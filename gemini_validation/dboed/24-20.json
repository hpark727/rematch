    "facts_of_the_case": "A group of United States citizens who were injured in terror attacks in Israel, along with the estates and survivors of U.S. citizens killed in such attacks, filed a lawsuit in 2004 against the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and the Palestinian Authority (PA). The PLO, founded in 1964, conducts Palestine\u2019s foreign affairs and serves as a Permanent Observer to the United Nations, while the PA was established under the 1993 Oslo Accords to serve as the interim governing body for parts of the Gaza Strip and West Bank. The plaintiffs sought damages under the Anti-Terrorism Act for the defendants\u2019 alleged involvement in these attacks. At trial, a jury found the defendants liable for six terror attacks and awarded $218.5 million in damages (automatically trebled to $655.5 million under the Anti-Terrorism Act), but the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit vacated this judgment in 2016, finding that U.S. courts lacked personal jurisdiction over the PLO and PA.\n\nIn 2019, Congress enacted the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act. This law deemed the PLO and PA to have consented to personal jurisdiction in U.S. courts if they engaged in certain conduct after the law\u2019s enactment: either making payments to families of deceased terrorists or designees of imprisoned terrorists who harmed U.S. nationals, or conducting various activities within the United States (with some exceptions for UN-related activities). After the district court found that the defendants had made qualifying payments following the Act\u2019s enactment, the Second Circuit ultimately concluded that this consent provision violated the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.",

Since this is a new case (Docket 24-20), the key document that initiated the Supreme Court's involvement is the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari. This document will lay out the petitioners' arguments for why the Second Circuit's decision was wrong and why the Supreme Court should hear the case. It will provide the questions presented, the legal precedents at play, and the core of the constitutional argument.\n\nTherefore, my first action will be to search for the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to understand the petitioners' legal position.

This moves the agent from a state of total ignorance to having a specific, high-value plan to acquire foundational knowledge about the petitioners' arguments (\u03b8). The EIG comes from formulating a highly efficient plan to reduce task uncertainty.\n\nDesign EIG (0.3): The action articulates a fundamental and generalizable strategy for SCOTUS case prediction: 'start by analyzing the Petition for Certiorari to understand the core legal arguments.' For an agent with no prior design beliefs (D), internalizing this effective heuristic is a valuable piece of meta-learning.\n\nJoint EIG (0.7): The action provides moderate value by setting a clear and effective course for the subsequent information-gathering actions, both for understanding this specific case and for learning how to approach future cases.",

The beliefs are internally consistent and logically aligned (e.g., acknowledging lack of knowledge and need for information gathering), so coherence is relatively high (0.7). Information density is low (0.2) because the beliefs are sparse and mostly placeholders for future learning rather than detailed knowledge.

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA \nby enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay the designee of any terrorist convicted \nof or killed while committing a terror attack against \nan American national, and the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the conviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); or  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct[] any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the 2020 trigger dates. But in the decisions be-\nlow, the Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. \nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Con-\ngress from specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides \nthe defendant with \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d in return, and \nthat the PLO and PA had not received any such reciprocal \nbargain.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ..................................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ........................................................................... 2 \nConstitutional And Statutory Provisions Involved .......... 2 \nStatement .............................................................................. 3 \nA.

This Court\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092331 et \nseq. (ATA), provides a private right of action for U.S. na-\ntionals and their families harmed by international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). For 25 years, the ATA worked as \nintended, enabling victims to hold terrorists and their \nsponsors accountable in civil actions in U.S. courts. But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \n\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA \nby enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay the designee of any terrorist convicted \nof or killed while committing a terror attack against \nan American national, and the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the conviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); or  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct[] any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the 2020 trigger dates. But in the decisions be-\nlow, the Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. \nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Con-\ngress from specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides \nthe defendant with \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d in return, and \nthat the PLO and PA had not received any such reciprocal \nbargain.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ..................................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ........................................................................... 2 \nConstitutional And Statutory Provisions Involved .......... 2 \nStatement .............................................................................. 3 \nA.

This Court\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092331 et \nseq. (ATA), provides a private right of action for U.S. na-\ntionals and their families harmed by international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). For 25 years, the ATA worked as \nintended, enabling victims to hold terrorists and their \nsponsors accountable in civil actions in U.S. courts. But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \nAmericans, and incentivizing the PLO and PA to end their \nofficial program of financially rewarding terrorism. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless facially invalidated \nthe PSJVTA, based on several errors.  \nFirst, the court began by asserting the \u201cdue process \nanalysis in the personal jurisdiction context is basically \nthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quotation marks omitted). That is \nincorrect. The Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cacting as an in-\nstrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to \ndivest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, \n294 (1980) (emphasis added). The Fifth Amendment, by \ncontrast, is not and never has been an instrument of in-\nternational federalism\u2014for there is no such thing. \nSecond, the court of appeals invented a novel test for \njudging consent-to-jurisdiction statutes, requiring such \nstatutes to be based on \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d between the \nforum\u2019s sovereign and the defendant. Pet.\u2009App.\u200924a. Yet \nthis Court recently upheld a state consent-to-jurisdiction \nlaw in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. \n122 (2023), without suggesting that due process requires \nany reciprocal bargain. Instead, the Court emphasized \nthat \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional conse-\nquences to what some might dismiss as mere formalities,\u201d \nand it rejected the defendant\u2019s request to look behind \nthose formalities to determine whether it had \u201creally sub-\nmitted\u201d to jurisdiction. Id. at 144-145 (plurality opinion). \nThird, the court of appeals misapplied its own test by \nholding that that the PLO and PA received no meaningful \n\u201cbenefit\u201d from engaging in conduct while present in the \nUnited States because their conduct was unlawful. As \nJudge Menashi explained in dissenting from denial of  \nrehearing, that conclusion was \u201cperverse\u201d: A visitor who  \nunlawfully \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from the United States \nshould not be rewarded by heightened due process  \nprotection that is unavailable to law-abiding guests. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a-232a. \nIn enacting the PSJVTA, Congress gave the PLO and \nthe PA a choice: Either refrain from paying terrorists for \nmurdering and maiming Americans, and cease all but a \nhandful of U.S. activities, or else submit to the jurisdiction \nof U.S. courts in ATA actions. They may not have relished \nthat choice, but they made it freely and with full \nknowledge of the consequences. Striking down the statute \nwill significantly curtail the political branches\u2019 ability to \ncombat terrorism and will restrict the power of Congress \n\n6 \n \nin other contexts\u2014a step that would be a sharp departure \nfrom this Court\u2019s traditional deference to the decisions of \nthe political branches in matters of jurisdiction over for-\neign governments, foreign affairs, and national security. \nA. Legal Background \n1. The Anti-Terrorism Act provides a private right of \naction to U.S. nationals and their families to recover for \ndeath and injuries sustained by reason of acts of interna-\ntional terrorism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired \nby a civil suit brought against the PLO for the 1985 mur-\nder of Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American \ncruise-ship passenger who was shot in the face and \nthrown into the open sea by PLO hijackers. \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family was able to hold the PLO ac-\ncountable for the murder only because federal admiralty \njurisdiction happened to be available. H.R. Rep. No. 102-\n1040, at 5 (1992). In advancing the ATA, the Senate Judi-\nciary Committee explained that it would \u201copen[] the \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-342, at 45 (1992). \nPresident Bush signed the law to \u201censure that \u2026 a remedy \nwill be available for Americans injured abroad by sense-\nless acts of terrorism.\u201d Statement by President George \nBush Upon Signing S. 1569, 28 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nThe ATA provides for nationwide service of process \nand exclusive federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u20092334(a), \n2338. The Attorney General may intervene in such ac-\ntions, id. \u00a7\u20092336(c), and may obtain a civil forfeiture of \n\u201c[a]ll assets, foreign or domestic, of any individual, entity, \nor organization engaged in planning or perpetrating any \nFederal crime of terrorism against the United States, \n\n7 \n \ncitizens or residents of the United States, or their prop-\nerty,\u201d id. \u00a7\u2009981(a)(1)(G)(i) (cleaned up). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in civil ATA \ncases based on the organizations\u2019 systematic and continu-\nous presence in the United States. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009193a\u2009n.10 \n(collecting cases). In 2016, however, the court of appeals \nin this case held that U.S. courts could no longer do so be-\ncause this Court had \u201cnarrowed the test for general juris-\ndiction\u201d in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014). \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009140-141a. It also held that specific jurisdiction \nover the PLO and PA was absent because the \u201cconduct \nthat could have subjected them to liability under the \nATA\u201d occurred \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Id. at 166a. \n2. Congress responded to that decision by enacting \nthe Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nwhich invoked another traditional basis for the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction: consent. Under the ATCA, any de-\nfendant \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension\u201d of 22 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202\u2014which forbids the PLO and its affiliates \nfrom maintaining an office or spending money in the \nUnited States\u2014\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction\u201d in civil ATA cases if the defendant \nmaintains \u201cany office \u2026 within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States\u201d after January 31, 2019, \u201cregardless of the \ndate of the occurrence of the act of international terror-\nism.\u201d Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7\u20094, 132 Stat. 3184, codified as \namended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). The House Judiciary \nCommittee explained: \u201cIt is eminently reasonable to con-\ndition\u201d the PLO and PA\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in the \nUnited States on [their] consent to jurisdiction \u2026, as Con-\ngress has repeatedly tied their continued receipt of these \nprivileges to their adherence to their commitment to re-\nnounce terrorism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018). \nThe court of appeals in this case then held that the \nATCA\u2019s factual predicates had not been met. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009\n\n8 \n \n10a-11a. In response, Congress again amended the ATA \nby enacting the PSJVTA. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. \nIX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 308, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e). \nThe PSJVTA has two operative prongs: \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(A) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 120 days after the \nlaw\u2019s enactment, the defendant makes any payment \nto a designee of an individual imprisoned for, or \nkilled while, committing a terror attack that killed \nor injured a national of the United States, if the pay-\nment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d such death or impris-\nonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d prong. \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(B) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 15 days after en-\nactment, the defendant \u201cconducts any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization or the Pales-\ntinian Authority.\u201d Subparagraph (1)(B) is subject to \nsix exceptions, including maintaining an office or \nconducting an activity \u201cexclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Na-\ntions.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(A), (B). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cU.S.-activities\u201d prong. \nB. Factual and Procedural Background \n1. These cases arose out of a series of terror attacks \nin Israel that killed and injured dozens of U.S. nationals. \nAlan Bauer and his seven-year-old son were walking down \na crowded street when a suicide bomber directed by a \nlieutenant in the PA intelligence service blew himself up, \nsending shrapnel through the boy\u2019s brain. The damage \nwas permanent. A bomb tore through Scott Goldberg\u2019s \n\n9 \n \nbody on a city bus while he was on his way to work; he left \na widow and seven children. The suicide bomber was a PA \npolice officer\u2014recruited and directed by a team of other \nPA officers. The PA gave him a hero\u2019s funeral. Four plain-\ntiffs were killed by a massive bomb detonated in a univer-\nsity cafeteria at lunchtime. Their parents learned about \nthe attack while at home in the United States\u2014some by \nrecognizing the bodies or personal effects of their children \non the television news. See Sokolow\u2009C.A.\u2009App.\u20094072-4076, \n4084-4086, 4948-4994, 5288, 5543-5574, 6450, 6454, 6487-\n6489, 6697, 6700, 6852, 7014-7015. \nA terrorist stabbed Ari Fuld, an American citizen and \nfather of four, just hours after Mahmoud Abbas, the \nChairman of the PLO and President of the PA, falsely \nclaimed that the Israeli Government was planning to es-\ntablish Jewish prayer zones inside the al-Aqsa Mosque, \none of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. J.A.\u2009420. \n2. The plaintiff families sued under the ATA in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nIn Sokolow, after a seven-week trial with testimony \nfrom 50 witnesses, the jury found that the PLO and PA, \nacting through their employees, perpetrated the six at-\ntacks at issue and that the PLO and PA knowingly pro-\nvided material support to organizations designated by the \nState Department as foreign terrorist organizations. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009141a. The jury awarded plaintiffs $218.5 million \nin damages, which was automatically trebled under the \nATA to $655.5 million. Ibid. \nOn appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the judgment \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. Ibid. The court rejected \nplaintiffs\u2019 argument that governmental entities like the \nPLO and PA were not \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process \nClause, holding that the PLO and PA enjoy due process \nrights precisely because \u201cneither the PLO nor the PA is \nrecognized by the United States as a sovereign state.\u201d Id. \nat 153a. It also held that the test for personal jurisdiction \n\n10 \n \nis \u201cthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Id. at 156a. Applying Fourteenth Amendment \nstandards, the court of appeals held that U.S. courts could \nnot exercise general jurisdiction because the PLO and PA \nwere \u201cat home\u201d in \u201cPalestine,\u201d id. at 160a, and could not \nexercise specific jurisdiction because the conduct giving \nrise to liability \u201coccurred entirely outside the territorial \njurisdiction of the United States,\u201d id. at 167a. This Court \ndenied review. 138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018). \nBipartisan sponsors introduced the ATCA in Con-\ngress a few weeks later. 164 Cong. Rec. S2926 (May 24, \n2018). They explained that \u201crecent Federal court deci-\nsions\u201d had \u201cseverely undermined the ability of American \nvictims to bring terrorists to justice.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. \nS5103-01 (July 19, 2018) (Sen. Grassley); see 164 Cong. \nRec. H6617-18 (July 23, 2018) (Rep. Nadler). The House \nJudiciary Committee explained that the bill\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d \nwas \u201cto better ensure that victims of international terror-\nism can obtain justice in United States courts.\u201d H.R. Rep. \nNo. 115-858, at 2 (2018). President Trump signed the bill \ninto law. Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7\u20094, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs then moved to recall the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s mandate in light of the ATCA. The court de-\nnied the motion, finding that the ATCA\u2019s factual predi-\ncates had not been satisfied. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009133a. The Sokolow \nplaintiffs again sought this Court\u2019s review. While their pe-\ntition was pending, Congress enacted the PSJVTA. This \nCourt granted the petition, vacated the judgment below, \nand remanded in light of the new statute. 140 S. Ct. 2714 \n(2020). The Second Circuit in turn remanded to the dis-\ntrict court. \n3. On remand in Sokolow, and on a Rule 12(b)(2) mo-\ntion in Fuld, the PLO and PA challenged the PSJVTA on \nthe ground that it facially violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause. The United States intervened in \nboth cases. \n\n11 \n \na. In Sokolow, the district court determined that the \nPLO and PA engaged in conduct meeting the pay-for-slay \nprong, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A), finding that they \u201cmade \npayments after April 18, 2020 to the families of individuals \nkilled while committing acts of terrorism, that the pay-\nments were made because the individuals engaged in ter-\nrorism, and that the terrorism harmed U.S. nationals.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200985a. Ample evidence supported the findings: \nConsistent with their long history of supporting and glo-\nrifying terrorism, the PLO and PA have an official policy \nof rewarding terrorists (or their next of kin) for attacking \nJews. J.A.\u2009156-157. These payments \u201care not social wel-\nfare or charity to the needy.\u201d Ibid. They are provided to \n\u201crich and poor alike,\u201d without regard to financial condi-\ntion. Ibid. They are unavailable to those who commit \u201cor-\ndinary\u201d crimes. Id. at 159. The PLO and PA made pay-\nments for at least 175 Palestinian individuals killed while \nor imprisoned for committing terror attacks that killed or \ninjured Americans. J.A.\u200969-135; Sokolow D. Ct. Doc. 1015-\n1. The payees included perpetrators of the attacks at issue \nin Sokolow. See Sokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc. 1015, at 11. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs asked the district court to \nmake factual findings that the PLO and PA engaged in \nconduct meeting the U.S.-activities prong, by engaging in \n\u201cactivit[ies] while physically present in the United States\u201d \nthat did not fall within any statutory exemption, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B)(iii). Plaintiffs offered evidence that, after \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s trigger date, PLO and PA officials dissem-\ninated public-relations material in the United States urg-\ning supporters to lobby the U.S. Government and public \nin support of their political agenda; gave speeches at U.S. \nuniversities and local venues; and authorized PA-depu-\ntized notaries in the United States to certify documents \nfor use in territories administered by the PA. See J.A.\u2009\n149-152, 275, 282-285, 616-913. The district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \n\n12 \n \nin these types of activities,\u201d but declined to determine \nwhether they fell within any statutory exemption. Pet.\u2009\nApp.\u200973a-75a. \nThe Fuld district court assumed without deciding \nthat both prongs had been satisfied. Id. at 101a-102a & \nn.3. \nb. Both district courts held the law facially unconsti-\ntutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. Id. at 74a-77a, 87a-92a, 108a-125a. In their \nview, this Court\u2019s decision in Daimler had rendered \u201cob-\nsolete\u201d consent-to-jurisdiction cases decided under pre-\nInternational Shoe precedents. Id. at 76a, 112a n.6. \n4. The Second Circuit heard the cases in tandem and \naffirmed. Id. at 1a-70a. \na. Like the district courts, the court of appeals ac-\ncepted that the PLO and PA had engaged in consent-man-\nifesting conduct by paying terrorists who had murdered \nAmericans, and it assumed that they had conducted non-\nexempt activities within the United States. Id. at 38a, 68a \nn.7. The Second Circuit also did not dispute that the \nPSJVTA meets \u201cminimum due process requirements,\u201d by \nproviding fair warning to the defendants and by reasona-\nbly advancing legitimate governmental interests. Id. at \n29a-30a. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless held the PSJVTA \nunconstitutional on its face. In the court\u2019s view, under the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to jurisdiction must be based on a \u201creciprocal bar-\ngain\u201d with the government or else must derive from \u201cliti-\ngation-related conduct.\u201d Id. at 24a-26a. The court also \nheld that the PLO and PA\u2019s permission to be present in \nthe United States and to engage in activities here does not \ncount as a constitutionally cognizable \u201cbenefit\u201d because \ntheir consent-manifesting conduct was \u201cprohibited\u201d by \nlaw. Id. at 28a. \n\n13 \n \nb. Plaintiffs and the United States sought rehearing \nen banc. The Second Circuit denied the petitions. Id. at \n208a. Judge Menashi dissented, joined in full or part by \nChief Judge Livingston and Judges Sullivan and Park. Id. \nat\u2009229a-267a. In Judge Menashi\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he panel\u2019s de-\ncision lacks a basis in the Constitution and cannot be rec-\nonciled with Supreme Court precedent on personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d Id. at 230a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The PSJVTA satisfies Fifth Amendment stand-\nards. \nA. As the Fifth Amendment was understood when \nratified, the guarantee of \u201cdue process of law\u201d did not pro-\nhibit the adjudication of conduct arising outside U.S. ter-\nritory. Cases arising outside the United States were com-\nmon in the Revolutionary Era, and Article III was framed \nby lawyers and judges who had been deeply involved in \nmany such cases. The Constitution expressly permits the \nadjudication of extraterritorial cases, and the Framers \nexplained that congruence between the reach of the legis-\nlative and judicial powers was intentional. The First Con-\ngress authorized extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Judi-\nciary Act of 1789 and the Crimes Act of 1790. \nWhen the Due Process Clause was ratified, no one un-\nderstood it to disturb prior practice. Although scholars \nhave adopted different views about its original meaning, \nno evidence suggests that anyone in 1791 thought the \nClause would limit adjudication of extraterritorial con-\nduct.  \nB.  The PSJVTA also satisfies Fifth Amendment due \nprocess standards under this Court\u2019s precedents. In the \nyears following ratification, the Court repeatedly con-\nfirmed that the judicial power of the United States ex-\ntends to cases involving conduct occurring outside the Na-\ntion\u2019s borders. Jurisdictional limits did exist, but they \n\n14 \n \nwere supplied by the law of nations, which Congress could \noverride by a clear command. \nOver time, this Court came to impose territorial limits \non the States under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. But even as it did so, the Court con-\ntinued to approve adjudication of federal cases arising ex-\ntraterritorially. Because the PSJVTA reflects express \ncongressional authorization to adjudicate disputes under \nU.S. law based on extraterritorial conduct, and because it \nis not arbitrary or fundamentally unfair, it does not run \nafoul of this Court\u2019s precedents applying the Fifth \nAmendment. \nC.  The Second Circuit held that personal jurisdiction \nin civil cases under the Fifth Amendment is governed by \nrules developed under the Fourteenth Amendment. But \nthose rules serve interstate federalism, preventing a \nState from infringing other States\u2019 sovereignty by adjudi-\ncating disputes with little connection to the forum. Such \nconcerns do not apply to the Federal Government. \nThe Second Circuit also erred by imposing a stricter \nstandard for civil cases than for criminal ones. Federal \ncases\u2014whether civil or criminal\u2014should be governed by \na single Fifth Amendment standard. It makes no sense to \nallow federal courts to impose criminal penalties (impris-\nonment or death) but not civil penalties (money damages) \nfor the same extraterritorial conduct. \nII.  Even if Fourteenth Amendment standards ap-\nplied, the PSJVTA would satisfy them. \nA.  In Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023), this Court upheld Pennsylvania\u2019s con-\nsent-to-jurisdiction statute against a Fourteenth Amend-\nment challenge. The Second Circuit attempted to distin-\nguish Mallory on the theory that the defendant there re-\nceived a \u201creciprocal bargain\u201d from Pennsylvania, but the \ndecision did not rest on that ground. Rather, the Court \n\n15 \n \nexplained that accepting an in-state benefit with jurisdic-\ntional strings attached was merely one means of construc-\ntively consenting to personal jurisdiction; another is by \nengaging in conduct specified by law as constituting sub-\nmission to jurisdiction, as happened here. This case fol-\nlows a fortiori from Mallory, because the Federal Gov-\nernment has a vital interest in the adjudication of anti-ter-\nrorism cases involving American victims. In contrast, as \nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court observed, the statute in \nMallory advanced no legitimate state interest. \nB.  The PLO and PA\u2019s consent was knowing and vol-\nuntary, because they had fair warning of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction, which they engaged in \nvolitionally. The PSJVTA also meets the traditional due \nprocess standard of reasonableness within the context of \nour federal system. \nC.  Even if the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d \ntest were valid, it would be satisfied here. The PLO and \nPA have received a \u201cbenefit\u201d from the United States by \nexercising \u201cthe privilege of residing and conducting busi-\nness in the United States\u2014not to mention furthering \ntheir political goals at the expense of American lives.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a (Menashi, J., dissenting). Their U.S. activ-\nities include notarizing documents for official use in their \nhome territories, posting on U.S.-based social media plat-\nforms to raise public awareness and bring attention to \ntheir cause, and meeting with local groups to encourage \nthem to lobby Congress to support that cause. \nThe Second Circuit denied the relevance of those U.S. \nactivities on the ground that they were all unlawful. That \nassertion is legally incorrect: The PLO and PA are not le-\ngally barred from conducting any activities in the United \nStates. The court\u2019s reasoning is also illogical: Someone \nwho conducts illegal activities in the forum obviously ex-\ntracts a benefit from the forum. A contrary rule would \n\n16 \n \nperversely give law-breakers due process protections un-\navailable to law-abiding persons. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE PSJVTA SATISFIES FIFTH AMENDMENT STANDARDS \nAt the Founding, the federal Judiciary\u2019s power to ad-\njudicate disputes was understood to be coextensive with \nCongress\u2019s power to legislate\u2014which included matters \narising abroad. Indeed, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause was not seen as a constraint on congressional \npower over personal jurisdiction at all: \u201cIf Congress \nwanted to exercise exorbitant [personal] jurisdiction \u2026 a \nfederal court \u2018would certainly be bound to follow it, and \nproceed upon the law.\u2019\u201d Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited \nJurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, \n1706 (2020) (quoting Picquet, 19 F. Cas. at 615) (Sachs). \nThe decision below, by subjecting Congress to the \nsame jurisdictional limitations that apply to the States, \nimproperly \u201ctakes the Fourteenth Amendment as given, \nand remakes the Fifth Amendment in its image.\u201d Id. at \n1705. Such \u201creverse incorporation\u201d of Fourteenth Amend-\nment standards into the Fifth Amendment is contrary to \nthis Court\u2019s precedents. Although the Court has long re-\nstricted the States\u2019 jurisdiction over disputes arising out-\nside their boundaries, it has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial cases to go forward in the federal courts, ex-\nplaining that such cases lie within Congress\u2019s power to au-\nthorize. Accepting the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning would \nresult in an upside-down regime in which unrecognized \nforeign governments enjoy due process protection una-\nvailable to States of the Union, and defendants in civil \ncases enjoy greater due process protections than defend-\nants in criminal cases arising out of the exact same con-\nduct. \n\n17 \n \nA. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Original Public Meaning \nImposed No Limit On Personal Jurisdiction \nThe Constitution expressly authorizes adjudication of \ncases arising from extraterritorial conduct. This power \nwas an intentional feature of the constitutional plan, re-\nflecting common practice during the Revolutionary Era, \nincluding in cases tried and adjudicated by the Framers \nthemselves. Ratification of the Due Process Clause did \nnot alter that feature. To the contrary, the most authori-\ntative interpreters of the Bill of Rights\u2014the First Con-\ngress and this Court\u2014continued the pre-constitutional \npractice of permitting adjudication of claims against for-\neign defendants arising from conduct abroad. \n1. Before The Fifth Amendment, Extraterritorial \nCases Were Permitted \nThe Constitution\u2019s text expressly vests Congress and \nthe Judiciary with extraterritorial powers. Most obvi-\nously, Congress may \u201cdefine and punish Piracies and Fel-\nonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against \nthe Law of Nations\u201d and \u201cmake Rules concerning Cap-\ntures on Land and Water.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u20098, Cls. 10, \n11. And what Congress can legislate, the Judiciary can ad-\njudicate: \u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in \nLaw and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the \nLaws of the United States, and Treaties made \u2026 under \ntheir Authority.\u201d Id. Art. III, \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 1 (emphasis added). \nThe Constitution empowers the Judiciary to adjudicate \ncases arising extraterritorially in other respects, too, in-\ncluding \u201call Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,\u201d \nibid., and \u201call Crimes \u2026 not committed within any State,\u201d \nid. \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 3. \nJudicial power commensurate with extraterritorial \nlegislative power was a deliberate feature of the constitu-\ntional plan. At the Philadelphia Convention, leading dele-\ngates explained that judicial power should be coextensive \n\n18 \n \nwith legislative power. For example, James Madison ex-\nplained that \u201c[a]n effective Judiciary establishment com-\nmensurate to the legislative authority, was essential.\u201d 1 \nRecords of the Federal Convention 124 (Max Farrand ed., \n1911) (Farrand). James Wilson agreed: \u201cthe Judicial \nshould be commensurate to the legislative and Executive \nAuthority.\u201d Id. at 237 n.18. In The Federalist, Hamilton \nobserved that \u201c[i]f there are such things as political axi-\noms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government \nbeing co-extensive with its legislative, may be ranked \namong the number.\u201d The Federalist No. 80, at 588 (Ham-\nilton ed. 1864). Madison, Wilson, and other Founders also \nexpressed this view at the ratifying conventions. In Penn-\nsylvania, for instance, Wilson explained that without such \nparity, the Federal Government would be \u201cgive[n] power \nto make laws, and no power to carry them into effect.\u201d 2 \nDebates on the Federal Constitution 469 (Jonathan Elliot, \n2d ed. 1836) (Elliott); see 3 Elliot at 532 (Madison); id. at \n517 (Pendelton in Virginia); 4 Elliot at 156-158 (Davie in \nNorth Carolina). \nPermitting adjudication of cases arising from extra-\nterritorial conduct had a strong antecedent in practice. \nCourts in the newly independent United States adjudi-\ncated thousands of \u201cprize\u201d and \u201ccapture\u201d cases. See \nHenry J. Bourguignon, The First Federal Court: The \nFederal Appellate Prize Court of the American Revolu-\ntion 1775-1787, at 75-77 (1977) (Bourguignon). Such cases \ngenerally arose from extraterritorial events. E.g., \nDarby v. Brig Erstern, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 34, 35 (Fed. Ct. \nApp. 1782); Miller v. The Resolution, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 19, \n20-21 (Fed. Ct. App. 1781). Leading delegates arrived at \nthe Philadelphia Convention with extensive experience as \nlawyers and judges in those very cases. See Deirdre Mask \n& Paul MacMahon, The Revolutionary War Prize Cases \nand the Origins of Diversity Jurisdiction, 63 Buff. L. \nRev. 477 (2015); Bourguignon at 328-329; see also Letter \n\n19 \n \nfrom E. Randolph to J. Madison (Apr. 19, 1782), \nbit.ly/40i7aUC; Letter from J. Madison to E. Randolph \n(May 1, 1782), bit.ly/3DWIY2F. \nAfter ratification, the First Congress exercised its au-\nthority to prescribe extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Ju-\ndiciary Act of 1789 granted the federal courts jurisdiction \nover \u201ccivil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d \narising \u201cupon the high seas,\u201d and over crimes committed \n\u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 20, \u00a7\u20099, 1 Stat. 76-77. The Crimes \nAct of 1790 similarly authorized prosecution of crimes \ncommitted \u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 9, \u00a7\u00a7\u20098-13, 1 Stat. \n113-115. This Court has \u201coften looked to laws enacted by \n[the First] Congress as evidence of the original under-\nstanding of the meaning of [the Bill of Rights].\u201d Collins v. \nVirginia, 584 U.S. 586, 613 n.3 (2018) (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(collecting cases). \nLeading Framers confirmed that extraterritorial ju-\nrisdiction was intended. During deliberations on the Judi-\nciary Act, Madison\u2014who earlier that summer had drafted \nand introduced the Bill of Rights\u2014reiterated his view \nthat the judicial power \u201cought to be commensurate with \nthe other branches of the Government.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. \n843 (Aug. 29, 1789). And the following year, Edmund Ran-\ndolph prepared a report in which he concluded that the \nfederal courts had the exclusive power \u201cto decide all \ncauses arising wholly on the sea, and not within the pre-\ncincts of any county.\u201d Edmund Randolph, Report from the \nAttorney General on the Judiciary System of the United \nStates (Dec. 31, 1790), reprinted in 1 American State Pa-\npers, Miscellaneous 22 (1834).2 \n \n2 Before serving as the first Attorney General, Randolph was a \nmember of the Committee on Detail at the Philadelphia Convention, \nand the \u201cfirst draft\u201d of the Constitution is in his handwriting. See \nWilliam Ewald, The Committee of Detail, 28 Const. Commentary \n197, 220 (2012). \n\n20 \n \n2. The Fifth Amendment Did Not Change The \nJurisdictional Baseline \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s text and history provide no \nindication that it was understood to change the pre-ratifi-\ncation baseline. Indeed, scholarship confirms that no one \nin 1791 understood the Due Process Clause to restrict the \njudicial power of the United States at all, much less to \nlimit federal jurisdiction to the adjudication of cases aris-\ning within the Nation\u2019s borders. Rather, three principal \nschools of thought have emerged about the meaning of the \nwords \u201cdue process of law\u201d\u2014and none of them involves \npersonal jurisdiction. \nOne view of the phrase\u2019s original public meaning was \nthat a deprivation of rights had to be judicial, that is, \n\u201cpreceded by certain procedural protections characteris-\ntic of judicial process.\u201d Nathan S. Chapman & Michael W. \nMcConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 \nYale L.J. 1672, 1679 (2012) (Chapman & McConnell); see \nUnited States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U.S. 159, 168 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., concurring); United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1, 36 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). This view \ndraws support from early state practice, most promi-\nnently New York\u2019s 1787 statutory bill of rights and an oft-\ncited speech by Alexander Hamilton, both of which refer-\nence \u201cdue process of law.\u201d See Ryan C. Williams, The One \nand Only Substantive Due Process Clause, 120 Yale L.J. \n408, 441-443 (2010) (Williams); see also id. at 437-445; \nChapman & McConnell at 1703-1717. Consistent with this \nview, this Court in Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & \nImprovement Co., 59 U.S. (18. How.) 272 (1856), held that \nCongress may not deprive a person of property except un-\nder \u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding,\u201d which give \nthe defendant the benefit of a judge (\u201cjudex\u201d), as well as \n\u201cregular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial ac-\ncording to some settled course of judicial proceedings.\u201d \nId. at 277, 280. \n\n21 \n \nAn alternative originalist view emphasizes a nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess,\u201d as \u201cwrits or precepts \nduly issued (usually by a court) or arising by operation of \nlaw.\u201d Max Crema & Lawrence B. Solum, The Original \nMeaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amend-\nment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, 462 (2022). Proponents of this \nview note that, in Founding-era legal documents, the nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess\u201d was much more com-\nmonly used than the broader (though still procedural) \n\u201ccourse of proceedings\u201d sense, which was more often ex-\npressed as \u201cdue course of law.\u201d Id. at 488-508. They also \nsuggest that the records of the ratifying convention of \nNew York\u2014the only State to include the  phrase \u201cdue pro-\ncess\u201d in its proposed amendments\u2014show an evolution of \nthe proposal from \u201cLaw of the Land\u201d to \u201cDue Course of \nLaw\u201d and then to \u201cDue Process of Law.\u201d Id. at 508 & n.257 \n(citation omitted). \nThis Court\u2019s traditional view of the Due Process \nClause has been that it embodies a \u201csubstantive\u201d aspect \n\u201cintended to secure the individual from the arbitrary ex-\nercise of the powers of government.\u201d Albright v. Oliver, \n510 U.S. 266, 272 (1994) (plurality opinion) (quotation \nmarks omitted). This Court has scrutinized federal stat-\nutes under that standard to ensure that they are \u201csup-\nported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by ra-\ntional means.\u201d United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 30-\n31 (1994); see Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, \n465 (1991). Under this view, \u201c[t]he party asserting a Fifth \nAmendment due process violation must overcome a pre-\nsumption of constitutionality and establish that the legis-\nlature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\u201d Nat\u2019l \nR.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. \nCo., 470 U.S. 451, 472 (1985) (quotation marks omitted). \nScholars debate whether this view took root in American \nlaw before or after ratification of the Fifth Amendment. \nCompare Crema & Solum at 513-518; Williams at 428-454; \n\n22 \n \nChapman & McConnell at 1676 n.5; with Chapman & \nMcConnell at 1676-1677 n.6. \n3. The PSJVTA Does Not Deprive The PLO And \nPA Of Any Due Process Right Recognized At \nThe Founding \nMeasuring the PSJVTA\u2019s constitutionality against \nthe original public meaning of the Fifth Amendment, this \nis an easy case regardless of which view one accepts. \nNothing in the statute interferes with the PLO and PA\u2019s \nability to defend themselves before a court of law applying \n\u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding.\u201d Denezpi v. \nUnited States, 596 U.S. 591, 617 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., dis-\nsenting) (quoting Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. (18 How.) at \n277). The statute does not deprive them of the benefit of \nan independent judge, or of \u201cregular allegations, oppor-\ntunity to answer, and a trial according to some settled \ncourse of judicial proceedings.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. \n(18 How.) at 280. And in both Fuld and Sokolow, the PLO \nand PA were served with a writ (i.e., a summons) in the \nUnited States, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(a). See \nSokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20092; Fuld\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20098, 9. \nThis Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents re-\nquire no more. Nothing about the PSJVTA is \u201carbitrary \nand irrational.\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger, 470 U.S. at 472 \n(quotation marks omitted). It reasonably advances vital \ninterests of the United States. It disrupts and deters sup-\nport for terrorism, which is \u201can urgent objective of the \nhighest order.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian L. Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 28 (2010). It advances the protection of U.S. citi-\nzens abroad. See Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, \n687 (2019) (\u201cspecial protection [abroad] for U.S. nationals \nserves key national interests\u201d). It promotes the Federal \nGovernment\u2019s interest in ensuring \u201cfair compensation for \nAmerican victims of terrorism from those responsible for \ntheir losses.\u201d J.A.\u200968. And it furthers U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives, because the PLO and PA\u2019s pay-for-slay \n\n23 \n \npolicies \u201cthreaten prospects for peace, pushing the chance \nfor a Palestinian state further and further out of reach.\u201d \n163 Cong. Rec. H9650 (daily ed. Dec. 5, 2017) (Rep. En-\ngel). \nB. This Court Has Never Blocked Congress From \nAuthorizing Personal Jurisdiction Over Conduct \nArising Abroad \nIn the years immediately following ratification of the \nFifth Amendment, this Court confirmed that the judicial \npower of the United States extends to cases involving con-\nduct occurring outside the Nation\u2019s borders. Later, even \nas this Court imposed territorial limits on the States un-\nder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment, it repeatedly rejected the imposition of such limita-\ntions on the Federal Government. \n1. Before The Lochner Era, This Court Never \nStruck Down Any Jurisdictional Statute On \nDue Process Grounds \n\u201cFor the first 150 years of the Republic, today\u2019s con-\nventional view of personal jurisdiction wasn\u2019t so conven-\ntional\u2026. Jurisdictional limits have always been with us, \nbut Fifth Amendment limits are a recent innovation.\u201d \nSachs at 1706, 1708. \nOriginally, extraterritorial jurisdiction was governed \nby the law of nations, which included rules for determin-\ning the circumstances under which \u201cone state\u2019s judgments \n[should] be received or rejected in another\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. \nat 1718. In some cases, the law of nations permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction. In Penhallow v. Doane\u2019s Admin-\nistrators, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 54 (1795), this Court enforced \nresolutions adopted by the Continental Congress provid-\ning for trials and appeals in cases of the capture of enemy \nships on the high seas. Id. at 80-81 (opinion of Patterson, \nJ.). The power to provide for adjudication in such cases, \nthe Court explained, was an incident of the Nation\u2019s \n\n24 \n \ninherent \u201cexternal sovereignty.\u201d Id. at 91 (opinion of Ire-\ndell, J.). And in Talbot v. Janson, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 133 \n(1795), the Court unanimously affirmed the exercise of ju-\nrisdiction over a civil claim for damages arising out of an \nincident on the high seas. As Justice Iredell explained, \n\u201ctrespasses committed against the general law of nations, \nare enquirable, and may be proceeded against, in any na-\ntion where no special exemption can be maintained, either \nby the general law of nations, or by some treaty which for-\nbids or restrains it.\u201d Id. at 159-160.3 Thus, the availability \nof extraterritorial jurisdiction ordinarily followed back-\nground legal principles established under the law of na-\ntions. \nHowever, Congress could override the law of nations \nby a clear command. See Murray v. Schooner Charming \nBetsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804). Thus Justice \nWashington explained that federal courts had no \u201cgen-\neral\u201d authority \u201cto issue process into another district, ex-\ncept in cases where such authority has been specially be-\nstowed, by some law of the United States.\u201d Ex parte Gra-\nham, 10 F. Cas. at 912 (emphasis added). If it was \u201cthe will \nof congress to vest in the courts of the United States an \nextra-territorial jurisdiction in prize causes, over persons \nand things found in a district other than that from which \nthe process issued,\u201d then the courts would be bound to fol-\nlow Congress\u2019s instruction. Id. at 913; see ibid. (\u201cthe ex-\nercise of jurisdiction over persons not inhabitants of, or \nfound within the district where the suit is brought\u201d pre-\nsents \u201cdifficulties, which, in the opinion of the court, noth-\ning but an act of congress can remove\u201d). \n \n3 Of the seven members of the Court who participated in one or \nboth of these cases, four (Rutledge, Wilson, Blair, and Patterson) \nserved as delegates at the Philadelphia Convention. 1 Farrand 1-2. \nThe other three served in their respective States\u2019 ratifying conven-\ntions. 2 Elliott 178 (Cushing); id.at 206 (Jay); 4 Elliott 1 (Iredell). \n\n25 \n \nUnder federal legislation, exercising jurisdiction in \ncases arising outside of U.S. territory became established \npractice. \u201cThe prosecution and punishment of extraterri-\ntorial crimes, including crimes committed by aliens, was \none of the federal government\u2019s top priorities\u201d in the dec-\nades following ratification, and \u201cthe federal government \nprincipally used two enforcement mechanisms\u2014punish-\nment after criminal trial, and civil forfeiture after a con-\ndemnation by a federal court sitting in admiralty.\u201d Na-\nthan S. Chapman, Due Process Abroad, 112 Nw. U. L. \nRev. 377, 409 (2017) (Chapman). \u201cAmericans appeared to \nbelieve that both enforcement mechanisms were con-\nsistent with due process of law.\u201d Id. at 410. Treatises of \nthe era similarly confirm that the federal courts could \nproperly exercise jurisdiction over extraterritorial con-\nduct. See, e.g., 1 James Kent, Commentaries on Ameri-\ncan Law 186 (6th ed. 1826) (\u201cIt is of no importance, for the \npurpose of giving jurisdiction, on whom or where a pirat-\nical offence has been committed.\u201d). \nPerhaps the clearest articulation of Congress\u2019s power \nto create jurisdiction over foreign conduct\u2014even in the \nface of general principles of the law of nations to the con-\ntrary\u2014is Picquet v. Swan. There, Justice Story explained \nthat Congress could enact a law providing that \u201ca subject \nof England, or France, or Russia, having a controversy \nwith one of our own citizens, may be summoned from the \nother end of the globe to obey our process, and submit to \nthe judgment of our courts.\u201d 19 F.\u2009Cas. at 613. And though \nsuch a law might be \u201crepugnant to the general rights and \nsovereignty of other nations,\u201d yet \u201c[i]f congress had pre-\nscribed such a rule, the court would certainly be bound to \nfollow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at 613, 615.  \nThis Court endorsed Picquet\u2019s reasoning in Toland v. \nSprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300 (1838), explaining that \u201cpos-\nitive legislation\u201d would be necessary to authorize federal \ncourts to hear cases involving \u201cpersons in a foreign \n\n26 \n \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 330. And in The Marianna Flora, 24 \nU.S. (11 Wheat.) 1 (1826) (Story, J.), the Court held that \neven though, as a general matter, \u201cforeign ships are not \nto be governed by our municipal regulations,\u201d still Con-\ngress could direct that a ship captured on the high seas be \nbrought to the United States for adjudication \u201cin our \nCourts.\u201d Id. at 18. \u201c[W]hatever may be the responsibility \nincurred by the nation to foreign powers, in executing \nsuch laws,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthere can be no doubt \nthat Courts of justice are bound to obey and administer \nthem.\u201d Ibid.; see ibid. (\u201c[T]he act of Congress is decisive \non this subject.\u201d).4 \nCongress also had the power to override the law of \nnations with respect to a State\u2019s recognition of \u201cforeign\u201d \n(i.e., out-of-state) judgments. In D\u2019Arcy v. Ketchum, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) 165 (1851), this Court noted Congress\u2019s \nauthority to \u201calter[] the rule\u201d regarding when the judg-\nments of one State\u2019s courts must be recognized by those \nof another. Id. at 174-175. There, a 1790 law required the \nStates to afford \u201cfaith and credit\u201d to the judicial proceed-\nings of other States. Ibid.; see Act of May 26, 1790, ch. 11, \n1 Stat. 122, codified as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091738 (2012). \nThe question was whether that law required recognition \nof a judgment even \u201cwhen the defendant had not been \nserved with process or voluntarily made defence,\u201d despite \nthe fact that such a proceeding would violate \u201cthe interna-\ntional law as it existed among the States in 1790.\u201d D\u2019Arcy, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) at 176. The Court ultimately concluded \n \n4 See also United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610, 631 \n(1818) (\u201cThe constitution having conferred on congress the power of \ndefining and punishing piracy, there can be no doubt of the right of \nthe legislature to enact laws punishing pirates, although they may \nbe foreigners, and may have committed no particular offence \nagainst the United States.\u201d); United States v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 \nWheat.) 153, 158-160 (1820) (broadly construing the constitutional \ngrant to Congress). \n\n27 \n \nthat \u201cCongress did not intend to overthrow the old rule by \nthe enactment,\u201d but the Court did not question\u2014indeed, \nit presumed\u2014that Congress had authority \u201cto declare a \nnew rule.\u201d Ibid. \nIn sum, the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwas understood to be proper if it comported with the law \nof nations or if Congress so provided. No case went the \nother way: \u201c[N]ot until the Civil War did a single court, \nstate or federal, hold a personal-jurisdiction statute inva-\nlid on due process grounds.\u201d Sachs at 1712; accord Chap-\nman at 442. \n2. After This Court Began Restricting State Power \nUnder The Fourteenth Amendment, It Rejected \nAnalogous Restrictions Under The Fifth \nTerritorial restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction emerged during the Lochner era, when this \nCourt began invoking due process to restrict state author-\nity to adjudicate cases involving conduct occurring in \nother States. See, e.g., Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 \nU.S. 394, 403 (1917); Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills \nv. Menefee, 237 U.S. 189, 194-195 (1915); see generally \nStephen E. Sachs, Pennoyer Was Right, 95 Tex. L. Rev. \n1249, 1252 (2017); Patrick J. Borchers, The Death of the \nConstitutional Law of Personal Jurisdiction: From Pen-\nnoyer to Burnham and Back Again, 24 U.C. Davis L. Rev. \n19, 43-51 (1990). These decisions were grounded in con-\ncerns about the division of power among the States, and \nin particular the impermissibility of \u201cattempt[ing] to ex-\ntend the authority and control of a state beyond its own \nterritory.\u201d Baker, 242 U.S. at 403. \nDuring the same era, however, this Court repeatedly \nreaffirmed that the Fifth Amendment affords \u201cno ground \nfor constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurposes of shutting [the federal] government off from \n\n28 \n \nthe exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by \nvirtue of its sovereignty.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. 299, 306 (1914) (emphasis added); see Burnet v. \nBrooks, 288 U.S. 378, 403-405 (1933) (same); Cook v. Tait, \n265 U.S. 47, 55-56 (1924) (same). \u201c[T]he limitations of the \nConstitution are barriers bordering the states and pre-\nventing them from transcending the limits of their author-\nity, and thus destroying the rights of other states,\u201d the \nCourt explained, but such interstate-federalism concerns \nhave no application to the national sovereign. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. at 306.5 \nFollowing its pathmarking decision in International \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), this Court \nhas continued to restrict state-court personal jurisdiction \nas \u201ca consequence of territorial limitations on the power \nof the respective States.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. \n235, 251 (1958). Yet the Court has been careful to make \nclear it was not holding that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment im-\nposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction by a federal court.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017). Moreover, \nthe Court has consistently expressed an expansive view \nabout the territorial competence of the national govern-\nment: \u201cIf Congress has provided an unmistakable instruc-\ntion that the provision is extraterritorial, then claims al-\nleging exclusively foreign conduct may proceed,\u201d Abitron \nAustria GmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 \n \n5 In admiralty cases, which raise no interstate-federalism con-\ncerns, the Court continued to apply the longstanding rule that \u201cthe \nbare circumstance of where the cause of action arose [has not] been \ntreated as determinative of the power of the court to exercise dis-\ncretion whether to take jurisdiction.\u201d Canada Malting Co. v. Pat-\nterson S.S., 285 U.S. 413, 422 (1932); Charter Shipping Co. v. \nBowring, Jones & Tidy, 281 U.S. 515, 517 (1930); Panama R.R. Co. \nv. Napier Shipping Co., 166 U.S. 280, 285 (1897); The Belgenland, \n114 U.S. 355, 358-359 (1885). \n\n29 \n \n(2023), a principle that remains true \u201cregardless of \nwhether the particular statute regulates conduct, affords \nrelief, or merely confers jurisdiction,\u201d RJR Nabisco, Inc. \nv. Eur. Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 326 (2016). \nIn sum, this Court has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction where Congress so provides and \nhas consistently declined to extend Fourteenth Amend-\nment limits to the Federal Government. The PSJVTA fits \ncomfortably within its precedents. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Reasoning Was Unsound \nThe Second Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018due process analy-\nsis\u2019 in the personal jurisdiction context \u2018is basically the \nsame under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments,\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quoting Pet.\u2009App.\u2009156a), and that \n\u201cthe [Fifth Amendment] due process test for asserting ju-\nrisdiction over extraterritorial criminal conduct \u2026 differs \nfrom the test applicable in this civil case,\u201d id. at 175a (em-\nphasis added; citation omitted). The court accordingly re-\nfused to apply to the PSJVTA \u201cthe broader [i.e., less-re-\nstrictive] Fifth Amendment standard used for personal \njurisdiction in criminal cases.\u201d Id. at 49a. \nThat reasoning was doubly unsound. Federal cases \nare not governed by the Fourteenth Amendment stand-\nard, which protects interstate federalism. Instead, federal \ncases\u2014not only criminal cases but also civil cases\u2014are \ngoverned by a single Fifth Amendment standard. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Conflation Of Fifth And \nFourteenth Amendment Standards Disregards \nInterstate Federalism \nPrinciples of interstate federalism limit a State\u2019s as-\nsertion of personal jurisdiction \u201cto ensure that States with \n\u2018little legitimate interest\u2019 in a suit do not encroach on \nStates more affected by the controversy.\u201d Ford Motor Co. \nv. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 360 (2021) \n(quoting Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263). Thus, in \n\n30 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, the Court explained that such \nrestrictions \u201censure that the States, through their courts, \ndo not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by \ntheir status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system\u201d and \nheld that \u201cthe Due Process Clause, acting as an instru-\nment of interstate federalism, may \u2026 divest the State of \nits power to render a valid judgment.\u201d 444 U.S. at 292, 294. \nThe Court has emphasized that allowing a State to assert \njurisdiction \u201cin an inappropriate case \u2026 would upset the \nfederal balance, which posits that each State has a sover-\neignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other \nStates.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. \n873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion). And the Court has re-\niterated that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of each State implies a \nlimitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States,\u201d and \ninsofar as personal jurisdiction is concerned, \u201cthis feder-\nalism interest may be decisive.\u201d Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. \nat 263 (cleaned up). \nThis case is different. It concerns federal claims re-\ngarding attacks on American nationals that must be adju-\ndicated in federal court under federal law. Congress cre-\nated these claims to further federal interests in national \nsecurity and foreign affairs. The Constitution allocates \npower over such matters exclusively to the national gov-\nernment. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 395 \n(2012). \u201cPower over external affairs is not shared by the \nStates,\u201d but instead \u201cis vested in the national government \nexclusively.\u201d United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 233 \n(1942); see Wendy Perdue, Aliens, the Internet, and \n\u201cPurposeful Availment,\u201d: A Reassessment of Fifth \nAmendment Limits On Personal Jurisdiction, 98 Nw. U. \nL. Rev. 455, 461 (2004) (\u201cStates are situated within the \nUnited States quite differently than is the United States \nwithin the international community.\u201d). \nWhereas federalism limitations on the individual \nStates inhere in the \u201cconstitutional plan,\u201d a \u201cforeign State \n\n31 \n \nlies outside the structure of the Union.\u201d Principality of \nMonaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 (1934). The Con-\nstitution limits each State\u2019s extraterritorial regulatory \npowers because they necessarily conflict with the regula-\ntory interests of other States. See Healy v. Beer Inst., \nInc., 491 U.S. 324, 336 (1989). In contrast, \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian Am. \nOil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991); see Gamble, 587 U.S. at \n687 (\u201c[M]urder of a U.S. national is an offense to the \nUnited States as much as it is to the country where the \nmurder occurred.\u201d). \nThe foreign-relations context here highlights the im-\nprudence of imposing interstate-federalism limitations on \nCongress. Congress\u2019s judgments in the foreign-relations \ncontext merit \u201cspecial respect\u201d because they involve \u201ca \nbalance that it is the prerogative of the political branches \nto make.\u201d Jesner v. Arab Bank PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 273 \n(2018). \u201cCongress has the undisputed power to decide, as \na matter of federal law, whether and under what circum-\nstances foreign nations should be amenable to suit in the \nUnited States,\u201d Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nige-\nria, 461 U.S. 480, 493 (1983), and the Court should be re-\nluctant to strip Congress of that power when it comes to \nnon-sovereign governments. The PLO and PA are foreign \npolitical entities that aspire to international statehood; as \nsuch, their amenability to suit in federal court should lie \nsolely in the hands of the political branches, not the Judi-\nciary. As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, \u201c[b]ecause the \nPLO purports to be an independent sovereign entity, we \nhave little difficulty concluding that it falls into [the] cate-\ngory\u201d of entities that \u201cexist outside the constitutional \ncompact and have no rights or responsibilities under it.\u201d \nConstitutionality of Closing the Palestine Information \nOffice, an Affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organiza-\ntion, 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 105 (1987). \n\n32 \n \nThe Second Circuit got this backwards, holding that \nthe PLO and PA have due process rights because they are \nnot \u201crecognized by the United States as a sovereign \nstate.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200994a, 153a. According to the court, allow-\ning the political branches to subject the PLO and PA to \nsuit would infringe their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d Id. at 30a \nn.11. Judge Menashi explained why this was wrong: \n[F]oreign states are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to rights \nunder the Due Process Clause. So if tomorrow the \nDepartment of State recognized the PA as the sover-\neign government of \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2014as the defendants \nbelieve it is\u2014then there would be no question at all \nthat the PSJVTA is constitutional and that the Due \nProcess Clause is not implicated. Fundamental con-\nstitutional rights are not typically so contingent. \nId. at 238a (citation omitted). \n2. The Second Circuit Incorrectly Applied A \nStricter Standard To Civil Cases Than To \nCriminal Cases \nThe Second Circuit acknowledged that the PSJVTA \nsatisfies \u201cbasic principles of due process.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200930a. \nIt also acknowledged that, in the context of criminal pros-\necutions against foreign defendants, the Fifth Amend-\nment permits the exercise of jurisdiction over a defendant \nwho harms American nationals or interests abroad. See \nUnited States v. Epskamp, 832 F.3d 154, 168 (2d Cir. \n2016).6 The court nevertheless held that, in the context of \na civil dispute, Congress must do more than merely sat-\nisfy these \u201cminimum due process requirements.\u201d \n \n6 Every Circuit to have considered the issue agrees. See United \nStates v. Murillo, 826 F.3d 152, 156-157 (4th Cir. 2016); United \nStates v. Rafoi, 60 F.4th 982, 995 (5th Cir. 2023); United States v. \nIossifov, 45 F.4th 899, 914 (6th Cir. 2022); United States v. Perlaza, \n439 F.3d 1149, 1162 (9th Cir. 2006). \n\n33 \n \nPet.\u2009App.\u200930a. The Second Circuit\u2019s position is thus that \nthe United States may imprison or impose the death pen-\nalty on a foreign person for extraterritorial conduct, but it \ncrosses a red line for the United States to allow a civil \nclaim for money damages against the same person for the \nsame conduct. \nThat makes no sense. As Judge Elrod put it in a case \nconcerning the same issue: \u201cIt is nonsense on stilts to hold \nthat allowing a civil lawsuit against a foreign defendant \nfor foreign conduct violates due process but that a crimi-\nnal prosecution against the same defendant for the same \nforeign conduct does not.\u201d Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Ka-\nbushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 270 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(dissenting). \nOutside the context of personal jurisdiction, this \nCourt has sometimes required a stricter due process \nstandard in criminal cases than in civil cases. See, e.g., \nTurner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 442 (2011); Addington v. \nTexas, 441 U.S. 418, 429-432 (1979). But it has never sug-\ngested that the inverse should be true: that a stricter \nstandard applies in civil cases than in criminal cases. It \nwould be incongruous to make it harder to deprive a de-\nfendant of property in a civil case than to deprive a de-\nfendant of liberty (or even life) in a criminal case arising \nout of the same facts. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment\u2014\nwhich contains only a single Due Process Clause, applica-\nble to civil and criminal cases alike\u2014supports such a rule. \nII. THE \nPSJVTA \nWOULD \nSATISFY \nFOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT STANDARDS \nEven if the Court were to import Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process standards for the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases into the Fifth Amendment, the \nPSJVTA easily satisfies those standards. That conclusion \nfollows a fortiori from Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Rail-\nway Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), which upheld a State\u2019s \n\n34 \n \nauthority to deem registration to do business in the state \nas signifying consent to be sued there. The United States \nmay likewise deem the PLO and PA\u2019s payments to terror-\nists who murdered or maimed U.S. nationals and U.S. ac-\ntivities as signifying their consent to suit in federal anti-\nterrorism cases involving U.S. victims. \nLike the statute in Mallory, the PSJVTA provided \nthe PLO and PA with advance notice of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction in United States courts. \nMoreover, the PSJVTA unquestionably serves legitimate \ngovernmental interests\u2014which the statute in Mallory did \nnot.  \nEven if this Court were to adopt the Second Circuit\u2019s \nnew rule that consent to suit must be part of a \u201creciprocal \nbargain\u201d in order to be valid, the PSJVTA would pass that \ntest too: The PLO and PA obtain valuable benefits from \nengaging in activities within the United States. \nA. This Is A Stronger Case For Jurisdiction Than \nMallory \nFor more than a century and a half\u2014and as recently \nas two Terms ago\u2014this Court has consistently held that \na State has the right to deem specified conduct as consti-\ntuting consent to personal jurisdiction, including by treat-\ning presence as consent to be sued there. The United \nStates, as the national sovereign, is at least equally enti-\ntled to treat specified conduct, including entry into its ter-\nritory, as consent to suit on federal claims in federal \ncourts. \n1. \u201cBoth at the time of the founding and the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption, the Anglo-American legal \ntradition recognized that a tribunal\u2019s competence was \ngenerally constrained only by the \u2018territorial limits\u2019 of the \nsovereign that created it.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128 (plu-\nrality opinion) (quoting Joseph Story, Commentaries on \nthe Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u2009539, pp. 450-451 (1834)). As a result, \n\n35 \n \n\u201can in personam suit \u2026 could be maintained by anyone on \nany claim in any place \u2026 \u2018wherever the [defendant] may \nbe found.\u2019\u201d Id. at 128-129 (quoting Massie v. Watts, 10 \nU.S. (6 Cranch) 148, 158 (1810)). Even a defendant\u2019s tran-\nsitory presence within the jurisdiction sufficed upon ser-\nvice of process there. See Burnham v. Superior Ct. of \nCal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990). \n\u201cAs the use of the corporate form proliferated in the \n19th century, the question arose how to adapt the tradi-\ntional rule about transitory actions for individuals to arti-\nficial persons created by law.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 129. \nIn many States, the answer was to treat an artificial en-\ntity\u2019s presence within the State as constructive consent to \nbe sued there. Id. at 129-130. While many of those statutes \nlimited such consent to suits \u201cby in-state plaintiffs,\u201d oth-\ners required foreign entities \u201cto defend themselves there \nagainst any manner of suit.\u201d Id. at 130. \nThis Court consistently upheld such statutes against \ndue process challenges. In St. Clair v. Cox, 106 U.S. 350 \n(1882), for instance, the Court upheld a Michigan statute \nthat implied consent to service of process\u2014and thus to \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014\u201cas a condition upon which a for-\neign corporation shall be permitted to do business within \nher limits.\u201d Id. at 356. So long as the state\u2019s jurisdictional \ninterest was \u201creasonable\u201d and the defendant had actual \n\u201cnotice of [the] suit,\u201d due process imposed no barrier. \nIbid. And in Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Is-\nsue Mining Co., 243 U.S. 93 (1917), the Court held that \nMissouri, by construing its consent-to-jurisdiction statute \nas permitting general jurisdiction upon the (required) ap-\npointment of the superintendent of insurance to receive \nprocess, \u201cdid not deprive the defendant of due process of \nlaw even if it took the defendant by surprise.\u201d Id. at 95. \n2. This Court recently confirmed the continuing vital-\nity of consent-to-jurisdiction statutes in Mallory. There, a \nVirginia-headquartered railroad corporation registered \n\n36 \n \nwith the Pennsylvania Department of State as a condition \nof doing business within the State. See 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. \n\u00a7\u2009411(a). Under a separate statute, such \u201cqualification as \na foreign corporation\u201d was deemed consent to appear in \nthe courts of the State on \u201cany cause of action.\u201d \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u20095301(a)(2)(i), (b). Based on such \ndeemed consent, a former employee sued the railroad in \nPennsylvania for injuries stemming from activities in Vir-\nginia and Ohio. \nThis Court held that the railroad\u2019s consent was a valid \nbasis for suit under the Fourteenth Amendment. Writing \nfor a four-Justice plurality, Justice Gorsuch explained \nthat the railroad had \u201cagreed to be found in Pennsylvania \nand answer any suit there,\u201d even if its contacts with the \nState did not support general or specific jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 135. Such consent was sufficient, he explained, be-\ncause \u201cpersonal jurisdiction is a personal defense that \nmay be waived or forfeited.\u201d Id. at 144. And waiver may \noccur by operation of law, just as readily as by any express \nstatement: Business-registration statutes are among the \n\u201c\u2018variety of legal arrangements [that] have been taken to \nrepresent express or implied consent\u2019 to personal jurisdic-\ntion consistent with due process.\u201d Id. at 136 n.5 (quoting \nInsurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703-704 (1982)) (cleaned up). \nJustice Alito agreed on this point to form a majority. \n\u201cConsent is a separate basis for personal jurisdiction,\u201d he \nexplained, and the railroad \u201chad clear notice that Penn-\nsylvania considered its registration as consent to general \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 153. Justice Alito nevertheless ex-\npressed doubt that \u201cthe Constitution permits a State to \nimpose such a submission-to-jurisdiction requirement.\u201d \nId. at 150. That kind of state law, he explained, creates \nserious tensions with \u201cthe very nature of the federal sys-\ntem that the Constitution created and in numerous provi-\nsions that bear on States\u2019 interactions with one another.\u201d \n\n37 \n \nId. at 154. However, Justice Alito concluded that limits \nimposed by interstate federalism would be better seated \nsomewhere other than the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause. Id. at 150. \nMallory controls here. Like the Pennsylvania statute \nat issue there, the PSJVTA clearly specifies in advance, \nand gives fair warning of, the conduct by which \u201ca defend-\nant shall be deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1).  \nIndeed, in important respects, this is a far easier case \nthan Mallory. There, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \nheld that the State had \u201cno legitimate interest in a contro-\nversy with no connection to the Commonwealth that was \nfiled by a non-resident against a foreign corporation that \nis not at home here.\u201d Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 266 \nA.3d 542, 567 (Pa. 2021). Here, by contrast, the PSJVTA \napplies only to cases involving terrorism against Ameri-\ncan victims and their families, a topic of preeminent fed-\neral concern. Moreover, unlike Pennsylvania\u2019s business-\nregistration statute, which required a foreign corporation \nto submit to general jurisdiction\u2014including in suits under \nnon-Pennsylvania causes of action\u2014the PSJVTA applies \nonly to a single category of federal cases. And whereas \nPennsylvania\u2019s practical and legal right to exclude from \nthe State a railroad engaged in interstate commerce was \nsuspect, the United States undoubtedly has authority to \nexclude the PLO and PA from its territory. \n3. The Second Circuit read Mallory as being limited \nto circumstances where the defendant \u201caccepted a gov-\nernment benefit from the forum, in return for which the \ndefendant [was] required to submit itself to suit in the fo-\nrum.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200923a-24a. According to the court, consent-\n\n38 \n \nto-jurisdiction statutes must be based on \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d to pass constitutional muster. Id. at 24a.7 \nThis reciprocal-bargains theory was novel. As Judge \nMenashi explained, the Second Circuit simply \u201cinvented a \nnew requirement that applies when Congress or a state \nlegislature attempts to extend personal jurisdiction \nthrough a deemed-consent statute.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009240a-241a \nn.11. \u201cAlthough there are cases holding that a defendant\u2019s \nreceipt of a benefit can be deemed to be consent,\u201d there \ndoes not appear to be \u201cany case holding that such receipt \nof a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Id. at 123a n.10 \n(Furman, J.) (citations omitted; emphasis added). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 reciprocal-bargain test reflects \na basic logic error. While \u201caccepting an in-state benefit \nwith jurisdictional strings attached\u201d is one way for a state \nto provide for consent to personal jurisdiction, Mallory, \n600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion), it is not the only way. \nTo the contrary, even a \u201ctrivial thing\u201d like taking \u201cone \nstep\u201d across an \u201cinvisible state line\u201d can lead to \u201cjurisdic-\ntional consequences [that] are immediate and serious.\u201d \nIbid. Or as Justice Jackson explained, a defendant may \nconsent to jurisdiction \u201cmore than one way,\u201d including: \n(1) \u201cexplicitly or implicitly consenting,\u201d by engaging in \nconduct deemed consent under law; (2) by \u201cfail[ing] to fol-\nlow specific procedural rules\u201d; or (3) by \u201cvoluntarily in-\nvoking certain benefits from a State that are conditioned \non submitting to the State\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 147-148. \nThe Second Circuit simply erased the first category. As \nJustice Jackson summarized: \nRegardless of whether a defendant relinquishes its \npersonal-jurisdiction \nrights \nexpressly \nor \n \n7 The court carved out an exception from its government-benefit \nrule for \u201clitigation-related activities,\u201d id. at 22a-24a, but did not ex-\nplain why such activities are sufficient without \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains.\u201d \n\n39 \n \nconstructively, the basic teaching of Insurance Corp. \nof Ireland is the same: When a defendant chooses to \nengage in behavior that \u201camount[s] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d the Due Process \nClause poses no barrier to the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 148 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-705) (brack-\nets in original). \nThe Second Circuit rested its holding on the rationale \nthat the \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d deemed to manifest consent \nto jurisdiction under the PSJVTA is not a sufficiently \nclose \u201cproxy for actual consent.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200938a (emphasis \nadded). That echoes the railroad\u2019s argument in Mallory: \nIt asserted that the statue was a \u201ccoercive assertion of ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d such that its consent was not \u201ctrue consent.\u201d \nResp.\u2009Br. at 3, 7, Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway \nCo., 600 U.S. 122 (2023) (No. 21-1168). The railroad thus \nargued it had \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 144 (plurality opinion). \nThis Court rejected the argument. \u201c[A] legion of \nprecedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional consequences to what \nsome might dismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145. \n\u201c[U]nder [those] precedents a variety of \u2018actions of the de-\nfendant\u2019 that may seem like technicalities nonetheless can \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of a \ncourt.\u2019 That was so before International Shoe, and it re-\nmains so today.\u201d Id. at 146 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n704-705) (citation omitted). Justice Alito agreed: There \nwas no due process violation because the defendant \u201cacted \nwith knowledge of state law when it registered,\u201d such that \nthe Court may \u201cpresume that by registering, it consented \nto all valid conditions imposed by state law.\u201d Id. at 151 \n(cleaned up). \n\n40 \n \nB. The PSJVTA Also Satisfies Traditional Due \nProcess Standards \nThis Court\u2019s rules for personal jurisdiction require \nthat the defendant receive \u201cfair warning\u201d and that \nmaintenance of the suit must be \u201creasonable, in the con-\ntext of our federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, \n592 U.S. at 358 (citations omitted). The PSJVTA easily \nsatisfies both requirements. \n1. The requirement of \u201cfair warning\u201d ensures that \n\u201c[a] defendant can \u2026 structure its primary conduct to \nlessen or avoid exposure to a given State\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. at \n360 (cleaned up). In the context of implied consent, that \nmeans the conduct that will subject the defendant to the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d \nWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, 685 \n(2015). Here, the PLO and PA knowingly and voluntarily \nconsented to federal jurisdiction under the PSJVTA. \nTheir consent was knowing because the PSJVTA de-\nscribes, in advance, exactly what actions would be deemed \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in civil cases under the \nATA. Indeed, the PLO and PA received actual notice of \nthe PSJVTA: Before the law took effect, they represented \nto the D.C. Circuit that they \u201cmight never make covered \npayments.\u201d Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org., 955 \nF.3d 1016, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2020). Thus, when they later \nmade pay-for-slay payments, they did so knowing that it \nwould vest U.S. courts with jurisdiction over them. \nTheir conduct was also voluntary. Actions are \u201cvol-\nuntary within the meaning of the Due Process Clause\u201d if \nthey are the product of \u201ca free and unconstrained will.\u201d \nOregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 304 (1985) (citation omit-\nted). Conduct is \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d by contrast, only if it arises \nfrom \u201ccoercive activity of the State.\u201d Colorado v. Con-\nnelly, 479 U.S. 157, 165 (1986). \n\n41 \n \nThe PSJVTA gave the PLO and PA a clear and vol-\nuntary choice: either cease engaging in the conduct spec-\nified in the law, or submit to jurisdiction in the United \nStates. That was not coercion. In North Carolina v. Al-\nford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), a criminal defendant argued that \nhis guilty plea to a murder charge was not \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in \nthe sense required by the Due Process Clause, because \nthe evidence against him presented a serious risk that the \nState would put him to death if he went to trial. Id. at 27-\n28. This Court rejected his claim, holding that even the \nhigh risk of a death sentence did not make the defendant\u2019s \nplea a product of \u201cfear and coercion.\u201d Id. at 29, 37. If \nHenry Alford\u2019s plea was voluntary, so were the PLO and \nPA\u2019s decisions to pay terrorists and their families for mur-\ndering Americans and to engage in non-U.N. activities \nwithin the United States. Cf. Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 \nU.S. 212, 219 n.8 (1978) (\u201cthe legal system is replete with \nsituations requiring the making of difficult judgments as \nto which course to follow,\u201d but that does not make those \nchoices involuntary) (cleaned up). \nThe Second Circuit questioned whether constructive \nwaivers of constitutional rights are ever truly \u201cvoluntary.\u201d \nSee Pet.\u2009App.\u200939a-43a. Relying on dicta from College Sav-\nings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \nExpense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999), the court stated that \nconstitutional rights cannot be waived by constructive \nconsent, and that a person\u2019s \u201cability to \u2018abandon\u2019 the rele-\nvant predicate conduct \u2018has no bearing upon the voluntar-\niness of the asserted waiver.\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200940a (quoting 527 \nU.S. at 684) (brackets omitted). That reading of College \nSavings is mistaken. \nIn College Savings, the question was whether a State, \nby engaging in trademark-related activities regulated by \nthe Lanham Act, could be deemed as having implicitly \nwaived its immunity from suit under that Act. 527 U.S. at \n669. The Court held that it could not, and that Congress \n\n42 \n \ndid not have authority \u201cto exact constructive waivers of \nsovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I pow-\ners.\u201d Id. at 683. The Court stated in dicta that constructive \nwaivers are \u201csimply unheard of in the context of other con-\nstitutionally protected privileges,\u201d id. at 681, and that \nCongress\u2019s clear notice of the conduct giving rise to con-\nstructive consent could \u201chave no bearing upon the volun-\ntariness of the waiver\u201d of State sovereign immunity, id. at \n684. \nThe dicta in College Savings is uninstructive here. \nSovereign immunity and personal jurisdiction differ in \nrelevant ways. A State\u2019s immunity is a fundamental as-\npect of the sovereignty that the States enjoyed before the \nratification of the Constitution; as such, it goes to the very \nheart of our federal system. Personal jurisdiction, by con-\ntrast, is a matter of \u201cindividual liberty\u201d that can \u201cbe \nwaived\u201d through \u201cexpress or implied consent.\u201d Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 702-703. And this Court has specifically re-\njected the argument that \u201cthere is something unique \nabout the requirement of personal jurisdiction, which pre-\nvents it from being established or waived like other \nrights.\u201d Id. at 706; accord Mallory, 600 U.S. at 149 (Jack-\nson, J., concurring).8 \n2. The PSJVTA is also \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, 592 U.S. \nat 358 (citation omitted). Making this assessment requires \n\u201ca forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d \nJ. McIntyre, 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion).  \n \n8 This Court has upheld constructive waivers of constitutional \nrights by statute in other contexts as well. See, e.g., Birchfield v. \nNorth Dakota, 579 U.S. 438 (2016) (Fourth Amendment); South Da-\nkota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (1983) (Fifth Amendment); Bank of Co-\nlumbia v. Okely, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 235 (1819) (Seventh Amend-\nment). \n\n43 \n \nIn Ford Motor, this Court found that \u201cprinciples of \n\u2018interstate federalism\u2019 support[ed jurisdiction\u201d in the \nplaintiffs\u2019 home states, which had \u201csignificant interests at \nstake\u201d in \u201cproviding their residents with a convenient fo-\nrum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state ac-\ntors, as well as enforcing their own safety regulations.\u201d \n592 U.S. at 368 (cleaned up). Here, the \u201cinterests at stake\u201d \nare those of the national sovereign. As discussed above, \nthe PSJVTA advances national security and foreign policy \ninterests distinct to the United States. See pp. 22-23, 30-\n31, supra. The United States is the only forum where \nAmerican victims of international terrorism (and their \nfamilies) can obtain redress under the ATA. And adjudi-\ncation of such suits does not encroach on the sovereignty \nof another body in our constitutional system. \nC. \nEven If A Reciprocal Benefit Was Required, The \nPLO and PA Received One \nEven if receipt of some \u201cbenefit\u201d was required, the \nPLO and PA have received one: They have obtained \u201cthe \nprivilege of residing and conducting business in the \nUnited States\u2014not to mention furthering their political \ngoals at the expense of American lives.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009231a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting). \nAs an initial matter, the United States has the abso-\nlute power to exclude the PLO and PA from its territory\u2014\nas it did for many years. J.A.\u2009276-279.9 The power to ex-\nclude includes the lesser power to admit on condition of \nconsent to personal jurisdiction. See Washington ex rel. \nBond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Ct. of Wash., 289 \nU.S. 361, 364-365 (1933) (\u201cqualification of a foreign corpo-\nration in accordance with the statutes permitting its entry \n \n9 The United States could exclude the PLO and PA even if doing \nso would violate our treaty obligations to the United Nations. \nUnited States v. Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F. Supp. 1456, 1463-\n1465, 1468-1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). \n\n44 \n \ninto the state constitutes an assent on its part to all the \nreasonable conditions imposed,\u201d including consent to ju-\nrisdiction); Hess v. Pawlowski, 274 U.S. 352, 356 (1927) \n(similar); St. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356 (similar); Baltimore & \nOhio R.R. Co. v. Harris, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 65, 81 (1871) \n(similar). \nThe PLO and PA have benefitted from their presence \nin the United States, including by engaging in activities \nother than those \u201cundertaken exclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Nations.\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(B). It is uncontested that after the \nstatutory trigger date, their U.S.-based officers, employ-\nees, and agents met with U.S.-based groups to encourage \nthem to \u201clobby[] the government, lobby[] Congress\u201d to \nsupport \u201cjustice for the Palestinian people\u201d; used U.S.-\nbased social media platforms to \u201craise public awareness\u201d \nand \u201cbring attention\u201d to their cause; and notarized docu-\nments in the United States for use in Palestinian territo-\nries. J.A.\u2009282-288. In Sokolow, the district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \nin these types of activities.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200973a.10 Their ability \nto engage in these activities while physically present in \nthe United States was a meaningful benefit. Cf. Burnham, \n495 U.S. at 637 (Brennan, J., concurring) (defendant re-\nceived \u201csignificant benefits\u201d by visiting forum State for \nthree days). \nThe Second Circuit dismissed all of these U.S. activi-\nties as irrelevant. According to the court, \u201cfederal law has \nlong prohibited [the PLO and PA] from engaging in any \n \n10 Opposing certiorari, the PLO and PA contended that petitioners \nforfeited the argument that their U.S. activities meet the PSJVTA\u2019s \nterms. Br.\u2009in\u2009Opp.\u200917-18. That is false. Petitioners told the court of \nappeals that \u201cremands would be required [to consider the U.S.-ac-\ntivities prong] if this Court adopts Defendants\u2019 unprecedented \u2018ben-\nefit\u2019 theory.\u201d Fuld\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A.\u2009Br.\u20096; Sokolow\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A. \nBr.\u20096. \n\n45 \n \nactivities or maintaining any offices in the United States.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200928a. As a result, the court concluded, the \nPSJVTA \u201cexacts \u2018deemed\u2019 consent \u2026 without conferring \nany rights or benefits on [them] in return.\u201d Id. at 29a. That \nreasoning is both legally and logically flawed. \nAs a legal matter, the court was incorrect that all the \nPLO and PA\u2019s activities in the United States were prohib-\nited by federal law. The relevant statute merely forbids \nthem to \u201cexpend funds\u201d or maintain an office in the United \nStates (other than their U.N. mission). 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202; \nsee Application of Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 to Diplo-\nmatic Visit of Palestinian Delegation, 46 Op. O.L.C. __, \nat 2 (slip op. Oct. 28, 2022). Their non-expenditure activi-\nties\u2014including notarizing documents, holding meetings \nwith community groups, public speaking, publishing, and \nissuing political statements on social-media\u2014are not for-\nbidden by \u00a7\u20095202.11 \nAs a logical matter, the court was incorrect that if all \ntheir activities had been unlawful, the PLO and PA would \nhave received no benefit from conducting activities within \nthe United States. The legality or illegality of their activi-\nties has no bearing on the question whether they benefited \nfrom the society, economy, and governmental protection \nof the United States. Indeed, if Congress were to prohibit \nthem from engaging in any U.S. activities, and if they \nwere to flout that law, that would only make the PSJVTA \nmore reasonable, not less. As Judge Menashi explained, \n\u201ca foreign actor that conducts unauthorized business in \nthe United States has obtained an even greater benefit \nfrom the forum than the foreign actor that complies with \nAmerican law,\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009250a, and it would be \u201cperverse\u201d \n \n11 The court also cited (Pet.\u2009App.\u200928a\u2009n.9) Section 7(b) of the Pales-\ntinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-446. But that \nstatute is inapplicable at this time, because no ministry, agency, or \ninstrumentality of the PA is controlled by Hamas. See ibid. (incor-\nporating 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092378b). \n\n46 \n \nto give the law-breaker protection that a law-abiding for-\neigner lacks, id. at 231a. \nTo see this point, consider an analogous consent stat-\nute. \u201c[A]ll 50 States have adopted implied consent laws \nthat require motorists, as a condition of operating a motor \nvehicle within the State, to consent to [blood alcohol con-\ntent] testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained on \nsuspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\u201d Missouri v. \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013). Under the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal benefits\u201d test, these implied-consent \nstatues would be constitutional only as applied to validly \nlicensed drivers who exchange consent for the \u201cprivilege \nof driving on state roads.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200937a\u2009n.14 (citation \nomitted). They would be unconstitutional as applied to \nmotorists whose licenses have been suspended or revoked \nbecause such persons are already \u201cprohibited\u201d from driv-\ning under existing law. No principle of due process im-\nposes such irrational limits on the political branches. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed. \n\n47 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL SILVERMAN \nTHE SILVERMAN LAW  \nFIRM, PLLC \n16 Squadron Blvd. \nNew York, NY 10956 \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMANN \nTHE LAW OFFICE OF  \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMAN, P.C. \n150 Broadway, Ste. 900 \nNew York, NY 10038 \nBRIAN M.

Findings; determinations \n(a) Findings \nThe Congress finds that\u2014 \n*\u2009*\u2009* \n(2) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter \nin this chapter referred to as the \u201cPLO\u201d) was directly re-\nsponsible for the murder of an American citizen on the \nAchille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, and a member of the \nPLO\u2019s Executive Committee is under indictment in the \nUnited States for the murder of that American citizen; \n(3) the head of the PLO has been implicated in the \nmurder of a United States Ambassador overseas; \n(4) the PLO and its constituent groups have taken \ncredit for, and been implicated in, the murders of dozens \nof American citizens abroad; *\u2009*\u2009* \n(b) Determinations \nTherefore, the Congress determines that the PLO \nand its affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat \nto the interests of the United States, its allies, and to in-\nternational law and should not benefit from operating in \nthe United States. \n\u00a7\u20091003. Prohibitions regarding PLO  \n\n2a \n \n \nIt shall be unlawful, if the purpose be to further the \ninterests of the Palestine Liberation Organization or any \nof its constituent groups, any successor to any of those, or \nany agents thereof, on or after the effective date of this \nchapter\u2014 \n(1) to receive anything of value except informational \nmaterial from the PLO or any of its constituent groups, \nany successor thereto, or any agents thereof; \n(2) to expend funds from the PLO or any of its con-\nstituent groups, any successor thereto, or any agents \nthereof; or \n(3) notwithstanding any provision of law to the con-\ntrary, to establish or maintain an office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments within the \njurisdiction of the United States at the behest or direction \nof, or with funds provided by the Palestine Liberation Or-\nganization or any of its constituent groups, any successor \nto any of those, or any agents thereof. \n \n*\u2009*\u2009* \n \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, Pub. L. 102-527, Ti-\ntle X, \u00a7 1003, 106 Stat. 4521, added the following provi-\nsions to Title 18 of the United States Code: \n\u00a7\u20092331. Definitions \nAs used in this chapter\u2014 \n(1) the term \u201cinternational terrorism\u201d means activi-\nties that\u2014 \n(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human \nlife that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United \nStates or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation \nif committed within the jurisdiction of the United States \nor of any State; \n\n3a \n \n \n(B) appear to be intended\u2014 \n(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; \n(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimi-\ndation or coercion; or \n(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass de-\nstruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and \n(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction \nof the United States, or transcend national boundaries in \nterms of the means by which they are accomplished, the \npersons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or \nthe locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asy-\nlum; *\u2009*\u2009* \n\u00a7\u20092333. Civil Remedies \n(a) ACTION AND JURISDICTION.\u2014Any national of the \nUnited States injured in his or her person, property, or \nbusiness by reason of an act of international terrorism, or \nhis or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in \nany appropriate district court of the United States and \nshall recover threefold the damages he or she sustains and \nthe cost of the suit, including attorney\u2019s fees. *\u2009*\u2009* \n\u00a7\u20092334. Jurisdiction and Venue  \n(a) GENERAL VENUE.\u2014Any civil action under section \n2333 of this title against any person may be instituted in \nthe district court of the United States for any district \nwhere any plaintiff resides or where any defendant re-\nsides or is served, or has an agent. Process in such a civil \naction may be served in any district where the defendant \nresides, is found, or has an agent. *\u2009*\u2009* \n \n*\u2009*\u2009* \n\n4a \n \n \nThe Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018, Pub. L. \n115-253, \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. 3183, added the following provision \nto Section 2334 of Title 18 of the United States Code: \n(e) Consent of Certain Parties to Personal Jurisdic-\ntion.\u2014 \n(1) In general.\u2014Except as provided in paragraph (2), \nfor purposes of any civil action under section 2333 of this \ntitle, a defendant shall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction in such civil action if, regardless of \nthe date of the occurrence of the act of international ter-\nrorism upon which such civil action was filed, the defend-\nant\u2014 *\u2009*\u2009* \n(B) in the case of a defendant benefiting from a waiver \nor suspension of section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act of \n1987 (22 U.S.C. 5202) after the date that is 120 days after \nthe date of enactment of this subsection\u2014 \n(i) continues to maintain any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments within the \njurisdiction of the United States; or \n(ii) establishes or procures any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments within the \njurisdiction of the United States. *\u2009*\u2009* \n \n*\u2009*\u2009* \n \n The Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA), Pub. L. No. 116\u201394, div. \nJ, tit.

Based on my internal reasoning, I have now established a foundational understanding of the case's central conflict. The core legal question is whether the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA) violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. Specifically, the issue revolves around a provision in the PSJVTA that \"deems\" the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian Authority (PA) to have consented to personal jurisdiction in U.S. courts if they perform certain actions, such as making payments to the families of terrorists. My understanding is now focused on the constitutionality of Congress statutorily creating personal jurisdiction through this mechanism of \"deemed consent,\" which stands in tension with the due process rights afforded to foreign entities.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was a blank slate regarding effective strategies for SCOTUS prediction. My own reasoning process has provided the first piece of meta-level guidance. A foundational strategy for approaching a new case is to first deconstruct the provided facts to identify the core constitutional or statutory conflict. In this instance, that conflict is between Congressional power (in the name of national security and justice for victims) and constitutional due process limitations.\n\nFurthermore, I have developed a specific information-gathering heuristic: to maximize initial information gain about the task parameters (\u03b8), the most effective first step is to seek out the primary source document that frames the legal arguments for the Supreme Court's review. For a new case, the **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari** is the highest-value initial target. Analyzing this document should provide a clear outline of the petitioners' legal arguments, the precedents they rely on, and the specific questions they are asking the Court to resolve. This confirms that prioritizing primary legal briefs is a superior strategy to broad, unfocused searches at the outset of an investigation."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to deepen. I previously identified the core legal question as whether the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), which \"deems\" the PLO and PA to have consented to personal jurisdiction, violates the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause. The observation of the petitioners' merits brief has significantly refined and expanded this understanding with specific legal arguments and key precedents.\n\nMy belief state now incorporates the following specific details about the petitioners' case:\n*   **Confirmation of the Legal Question:** The brief confirms the question presented is \"Whether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.\" It also clarifies that the Second Circuit's invalidation was based on the theory that the statute failed to provide a \"reciprocal bargain\" to the PLO and PA in exchange for their deemed consent.\n*   **U.S. Government Involvement:** I now know that this case, *Fuld v. PLO* (24-20), is consolidated with *United States v. PLO* (24-151). This means the U.S. Government, through the Solicitor General, is also a petitioner arguing in favor of the PSJVTA's constitutionality. This is a powerful signal, as the executive branch's views on matters of foreign policy, national security, and the interpretation of federal statutes carry significant weight with the Court.\n*   **Primary Argument - Originalism & Federal Power:** The petitioners' lead argument is that the Fifth Amendment, as originally understood in 1791, placed no limits on Congress's power to establish personal jurisdiction, especially over cases arising from extraterritorial conduct. They argue that historical limits on jurisdiction stemmed from the law of nations, not the Constitution, and Congress has the authority to override them.\n*   **Distinction Between 5th and 14th Amendments:** A core pillar of their argument is that the Court's modern personal jurisdiction jurisprudence (e.g., *International Shoe*, *Bristol-Myers Squibb*), which limits state courts, is rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment and principles of \"interstate federalism.\" They contend these limitations do not apply to the federal government, which possesses sovereign authority over foreign affairs and national security.\n*   **The \"Linchpin Precedent\" - *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.*:** The petitioners are heavily relying on the Court's very recent decision in *Mallory* (2023). Their argument is that if a corporation's registration to do business in a state constitutes consent to jurisdiction there (as held in *Mallory*), then the PLO/PA's specified conduct (making payments to terrorists, conducting U.S. activities) is an even stronger basis for finding consent to jurisdiction in federal court for terrorism cases. This recent precedent is now the central axis around which the case will likely turn.\n*   **Alternative Arguments:** In a fallback position, the petitioners argue that even if the stricter Fourteenth Amendment standards were to apply, the PSJVTA would still be constitutional. They claim it satisfies traditional \"minimum contacts\" standards and that the PLO/PA did receive a \"reciprocal benefit\" for their consent, such as the privilege of conducting activities within the United States.\n\nMy confidence in a potential prediction has shifted. The combination of the U.S. government's support and the petitioners' strategy of anchoring their argument to the recent *Mallory* decision makes their position appear stronger than I initially perceived. The key uncertainty is now how the Court will choose to apply or distinguish *Mallory* in the context of a foreign entity and a federal statute grounded in national security, rather than a domestic corporation and state commercial law.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of how to approach SCOTUS prediction tasks has evolved significantly. My initial heuristics have been tested and refined, and new, more sophisticated ones have been developed.\n\nMy current design beliefs are:\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents:** My initial belief that one should deconstruct the case facts to find the core conflict is confirmed as a necessary first step. My subsequent heuristic to target the Petition for Certiorari was effective, but this observation provides a crucial refinement:\n    *   **Refined Heuristic:** For a newly granted case, the most information-dense documents are the **Merits Briefs** for the petitioner and respondent. While the Petition for Certiorari is the key document pre-grant, the Merits Briefs contain the parties' fully developed legal arguments that will be presented to the justices.\n*   **Identify the \"Linchpin Precedent\":** A new and powerful heuristic is to identify the single precedent that a case appears to hinge on. In this instance, the petitioners' brief makes it clear that *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* (2023) is that case. A deep analysis of the linchpin precedent\u2014and how each side attempts to frame it, apply it, or distinguish it\u2014is critical for predicting the outcome.\n*   **Track the Solicitor General:** The discovery that the United States is a co-petitioner confirms the importance of a new heuristic: always identify the position of the U.S. Government, as represented by the Office of the Solicitor General. The SG's involvement as a party or a significant amicus curiae is a strong predictive variable due to the office's high credibility and the Court's deference on issues of federal law and executive power (especially in foreign policy and national security).\n*   **Map Argumentative Structure:** Effective legal analysis requires deconstructing the architecture of each party's argument. The petitioners' brief provides a clear template: 1) Lead with a strong, foundational argument (originalism/federal power), 2) Distinguish adverse jurisprudence (14th vs. 5th Amendment cases), 3) Anchor the argument to a favorable recent precedent (*Mallory*), and 4) Provide alternative/fallback arguments (\"even if... we still win because...\"). Mapping these structures for both sides will reveal points of clash and potential weaknesses."

For the same reasons, courts held \nthat Respondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot \nsupport jurisdiction.  Now, under the broad provisions \nof the PSJVTA, Petitioners assert that Respondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n\nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTION PRESENTED.......................................... i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ........................................ v \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 4 \nA. \nCourts Unanimously Agree \nRespondents Are Not Subject to \nPersonal Jurisdiction in the United \nStates. ....................................................... 5 \nB. \nCongress Tries Different Approaches \nto Jurisdiction in the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA. .................................................... 6 \nC. \nThe Lower Courts Unanimously Hold \nthat Applying the PSJVTA Would \nViolate Due Process. ................................. 7 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 10 \nARGUMENT ............................................................. 15 \nI. \nThe Act\u2019s \u201cDeemed Consent\u201d Provisions \nViolate Due Process. ....................................... 15 \nA.

App. 1a-5a.  \nINTRODUCTION  \nThe PSJVTA is the latest legislative attempt to \nundo an unbroken line of cases holding that \nRespondents PA and PLO are not subject to personal \njurisdiction in the United States for their alleged \ninvolvement in terrorist attacks in Israel and \nPalestine.  Time and again, courts have held that \nexercising personal jurisdiction over Respondents \nwould violate due process because the attacks did not \ntarget Americans, and Respondents lack any other \nconstitutionally-sufficient connection to the United \nStates.  Because jurisdictional due process protections \nare rooted in the Constitution, these decisions cannot \nbe undone by legislation. \nAs the Second Circuit held, the PSJVTA attempts \nan end-run around settled constitutional analysis by \ndeclaring that Respondents always shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d \nto \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction when they engage \nin the same conduct courts have previously held \ninsufficient to support jurisdiction under the Due \nProcess Clause.  Pet. App. 25a-38a, 44a. 1   The \nPSJVTA accordingly seeks to elide the constitutional \nboundaries of due process recognized in prior cases.   \nThe Second Circuit saw through this ruse, \nholding\u2014like every other federal court to consider the \nissue\u2014that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d imposed by legislative \nfiat cannot paper over the lack of any constitutionally-\nmeaningful connection between Respondents, the \nforum, and the conduct that gave rise to Plaintiffs\u2019 \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n2 \nclaims.  As the courts below recognized, the PSJVTA \nonly pretends to replace traditional due process \n\u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d \nanalysis \nwith \n\u201cconsent.\u201d  \nRespondents have not taken any actions that could be \nunderstood as submission to personal jurisdiction: \nthey did not sign a contract agreeing to jurisdiction, \nthey did not accept any benefit from the Government \nconditioned on submission to jurisdiction, and they \ndid not take any other actions signifying their express \nor implied agreement to litigate these disputes in the \nUnited States.  Rather, Respondents have repeatedly \nand successfully challenged personal jurisdiction on \nfacts nearly identical to those here. \nThe court of appeals scrupulously followed this \nCourt\u2019s guidance in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023) and Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (\u201cBauxites\u201d), 456 \nU.S. 694 (1982) in holding that Respondents\u2019 conduct \ndoes not meet due process standards for consent-\nbased jurisdiction.  Respondents have not taken any \naction that manifests submission to jurisdiction under \nBauxites.  And the PSJVTA does not grant any benefit \nto Respondents in exchange for submission to \njurisdiction that could bring this case closer to \nMallory.  The court of appeals thus explained that \n\u201cCongress cannot take conduct otherwise insufficient \nto support an inference of consent\u201d and \u201cbrand it as \n\u2018consent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 44a.   \nUnder Mallory, neither form of conduct relied upon \nby Petitioners\u2014making payments in Palestine and \nconducting UN-related activities in the United \nStates\u2014signals Respondents\u2019 submission to personal \njurisdiction in the United States.  As to the payments, \nthat is because the United States does not have \nantecedent authority to permit them in the first \nplace\u2014just as Pennsylvania could not offer a company \n\n3 \nthe right to do business in New Jersey in exchange for \nconsent to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania.  As to the \nactivity prong, the PSJVTA specifically excludes \n\u201cofficial\u201d UN business and \u201cancillary\u201d activities, does \nnot \nwaive \nor \nwithdraw \npreexisting \nstatutory \nrestrictions on Respondents\u2019 activities in the United \nStates, and does not permit any U.S. activity at all by \nRespondents.  In turn, since at least the PSJVTA\u2019s \neffective date, Respondents perform no U.S. activities \noutside the UN sphere (whether those activities are \ndenominated \u201cofficial\u201d UN activity or \u201cancillary\u201d \nactivity).  The PSJVTA merely avoids interfering with \nthe United Nations\u2019 preexisting authority to grant \ninternational actors \u201cinvitee\u201d status. \nAllowing Congress to impose \u201cconsent\u201d on \nRespondents in these circumstances would swallow \nthe due process test and eviscerate the meaning of \nconsent.  If due process required nothing more than \nnotice, then nothing would stop Congress from \ndecreeing that a defendant shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction by engaging in \nany activity anywhere in the world.  These are not \nmerely theoretical concerns.  That is precisely what \nthe PSJVTA purports to do here.  The Government\u2019s \nargument that such jurisdiction could satisfy \n\u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under a \u201cflexible\u201d due process \nstandard that \u201cdepends on the type of actor involved\u201d \n(Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 25), underscores Petitioners\u2019 failure to \noffer any meaningful or consistent guardrails.   \nNor can the PSJVTA be upheld as an exercise of \nthe enumerated power to punish extraterritorial \noffenses.  Although Petitioners significantly overread \nthe scope of that power, the bottom line is that \nCongress cannot impose personal jurisdiction as a \npunishment or sanction.  This Court\u2019s decisions hold \nthat personal jurisdiction must be independently \n\n4 \nestablished consistent with due process minimum \ncontacts even when Congress has the power to enact \nstatutes with extraterritorial substantive reach. \nNor does Plaintiffs\u2019 historical argument save the \nstatute.  The founders believed due process of law \nprotected the natural rights of individuals, and early \nAmerican courts regularly held that personal \njurisdiction protections were safeguarded from \nCongressional interference.  Neither the payments \nnor Respondents\u2019 alleged \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d UN-\nrelated actions are within the territorial authority of \nthe United States.  The Framers never imagined that \nCongress would have power to create jurisdiction over \nforeign actors for conduct not within the territorial \nlimits of, and not directed at, the United States.   \nSTATEMENT \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet.

For the same reasons, courts held \nthat Respondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot \nsupport jurisdiction.  Now, under the broad provisions \nof the PSJVTA, Petitioners assert that Respondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n\nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTION PRESENTED.......................................... i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ........................................ v \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 4 \nA. \nCourts Unanimously Agree \nRespondents Are Not Subject to \nPersonal Jurisdiction in the United \nStates. ....................................................... 5 \nB. \nCongress Tries Different Approaches \nto Jurisdiction in the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA. .................................................... 6 \nC. \nThe Lower Courts Unanimously Hold \nthat Applying the PSJVTA Would \nViolate Due Process. ................................. 7 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 10 \nARGUMENT ............................................................. 15 \nI. \nThe Act\u2019s \u201cDeemed Consent\u201d Provisions \nViolate Due Process. ....................................... 15 \nA.

App. 1a-5a.  \nINTRODUCTION  \nThe PSJVTA is the latest legislative attempt to \nundo an unbroken line of cases holding that \nRespondents PA and PLO are not subject to personal \njurisdiction in the United States for their alleged \ninvolvement in terrorist attacks in Israel and \nPalestine.  Time and again, courts have held that \nexercising personal jurisdiction over Respondents \nwould violate due process because the attacks did not \ntarget Americans, and Respondents lack any other \nconstitutionally-sufficient connection to the United \nStates.  Because jurisdictional due process protections \nare rooted in the Constitution, these decisions cannot \nbe undone by legislation. \nAs the Second Circuit held, the PSJVTA attempts \nan end-run around settled constitutional analysis by \ndeclaring that Respondents always shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d \nto \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction when they engage \nin the same conduct courts have previously held \ninsufficient to support jurisdiction under the Due \nProcess Clause.  Pet. App. 25a-38a, 44a. 1   The \nPSJVTA accordingly seeks to elide the constitutional \nboundaries of due process recognized in prior cases.   \nThe Second Circuit saw through this ruse, \nholding\u2014like every other federal court to consider the \nissue\u2014that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d imposed by legislative \nfiat cannot paper over the lack of any constitutionally-\nmeaningful connection between Respondents, the \nforum, and the conduct that gave rise to Plaintiffs\u2019 \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n2 \nclaims.  As the courts below recognized, the PSJVTA \nonly pretends to replace traditional due process \n\u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d \nanalysis \nwith \n\u201cconsent.\u201d  \nRespondents have not taken any actions that could be \nunderstood as submission to personal jurisdiction: \nthey did not sign a contract agreeing to jurisdiction, \nthey did not accept any benefit from the Government \nconditioned on submission to jurisdiction, and they \ndid not take any other actions signifying their express \nor implied agreement to litigate these disputes in the \nUnited States.  Rather, Respondents have repeatedly \nand successfully challenged personal jurisdiction on \nfacts nearly identical to those here. \nThe court of appeals scrupulously followed this \nCourt\u2019s guidance in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023) and Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (\u201cBauxites\u201d), 456 \nU.S. 694 (1982) in holding that Respondents\u2019 conduct \ndoes not meet due process standards for consent-\nbased jurisdiction.  Respondents have not taken any \naction that manifests submission to jurisdiction under \nBauxites.  And the PSJVTA does not grant any benefit \nto Respondents in exchange for submission to \njurisdiction that could bring this case closer to \nMallory.  The court of appeals thus explained that \n\u201cCongress cannot take conduct otherwise insufficient \nto support an inference of consent\u201d and \u201cbrand it as \n\u2018consent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 44a.   \nUnder Mallory, neither form of conduct relied upon \nby Petitioners\u2014making payments in Palestine and \nconducting UN-related activities in the United \nStates\u2014signals Respondents\u2019 submission to personal \njurisdiction in the United States.  As to the payments, \nthat is because the United States does not have \nantecedent authority to permit them in the first \nplace\u2014just as Pennsylvania could not offer a company \n\n3 \nthe right to do business in New Jersey in exchange for \nconsent to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania.  As to the \nactivity prong, the PSJVTA specifically excludes \n\u201cofficial\u201d UN business and \u201cancillary\u201d activities, does \nnot \nwaive \nor \nwithdraw \npreexisting \nstatutory \nrestrictions on Respondents\u2019 activities in the United \nStates, and does not permit any U.S. activity at all by \nRespondents.  In turn, since at least the PSJVTA\u2019s \neffective date, Respondents perform no U.S. activities \noutside the UN sphere (whether those activities are \ndenominated \u201cofficial\u201d UN activity or \u201cancillary\u201d \nactivity).  The PSJVTA merely avoids interfering with \nthe United Nations\u2019 preexisting authority to grant \ninternational actors \u201cinvitee\u201d status. \nAllowing Congress to impose \u201cconsent\u201d on \nRespondents in these circumstances would swallow \nthe due process test and eviscerate the meaning of \nconsent.  If due process required nothing more than \nnotice, then nothing would stop Congress from \ndecreeing that a defendant shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction by engaging in \nany activity anywhere in the world.  These are not \nmerely theoretical concerns.  That is precisely what \nthe PSJVTA purports to do here.  The Government\u2019s \nargument that such jurisdiction could satisfy \n\u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under a \u201cflexible\u201d due process \nstandard that \u201cdepends on the type of actor involved\u201d \n(Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 25), underscores Petitioners\u2019 failure to \noffer any meaningful or consistent guardrails.   \nNor can the PSJVTA be upheld as an exercise of \nthe enumerated power to punish extraterritorial \noffenses.  Although Petitioners significantly overread \nthe scope of that power, the bottom line is that \nCongress cannot impose personal jurisdiction as a \npunishment or sanction.  This Court\u2019s decisions hold \nthat personal jurisdiction must be independently \n\n4 \nestablished consistent with due process minimum \ncontacts even when Congress has the power to enact \nstatutes with extraterritorial substantive reach. \nNor does Plaintiffs\u2019 historical argument save the \nstatute.  The founders believed due process of law \nprotected the natural rights of individuals, and early \nAmerican courts regularly held that personal \njurisdiction protections were safeguarded from \nCongressional interference.  Neither the payments \nnor Respondents\u2019 alleged \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d UN-\nrelated actions are within the territorial authority of \nthe United States.  The Framers never imagined that \nCongress would have power to create jurisdiction over \nforeign actors for conduct not within the territorial \nlimits of, and not directed at, the United States.   \nSTATEMENT \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a.  The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \nand public schools, with over 155,000 government \nemployees.  Id. at 143a-44a.  Under the Oslo Accords, \nthe PLO conducts Palestinian foreign affairs, \nincluding operating its mission to the United Nations.  \nId. at 6a; see also JA 65-68 (State Dept. Statement of \nInterest).  The United States does not recognize \nRespondents as sovereign.  Gov\u2019t Br. 3; Pet. App. 153a.   \nRespondents \nare \ncurrently \nforbidden \nfrom \noperating in the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n5201(b), 5202; Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, \nPub. L. No. 109-446, \u00a7 7(a)2, 120 Stat. 3318 (22 U.S.C. \n2 Plaintiffs erroneously cite Section 7(b), rather than Section \n7(a), of the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, which is the \nprovision cited by the Second Circuit.  Pls. Br. 45 n.11 (citing Pet. \n\n5 \n\u00a7 2378b note); United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \nPalestine\u2019s UN mission to conduct activities relating \nto its role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that office closed in 2018, \nbefore \nthe \nPSJVTA \nbecame \neffective. \n \nIbid.\nRespondents have no other offices and conduct no \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \nA.\nCourts Unanimously Agree Respondents \nAre Not Subject to Personal Jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause Respondents\u2019 alleged actions do not have \nany constitutionally-meaningful connection to the \nUnited States, federal courts have long held that \nexercising personal jurisdiction over Respondents for \nalleged attacks in Israel and Palestine would violate \ndue process.  In Sokolow, Plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170a-78a.  That Americans \nwere injured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id. at 170a.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed \nrandom\u201d as the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  \nIbid.3\nApp. 28a n.9).  Section 7(a) prohibits the PA from operating in \nthe U.S. absent presidential certification.  The Government \nacknowledges Section 7(a) remains in effect.  Gov\u2019t Br. 7, 42. \n3 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \n\n6 \nPlaintiffs sought review by this Court, but the \nUnited States recommended against certiorari.  Resp. \nApp. 7a.  It warned that Plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment \nanalysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d and that the \ndecision did \u201cnot conflict with any decision of this \nCourt [or] implicate any conflict among the courts of \nappeals.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21a-24a.  The United States \nrejected the argument that denying jurisdiction \nharmed other anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing in the \ncourt\u2019s opinion calls into question the United States\u2019 \nability to prosecute defendants under the broader due \nprocess principles the courts have recognized in cases \ninvolving the application of U.S. criminal laws to \nconduct affecting U.S. citizens or interests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  \nThis Court denied certiorari.  Sokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. \n915 (2018). \nB.\nCongress Tries Different Approaches to \nJurisdiction in the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n7 \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134a-35a; see also\nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.  The Sokolow plaintiffs \npetitioned for certiorari, but Congress intervened \nagain by enacting the PSJVTA in December 2019.   \nThe PSJVTA requires courts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that \nRespondents \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction if, \nafter certain dates, they engage in either of two types \nof conduct: (i) outside the United States, making \npayments relating to Palestinians imprisoned or \nkilled as a result of committing overseas attacks \nharming American nationals; or (ii) in the United \nStates, engaging in \u201cany activity\u201d other than UN \nparticipation, meetings with government officials, and \nactivities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The \nPSJVTA, in other words, takes the same conduct \npreviously held as insufficient to create personal \njurisdiction, and instructs courts to treat it as \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to jurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld\nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Ibid.  The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC.\nThe Lower Courts Unanimously Hold \nthat Applying the PSJVTA Would Violate \nDue Process.  \nRespondents raised an as-applied challenge to the \nPSJVTA, arguing that the conduct alleged by \nPlaintiffs could not give rise to valid \u201cconsent\u201d to \njurisdiction.  Sokolow C.A. Def. Supp. Br. #569 at 7 \n(\u201cPSJVTA \u2026 is unconstitutional as applied to \nDefendants in these cases\u201d); Fuld C.A. Def. Supp. Br. \n#222 at 7 (same); Sokolow & Fuld Oral Arg. (2d Cir. \n\n8 \nMay 3, 2023) at 20:30 (\u201cThis is not a facial challenge.  \nThis is an as applied challenge to the statute.\u201d).  Both \ndistrict courts held that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provisions violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause.  Pet. App. 15a, 60a.  They \nreviewed extensive evidence and briefing regarding \nthe factual predicates of the PSJVTA, but declined to \ndecide if the activities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at \n15a, 67a-68a, 74a.  Two other courts reached the same \nconclusion.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 WL \n826409, *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. PLO, \n688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Second Circuit relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision \nin \nMallory, \nwhich \n\u201cunderscores\u201d \nthe \ndifference \u201cbetween the PSJVTA and business \nregistration statutes,\u201d because unlike the statute at \nissue in Mallory, the \u201cPSJVTA does not require that \nthe PLO and the PA consent to jurisdiction as a \ncondition of securing a legal right to do business in the \nUnited States, which remains prohibited under \n\n9 \ncurrent law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  Unlike the corporate \ndefendants in Mallory, Respondents did not accept \n\u201csome in-forum benefit in return for an agreement to \nbe amenable to suit in the United States.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt thus affirmed the dismissal in Fuld and denied \nthe motion to recall the Sokolow mandate.  Pet. App. \n52a, 70a.  \nThe Second Circuit then denied en banc review.  In \na concurrence to that denial, Judge Bianco (a member \nof the Panel) explained that nothing in the Panel\u2019s \nopinion requires an \u201cexchange of benefits\u201d as the sole \nbasis to infer consent, and that the PSJVTA in any \nevent falls outside the Mallory line of \u201cexchange of \nbenefits\u201d cases.  Id. at 212a-15a.  Adopting the new \n\u201cnexus\u201d tests proposed by Petitioners, he explained, \n\u201cwould allow Congress to subject any foreign entity to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States, even in the \nabsence of any contacts with the United States, if that \nentity knowingly and voluntary engages in any \nconduct around the world (with some undefined nexus \nto the United States) after Congress enacts legislation \ndeeming the continuation of that conduct to constitute \nconsent.\u201d  Id. at 216a.  This \u201cwould allow the \ngovernment to declare conduct to be consent, even if \nthat conduct could not reasonably be considered to be \nconsent.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n10 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. To establish valid \u201cconsent,\u201d a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate \u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that support a \n\u201cpresumption\u201d the defendant submitted to jurisdiction \nin the forum.  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-09 (discussing \nthe \u201cHammond Packing presumption\u201d).  A Bauxites \n\u201cpresumption\u201d of \u201clegal submission to \u2026 jurisdiction\u201d \nmust rest on conduct by the defendant that is \n\u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201crelated\u201d to the issue of jurisdiction over \nthe defendant.  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 31a (facts \nunderlying Hammond Packing presumption were \n\u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction).  In applying \nthis rule, this Court has distinguished between a \ndefendant\u2019s voluntary conduct signaling submission \nto jurisdiction, and \u201c\u2018mere assertions\u2019 of power\u201d by the \nforum to impose jurisdiction on a nonconsenting \ndefendant.  Id. at 704-05; see also College Savings \nBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense \nBd., 527 U.S. 666, 675 (1999) (State must make \u201ca \n\u2018clear declaration\u2019 that it intends to submit itself to \nour jurisdiction\u201d).   \nAs one barometer for submission under Bauxites, \ncourts recognize a narrow category of \u201cimplied consent\u201d \nstatutes by which a party agrees to personal \njurisdiction by accepting a benefit conditioned by the \nforum on consent.  This Court\u2019s recent decision in \nMallory\u2014where all four opinions cited Bauxites\u2014falls \nsquarely within this category.  As the Court explained, \nthe business registration statute at issue in Mallory\nrequired foreign corporations to submit to jurisdiction \n\u201cin exchange for status as a registered foreign \ncorporation and the benefits that entails.\u201d  600 U.S. at \n127 (plurality op.) (emphasis added); see also id. at \n167 (Barrett, J., dissenting) (explaining the majority\u2019s \nstandard \u201ccasts [the statute] as setting the terms of a \nbargain\u201d).  Though this Court fractured on whether \n\n11 \nthe bargain was fair, everyone agreed that Norfolk \nSouthern had accepted the benefits of the bargain.  \nThis case is the opposite of Mallory.  The PSJVTA \noffers no exchange from which the presumption of \n\u201cconsent\u201d or submission can be reasonably inferred.  \nSee Pet. App. 28a, 35a-36a & n.13.  The PSJVTA \ncreates two triggers for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdiction.  \nIn the first, the statute provides that a payment \nprogram limited exclusively to Palestine, which courts \nhad previously held was not aimed at the United \nStates in any way, creates \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \njurisdiction in the United States.  Unlike the statute \nin Mallory, neither Congress nor the Executive has \nantecedent \nauthority \nto \ngrant \nRespondents \npermission to make, or not make, those payments.  \nThe PSJVTA simply punishes Respondents for the \nprogram.  Respondents have ended that program, but \nthe statute imposes personal jurisdiction for making \npayments that the United States had no power to \npermit or prohibit in the first place. \nThe second trigger provides that Respondents \nshall be \u201cdeemed\u201d to consent to jurisdiction if they \nundertake \u201cany activity\u201d in the United States that is \nnot part of or \u201cancillary\u201d to United Nations or \ndiplomatic activity.  Like Pennsylvania in Mallory, \nthe United States can exclude Respondents from its \nterritory.  And it has successfully done so.  But unlike \nthe statute in Mallory, the PSJVTA does not grant \nany territorial access to Respondents, does not waive \nor withdraw preexisting statutory restrictions on \nRespondents\u2019 U.S. activities, and does not permit any \nactivity at all by Respondents.  See Pet. App. 29a, 35a.  \nThe activities prong does not offer any \u201cbenefit\u201d for \nRespondents to accept, in exchange for their \npurported consent.  And in any event, Respondents \n\n12 \nhave not taken non-UN actions in the United States \nthat could trigger that prong in the first place.   \nThe Government\u2019s new \u201cexchange of undertakings\u201d \nrationale for the PSJVTA (Gov\u2019t Br. 20) does not solve \nthis problem.  The only \u201cbenefit\u201d offered to \nRespondents is the \u201cbenefit of avoiding jurisdiction in \nATA suits.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 41 (emphasis added).  This is \nentirely circular, and contrary to Bauxites, and would \nsupport consent jurisdiction in every instance where \nCongress purports to impose jurisdiction.   \n2. Petitioners\u2019 amorphous new warning-plus-nexus \ntest for consent jurisdiction supplants traditional \nminimum contacts on the one hand, and the \nBauxites/Mallory framework for deemed consent on \nthe other, yet provides no meaningful guardrails in \ntheir place.  See Pet. App. 35a-38a & n.13.  The test \nproposed by Petitioners is entirely ad hoc in both its \nformulation and application, see Gov\u2019t Br. 34-38, and \nprovides no prospective guidance on a dependable \nrule, or any limiting principle.  The grab-bag list of \nfactors advocated by the Government under its \n\u201cflexible\u201d approach to due process offers no general, \neven-handed rule for this Court to divine.  See ibid.   \nThe Court has already rejected the same \u201cnotice\u201d \nformulation of consent that Petitioners advance now, \nsee College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 679-80, and for \ngood reason.  Petitioners effectively ask whether \nCongress can impose jurisdiction on Respondents, \nwhen the actual text of the PSJVTA asks if \nRespondents can be deemed to have consented to \njurisdiction.  Implied consent \u201ccannot be based solely \non a government decree\u201d that the defendant \u201cconsents\u201d \nby engaging in \u201cactivities unrelated to being sued in \nthe forum.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  Otherwise, if \u201cnotice\u201d alone \ncould serve as a valid basis for implying consent to \njurisdiction, there is no end to the types of activities \n\n13 \nthat could give rise to \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.   \nTo avoid that critique, Petitioners advocate a sea \nchange in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional due process, \ncontending that due process limits under the \nFourteenth Amendment have no application here.  \nBut as Mallory explained, distinctions \u201csounding in \nfederalism\u201d\u2014often \nurged \nas \nthe \nchief \nfactor \ndistinguishing due process under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendment\u2014play no role in analyzing \nthe constitutionality of a consent statute, as the \nPSJVTA purports to be.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144 \n(plurality op.); see also id. at 156 (Alito, J., concurring \nin part).  Moreover, no court has ever agreed that the \nFifth Amendment requires only a generic \u201cfairness\u201d \ntest uninformed by this Court\u2019s prior limitations on \npersonal jurisdiction.   \n3. The decision below is also faithful to the original \npublic understanding of the Fifth Amendment.  \nFounding-era sources indicate that due process \nlimited the extraterritorial reach of the federal courts.  \nEarly cases further demonstrate that due-process \nlimits on discriminatory legislation were seen as \nessential to protecting individual liberty.  These \nhistorical \nlimits \nwork \nagainst \nthe \nPSJVTA: \nRespondents\u2019 alleged UN activities are not considered \nto be within the territorial authority of the United \nStates; and the PSJVTA singles out Respondents to \nreceive less jurisdictional due process. \nPlaintiffs rely on the enumerated power to \u201cdefine \nand punish\u201d extraterritorial offenses (Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl.10).  \nThat clause does not apply here.  In any case, Bauxites \nand College Savings hold that jurisdiction cannot be \nimposed as \u201cpunishment\u201d or a \u201csanction\u201d for a \ndefendant\u2019s disfavored conduct.  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n706 (discussing Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897)); \n\n14 \nCollege Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 686-87.  Nor does \nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory fit under Mallory, which instead \nrequired the forum\u2019s power to permit conduct on \ncondition and treated acceptance of permission as a \nwaiver.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144-45 (\u201cpersonal \njurisdiction is a personal defense that may be waived \nor forfeited\u201d by \u201caccepting an in-state benefit with \njurisdictional strings attached\u201d) (plurality op.); id. at \n147-48 (waiver occurs when \u201ca defendant \u2026 \nvoluntarily invoke[s] certain benefits from a State \nthat are conditioned on submitting to the State\u2019s \njurisdiction\u201d) (Jackson, J., concurring).  The PSJVTA \nincludes no such permission.  \n4. This Court may also affirm on the alternative \nground that the PSJVTA violates the separation-of-\npowers doctrine.  The PSJVTA attempts to usurp the \njudicial function by dictating that courts must always \nfind \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction if Respondents \nengage in certain activities.  In our system, courts \ndetermine whether conduct satisfies the due process \ntest for submission to jurisdiction, and courts have \nalready \nheld \nthat \nthose \nsame \nactivities \nare \ninsufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nunder the Due Process Clause. \n5.  Finally, Plaintiffs misstate the factual record \nregarding Respondents\u2019 alleged activities in the \nUnited States.  No court has concluded that \nRespondents\u2019 activities were sufficient to trigger \njurisdiction under the activities prong.  And \nRespondents have consistently contested Plaintiffs\u2019 \nallegations that they engaged in any non-UN related \nactivities in the United States after the trigger date.   \n\n15 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nThe Act\u2019s \u201cDeemed Consent\u201d Provisions \nViolate Due Process. \n\u201cThe Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s \nliberty interest in not being subject to the binding \njudgments of a forum with which he has established \nno meaningful \u2018contacts, ties, or relations.\u2019\u201d  Burger \nKing Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 471-72 (1985) \n(quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n319 (1945)).  Because the \u201cassertion of jurisdiction\u201d \nover a foreign defendant \u201cexposes [the defendant] to \nthe State\u2019s coercive power,\u201d it is subject to review in \nfederal court for \u201ccompatibility\u201d with due process.  \nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 \nU.S. 915, 918 (2011) (holding assertion of personal \njurisdiction over foreign corporations violated due \nprocess).  The personal jurisdiction requirement \n\u201crepresents a restriction on judicial power not as a \nmatter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual \nliberty.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 702. \nThis Court\u2019s cases have typically focused on \u201ctwo \nkinds of personal jurisdiction: general (sometimes \ncalled \nall-purpose) \njurisdiction \nand \nspecific \n(sometimes called case-linked) jurisdiction.\u201d  Ford \nMotor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 592 \nU.S. 351, 358, 365 (2021).  General jurisdiction \n\u201cextends to \u2018any and all claims\u2019 brought against a \ndefendant,\u201d but is available \u201conly when a defendant is \n\u2018essentially at home\u2019\u201d in the forum.  Ibid.  Specific \njurisdiction \n\u201ccovers \ndefendants \nless \nintimately \nconnected\u201d to the forum, \u201cbut only as to a narrower \nclass of claims.\u201d  Id. at 359.  Specific jurisdiction \napplies when the defendant \u201ctake[s] some act by \nwhich it purposefully avails itself of the privilege of \nconducting activities within the forum,\u201d and the \n\n16 \nplaintiff\u2019s claims \u201carise out of or relate to the \ndefendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d  Ibid. (cleaned \nup). \nThis case, however, does not involve either of those \ntraditional forms of personal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. \n18a.  Respondents are not subject to general \njurisdiction, because they are not \u201cfairly regarded as \nat home\u201d in the United States.  See Livnat, 851 F.3d \nat 56-57 (explaining Respondents\u2019 \u201cheadquarters, \nofficials, and primary activities are all in the West \nBank\u201d).  And Respondents are not subject to specific \njurisdiction, because they have not engaged in any \n\u201csuit-related conduct\u201d in the United States.  Pet. App. \n166a; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56-57; Shatsky, 955 F.3d at \n1037.  Contrary to the assertions of some amici,4 it is \nundisputed the attacks at issue \u201cwere not expressly \naimed at the United States,\u201d but rather \u201caffected \nUnited States citizens only because they were victims \nof indiscriminate violence that occurred abroad.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 168a, 170a; see also Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1124-\n26; Pet. App. 7a-9a.  Indeed, Petitioners do not argue \nthat Respondents are subject to either general or \nspecific jurisdiction in this case.5\n4 See, e.g., ACLJ Br. 8 (claiming \u201cthe crucial fact supporting \njurisdiction\u201d is \u201c[Respondents\u2019] ongoing funding of terrorist \nactivity towards the United States\u201d); id. at 17 (inaccurately \nasserting Respondents engaged in \u201ctargeted support of the \nkilling of Americans\u201d); House Br. 8 (claiming Congress intended \nto hold Respondents \u201caccountable \u2026 for their attacks on \nAmericans\u201d). \n5  In Fuld, plaintiffs did not allege that Respondents had \nsufficient contacts with the United States to support the exercise \nof general or specific jurisdiction.  JA 384-85 (identifying the \nPSJVTA as sole basis for personal jurisdiction); Pet. App. 12a-\n13a, 18a-19a.  The Fuld plaintiffs also did not challenge the \ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion that the complaint failed to sufficiently \n\n17 \nInstead, Petitioners rely on a third traditional \nbasis for establishing personal jurisdiction: consent.  \nLatching onto the \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions of the \nPSJVTA, \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nRespondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction by engaging in \nprecisely the same types of activities previously held \ninsufficient to support the exercise of general or \nspecific jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.  \nPetitioners make this claim despite the fact that \nRespondents have contested jurisdiction at every turn, \nand have not taken any action that would reasonably \nsupport a presumption they have submitted to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States.  As every \ncourt to consider the issue has concluded, allowing \nCongress to impose \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction in such \ncircumstances would \u201cpush the concept of consent well \nbeyond its breaking point,\u201d letting \u201cfiction get the \nbetter of fact and mak[ing] a mockery of the Due \nProcess Clause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a-24a. \nA. Implied Consent Must Be Based on Some \nActions of the Defendant that \u201cAmount \nto a Legal Submission to the Jurisdiction \nof the Court.\u201d \nAs this Court recently reaffirmed in Mallory, \n\u201c\u2018express or implied consent\u2019 can continue to ground \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014and consent may be manifested \nin various ways by word or deed.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. \nat 138 (plurality op.); see also id. at 153 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201cConsent is a separate basis for \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d).  \u201cBecause the requirement of \npersonal jurisdiction represents first of all an \nallege the attack targeted Americans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4.  The \nSokolow plaintiffs do not now challenge the Second Circuit\u2019s \nholding that they likewise failed to establish general or specific \njurisdiction.  Pet. App. 157a-80a.   \n\n18 \nindividual right, it can, like other such rights, be \nwaived.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 703.  And in \ndetermining whether a statute gives rise to valid \nconsent to personal jurisdiction, Mallory confirmed \nthat this Court\u2019s prior decision in Bauxites sets forth \nthe appropriate standard.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n138, 145-46 (plurality op.); see also id. at 147-49 \n(Jackson, \nJ., \nconcurring) \n(finding \nBauxites\n\u201cparticularly instructive\u201d); id. at 153, 156 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (citing Bauxites); id. at 167 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (same). \nBauxites establishes two basic principles that \nguide the consent inquiry\u2014the second of which \nPetitioners \nlargely \nignore. \n \nFirst, \nBauxites\nacknowledged that there is no \u201cmagic words\u201d \nrequirement for consent to personal jurisdiction.  See \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 136 n.5.  \u201cA variety of legal \narrangements have been taken to represent express \nor implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the \ncourt,\u201d \nincluding \nsubmission \nby \nappearance, \nstipulation, forum-selection clauses, and \u201cconstructive \nconsent\u201d through \u201cthe voluntary use of certain state \nprocedures.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 703-04.  Each of \nthese \u201clegal arrangements,\u201d the Court explained, may \nresult in an effective waiver of the personal-\njurisdiction requirement, because the defendant has \ntaken some actions that \u201camount to a legal submission \nto the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Id. at 704-05. \nIn many cases, determining whether a defendant\u2019s \nactions \u201camount to a legal submission to the \njurisdiction of the court\u201d is straightforward.  A party \nmay expressly agree\u2014through a forum-selection \nclause, for example\u2014to litigate a dispute in a \nparticular forum.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. \nv. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311, 315-16 (1964) (\u201cparties to a \n\n19 \ncontract may agree in advance to submit to the \njurisdiction of a given court\u201d).  So long as the party\u2019s \nconsent was \u201cfreely negotiated\u201d and enforcement \nwould not be \u201cunreasonable and unjust,\u201d such \nprovisions \u201c[do] not offend due process.\u201d  Burger King, \n471 U.S. at 472 n.14 (internal quotations omitted). \nA party may also consent to personal jurisdiction \nby taking certain actions in the litigation itself, which \ndemonstrate the party\u2019s submission to the jurisdiction \nof the court.  This Court has held, for example, that a \nparty who \u201cvoluntarily participated in the entire \ncourse \nof \nproceedings\u201d \nwithout \nobjecting \nto \njurisdiction \n\u201cclearly \nimplied \n[its] \nconsent\u201d \nto \njurisdiction through its own conduct.  Roell v. \nWithrow, 538 U.S. 580, 584 (2003).  Similarly, the \nFederal Rules have long provided that a party submits \nto personal jurisdiction by filing a responsive \npleading, without objecting to personal jurisdiction.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h); see also Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n705 (explaining that \u201c[t]he expression of legal rights is \noften subject to certain procedural rules,\u201d and \n\u201cfail[ing] to follow those rules may well result in a \ncurtailment of the rights\u201d). \nThese canonical forms of consent are not at issue \nin this case, however, because Respondents have not \nexpressly consented to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States, or taken any action in the litigation \nitself demonstrating their submission to jurisdiction.6\nAnd in the absence of such conduct, determining \nwhether \na \ndefendant \nsubmitted \nto \npersonal \n6  To the contrary, Respondents have long maintained (in \nSokolow, for more than a decade) that they are not subject to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States, and moved to dismiss \nPetitioners\u2019 claims on that basis.  Sokolow C.A. Defs. Br. 14 (Nov. \n10, 2015) (describing history); Fuld C.A. Defs. Br. 29 (same). \n\n20 \njurisdiction is more difficult.  See Wellness Int\u2019l \nNetwork, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, 685-86 (2015) \n(explaining implied consent requires \u201ca deeply \nfactbound analysis\u201d to determine \u201cwhether [the \ndefendant\u2019s] actions evinced the requisite knowing \nand voluntary consent\u201d). \nSecond, in determining whether the defendant\u2019s \nconduct \u201camount[ed] to a legal submission to the \njurisdiction \nof \nthe \ncourt,\u201d \nBauxites \nexpressly \ndistinguished between conduct capable of supporting \na jurisdictional finding, and \u201c\u2018mere assertions\u2019 of \npower\u201d by the forum to impose jurisdiction on \nnonconsenting defendants.  456 U.S. at 704-05.   \nThe question in Bauxites was whether the \ndefendant\u2019s failure to comply with court-ordered \njurisdictional discovery could be treated as a \nconstructive waiver of its objection to personal \njurisdiction.  This Court held that it could, but only \nbecause \u201c[t]he preservation of due process was secured \nby the presumption\u201d that the defendant\u2019s specific \nconduct\u2014its \u201crefusal to produce evidence material to\u201d \nthe jurisdictional inquiry\u2014\u201cwas but an admission of \nthe want of merit in the asserted defense.\u201d  Id. at 705, \n709 (emphasis added; internal quotations omitted).  \nBy refusing to produce the requested jurisdictional \ndiscovery, the defendant implicitly acknowledged that \nit did have sufficient contacts with the forum to \nsupport the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Id. at \n706.  The Court thus held that it was fair to treat the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct as a constructive waiver of any \nobjection.  See ibid. (\u201c[T]he sanction is nothing more \nthan the invocation of a legal presumption, or what is \nthe same thing, the finding of a constructive waiver.\u201d). \nTo illustrate the \u201cdue process limits\u201d that apply to \nimplied consent, Bauxites distinguished an earlier \n\n21 \ncase\u2014Hovey, 167 U.S. 409\u2014in which this Court held \nthat \u201cit did violate due process for a court to take \nsimilar action as \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure to obey a \ncourt order\u201d unrelated to the asserted defense.  456 \nU.S. at 706 (emphasis added).  The defendant\u2019s \nconduct in that case\u2014failure \u201cto pay into the registry \nof the court a certain sum of money\u201d\u2014did not support \nthe presumption of a \u201cwant of merit\u201d in the asserted \ndefense.  Id. at 705-06.  Subjecting the defendant to \nthe \ncourt\u2019s \njurisdiction, \nthis \nCourt \nexplained, \ntherefore would constitute an improper penalty, \nrather than a valid presumption of constructive \nwaiver drawn from the defendant\u2019s own conduct.  Id.\nat 706. \nPetitioners ignore this central aspect of Bauxites\u2019 \nreasoning, \ndescribing \nthe \nopinion \nas \nmerely \n\u201ccanvassing factors that made consent \u2018just\u2019 and \nsatisfied due process.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 25; see also Pls. Br. \n36-39.  But Bauxites could not have been clearer in \nspecifying the reason it was fair to infer that the \ndefendant consented to personal jurisdiction: \u201c[T]he \npreservation of due process was secured by the \npresumption that the refusal to produce evidence \nmaterial to the administration of due process was but \nan admission of the want of merit in the asserted \ndefense.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 705 (quoting \nHammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, \n350-51 (1909)).  The fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct \nwas material to jurisdiction, in other words, was \nprecisely what distinguished a permissible inference \nof consent from an improper penalty. \nThe same distinction between valid, implied \nconsent and the improper imposition of jurisdiction \nruns throughout this Court\u2019s cases addressing the \nwaiver of jurisdictional defenses.  In College Savings \n\n22 \nBank, for example, plaintiffs argued that a state \nagency \nwaived \nits \nimmunity \nand \n\u201cimpliedly\u201d \nconsented to jurisdiction in federal court by knowingly \nand voluntarily engaging in interstate marketing, \nafter a federal statute made clear that such activity \nwould subject it to jurisdiction for Lanham Act claims.  \n527 U.S. at 671, 676.  This Court emphatically \nrejected this \u201cconstructive-waiver\u201d theory, holding: \nThere is a fundamental difference between a \nState\u2019s expressing unequivocally that it waives \nits immunity, and Congress\u2019s expressing \nunequivocally its intention that if the State \ntakes certain action it shall be deemed to have \nwaived that immunity.  In the latter situation, \nthe most that can be said with certainty is that \nthe State has been put on notice that Congress \nintends to subject it to suits brought by \nindividuals.  That is very far from concluding \nthat the State made an \u201caltogether voluntary\u201d \ndecision to waive its immunity. \nId. at 680-81.  The constitutional requirement of \nknowing and voluntary consent would mean nothing, \nthe Court explained, if Congress had \u201c[the] power to \nexact constructive waivers\u201d of jurisdictional defenses \n\u201cthrough the exercise of Article I powers.\u201d  Id. at 683.  \nAccordingly, this Court held that merely providing \nnotice of Congress\u2019s intent to subject the defendant to \njurisdiction if it \u201cvoluntarily\u201d engaged in \u201cfederally \nregulated conduct\u201d was insufficient to establish a \nconstructive waiver.  Id. at 679-82. \nIn describing the circumstances in which plaintiffs \ncould demonstrate implied consent to jurisdiction, \nCollege Savings Bank located valid \u201cconsent\u201d in the \nsame place as many other implied consent statutes: \nthe defendant\u2019s acceptance of a government benefit or \n\n23 \nprivilege conditioned upon consent to jurisdiction.  As \nthe Court explained, Congress may \u201ccondition its \ngrant of [federal] funds to the States\u201d upon their \nwillingness to consent to jurisdiction in a federal \nforum.  Id. at 686-87.  The \u201cacceptance of the funds\u201d \nby the State would thereby signal its \u201cagreement\u201d or \nconsent to the condition attached.  Ibid.  The Court \nnoted, however, that accepting a \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cgratuity\u201d \nconditioned on consent to jurisdiction presents a \n\u201cfundamentally different\u201d case than the imposition of \njurisdiction by legislative fiat.  Ibid.  In the latter case, \n\u201cwhat Congress threatens if the State refuses to agree \nto its condition is not the denial of a gift or gratuity, \nbut a sanction.\u201d7 Ibid.\nThis Court has used the same barometer to \nevaluate other implied consent statutes as well, \nexamining whether the defendant signaled its \nagreement to personal jurisdiction by accepting a \ngovernment benefit or privilege with \u201cjurisdictional \n7 Petitioners criticize Respondents\u2019 (and the Second Circuit\u2019s) \nreliance on College Savings Bank, arguing that decision \naddresses state sovereign immunity rather than personal \njurisdiction.  Pls. Br. 41-42; Gov\u2019t Br. 39-40.  This Court\u2019s \ndecision, however, refutes that reading.  Relying on the \u201cclassic \ndescription of an effective waiver of a constitutional right,\u201d the \nCourt explained that \u201c[c]onstructive consent is not a doctrine \ncommonly associated with the surrender of constitutional rights.\u201d  \nCollege Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 681-82 (emphasis added).  \nBecause \u201c[s]tate sovereign immunity, no less than the right to \ntrial by jury in criminal cases, is constitutionally protected,\u201d \ncourts should \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 682.  Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertions, the \nprinciples underlying College Savings Bank are not limited to \nstate sovereign immunity, but rather apply more broadly to \nimplied waivers of constitutional protections. \n\n24 \nstrings attached.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (citing \nBauxites). \nMany states, for example, have enacted statutes \nconditioning the \u201cprivilege\u201d of driving on public roads \non consent to personal jurisdiction in the state.  In \nHess v. Pawloski, this Court held that such \u201cimplied \nconsent\u201d statutes do not violate due process because \nthe state maintains the antecedent authority \u201cto \nregulate the use of its highways,\u201d and \u201cto exclude a \nnon resident\u201d from that use unless they consent to \njurisdiction in the state.  274 U.S. 352, 356-57 (1927).  \nBy \u201caccept[ing]\u201d the \u201cprivileges\u201d of driving on public \nroads, a non-resident defendant \u201csignifi[es] \u2026 his \nagreement\u201d to consent to personal jurisdiction in the \nforum.  Id. at 354-57; see also Wuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 \nU.S. 13, 19 (1928) (\u201c[T]he act of a non resident in using \nthe highways of another state may be properly \ndeclared to be an agreement to accept service of \nsummons in a suit growing out of the use of the \nhighway\u2026\u201d). \nThis Court applied a similar analysis to the \nbusiness registration statute at issue in Mallory.  The \nstatutory scheme in that case required foreign \ncorporations to consent to personal jurisdiction \u201cin \nexchange for status as a registered foreign corporation \nand the benefits that entails.\u201d  600 U.S. at 127 \n(emphasis added).  In affirming the constitutionality \nof such implied-consent statutes, this Court explained \nthat a defendant may submit to jurisdiction by \n\u201caccepting an in-state benefit with jurisdictional \nstrings attached.\u201d  Id. at 145 (plurality op.) (citing \nBauxites).  \u201c[A] variety of legal arrangements may \nrepresent express or implied consent to personal \njurisdiction consistent with due process, and these \narrangements can include requiring at least some \n\n25 \ncompanies to consent to suit in exchange for access to \na State\u2019s markets.\u201d  Id. at 144 n.10 (emphasis added; \ncleaned up); see also id. at 147-48 (Jackson, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that \u201cone way to waive \npersonal-jurisdiction rights\u201d is to \u201cvoluntarily invoke \ncertain benefits from a State that are conditioned on \nsubmitting to the State\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d); id. at 167 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (noting the majority\u2019s \nstandard \u201ccasts [business registration statutes] as \nsetting the terms of a bargain\u201d).8\nIn addition to business registration and driver \nregistration statutes, many states have also adopted \ncorporate director statutes, which similarly \u201cdeem\u201d \nthat non-resident defendants \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction \nin the forum by accepting appointment to a \ncorporation\u2019s board of directors.  See, e.g., Armstrong \nv. Pomerance, 423 A.2d 174, 176 & n.4 (Del. 1980) \n(analyzing Delaware corporate director statute).  By \naccepting the benefits afforded to directors under \nstate law, a non-resident director impliedly consents \nto personal jurisdiction in the state for any claims \n8  As Justice Gorsuch explained, these types of exchange-of-\nbenefits statutes have a long history.  \u201cAs the use of the corporate \nform proliferated in the 19th century,\u201d \u201c[l]awmakers across the \ncountry soon responded\u201d by \u201cadopt[ing] statutes requiring out-of-\nstate corporations to consent to in-state suits in exchange for the \nrights to exploit the local market and to receive the full range of \nbenefits enjoyed by in-state corporations.\u201d  600 U.S. at 129-30 \n(emphasis added).  The statute at issue in Pennsylvania Fire Ins. \nCo. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. \n93 (1917), for example, required foreign corporations to \u201cagree[] \nto accept service of process in Missouri on any suit as a condition \nof doing business there.\u201d  Id. at 133.  Conversely, Respondents \nare not aware of any history (and Petitioners cite none) \npermitting a legislature to simply \u201cdeem\u201d that foreign defendants \n\u201chave consented\u201d to suit, in the absence of any benefit or privilege \nconditioned on consent. \n\n26 \nrelated to the corporation.  Ibid.; see also Swenson v. \nThibaut, 250 S.E.2d 279, 289-91 (N.C. Ct. App. 1978) \n(same). \nIn each of these cases, the defendant\u2019s acceptance \nof a benefit or privilege conditioned by the forum on \nconsent to jurisdiction signals the defendant\u2019s implied \nagreement to submit to jurisdiction\u2014just as a state\u2019s \nacceptance of a conditional \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cgratuity\u201d from \nthe federal government would signal its implied \nwaiver of sovereign immunity under College Savings \nBank.  By accepting the benefit provided by the forum, \nthe defendant enters a bargain whereby it consents to \npersonal jurisdiction in exchange for permission to \nengage in conduct the forum could otherwise prohibit.  \nIndeed, the exchange of \u201creciprocal obligations\u201d is \nexactly what makes the exercise of personal \njurisdiction \u201cfair\u201d to a defendant under the Due \nProcess Clause.  Ford, 592 U.S. at 367-68 (explaining \nthat \u201callowing jurisdiction in these cases treats Ford \nfairly\u201d because Ford enjoyed \u201cthe benefits and \nprotections\u201d of state law when doing business in the \nforum). \nAs this Court has recognized, however, implied \nconsent becomes a disguised form of legislatively-\nimposed jurisdiction when the forum does not offer \nany corresponding benefit for the defendant to accept \nor reject, in exchange for its consent to jurisdiction.  If \nthe forum does not have the antecedent authority to \npermit (or to prohibit) the conduct purportedly giving \nrise to \u201cconsent,\u201d the defendant\u2019s choice to engage in \nsuch conduct does not reflect any implied agreement \nto submit to jurisdiction, because the defendant\u2019s \nability to engage in the activity did not depend on any \nbenefit conferred by the forum in the first instance.  \nSee College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 680-81 (holding \n\n27 \nCongress\u2019s bare \u201cintention\u201d to subject defendant to \njurisdiction failed to establish implied consent \nbecause \u201cthere is little reason to assume actual \nconsent based upon the [defendant\u2019s] mere presence \nin a field subject to congressional regulation\u201d). \nThis does not mean that reciprocity or an exchange \nof benefits is necessary to establish implied consent in \nevery case.9  As this Court reaffirmed in Mallory, a \n\u201cvariety of legal arrangements\u201d may give rise to valid \nconsent, and statutes conditioning a government \nbenefit on consent to jurisdiction in the forum are \nmerely one, commonly-accepted example.  See 600 \nU.S. at 144 & n.10; see also id. at 147-49 (Jackson, J., \nconcurring).  A defendant can also consent to personal \njurisdiction by appearing in court without objecting, \nvoluntarily agreeing to a forum-selection clause, \nviolating a jurisdictional discovery order, or engaging \nin any other conduct that \u201camount[s] to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 704-05.  But nothing in this Court\u2019s cases \nsuggests (as Petitioners claim) that the forum can \nsimply \u201cdeem\u201d that any conduct it chooses shall \nconstitute \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction, when the \n9 Petitioners repeatedly mischaracterize the decision below as \nholding that implied consent must \u201cbe based on \u2018reciprocal \nbargains\u2019 between the forum\u2019s sovereign and the defendant,\u201d or \nis limited to \u201creciprocal bargain[s]\u201d and \u201clitigation-related \nconduct.\u201d  Pls. Br. 5, 12, 37-38; see also Gov\u2019t Br. 15, 20.  But the \nSecond Circuit itself refuted any such suggestion, explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he receipt of a benefit from the forum is not a necessary \nprerequisite to a finding that a defendant has consented to \npersonal jurisdiction,\u201d but rather is simply one commonly-\naccepted mechanism that \u201ccan suffice under the circumstances to \n\u2018signal consent to jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 35a-36a n.13 \n(emphasis added). \n\n28 \nconduct itself does not support the presumption that \nthe defendant submitted to jurisdiction in the forum. \nB.\nRespondents Have Not Engaged in Any \nConduct Signaling Consent to Personal \nJurisdiction in the United States. \nMeasured against these standards, the PSJVTA \nfails \nto \nestablish \nvalid \nconsent \nto \npersonal \njurisdiction.  As the Second Circuit recognized, \nneither form of conduct relied upon by Petitioners\u2014\nmaking social welfare payments in Palestine or \nmaintaining a UN office and conducting UN-related \nactivities in the United States\u2014signals Respondents\u2019 \napproval or acceptance of personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States.  As to the payments, that is because \nthe United States does not have antecedent authority \nto permit them in the first place.  As to UN-related \nactivities, they are specifically exempted from the \nPSJVTA.  The PSJVTA does not waive preexisting \nrestrictions on Respondents\u2019 U.S. activity and does \nnot permit any U.S. activity by Respondents.  \nAccordingly, neither type of predicate conduct alleged \nby Plaintiffs provides a valid basis for \u201cdeeming\u201d that \nRespondents have \u201cconsented\u201d to jurisdiction under \nthe standards set forth in Bauxites and Mallory.  \n1. Social Welfare Payments Made Outside \nthe United States Do Not Support the \nPresumption \nthat \nRespondents \nSubmitted to Jurisdiction. \nThe first type of conduct specified by the \nPSJVTA\u2014payments made in Palestine to those \nimprisoned or killed as a result of committing attacks, \nor to their families\u2014has \u201cno direct connection to the \nUnited States, let alone to litigation in a United States \ncourt.\u201d  Pet. App. 108a.  The payments at issue \n\n29 \noccurred entirely outside the United States, under \nPalestinian law, were not within the power of the U.S. \ngovernment to permit, and were not directed at the \nUnited States.  Any decision to make (or stop making) \nsuch payments therefore reflects Respondents\u2019 own \ndomestic laws and policy choices,10 rather than some \nimplicit agreement to consent to jurisdiction in the \nUnited States. \nInferring consent to personal jurisdiction based on \nsuch payments would be doubly immaterial to \njurisdiction in this case, because courts have \nconsistently held that the same payments are \ninsufficient to establish the requisite \u201cconnection\u201d \nbetween Respondents, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the \nUnited States to support the exercise of personal \njurisdiction.  See, e.g., Shatsky, 955 F.3d at 1022-23, \n1037 (holding alleged \u201cmartyr payments\u201d did not \nconfer specific jurisdiction).  As the Second Circuit \nrecognized, continuing to engage in the same, \nconstitutionally-insufficient \nconduct \n\u201ccannot \nreasonably be interpreted as signaling the defendants\u2019 \n\u2018intention to submit\u2019 to the authority of the United \nStates courts.\u201d  Pet. App. 26a.  \u201cRather, such activities \nallegedly constitute \u2018consent\u2019 under the PSJVTA only \nbecause Congress has labeled them that way.\u201d  Ibid.\n\u201cThis declaration of purported consent, predicated on \nconduct lacking any of the indicia of valid consent \npreviously recognized in the case law, fails to satisfy \nconstitutional due process.\u201d  Ibid.\nIn asserting that such payments may serve as a \nvalid basis for implied consent to jurisdiction, \n10 As explained below, Respondents no longer make payments \nbecause a person, or a family member, was killed or imprisoned \nin connection with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\n30 \nPetitioners repeatedly conflate federal authority to \npunish \nextraterritorial \nconduct \n(so-called \n\u201cprescriptive\u201d or \u201clegislative\u201d jurisdiction) and federal \nauthority to subject nonresident defendants to \npersonal \njurisdiction in \nU.S. \ncourts \n(so-called \n\u201cadjudicative\u201d jurisdiction).  Although Congress may \nlegislate that making such payments will subject a \nparty to potential liability,\n11  that prescriptive \nauthority does not answer the separate constitutional \nquestion whether Respondents can be forced to \nsubmit to adjudication of such claims in U.S. courts. \nPersonal jurisdiction \u201cis an important limitation \non the jurisdiction of the federal courts over purely \nextraterritorial activity that is independent of the \nextraterritorial reach of a federal statute or the court\u2019s \nsubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d  Litecubes, LLC v. N. \nLight Prods., 523 F.3d 1353, 1363 & n.10 (Fed. Cir. \n2008) (emphasis added).  Although Congress can \n\u201cextend[] a cause of action to reach extraterritorial \nactivity,\u201d it is well-established that a federal court can \nadjudicate such claims only if it \u201chas personal \njurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d  Id. at 1363.  In \nother words, Congress\u2019s \u201cprescriptive jurisdiction\u201d\u2014\nits authority to make federal law applicable to foreign \nconduct\u2014\u201cis activated only when there is personal \njurisdiction, often referred to as \u2018jurisdiction to \nadjudicate.\u2019\u201d  Laker Airways v. Sabena, Belgian World \nAirlines, 731 F.2d 909, 923 (D.C. Cir. 1984). \nAccordingly, even if Congress maintains the \nprescriptive authority to impose civil liability under \nU.S. law for extraterritorial payments, that authority \n11 Plaintiffs seek to justify jurisdiction to adjudicate by over-\nreading the Offenses Clause.  Respondents address this issue in \nSection III.C.   \n\n31 \ndoes not answer the separate question whether \nRespondents are subject to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States for claims related to such payments.  \nSee Pet. App. 180a (holding federal statute providing \nfor jurisdiction through service of process in ATA \ncases \u201cdoes not answer the constitutional question of \nwhether due process is satisfied\u201d).  Congress may \nobject to the payments as a matter of federal policy, \nand impose a variety of sanctions (e.g., ATA liability \nand conditions on foreign aid to Palestine) to \ndiscourage such payments.  But those policy concerns, \nstanding \nalone, \ndo \nnot \nsomehow \ntransform \nconstitutionally-insufficient conduct overseas into \ngrounds for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States.  The same limitation applies to \nall extraterritorial statutes, whether the punishment \nis direct (as in the Alien Tort Statute or Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act) or collateral (as in the \nPSJVTA).  \nPetitioners also misleadingly suggest that the \npayments were closely linked to the United States \nbecause they were made \u201cfor terror attacks against \nAmericans.\u201d  See, e.g., Pls. Br. 3.  That assertion \noverlooks the courts\u2019 consistent holdings that the \nattacks at issue (and a fortiori any payments \npurportedly following from such attacks) did not\ntarget the United States, and \u201caffected United States \ncitizens \nonly \nbecause \nthey \nwere \nvictims \nof \nindiscriminate violence that occurred abroad.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 168a. \nImportantly, in February 2025 Respondents \nformally revoked the old payments program, so that \npayments will now use need-based qualifications that \n\u201capply to all families in need of assistance in \n\n32 \nPalestinian society.\u201d12  The EU already has lauded \nthis \u201cimportant step\u201d of \u201crestructuring the social \nwelfare system and revoking the \u2018prisoners and \nmartyrs\u2019 payment\u2019 mechanism.\u201d13\nTo be clear, however, the old program was \nintended to provide a \u201csocial safety net in the face of \nbrutal and oppressive living conditions under Israeli \nmilitary occupation.\u201d  See Carnegie Endowment for \nInt\u2019l Peace, Palestinian Prisoner Payments (2021).14\nThe PA provided monthly welfare payments to \nPalestinians imprisoned in Israel for political crimes \nand security offenses, to their families, and to the \nfamilies of Palestinians killed during political \nviolence.

Respondents\u2019 Alleged U.S. Activities \nFail to Establish Implied Consent to \nPersonal Jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations under the \u201cactivities\u201d prong \nof the PSJVTA likewise fail to establish a valid basis \nfor inferring that Respondents consented to personal \njurisdiction, for two reasons: (1) Respondents\u2019 alleged \nU.S. activities do not support the presumption that \nthey have submitted to jurisdiction in the United \nStates, as courts have previously held the same \nconduct insufficient to support the exercise of personal \njurisdiction; \nand \n(2) \ncontrary \nto \nPetitioners\u2019 \nassertions, the PSJVTA does not offer any \u201cbenefit\u201d \nfor Respondents to \u201caccept,\u201d in exchange for their \npurported consent.   \nThe activities prong directs courts to \u201cdeem[]\u201d that \nRespondents \u201chave consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d \nif they maintain any office or conduct \u201cany activity\nwhile physically present in the United States\u201d\u2014\nregardless of whether that activity would support a \npresumption \nthat \nRespondents \nsubmitted \nto \njurisdiction in the United States.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(1) \n(emphasis \nadded). \n \nBy \nexpressly \nencompassing \u201cany activity\u201d conducted in the United \nStates (no matter how trivial or jurisdictionally-\ninsignificant), this provision fails to ensure that \nRespondents\u2019 purported \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction is \n\n34 \ngrounded in conduct capable of supporting a \njurisdictional finding as required by Bauxites and \nMallory.   \nThe specific conduct relied upon by Plaintiffs in \nthese cases illustrates this infirmity.  Relying on the \nactivities prong\u2019s broad language, the Fuld plaintiffs \nalleged that Respondents \u201cconsented\u201d to personal \njurisdiction in the United States when their UN \nmission issued a tweet highlighting \u201csurfing in Gaza.\u201d  \nJA 217.  Plaintiffs overlooked the date of the tweet \nand its hashtag, which referenced the UN\u2019s \nInternational Day of Sport for Development and \nPeace.  JA 218.  More importantly, such conduct \nobviously bears no relationship to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, \nthe underlying attacks, or any purported agreement \nto litigate ATA claims in U.S. court.  Sending a \nmessage \npromoting \n\u201csurfing \nin \nGaza\u201d \ncannot \nreasonably be interpreted as signaling Respondents\u2019 \nagreement to submit to jurisdiction in U.S. court for \nclaims related to alleged terrorist attacks in Israel \nand Palestine years (and in some cases, decades) \nearlier. \nThe rest of Plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional claims are \nsimilarly incapable of supporting a presumption of \nconsent to jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs allege that \nRespondents maintained an office (Palestine\u2019s UN \nmission) in New York and engaged in press \nconferences and social media activity \u201cintended to \ninfluence the public\u201d and \u201caffect U.S. foreign policy\u201d \nwhile physically present in the United States.  JA \n409.16\n16 As explained further in Section V, these types of UN-related \nactivities (and \u201cancillary\u201d activities) cannot be considered as \ngrounds for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d under the PSJVTA. \n\n35 \nBut courts confronted with virtually identical (if \nnot more extensive) allegations have consistently held \nthat these types of activities are not material to \njurisdiction, as Bauxites requires.  That is, they do not\nestablish \na \nsufficient \nconnection \nbetween \nRespondents, the claims at issue, and the United \nStates to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nunder the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., Pet. App. \n147a, 161a, 177a-78a (holding maintenance of office in \nWashington, D.C., retention of a lobbying firm, \n\u201cpromot[ing] the Palestinian cause in speeches and \nmedia appearances,\u201d and engaging in \u201cextensive \npublic relations activities\u201d to \u201cinfluence United States \npolicy\u201d were insufficient to establish personal \njurisdiction); Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1118, 1123-26 \n(holding alleged \u201ccampaign\u201d to \u201cinfluence\u201d U.S. \nforeign policy \u201cthrough the use of U.S. offices, \nfundraising, lobbying, [and] speaking engagements\u201d \ninsufficient).  As the Second Circuit recognized, the \ncontinuation of the same conduct previously held \ninsufficient to support the exercise of personal \njurisdiction cannot support a reasonable presumption \nthat, by engaging in such conduct, Respondents \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States. \nRather \nthan \nexplaining \nwhy \nthe \nsame, \nconstitutionally-insufficient conduct could support a \npresumption of submission to jurisdiction under \nBauxites and Mallory, Petitioners instead attempt to \nshoehorn this case into the line of \u201cbenefits\u201d cases \ndescribed above.  Petitioners assert that the U.S. \nActivities \nprong \nextracts \nvalid \n\u201cconsent\u201d \nby \nconditioning a government benefit (entry into the \nUnited States) on Respondents\u2019 purported agreement \nto submit to personal jurisdiction in U.S. courts.  See\nPls. Br. 43-45; Gov\u2019t Br. 27, 40-41.   \n\n36 \nAs the Second Circuit recognized, however, that \nargument fails because the PSJVTA does not \nauthorize Respondents to enter the United States, or \nto conduct any activities here.  Pet. App. 29a.  \u201cIndeed, \nthe statute does not offer any in-forum benefit, right, \nor privilege that the PLO and the PA could \n\u2018voluntarily invoke\u2019 in exchange for their submission \nto the federal courts.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  As the \nGovernment concedes (at 3), for decades \u201cCongress \nhas heavily restricted respondents\u2019 activities on U.S. \nsoil.\u201d  The PSJVTA does nothing to alter or remove \nthose restrictions, or to permit otherwise-prohibited \nactivities in the United States.  Accordingly, unlike \nthe \u201cbenefits\u201d cases described above, the PSJVTA does \nnot offer any government \u201cbenefit\u201d or privilege for \nRespondents to \u201caccept,\u201d in exchange for their \npurported consent to personal jurisdiction. \nThe activities prong\u2019s failure to establish valid, \nimplied consent to jurisdiction on these facts is \nperhaps best illustrated by contrasting the PSJVTA \nwith its predecessor statute, the ATCA.  More than \nthree decades ago, Congress enacted the Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 1987, which prohibits the PLO and \naffiliates from operating in the United States by \nmaking it unlawful to (1) \u201creceive anything of value \nexcept informational material from the PLO;\u201d (2) \n\u201cexpend funds from the PLO\u201d; or (3) \u201cestablish or \nmaintain an office, headquarters, premises, or other \nfacilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of \nthe United States at the behest or direction of, or with \nfunds provided by,\u201d the PLO.17  22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202.   \n17 The sole exception is for activities conducted by Respondents \nin furtherance of Palestine\u2019s role as a Permanent Observer at the \nUnited Nations.  As described below, the PSJVTA mirrors \n\n37 \nCongress passed the 1987 Act for the express \npurpose of denying the PLO and its affiliates the \n\u201cbenefit\u201d of \u201coperating in the United States.\u201d  See 22 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 5201(b).  And, consistent with that purpose, \nthe 1987 Act has been interpreted as a \u201cwide gauged \nrestriction of PLO activity within the United States,\u201d \nPLO, 695 F. Supp. at 1471, that deprives Respondents \nof the \u201cmany benefits which accrue to organizations \noperating in the United States, including political \nstability, \naccess \nto \nour \npress \nand \ncapital \ninfrastructure, and \u2026 the patina of legitimacy.\u201d  \nMendelsohn v. Meese, 695 F. Supp. 1474, 1484 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1988) (\u201cThe avowed interest asserted by \nCongress in favor of the ATA is \u2026 to deny the PLO the \nbenefits of operating in the United States.\u201d).18\nRecognizing those restrictions, the ATCA provided \nthat Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have consented \nto personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted either of two \ngovernment benefits: (1) certain types of U.S. foreign \naid, or (2) the \u201cbenefit\u201d of a formal \u201cwaiver or \nsuspension\u201d of the prohibitions on the PLO\u2019s U.S. \nactivities under the 1987 Act, which would have \nallowed it to maintain a mission in Washington, D.C.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1) (2018) (superseded by \nPSJVTA).   \nIn defending the constitutionality of the ATCA, the \nGovernment specifically argued that because \u201c[t]he \nlongstanding law by providing that a court cannot consider UN \nactivities to determine personal jurisdiction. \n18 Several amici assume Respondents \u201coperate freely on U.S. \nsoil.\u201d  Grassley Br. 4; AFLF Br. 5; ACLJ Br. 5.  Untrue.  \nConsistent with the 1987 Act\u2019s prohibitions, Respondents do not \nmaintain any physical premises in the United States (other than \nPalestine\u2019s UN mission), and do not engage in any non-UN \nrelated activities here.  \n\n38 \npolitical branches have long imposed conditions on \nthese benefits,\u201d it was \u201creasonable and consistent with \nthe Fifth Amendment for Congress and the Executive \nto determine that the [PLO\u2019s] maintenance of an office \nin this country after a waiver \u2026, or the [PA\u2019s] \ncontinued receipt of certain foreign assistance, should \nbe \u2018deemed\u2019 consent to personal jurisdiction in civil \ncases under the ATA.\u201d  U.S. Brief 12-13, Klieman v. \nPalestinian Auth., No. 15-7034 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 13, \n2019) (emphasis added).  The ATCA satisfied Fifth \nAmendment due process, in other words, because it \ngrounded \u201cdeemed consent\u201d on Respondents\u2019 choice to \naccept or reject either of two distinct government \nbenefits \nconditioned \nupon \nconsent. \n \nThis \ninterpretation is consistent with Mallory, Hess, and \nthe other authorities described above, which similarly \nhold that acceptance of a government benefit with \n\u201cjurisdictional string attached\u201d may provide a valid \nbasis for inferring consent to personal jurisdiction.  \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 145.  \nThe PSJVTA, by contrast, does not permit any \nactivity by Respondents.  It does not offer to waive the \nprohibitions imposed by the 1987 Act, nor does it \npermit Respondents to conduct any previously-\nunauthorized activities in the United States.  The \nstatute therefore does not offer any benefit for \nRespondents to accept, in exchange for their \npurported \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction.  \nRather than identifying conduct that might \nactually \ndemonstrate \nRespondents \nimpliedly \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States (such as \nthe acceptance of U.S. foreign aid or some other \ngovernment benefit), \u201cCongress simply took conduct \nin which the PLO and PA had previously engaged\u2014\nconduct that the Second and D.C. Circuits had held \n\n39 \nwas insufficient to support personal jurisdiction in \nWaldman I, Livnat, Shatsky, and Klieman\u2014and \ndeclared that such conduct \u2018shall be deemed\u2019 to be \nconsent.\u201d  Pet. App. 108a.  Because such conduct does \nnot support the presumption that Respondents \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States, it fails \nto provide a valid basis for implied consent under this \nCourt\u2019s precedent. \nII.\nThis Court Should Reject Petitioners\u2019 \nAttempts to Rewrite Established Due \nProcess Standards. \nStripped of the fiction of \u201cconsent,\u201d the PSJVTA\nattempts to impose jurisdiction over Respondents \nbased on the same activities federal courts have \nalready \nheld \ninsufficient \nto \nsupport \npersonal \njurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.  But \ndeemed consent statutes cannot pass constitutional \nmuster merely by providing advance notice of \njurisdictional consequences, as Petitioners propose, \nwithout undermining fundamental due process \nprotections.  Petitioners fail to provide any sound \nreason for this Court to depart from well-established \nprecedent by applying a less demanding due process \nstandard in this case. \nA. Permitting Congress to Impose Consent \nto \nJurisdiction \nbased \non \nConstitutionally-inadequate \nConduct \nWould \nEviscerate \nDue \nProcess \nProtections. \nPetitioners fail to offer any consistent standard or \nlimiting principle for \u201cdeemed consent,\u201d instead \nproposing \nan \nentirely \nad \nhoc \nand \n\u201cflexible\u201d \nformulation.  Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 22, 38, 46.  They concede that \nconsent to personal jurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and \nvoluntary.\u201d  Pls. Br. 40.  But they attempt to redefine \n\n40 \nthat standard, asserting that a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \nstatute satisfies due process if it merely provides \n\u201cnotice\u201d and is \u201cnot fundamentally unfair or \nexorbitant\u201d (the Government\u2019s version, Gov\u2019t Br. 1, 14, \n23), or gives \u201cfair warning\u201d and is \u201creasonable\u201d \n(Plaintiffs\u2019 version, Pls. Br. 24, 26). \nIn advancing these ever-shifting standards, \nPetitioners \u201cblur[] the requirements\u201d for specific \njurisdiction and consent.  Pet. App. 222a (Bianco, J., \nconcurring).  On the one hand, Petitioners contend \nthat \u201cconsent\u201d is a separate basis for personal \njurisdiction and do not argue that requirements for \ngeneral or specific jurisdiction have been met.  E.g., \nPls. Br. 36-37.  On the other hand, to defend the \nPSJVTA as creating valid \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction, \nPetitioners admittedly rely on \u201cnon-consent cases,\u201d see\nGov\u2019t Br. 25, that do not address \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \nstatutes at all.  Importing an interest-balancing test \ninto consent, Petitioners draw their purported \nstandards from cases like Ford and Burger King\u2014\nseminal \u201cminimum contacts\u201d cases.  Gov\u2019t Br. 25-26; \nPls. Br. 40-43.  But those cases squarely hold that \n\u201c[t]he Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s \nliberty interest in not being subject to the binding \njudgments of a forum with which he has established \nno meaningful contacts, ties, or relations.\u201d  Burger \nKing, 471 U.S. at 471-72 (emphasis added).  Of course, \ncourts examining whether personal jurisdiction may \nbe asserted over Respondents under a minimum \ncontacts analysis have resoundingly answered that \nquestion in the negative because Respondents lack \nany constitutionally-meaningful connection to the \nUnited States.  See supra I.B.2. \nPetitioners give no more than lip service to the \nconcept of consent, instead offering a framework \n\n41 \nunder which Congress can legislatively decree\njurisdiction if Respondents do not comply with \nCongress\u2019s demands.  Rather than establishing \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cconsent\u201d as a separate basis for \njurisdiction, \nPetitioners \nadvance \nthe \nsame \nformulation of \u201cconsent\u201d that College Savings Bank\nrejected \nas \nimpermissibly \nimposing \npersonal \njurisdiction by legislative fiat.  Writing for the Court, \nJustice Scalia drew the distinction between consent to \njurisdiction and imposed jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at 679-\n81.  Putting the defendant \u201con notice\u201d of Congress\u2019s\nintention to subject the defendant to suit, the Court \nexplained, remains \u201cvery far\u201d from demonstrating \nthat a defendant \u201cmade an \u2018altogether voluntary\u2019 \ndecision\u201d to submit to jurisdiction.  Id. at 681.  College \nSavings Bank\u2014just like Bauxites and Mallory\u2014\nrequires that a legislative presumption of consent to \njurisdiction must be based on conduct that can \nsupport a presumption of submission to jurisdiction.  \nId. at 675 (\u201caltogether voluntary\u201d consent, or a \n\u201cgratuity); id. at 676 (State must make \u201ca \u2018clear \ndeclaration\u2019 that it intends to submit itself to our \njurisdiction\u201d).  The Court of Appeals here applied the \nCollege Savings Bank framework to conclude that the \nPSJVTA is an attempt to impose jurisdiction\u2014not a \nconsent jurisdiction statute.  Pet. App. 39a-40a \n(applying College Savings Bank).   \nWith no dependable or predictable due process \ntest, Congress and state legislatures could simply \nenact statutes declaring that the same activities \ninsufficient under minimum contacts \u201cshall be \ndeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction.  In theory, \nthe Government agrees it should be impermissible for \na State to \u201ccircumvent constitutional limits on \npersonal jurisdiction by simply declaring nonresident \ndefendants to have consented to suit.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 25.  \n\n42 \nBut under a mere \u201cnotice\u201d and not-\u201cexorbitant\u201d test, \nfor virtually any decision dismissing claims for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, the legislature could simply \nrepackage the same contacts with the forum as \ngrounds for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to jurisdiction.  Under \nDaimler AG v. Bauman, for example, a California \ncourt could not exercise jurisdiction over a foreign car \nmanufacturer \nand \nits \nU.S. \nsubsidiary, \nwhich \ndistributed vehicles to California dealerships, but \nwere incorporated and maintained their principal \nplaces of business elsewhere.  571 U.S. 117, 139 \n(2014).  Under Petitioners\u2019 reasoning, Congress could \ndeclare that any foreign corporation that distributed \nvehicles to California dealerships \u201cshall be deemed to \nhave consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in the state.    \nThere is no clear, predictable, or limiting principle \nthat would cabin this new mechanism from use \nagainst all foreign actors in securities, antitrust, \ntrademark, and copyright cases to name just a few.  \nPet. App. 216a (Bianco, J., concurring).  Such a test \nwould substitute \u201cthe well-established requirement \nthat consent be knowing and voluntary with the \nconcept that all that is necessary is that a person\u2019s \nconduct be knowing and voluntary.\u201d  Ibid.  Under \nPetitioners\u2019 interpretation, Congress could \u201csubject \nany foreign entity to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States, even in the absence of any contacts \nwith the United States, if that entity knowingly and \nvoluntarily engages in any conduct around the world \n(with some undefined nexus to the United States) \nafter Congress enacts legislation deeming the \ncontinuation of that conduct to constitute consent to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States courts.\u201d  \nIbid.  This framework would in fact allow Congress to \nimpose jurisdiction over domestic defendants, too, in \nevery type of federal question case.  See House Br. 5-6 \n\n43 \n(listing \u201ccorporate law and governance, bankruptcy \nand tax, criminal, environmental, civil rights, and \nlabor laws\u201d), and 12-14 (listing Helms-Burton, False \nClaims Act, and antitrust); Chamber Br. 28-29.  And \nit would \u201celevate the risk of foreign nations engaging \nin retaliatory assertions of jurisdiction over United \nStates citizens and companies.\u201d  Chamber Br. 26. \nPetitioners\u2019 vision of \u201cconsent\u201d offer no guardrails \nat all.  The Government contends repeatedly that due \nprocess is \u201cflexible,\u201d such that it can be measured on a \nsliding scale, with different standards \u201cdepend[ing] on \nthe type of actor involved.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 22.  Petitioners \ndid not argue below that Respondents cannot \u201cinvoke \nthe same extent of due process limitations as any \nother defendant,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 5, and have therefore \nforfeited this argument, see Am. Nat. Bank & Tr. Co. \nof Chicago v. Haroco, Inc., 473 U.S. 606, 608 (1985).  \nBut such an ad hoc approach also underscores the \nfundamental absence of any principled standards for \ninterpreting or applying Petitioners\u2019 conception of due \nprocess.  It is unclear to whom the sliding scale of due \nprocess applies, what criteria determine who gets \nwhat degree of due process, and how those standards \ndiffer.  Petitioners note that Respondents would \u201clack \ndue process rights entirely\u201d if the United States \n\u201crecognized respondents as the government of a \nsovereign state.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 28.  But in that case, \nRespondents \n\u201cwould \nreceive \nthe \nprotection \nof \nsovereign immunity.\u201d Pet. App. 212a (Bianco, J., \nconcurring).   \nPetitioners prefer to place Respondents in a \ncategory of one, as though that saves the statute, \nnoting that the PSJVTA applies \u201conly to respondents \nand their successors and affiliates\u201d and a \u201cnarrow\u201d \nclass of claims.  Gov\u2019t Br. 18.  But as the Court of \n\n44 \nAppeals \nexplained, \n\u201c[s]uch \nsingling \nout \n[of \nRespondents] \ndoes \nnot \ncure \na \nconstitutional \ndeficiency.  Where, as here, a statute impinges on \nconstitutional rights, it cannot be salvaged on the \nbasis that it violates the rights of only a handful of \nsubjects.\u201d  Pet. App. 45a.   \nOn the contrary, the Government\u2019s defense that \nthe statute is targeted against sui generis groups \namplifies\u2014rather \nthan \nameliorates\u2014these \nconstitutional concerns.  The Constitution vests the \n\u201cjudicial powers\u201d in a non-political branch precisely to \nprotect \u201cthe rights of one person\u201d from the \u201ctyranny of \nshifting majorities.\u201d  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, \n961-62 (1983) (Powell, J., concurring).  A statute (like \nthe PSJVTA) that singles out only two \u201csui generis\u201d \ngroups (the PA and PLO) for disparate treatment \ntherefore warrants more scrutiny, not less.  See City of \nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 529 (1997) (holding \nthat if Congress were permitted to define the \nconstitutional protections afforded to individual \ngroups, \u201cit is difficult to conceive of a principle that \nwould limit congressional power\u201d).  \nThis Court should likewise reject Petitioners\u2019 \nargument that the PSJVTA\u2019s deemed consent \nprovisions are \u201creasonable\u201d because Congress thinks \nthey further \u201cnational-security and foreign-policy \ninterests.\u201d  See Gov\u2019t Br. 34-37; Pls. Br. 30-31, 43.  \nAlthough courts may defer to Congress on matters of \nlegislative policy, \u201crespect for Congress\u2019s policy \njudgments \u2026 can never extend so far as to disavow \nrestraints on federal power that the Constitution \ncarefully constructed.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012).  \u201cOur precedents, \nold and new, make clear that concerns of national \nsecurity and foreign relations do not warrant \n\n45 \nabdication of the judicial role \u2026. [T]he Government\u2019s \n\u2018authority and expertise in these matters do not \nautomatically trump the Court\u2019s own obligation to \nsecure the protection that the Constitution grants to \nindividuals.\u2019\u201d  Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, \n561 U.S. 1, 34 (2010).  \nAccordingly, the Government\u2019s \u201cforeign affairs \npower ... , \u2018like every other governmental power, must \nbe exercised in subordination to the applicable \nprovisions of the Constitution.\u2019\u201d Am. Ins. Ass\u2019n v. \nGaramendi, 539 U.S. 396, 416 n.9 (2003).  Even in \ncases involving \u201cforeign affairs\u201d and \u201cnational \nsecurity,\u201d courts adhere to the well-settled rule that \u201ca \nstatute cannot grant personal jurisdiction where the \nConstitution forbids it.\u201d  Gilson v. Republic of Ire., 682 \nF.2d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  In Livnat, for \nexample, plaintiffs urged the court to depart from \n\u201cordinary due-process requirements\u201d and exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents because the \nATA reflected \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to provide redress in \nU.S. courts for terrorism abroad.\u201d  851 F.3d at 53.  The \nD.C. \nCircuit \nrejected \nthat \nargument, \nholding \n\u201cCongress \ncannot \nwish \naway \na \nconstitutional \nprovision.\u201d  Ibid.  Deference is even less appropriate \nwhere, as here, Congress\u2019s explicit purpose is to \nreverse \nfederal \ndecisions \nestablishing \nthe \nconstitutional limits of personal jurisdiction.  See City \nof Boerne, 521 U.S. at 536. \nPetitioners and their amici also greatly overstate \nthe significance of the PSJVTA, attempting to paint it \nas a \u201ccritical component of Congress\u2019s comprehensive \nanti-terror scheme.\u201d  Grassley Br. 4; see also Gov\u2019t Br. \n3 (\u201ckey foreign-policy and national-security tool\u201d); \nPompeo Br. 3 (\u201cimportant tool in the United States\u2019 \ncounterterrorism arsenal\u201d).  Despite that rhetoric, the \n\n46 \nPSJVTA applies only to Respondents\u2014two sui generis\nentities the courts have repeatedly found do not target \nAmericans.  By its plain terms, the PSJVTA does not \napply to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic State, or any \nother terrorist group or state-sponsor of terrorism.   \nThere is similarly no merit to the assertion that the \ndecision below would \u201cgut\u201d the ATA, U.S. House Br. 2, \nor place Respondents \u201cbeyond the reach of Congress \nand American courts,\u201d Grassley Br. 5.  When a \ndefendant targets the United States or its citizens, or \nengages in conduct in the United States substantially \nconnected to terrorist attacks overseas, U.S. courts \ncan (and do) exercise personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant.  See, e.g., Mwani v. Bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1, \n11-14 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (foreign defendants who \n\u201corchestrated the bombing of the American embassy \nin Nairobi\u201d were subject to personal jurisdiction \nbecause they \u201cpurposefully directed their terror at the \nUnited States\u201d); Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, \n732 F.3d 161, 169-74 (2d Cir. 2013) (foreign bank that \nused U.S. correspondent accounts to transfer funds for \nHezbollah was subject to personal jurisdiction).  The \nDue Process Clause precludes the exercise of personal \njurisdiction only when plaintiffs cannot establish the \nrequisite connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct, \nthe attack giving rise to plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the \nforum.  See Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1126 (distinguishing \nclaims against Respondents from Mwani, in which the \ndefendants \u201cindisputably aimed to kill Americans\u201d). \nB.\nThe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \nReflect the Same Due Process Standards.  \nWhen evaluating the constitutionality of a \n\u201cconsent\u201d statute like the PSJVTA, the due process \nstandards \nunder \nthe \nFifth \nand \nFourteenth \nAmendments are the same.  The question is whether \n\n47 \nthe actions chosen by Congress to constitute consent \nsatisfy the standards for consent established by this \nCourt in Bauxites and Mallory.  Petitioners fail to \nidentify any reason why the standard for consent \nwould differ under the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  Whether Congress, in a different \nstatute, \ncould \ndirectly \nimpose \njurisdiction \non \nRespondents is not at issue because, in the PSJVTA, \nCongress expressly chose a \u201cconsent\u201d mechanism.   \n1.  Petitioners argue that the primary difference \nbetween the due process analysis under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments is that the Fourteenth \nAmendment inquiry protects \u201cinterstate federalism\u201d \ninterests, \nwhich are \nabsent \nunder \nthe \nFifth \nAmendment.  See Pls. Br. 29-32; Gov\u2019t Br. 30-34.  For \nthat reason, Petitioners assert that the constraints on \npersonal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment are \n\u201cless restrictive than the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s.\u201d  \nGov\u2019t Br. 31. \nBut as this Court recently explained in Mallory, \npotential \ndue \nprocess \nconcerns \n\u201csounding \nin \nfederalism\u201d \nplay \nno \nrole \nin \nanalyzing \nthe \nconstitutionality of a consent statute\u2014even under the \n(purportedly more rigorous) Fourteenth Amendment.  \nSee Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144 (plurality op.); see also id.\nat 156 (Alito, J., concurring in part).  \u201cOur personal \njurisdiction cases have never found a Due Process \nClause problem sounding in federalism when an out-\nof-state defendant submits to suit in the forum state.  \nAfter all, personal jurisdiction is a personal defense \nthat may be waived or forfeited.\u201d  Ibid.\nThe Government also inaccurately claims that \n\u201c[i]n Mallory, five Justices agreed that federalism \nconcerns bear on the personal-jurisdiction analysis \neven in consent cases, albeit through different \n\n48 \nconstitutional mechanisms.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 32 (citing \nJustice Alito\u2019s concurrence and Justice Barrett\u2019s \ndissent).  That assertion is not faithful to Justice \nAlito\u2019s opinion, which joined the plurality in holding \nthat federalism concerns play no role in determining \nwhether a defendant has consented to personal \njurisdiction: \n[W]e have never held that a State\u2019s assertion of \njurisdiction unconstitutionally intruded on the \nprerogatives of another State when the \ndefendant had consented to jurisdiction in the \nforum State.  Indeed, it is hard to see how such \na decision could be justified.  The Due Process \nClause confers a right on \u2018person[s],\u2019 Amdt. 14, \n\u00a7 1, not States.  If a person voluntarily waives \nthat right, that choice should be honored. \n600 U.S. at 156 (Alito, J. concurring in part).  Contrary \nto the Government\u2019s assertions, five Justices thus \nplainly agreed that \u201cfederalism concerns\u201d do not bear \non the personal-jurisdiction analysis in consent cases.  \nFederalism interests thus fail to provide a valid \nreason for treating consent differently under the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments. \n2.  If it reaches beyond consent, this Court should \nhold that the jurisdictional due process standards are \nsubstantively the same.  Every circuit to reach the \nissue agrees that the standards developed under the \nFourteenth Amendment apply under the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Pet. App. 49a-51a; Livnat, 851 F.3d \nat 54-56.   \nThe Fifth Circuit recently summarized the \nreasoning behind these decisions: \u201cBoth Due Process \nClauses use the same language and serve the same \npurpose, \nprotecting \nindividual \nliberty \nby \n\n49 \nguaranteeing \nlimits \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.\u201d  \nDouglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 235 & 238 n.22 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (\u201cEvery \ncourt that has considered this point agrees that the \nstandards mirror each other.\u201d).  The Eleventh Circuit \nsimilarly explained that \u201cthe operative language of \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is materially \nidentical, and it would be incongruous for the same \nwords to generate markedly different doctrinal \nanalyses.\u201d  Herederos De Roberto Gomez Cabrera v. \nTeck Res. Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1308 (11th Cir. 2022).  \nAs Justice Frankfurter explained: \u201cTo suppose that \n\u2018due process of law\u2019 meant one thing in the Fifth \nAmendment and another in the Fourteenth is too \nfrivolous to require elaborate rejection.\u201d  Malinski v. \nNew York, 324 U.S. 401, 415 (1945) (Frankfurter, J., \nconcurring).19\nNo case supports Petitioners\u2019 views that the due \nprocess standards are lower under the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Pet. App. 45a-46a.  Courts have long \nrejected the notion \u201cthat federalism\u2019s irrelevance in \nthe Fifth Amendment context justifies a \u2018more lenient\u2019 \nstandard for personal jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 48a; \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 239 n.24 (collecting cases from \nvarious circuits).  Nor does any case suggest that the \nlack of federalism concerns changes the personal \nliberty analysis that underlies the doctrine of personal \njurisdiction, or that the quality or meaning of the \ncontacts (or the consent) must be different. \n19 The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended that \nidentical wording would create identical rights.  See Cong. Globe, \n39th Cong., 1st Sess. 1088-89 (1866) (purpose of amendment was \nto \u201cenforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution \ntoday\u201d and the meaning of due process was that which \u201cthe courts \nhave settled [] long ago\u201d).  \n\n50 \nMoreover, this Court consistently assumes the \nminimum contacts due process analysis applies to \nfederal statutes, reflecting that the authority to \nlegislate extraterritorially does not create jurisdiction \nto adjudicate over foreign defendants.  See Kiobel v. \nRoyal Dutch Petroleum, 569 U.S. 108, 124-25 (2013) \n(Alien Tort Statute); id. at 139 (Breyer, J., concurring) \n(same); Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 313, \n(2018) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (same); Mohamad v. \nPalestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 460 (2012) (plaintiffs \nstill must establish \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d under the \nTorture Victim Protection Act); Abitron Austria \nGmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 445 (2023) \n(Sotomayor, \nJ. \nconcurring) \n(assuming \nforeign \ncompanies have personal jurisdiction defenses to \nLanham Act claims). \n3. Petitioners argue that application of minimum \ncontacts standards would be unfair, referencing other \njurisdictional standards.  Their examples are not \npersuasive.  \nThe Government argues that if Respondents were \n\u201cnatural persons,\u201d then \u201cthe mere act of serving them\u201d \nin the United States would suffice for tag jurisdiction \nunder Burnham.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 28-29.  But if \nRespondents were natural persons, they would have \nto physically enter the United States to be served with \ntag jurisdiction.  And, as the Government admits, \nPlaintiffs served process on Respondents\u2019 ambassador.  \nIbid.  Natural persons would not have an ambassador \n(even assuming that Burnham applies to diplomatic \nenvoys), so tag jurisdiction would not be available.20\n20 One amici even argues that service itself creates jurisdiction.  \nSachs Br. 27.  But service performed under the Federal Rules \nonly does so when \u201cexercising jurisdiction is consistent with the \n\n51 \nThe Government also compares Respondents to \ncorporations, claiming that personal jurisdiction \nwould \nbe \nappropriate \nif \nRespondents \nwere \n\u201ccorporations registered to do business in New York\u201d \nand New York had a corporate registration statute \n\u201clike the one upheld in Mallory.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 41-42.  This \ncomparison actually supports Respondents.  Under \nthe ATCA, Congress stated that specific benefits \n(certain foreign aid or an Executive waiver to have an \noffice in the U.S.) were conditioned on consent to \njurisdiction, just like Pennsylvania conditioned the \nbenefit of doing business in the state on submission to \njurisdiction in Mallory.  But unlike Norfolk Southern, \nRespondents did not accept the benefit conditioned on \nconsent, just like any foreign corporation could avoid \npersonal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania by refusing to \nregister.   \nThe Government further argues that the United \nStates has a special relationship with Respondents.  \nBut it cites laws limiting Respondents\u2019 presence in the \nUnited States, restricting foreign assistance, and \npunishing them for interacting with international \nbodies.  Gov\u2019t Br. 35-36.  Those are one-sided penalties, \nnot actions by Respondents that might signify \nsubmission to jurisdiction.  \nThe Government also argues that Respondents \nshould not be treated like \u201crun-of-the-mill foreign \nprivate defendants for due process purposes,\u201d but \nshould receive some lesser subset of Fifth Amendment \ndue process rights.  Gov\u2019t Br. 35-36.  It did not raise \nUnited States Constitution and laws.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2)(B).  \nAnd that question turns on whether Respondents \u201creally \nsubmitted to proceedings.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144.  In any case, \nneither Petitioner makes this argument, nor did the courts below \npass on it. \n\n52 \nthis argument below, and so it is waived.  More \nimportantly, it presents no authority for the novel \nidea that some persons should be entitled to less \nprocess than others when convenient for the \nGovernment.  This is a dangerous doctrine, which \nwould quickly create different classes of people \nentitled to different classes of due process.  As \nexplained below, infra at III.D, this is exactly the kind \nof position the Due Process Clause was designed to \nprotect against.  \nPlaintiffs, in turn, argue that the correct \ncomparison for purposes of fairness is to criminal \ncases.  Pls. Br. 14, 29, 32-33.  But the fulcrum of their \ncomparison has nothing to do with personal \njurisdiction.  It is not controversial, but it is entirely \nirrelevant to personal jurisdiction, that the Second \nCircuit has found a sufficient \u201cnexus\u201d for Congress to \nenact an extraterritorial criminal statute when the \nstatute focuses on \u201cactivity [that aims] to cause harm \ninside the United States or to U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  United States v. Sanchez, 972 F.3d 156, \n169 (2d Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).   \nBut that begs the question whether Congress can \ngo further and legislate that all defendants sued \nunder such laws are subject to personal jurisdiction in \nsuits making such civil claims.  The Second Circuit \nrejected that assertion, Pet. App. 180a-81a, and this \nCourt denied certiorari after the Solicitor General saw \nno conflict with any decision of this Court.  CVSG Br. \n14-16, No. 16-1071 (U.S. Feb. 22, 2018). \nUnderscoring \nthe \nirrelevance \nof \nlegislative \nauthority to enact laws criminalizing extraterritorial \noffenses, \u201cin a criminal case, personal jurisdiction is \nbased on the physical presence of the defendant in the \nforum, \nindependent \nof \nany \nminimum-contacts \n\n53 \nanalysis.\u201d  CVSG Br. 21, Fed. Ins. Co. v. Saudi Arabia, \nNo. 08-640 (U.S. May 29, 2009).  Physical presence is \nrequired even if the United States must conduct a \n\u201cforcible abduction\u201d of an individual abroad.  United \nStates v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655, 661, 670 \n(1992) (abducted from Mexico); United States v. Yunis, \n924 F.2d 1086, 1089 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (terrorist lured \ninto international waters).  Due process standards in \ncivil cases do not require physical presence, but \ninstead the more lenient standard of a forum-\nconnection consistent with due process.  \n4.  Finally, one amicus argues Respondents are not \npersons under the Fifth Amendment.  Chamber Br. 5-\n16.  This Court should ignore this argument as neither \nPetitioner raises it here.  In any case, two Circuits \nhave expressly held that Respondents are persons \nunder the Due Process Clause.  Pet. App. 153a-54a; \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 49-53 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  The \nGovernment has also acknowledged the unbroken line \nof authority holding that Respondents are \u201cpersons.\u201d  \nU.S. Amicus Br. 9-12, Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 \n(U.S. Feb. 22, 2018).  This Court has presupposed \nRespondents are \u201cpersons\u201d when contrasting a \nstatute\u2019s use of the word \u201cindividual,\u201d which does not \ninclude Respondents, with use of the word \u201cperson,\u201d \nwhich would include entities like Respondents.  \nMohamad, 566 U.S. at 454-55.  This Court has \nsimilarly assumed that unincorporated associations \n(which is how Respondents are classified in the \nUnited States, see Pet. App. 159a) are entitled to due \nprocess just like corporations.  California State \nAutomobile Association Inter-Insurance Bureau v. \nMaloney, 341 U.S. 105, 108 (1951); Joint Anti-Fascist \nRefugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 140-41 \n(1951).   \n\n54 \nNor should the issue be controversial.  The \u201cDue \nProcess Clause applies to all \u2018persons\u2019 within the \nUnited States, including aliens, whether their \npresence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or \npermanent.\u201d  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 \n(2001).  Because foreign defendants are \u201cforced to \nappear in the United States\u201d to answer potential \nclaims, they are \u201centitled to the protection of the Due \nProcess Clause.\u201d  GSS Grp. Ltd. v. Nat\u2019l Port Auth.,\n680 F.3d 805, 816 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  Amici\u2019s argument \nalso relies on treating Respondents like sovereigns.  \nChamber Br. 6.  But Respondents lack \u201cattributes of \nsovereignty like sovereign immunity\u201d and \u201cterritorial \nsecurity\u201d and do not enjoy other \u201cspecial privileges\u201d \nthat are \u201cavailable only to entities that are juridical \nequals in the eyes of the United States.\u201d  Livnat, 851 \nF.3d at 50-51. \nIII.\nThe Original Meaning of Due Process \nImposes Limitations on Jurisdiction.    \nThe Court should not upend well-settled law on the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause based on \nscant historical evidence.  As the Government and a \nleading proponent of Plaintiffs\u2019 maximalist position \nagree, \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 theory is not easily confirmed as \na \nhistorical \nmatter\u201d \nbecause \n\u201c[s]howing \nthat \nFounding-era due process didn\u2019t limit federal personal \njurisdiction is an exercise in proving a negative.\u201d  \nGov\u2019t Br. 47 (citation omitted); Sachs Br. 7.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201c[e]vidence of the understanding of those \nwho crafted the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause is surprisingly slim.\u201d  Lawrence Rosenthal, \nDoes Due Process Have an Original Meaning? On \nOriginalism, Due Process, Procedural Innovation ... \nand Parking Tickets, 60 Okla. L. Rev. 1, 29 (2007).  \nContrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 broad claims (Pls. Br. 18-19), \n\n55 \n\u201cneither Madison nor anyone else involved in the \nprocess made any substantive comments about its \nmeaning.\u201d  Id. at 29, 52 (calling the same kinds of \nevidence relied upon by Plaintiffs \u201cmurky and \nincomplete\u201d).  As members of this Court have \nexplained, when the proponent of a historical claim \nthat would overturn longstanding precedent admits \nthat it is speculative, wisdom counsels against \nadopting that position.  Amy Coney Barrett, \nOriginalism and Stare Decisis, 92 Notre Dame L. Rev. \n1921, 1924 & n.8 (2017); Amy Coney Barrett & John \nCopeland Nagle, Congressional Originalism, 19 U. Pa. \nJ. Const. L. 1, 11 (2016) (history is only \u201cconclusive \nwhen it is determinate\u201d); Gamble v. United States, 587 \nU.S. 678, 722-23 (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) \n(declining to overturn precedent where \u201chistorical \nrecord present[ed] knotty issues about the original \nmeaning of the Fifth Amendment,\u201d insufficient to \nrender precedent \u201cdemonstrably erroneous\u201d).  \nPlaintiffs also failed to raise this argument below, \ndepriving the Second Circuit of an opportunity to \naddress it.  On appeal, only the Fuld plaintiffs raised \noriginalism, and only to argue for a \u201crelaxed\u201d or \n\u201cnexus\u201d standard\u2014very different from the extreme \nposition they take before this Court.21 See Fuld C.A. \nPls. Br. 49, 61.  The Court should decline to consider \nsuch arguments.  See Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. \n257, 259 (1987) (\u201cWe ordinarily will not decide \nquestions not raised or litigated in the lower courts.\u201d). \n21 Plaintiffs first introduced their maximalist theory in their \npetition for rehearing en banc.  See Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. \n558, 574 n.25 (1984) (argument made \u201cfor the first time\u201d at the \nrehearing stage \u201cprecludes our consideration\u201d). \n\n56 \nThe argument fails regardless.  The founders \nbelieved due process protected the natural, unwritten \nrights of individuals.  Early courts regularly held that \npersonal jurisdiction was one of those rights protected \nfrom the power of the \u201csovereign\u201d and the \u201clegislature.\u201d  \nThey also believed that due process precluded \ndiscriminatory \nstatutes \nthat \nsought \nto \nstrip \nprotections from specific individuals or groups.  The \nPSJVTA transgresses these limitations\u2014and early \nAmerican courts would have struck it down. \nA. Founding-era Judges Believed that Due \nProcess Restrained Legislative Power \nand Protected Natural Rights. \nFor early Americans, due process rights had a long \nhistory of protecting individuals against legislative \nacts.  \u201cThe due process and law-of-the-land clauses of \nthe American state and federal constitutions originate \nin Magna Charta and the English customary \nconstitution.  This is uncontroversial.\u201d  Nathan S. \nChapman & Michael W. McConnell, Due Process As \nSeparation of Powers, 121 Yale L.J. 1672, 1681, 1722-\n23 (2012).  The Due Process Clause \u201cgrew out of the \n\u2018law of the land\u2019 provision of Magna Carta and its later \nmanifestations in English statutory law.\u2019\u201d  O\u2019Bannon \nv. Town Ct. Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 792 n.2 (1980) \n(Blackmun, J. concurring).   \nAs this Court explained, due process requires \ncourts to decide if any \u201cprocess\u201d ordered by Congress \nis \u201cin conflict\u201d with \u201cthe constitution itself\u201d and \nwhether it contravenes the \u201csettled usages and modes \nof proceeding existing in the common and statute law \nof England.\u201d  Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Imp. \nCo., 59 U.S. 272, 277 (1855).  Legislative acts were \noverturned when contrary to \u201cdue process of law,\u201d \nwhich was also called the \u201claw of the land.\u201d  Id. at 276; \n\n57 \nEdward Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the \nLaws of England at 50-55 (London, 6th Ed. 1772) (the \nphrase \u201cby the Law of the Land\u201d is also \u201crendered, \nwithout due process of Law\u201d).   \n \u201c[A]t least one common, public understanding of \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment at the \ntime it was ratified in 1791 was that it protected \nunenumerated natural and customary rights against \nencroachment by Congress.\u201d  Frederick Mark Gedicks, \nAn Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: \nMagna Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the \nFifth Amendment, 58 Emory L.J. 585, 596 (2009) \n(emphasis added);  see also 3 Jonathan Elliot, The \nDebates in the Several State Conventions on the \nAdoption of the Federal Constitution, 451 (2d ed. 1836) \n(\u201cA bill of rights is only an acknowledgment of the \npreexisting claim to rights in the people.\u201d (quoting \nVirginia legislator George Nicholas)).   \nEarly cases applied these limitations, unwritten in \npositive law but widely-understood, to overturn \nlegislative acts.  See, e.g., Bowman v. Middleton, 1 Bay \n252 (1792) (holding that law was \u201cagainst common \nright, as well as against Magna Charta\u201d); Zylstra v. \nCorp. of City of Charleston, 1 Bay 382, 384 (1794) \n(refusing to enforce law because \u201cthe trial by jury is a \ncommon law right; not the creature of the constitution, \nbut originating in time immemorial; it is the \ninheritance of every individual citizen\u201d); Taylor v. \nPorter & Ford, 4 Hill 140, 145 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1843).   \nPlaintiffs seek to exclude personal jurisdiction \nsafeguards from those protected rights inherited from \nEngland, but early judges called personal jurisdiction \nan \u201ceternal principle of justice\u201d that may not be \nexercised \u201cover persons not owing [the State] \nallegiance or not subjected to [its] jurisdiction by being \n\n58 \nfound within [its] limits.\u201d  Mills v. Duryee, 11 U.S. 481, \n486 (1813) (Johnson, J., dissenting).  Justice Story \nexplained \nthat \n\u201cAmerican \ncourts\u201d \nhad \n\u201cfully \nrecognized\u201d the English limits on jurisdiction over \npersons that were not physically \u201cpresent\u201d \u201cwithin the \njurisdiction.\u201d  Joseph Story, Commentaries on the \nConflict of Laws, \u00a7 545 (1834); see id., \u00a7\u00a7 537-550 \n(discussing personal jurisdiction).   \nScholars may disagree about whether the founders \nwere correct \u201cthat the law of the land bound \nParliament\u201d \nin \nEngland, \n\u201cbut \nrevolutionary \nAmericans believed that it did, and that is all that \nmatters.\u201d  Gedicks, 58 Emory L.J. at 657.  American \ndue process became \u201ca restraint on the legislative \u2026 \npowers of the government, and cannot be so construed \nas to leave congress free to make any process \u2018due \nprocess of law,\u2019 by its mere will.\u201d  Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 \nU.S. at 276 (emphasis added); Appeal of Ervine, 16 Pa. \n256, 268 (1851) (rejecting proposition that the \nlegislature can determine what counts as \u201cdue \nprocess\u201d).  \nB.\nEarly Courts Applied Customary Due \nProcess Rights Inherited From English \nLaw to Limit Personal Jurisdiction.   \nAmong the important customary rights inherited \nfrom eighteenth-century English law, and zealously \nprotected by early American courts, were limits on \npersonal jurisdiction.  Historically, English \u201ccommon \nlaw courts neither exercised nor believed they could \nexercise jurisdiction in personal actions without \neither physical custody of the defendant or an \nappearance by him.\u201d  Nathan Levy, Jr., Mesne Process \nin Personal Actions at Common Law and the Power \nDoctrine, 78 Yale L.J. 52, 94 (1968).  American courts \nadopted that doctrine, which protected individual \n\n59 \nrights as an inherent due process limitation on \nsovereignty:  \u201cThe general rule is that all sovereignty \nis strictly local, and cannot be exercised beyond the \nterritorial limits.  This flows from the nature of \nsovereignty, which being supreme power, cannot exist \nwhere it is not supreme.\u201d  The Schooner Exch. v. \nMcFaddon, 11 U.S. 116, 126-27 (1812).   \nThe strength of this doctrine is shown in Picquet v. \nSwan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 611-13 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828), \nwhere Justice Story, riding circuit, explained that \njurisdiction \ndid \nnot \nextend \noutside \nnational \nboundaries.  Service of process was originally a means \nof affirming that the defendant\u2019s person was within \nthe sovereign\u2019s territorial boundaries and, because of \nthat presence, subject to the in personam jurisdiction \nof its courts.  Justice Story explained that \u201cno \nsovereignty can extend its process beyond its \nterritorial limits, to subject either persons or property \nto its judicial decisions,\u201d and \u201c[e]ven the court of king\u2019s \nbench in England, though a court of general \njurisdiction, never imagined, that it could serve \nprocess in Scotland, Ireland, or the colonies, to compel \nan appearance, or justify a judgment against persons \nresiding therein at the time of the commencement of \nthe suit.\u201d  19 F. Cas. at 611-12.  Picquet affirmed that \nexerting jurisdiction \u201cbeyond those limits; and any \nattempt to act upon persons or things beyond them, \nwould be deemed an usurpation of foreign sovereignty, \nnot justified or acknowledged by the law of nations.\u201d  \nIbid.  Picquet concluded that \u201c[e]very exertion of \nauthority beyond this limit is a mere nullity.\u201d  Ibid. \nNot surprisingly, Justice Story\u2019s other writings \nreflect this limited view of federal jurisdiction.  He \nexplained that \u201cjurisdiction, to be rightfully exercised, \nmust be founded either upon the person being within \n\n60 \nthe territory, or upon the thing being within the \nterritory; for, otherwise, there can be no sovereignty \nexerted.\u201d  Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws\n\u00a7 539.  As such, \u201cno state or nation can, by its laws, \ndirectly affect, or bind property out of its own territory, \nor persons not resident therein.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 20 (\u201cno \nsovereign has a right to give the law beyond his own \ndominions\u201d).   \nPlaintiffs twist Justice Story\u2019s words to mean the \nopposite of what Picquet actually says.  Plaintiffs \nclaim that Congress could order the federal courts to \nsummon a foreigner \u201cfrom the other end of the globe\u201d \nand that if Congress had \u201cprescribed such a rule, the \ncourt would certainly be bound to follow it.\u201d  Pls. Br. \n25.  The first quote is part of an argument that Justice \nStory rejected as \u201cso repugnant to the general rights \nand sovereignty of other nations\u201d to be an implausible \nreading of a statute.  19 F. Cas. at 613.  The second \nquote (\u201cbound to follow it\u201d) explicitly discussed in rem\njurisdiction (\u201cby attachment\u201d).  The preceding \nsentence in the opinion (beginning with \u201cUnless\u201d) \nstated that serving a summons \u201cby any attachment\u201d \nof \u201cproperty, however small, within the district\u201d can \ncreate an \u201cin invitum\u201d judgment against an \u201calien, \nwho has never been within the United States.\u201d  Id. at \n615.  That quote affirms Justice Story\u2019s belief that \nCongress had authority to create expansive in rem\njurisdiction even based on small amounts of property, \nand the courts would be \u201cbound to follow it.\u201d  Ibid.  But \nthat only contrasts with Justice Story\u2019s repeated \nstatements that the sovereign\u2014which includes \nCongress, by definition\u2014could never exercise in \npersonam jurisdiction over someone outside its \nterritory. \n\n61 \nPlaintiffs (and some amici) conflate Justice Story\u2019s \ndistinction between in personam and in rem\njurisdiction.  But Picquet clearly distinguished the two: \nWhere a party is within a territory, he may \njustly be subjected to its process, and bound \npersonally by the judgment pronounced, on such \nprocess, against him.  Where he is not within \nsuch territory, and is not personally subject to \nits laws, if on account of his supposed or actual \nproperty being within the territory, process by \nthe local laws may by attachment go to compel \nhis appearance, and for his default to appear, \njudgment may be pronounced against him, such \na judgment must, upon general principles, be \ndeemed only to bind him to the extent of such \nproperty, and cannot have the effect of a \nconclusive judgment in personam, for the plain \nreason, that except so far as the property is \nconcerned, it is a judgment coram non judice. \nId. at 612 (emphasis added).  Picquet thus exemplified \nthe founding-era belief that foreign defendants could \nonly be bound to the extent of their property within \nthe United States. \nPlaintiffs also string together unrelated phrases \nfrom Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. 300 (1838), see Pls. \nBr. 25-26, to suggest that in personam jurisdiction \ncould cover any person in a foreign jurisdiction.  Like \nJustice Story in Picquet, Toland was careful to \ndistinguish between in personam and in rem\njurisdiction:  \nThat the right to attach property, to compel the \nappearance of persons, can properly be used only \nin cases in which such persons are amenable to \nthe process of the court, in personam; that is, \n\n62 \nwhere they are inhabitants, or found within the \nUnited States; and not where they are aliens, or \ncitizens resident abroad, at the commencement \nof the suit, and have no inhabitancy here... \nId. at 330.  Like Picquet, Toland noted that Congress \ncould have authorized \u201ccivil process from any circuit \ncourt, to have run into any state of the Union.\u201d  Id. at \n328.  But until Congress passed \u201cpositive legislation\u201d \non the issue, Toland held that process \u201ccan only be \nserved upon persons within the same districts.\u201d  Id. at \n330.  This holding does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 \nargument.  \nThese personal jurisdiction limits on legislative \nand sovereign power were well-established at the \nfounding.  See Kibbe v. Kibbe, 1 Kirby 119, 126 (Conn. \nSuper. Ct. 1786) (a Massachusetts court lacked \njurisdiction over Connecticut defendant unless \u201cboth \nparties are within the jurisdiction of such courts at the \ntime of commencing the suit\u201d); Schooner Exch. 11 U.S. \nat 136-37 (\u201cevery sovereign\u201d is \u201cincapable of \nconferring extra-territorial power\u201d); id. at 132 (Syll.) \n(Attorney General Pinkney explaining \u201cthe judicial \ndepartment[\u2019s] power cannot extend beyond the \nterritorial jurisdiction\u201d); United States v. Bevans, 16 \nU.S. (3 Wheat.) 336, 386-87 (1818) (\u201c[T]he jurisdiction \nof a state is co-extensive with its territory; co-\nextensive with its legislative power.\u201d); The Apollon, 22 \nU.S. 362, 370 (1824) (same); Rose v. Himely, 8 U.S. 241, \n279 (1808) (\u201cthe legislation of every country is \nterritorial; that beyond its own territory, it can only \naffect its own subjects or citizens\u201d); Cohens v. Virginia, \n19 U.S. 264, 295 (1821) (\u201clegislative power has no \noperation, beyond the territorial limits under its \nauthority\u201d). \n\n63 \nPlaintiffs ignore these early cases that universally \nspeak of personal jurisdiction as a limit on both \n\u201csovereign\u201d and \u201clegislative\u201d authority.  Pls. Br. 17-20.  \nAlthough those cases do not explicitly name the Due \nProcess Clause, founding-era judges \u201coften did not \nview constitutional provisions as creating rights,\u201d so \nthey found \u201clittle need to actually anchor rights that \nwere \n\u2018universally \nesteemed \nfundamental \nand \nessential to society\u2019 to a particular constitutional \ntextual source.\u201d  Charles Rhodes, Liberty, Substantive \nDue Process, and Personal Jurisdiction, 82 Tul. L. Rev. \n567, 580-81 (2007).  Nor does the specific provision \nmatter as the early cases show that personal \njurisdiction safeguards limited legislative power. \nIn the mid-nineteenth century, however, courts \nstarted to more commonly refer to \u201cdue process\u201d as a \nsource of individual rights.  Ibid.; see Bloomer v. \nMcQuewan, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 539, 553 (1852) (federal \nstatute \u201ccertainly could not be regarded as due process \nof law.\u201d).  At that point, not surprisingly, courts \nstarted locating personal jurisdiction in the Due \nProcess Clause.  For instance, Lafayette Ins. Co. v. \nFrench, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 404, 408 (1856), explicitly \ntied personal jurisdiction to due process, requiring \ncertain state-based contacts, to properly exercise \njurisdiction \u201cby due process of law.\u201d  State courts also \nbegan to refer to \u201cdue process of law\u201d as requiring \npersonal jurisdiction.  See Owen v. Miller, 10 Ohio St. \n136, 143 (1859) (\u201c[t]o constitute due process of law, ... \nthere must be jurisdiction over the person of the \nowner, or over his property\u201d).   \nThe Framers\u2019 limited views of personal jurisdiction \nfit well within their historical context.  As the Court \nhas explained, it \u201cis implausible to suppose that the \nFirst Congress wanted their fledgling Republic ... to \n\n64 \nbe the custos morum of the whole world.\u201d  Kiobel, 569 \nU.S. at 123.  Federal courts were thus \u201cdesigned and \nimplemented ... to fit [the Framers\u2019] practical \ngovernance imperatives, most pertinently, their \ngeopolitical circumstances as a new, weak state.\u201d  \nThomas Lee, Article IX, Article III, and the First \nCongress, 89 Fordham L. Rev. 1895, 1898, 1901 (2021).   \nC.\nGrants of Extraterritorial Authority to \nCongress \nDid \nNot \nAffect \nPersonal \nJurisdiction. \nAs proof of the \u201cunlimited\u201d jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts, Plaintiffs point to the \u201cthousands of \n\u2018prize\u2019 and \u2018capture\u2019 cases.\u201d  Pls. Br. 18, 23-27.  But \neven those cases did not go to judgment unless the \nperson (i.e., pirate) or property (i.e., prize ship) was \nbrought within the sovereign\u2019s physical power.  \nPlaintiffs rely on Talbot v. Jansen, 3 U.S. 133, 133-34 \n(1795), but the prize ship in that case was \u201cthen lying \nat Charleston, within the jurisdiction of the Court.\u201d  \nThe Marianna Flora, 24 U.S. 1, 39-40 (1825), similarly \nrequired the Government to \u201ccapture\u201d the ship and \nthe \u201csending in of the ship for adjudication\u201d before \n\u201ccondemnation in our Courts.\u201d  It pointed to many \ncases dismissed for failure to bring a captured vessel \nto \u201cthe most convenient port for adjudication.\u201d  Id. at \n21 n.r.  Jurisdiction required that prizes \u201ctaken at \nsea \u2026 be brought with due care into some convenient \nport for adjudication by a competent court.\u201d  Jecker v. \nMontgomery, 54 U.S. 498, 510 (1851) (citation \nomitted).  \nPlaintiffs rely on Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n913 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818), but that case explains that \neven federal courts sitting in \u201cadmiralty\u201d found it \n\u201cessential to the exercise of this jurisdiction by any \nparticular court, that the person or thing against \n\n65 \nwhom or which the court proceeds, should be within \nthe local jurisdiction of such court.\u201d   \nThe constitutional basis for those extraterritorial \ncases was the congressional Define and Punish Clause \nand \nthe \n\u201cjudicial \nadmiralty \nand \nmaritime \nJurisdiction.\u201d  See U.S. Constit. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cls. 10; Art. \nIII, \u00a7 2, Cls. 1.  Those specific grants of authority were \nexceptions to the pre-existing jurisdictional limits.22\nHad \nthe \nFramers \nbelieved \nCongress \nwas \nunconstrained by national borders, those grants of \nauthority would be superfluous.  Edmund Randolph\u2019s \nconclusion, cited by Plaintiffs (at 19), that the \u201cfederal \ncourts had the exclusive power \u2018to decide all causes \narising wholly on the sea, and not within the precincts \nof any county\u2019\u201d confirms that jurisdiction was \noriginally intended to be territorially limited.  \nThe historical focus on territoriality invalidates \nthe application of the PSJVTA in this case.  \nRespondents\u2019 only actions here are the \u201cofficial\u201d or \n\u201cancillary\u201d UN activities of its UN mission, which are \nexcluded from the PSJVTA.  Plaintiffs\u2019 own cases, \nwhich arose under the enumerated authority to \npunish extraterritorial offenses, were not exempt \nfrom \nthe \nadditional \nrequirement \nof \npersonal \njurisdiction.  The same requirement exists today.  \n22 Plaintiffs rely on congressional authority to define and punish \npiracy and offenses against the law of nations.  Pls. Br. 17; see \nalso Sachs Br. 22, 28.  But the founders did not believe that \n\u201cpiracy\u201d encompassed \u201cother high seas crimes,\u201d let alone other \n\u201cinternational law offenses.\u201d  Eugene Kontorovich, The \u201cDefine \nand Punish\u201d Clause and the Limits of Universal Jurisdiction, 103 \nNw. U. L. Rev. 149, 159 (2009).  And, as Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, \n542 U.S. 692, 724 (2004), explained, \u201cthe First Congress\u201d \nbelieved that \u201cOffenses\u201d against the law of nations were limited \n\u201cto Blackstone\u2019s three primary offenses: violation of safe conducts, \ninfringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.\u201d \n\n66 \nWhen Congress exercises its constitutional authority \nto create causes of action, it does not supplant the \nindependent requirement to establish personal \njurisdiction over defendants.  This Court\u2019s decisions \nunder the Alien Tort Statute\u2014a Founding-era \nenactment\u2014and similar extraterritorial laws also \nrequire personal jurisdiction to be independently \nestablished consistent with due process.  See supra \nII.B. \nIn the end, Plaintiffs\u2019 novel idea that Congress can \nimpose personal jurisdiction on anyone in the world as \na punishment finds no historical support.  Leading \njurists like \u201cJames Wilson (a drafter of the \nConstitution), John Marshall, and Joseph Story\u201d \nrejected the idea that Congress had the power to \n\u201cpunish\u201d anyone in the world, and by \u201c1820, both \nCongress and the Supreme Court had rejected \nuniversal jurisdiction over anything but \u2018piracies.\u2019\u201d  \nKontorovich, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. at 152-53.   \nD. The Original Meaning of Due Process \nEnsured \u201cEquality Before the Law\u201d and \nForbade Discriminatory Statutes.   \nEven if personal jurisdiction were satisfied, the \noriginal public meaning of the Due Process Clause \nalso required statutes to provide equality of \ntreatment.  At the founding, natural law and the \u201claw \nof the land\u201d precluded discriminatory statutes\u2014like \nthe PSJVTA\u2014that sought to strip protections from \nspecific individuals or groups.   \nAs originally understood in England, due process \nof law prohibited legislatures from engaging in acts \nthat are \u201ceffectively a judicial decree\u201d or exercising \n\u201cquasi-judicial power,\u201d and required them to act \u201cby \nmeans \nof \ngenerally \napplicable \nlegislation \nadministered by courts,\u201d prohibiting \u201claws that \n\n67 \nreduced procedural protections for a small class of \ncitizens.\u201d  Chapman & McConnell, 121 Yale L.J. at \n1672, 1680, 1720, 1762, 1766-68, 1803. 23\n\u201cAs elaborated by courts in the early decades of the \nnineteenth century, this general law conception \ninterpreted due process to require general and \nimpartial laws rather than \u2018special\u2019 or \u2018class\u2019 \nlegislation that imposed particular burdens upon, or \naccorded special benefits to, particular persons or \nparticular segments of society.\u201d  Ryan C. Williams, \nThe One and Only Substantive Due Process Clause, \n120 Yale L.J. 408, 425 (2010).  American courts \nrepeatedly affirmed the principle that discriminatory \nlegislation seeking to \u201cswe[ep] away the life, liberty \nand property of one or a few citizens, by which neither \nthe representatives nor their other constituents are \nwilling to be bound, is too odious to be tolerated in any \ngovernment where freedom has a name.\u201d  Vanzant v. \nWaddel, 10 Tenn. 260, 270-71 (1829); see also Calder \nv. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 388 (1798) (the legislature may \nonly \u201cestablish rules of conduct for all its citizens in \nfuture cases\u201d) (emphasis added); Holden v. James, 11 \nMass. 396, 404-05 (1814) (\u201cIt is manifestly contrary to \nthe first principles of civil liberty and natural justice, \nand to the spirit of our constitution and laws ... that \nany one should be subjected to losses, damages, suits, \nor actions, from which all others, under like \ncircumstances, are exempted.\u201d); Merrill v. Sherburne, \n1 N.H. 199, 212 (1818) (\u201c[A]n act, which operates on \nthe rights or property of only a few individuals, \n23 Though some founding-era courts refer to \u201ccitizens,\u201d the Due \nProcess \nClause \nequally \nprotects \nnon-citizens \ndefending \nthemselves in U.S. courts.  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 918.   \n\n68 \nwithout their consent, is a violation of the equality of \nprivileges guaranteed to every subject.\u201d). \nBy defining \u201cdefendant\u201d to refer exclusively to \nRespondents, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5), the PSJVTA \ncontravenes the original meaning of the Due Process \nClause by subjecting Respondents to \u201closses, damages, \nsuits, or actions, from which all others, under like \ncircumstances, are exempted.\u201d  Holden, 11 Mass. at \n405.  The original meaning of due process supports \nfinding the PSJVTA unconstitutional on this basis \nalone.  \nIV.\nThe PSJVTA Violates Separation of Powers \nby Removing a Court\u2019s Ability to Decide if \na Litigant Consented to Jurisdiction.  \nThe PSJVTA violates separation of powers by \nusurping the Judiciary\u2019s Article III power \u201c\u2018to say \nwhat the law is\u2019 in particular cases and controversies.\u201d  \nBank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 225 (2016) \n(citation omitted).  The Constitution \u201ccommands that \nthe independence of the Judiciary be jealously \nguarded.\u201d  N. Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe \nLine Co., 458 U.S. 50, 60 (1982) (plurality op.).  \nCongress exceeds its powers and infringes on the \nJudiciary when it \u201ccompel[s] ... findings or results \nunder old law\u201d and \u201cfails to supply any new legal \nstandard effectuating the lawmakers\u2019 reasonable \npolicy judgment.\u201d  Bank Markazi, 578 U.S. at 231.   \nWith the PSJVTA, Congress sought to compel the \nJudiciary to find that certain enumerated activities \n(which the courts had already found were insufficient \nfor general or specific jurisdiction) must constitute \nconsent, though only for Respondents.  Instead of \n\u201csupply[ing] any new legal standard,\u201d therefore, the \nPSJVTA grafts its own definition in place of pre-\n\n69 \nexisting constitutional standards for consent to \npersonal jurisdiction.  Ibid.\nCongress \ncannot \n\u201clegislatively \nsupersede\u201d \ndecisions \n\u201cinterpreting \nand \napplying \nthe \nConstitution.\u201d  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. \n428, 437 (2000).  Before the PSJVTA, courts uniformly \nheld that subjecting Respondents to personal \njurisdiction in the United States would violate the \nDue Process Clause, because Respondents neither \nconsented to jurisdiction, nor had minimum contacts \nwith the forum.  See Pet. App. 136a, cert. denied, 584 \nU.S. 915; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 58, cert. denied, 586 U.S. \n952 (2018); Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1130; Shatsky, 955 \nF.3d at 1037-38 (same).   \nFar from \u201csimply allow[ing] courts to decide \ndisputes among the affected parties\u201d (House Br. 25), \nthe \nPSJVTA \ncircumvents \nthose \nconstitutional \nholdings.  The Constitution, however, is not \u201calterable \nwhen the legislature shall please to alter it,\u201d but is \ninstead \u201csuperior paramount law, unchangeable by \nordinary means.\u201d  City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 529 \n(citation omitted).  While Congress may \u201ccreate[] a \nnew standard for courts to apply\u201d (House Br. 26-27), \nconstitutional holdings cannot be so easily changed. \nThat the PSJVTA applies only to Respondents \nrequires special caution.  The Framers warned of \u201cthe \ndanger of subjecting the determination of the rights of \none person to the \u2018tyranny of shifting majorities,\u2019\u201d and \nthus \u201cvested the executive, legislative, and judicial \npowers in separate branches \u201cto prevent the \nrecurrence of such abuses.\u201d  Chadha, 462 U.S. at 961-\n62 (Powell, J., concurring).  Separation of powers \nensured \u201cthat a legislature should not be able \nunilaterally to impose a substantial deprivation on \none person.\u201d  Ibid.  The founders \u201cknew that when \n\n70 \npolitical actors are left free not only to adopt and \nenforce written laws, but also to control the \ninterpretation of those laws, the legal rights of \n\u2018litigants with unpopular or minority causes or ... who \nbelong to despised or suspect classes\u2019 count for little.\u201d  \nKisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 612-13 (2019) (Gorsuch, \nJ., concurring). \nCongress was created \u201cto prescribe general rules\u201d \nwhile \u201cthe application of those rules to individuals in \nsociety would seem to be the duty of other \ndepartments.\u201d  Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. 87, 136 (1810).  \nWhen Congress overstepped this power, it was not \nmaking \u201claw\u201d as the founders understood that term.  \nRegents of Univ. of Md. v. Williams, 9 G. & J. 365, 366 \n(1838) (\u201cAn act which only affects \u2026 a particular \nperson \u2026 and has no relation to the community in \ngeneral, is rather a sentence than a law.\u201d); Merrill, 1 \nN.H. at 212 (laws \u201cmust in substance be of a legislative \ncharacter,\u201d including that they \u201cbe rules prescribed for \ncivil conduct to the whole community, and not \u2026 \nconcerning a particular person\u2019\u201d).  The PSJVTA\u2019s \ntargeted deprivation of Respondents\u2019 rights violates \nthese longstanding separation of powers principles.  \nSee Chapman & McConnell, 121 Yale L.J. at 1722. \nV.\nPlaintiffs \nMischaracterize \nthe \nFactual \nRecord Regarding Respondents\u2019 Alleged \nU.S. Activities. \nBefore this Court, Plaintiffs inaccurately assert it \nis \u201cuncontested\u201d that Respondents engaged in various \nnon-UN related activities in the United States \u201cafter \nthe statutory trigger date,\u201d thereby satisfying the \nactivities prong.  Pls. Br. 44.  That is false.  As \nexplained below, Respondents have consistently \ncontested Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that they engaged in \nany non-UN related activities in the United States \n\n71 \nafter the trigger date.  The courts below did not \nresolve those factual disputes, nor did they address \nthe related, statutory questions of what types of \nactivities constitute \u201cofficial business of the United \nNations,\u201d \u201cmeetings with [government] officials,\u201d or \n\u201cancillary\u201d activities\u2014which a court cannot consider \nwhen assessing jurisdiction under the PSJVTA.  See\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). \nTo purportedly trigger \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction under the activities prong, \nPlaintiffs \nalleged \n(and \nRespondents \nprovided \njurisdictional discovery regarding) various activities \nallegedly conducted by Respondents while physically \npresent in the United States.  No court has ever found \nthat these activities were sufficient to trigger \njurisdiction under the activities prong. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 first factual claim is that Respondents \nallowed \u201cnotaries in the United States to certify \ndocuments\u201d for use in Palestine.  See Pls. Br. 11, 15, \n44-45; Gov\u2019t Br. 4, 14 (characterizing this as \n\u201cproviding consular services\u201d).  But the activities of \nstate-licensed notaries, independently hired by \nAmerican citizens, cannot constitute activities of \nRespondents sufficient to satisfy the activities prong. \nThe only evidence cited by Plaintiffs is an affidavit \nclaiming that the website of the PLO\u2019s (long-shuttered) \nWashington, \nD.C. office \nlisted \nArabic-speaking \nnotaries in 2018.  Pls. Br. 11 (citing JA 149-52 (the \naffidavit)).  When Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contacted those \nnotaries before the enactment of the PSJVTA in \nDecember 2019, the notaries offered to send notarized \ndocuments \n\u201cto \neither \nCanada \nor \nMexico \nfor \ncertification\u201d by a PLO consulate.  Ibid.  As noted \nabove, however, the PLO closed its D.C. office in 2018.  \nNothing in the affidavit demonstrates that the alleged \n\n72 \n\u201cconsular\u201d activities by private notaries continued \nafter the PSJVTA\u2019s trigger date.  \nDepositions \nof \nthe \nstate-licensed \nnotaries \nconfirmed that Respondents had not authorized or \ncontrolled their U.S. activities.  See JA 343-48 \n(summarizing the evidence on this issue).  The state-\nlicensed notaries denied having any authority to act \non \nbehalf \nof \nRespondents \nor \nreceiving \nany \ncompensation from them.  JA 475, 513-515, 553-57, \n560-61, 577-81 (notary deposition testimony).  They \nexplained in significant detail that Americans hire \nthem to notarize documents and then send them to the \nPLO\u2019s \nCanadian \nor \nMexican \nconsulates \nfor \nauthentication\u2014precisely \nbecause \nRespondents \ncannot, and do not, perform consular operations in the \nUnited States.  Ibid.  They testified that Respondents \nhad no authority to control or limit their actions, and \nthey never (even before the PSJVTA) provided \nservices on behalf of Respondents.  Ibid.  In no way \nwere they \u201cagents\u201d acting for Respondents.  Ibid. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 remaining factual allegations (see Pls. \nBr. 11, 15, 44-45) involve the following activities: \n\uf0b7\nposting \u201ccommunications in English\u201d on the \nPLO\u2019s semi-official news website, including \n\u201ctranslations of numerous speeches given by \nPalestinian representatives at the United \nNations\u201d; JA 140-41, 410-14 (allegations); \n\uf0b7\nposting messages on websites, Twitter accounts, \nand Facebook accounts run by Respondents\u2019 UN \nmission; JA 137-40, 142-45, 414-18 (allegations); \n\uf0b7\nmaintaining the physical office of Respondents\u2019 \nUN mission in New York City; JA 418-19;  \n\n73 \n\uf0b7\nparticipating in a press conference with an \nIsraeli politician to discuss a significant Security \nCouncil meeting; JA 137 (allegations); and \n\uf0b7\nPalestine\u2019s UN ambassador explaining that \nyoung Palestinian-Americans \u201clobby\u201d Congress \nto support the Palestinian people and to take \n\u201cmore of a balanced and just position;\u201d compare\nPls. Br. 11, 15, 44 with JA 911 (transcript of his \nactual remarks). \nAs Respondents argued below (see, e.g., JA 340-57, \n362-77, 443-48; Fuld C.A. Def. Br. 23 n.2, 46-48 & \nn.20), none of these activities triggers the activities \nprong.  Posting in English on the PLO\u2019s news site is \nnot an activity \u201cin the United States.\u201d  The other \nactivities do not trigger consent to jurisdiction based \non the plain language of the PSJVTA, which expressly \nprovides that a court may not consider \u201cofficial \nbusiness of the United Nations,\u201d Respondents\u2019 UN \nmission office, meetings with U.S. and foreign \ngovernment officials, and \u201cpersonal and official\u201d \nactivities \u201cancillary\u201d to such activities.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n2334(e)(3)(A)-(F).  The statute\u2019s rule of construction \nalso explicitly treats Respondents\u2019 UN mission \n(\u201cexempted by paragraph (3)(A)\u201d) as outside of the \nUnited States, though it states that any other office \n\u201cshall be considered to be in the United States.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(4).   \nBy excluding UN-related work and diplomacy from \nconsideration, the PSJVTA mirrors established law.  \nThe \nUN \nHeadquarters \nAgreement \n(\u201cUNHQA\u201d) \nguarantees \u201cinvitees\u201d of the UN, including the PLO, \nbasic rights of \u201centry, access and residence\u201d in the UN \nHeadquarters District in New York.  PLO, 695 F. \nSupp. at 1465-68.  As such, \u201cthe UN Headquarters is \nnot really United States territory at all, but is rather \n\n74 \nneutral ground over which the United States has \nceded control,\u201d and Palestine\u2019s UN mission is thus not \nin the United States.  Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille \nLauro, 937 F.2d 44, 51 (2d Cir. 1991).  \nUnder the UNHQA, the United States is \n\u201cobligat[ed] \u2026 to refrain from impairing the function \nof the PLO Observer Mission to the United Nations,\u201d \nwhich falls outside U.S. \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  PLO, 695 F. \nSupp. at 1465-68, 1471.  Courts have thus long held \nthat UN-related activities conducted by Respondents \ncannot \u201cproperly be considered as a basis of \njurisdiction.\u201d  See Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51; U.S. \nBrief 6, Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., No. 15-7034 \n(D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2019) (same).  The United States \ncannot take away any right granted to Respondents \nby the United Nations without impairing its \nantecedent obligations under the UNHQA.  Ibid. \nPlaintiffs argue that Respondents engaged in non-\nUN-related activities whenever their UN mission \ndiscussed \u201cgrievances against the Government of \nIsrael.\u201d  JA 303.  This allegation ignores the fact that \ndiscussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is \nomnipresent at UN organs24 and by UN missions on \nsocial media.25\n24 See, e.g., Meetings Coverage, GA/12325 (Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: \u201cIf \nthere is a hell on earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza\u201d) (May \n20, 2021); G.A. Res. No. A/C.4/73/L.18 (Nov. 14, 2018) \n(condemning \u201cthe excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying \nforces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in the death and \ninjury of civilians\u201d). \n25 See, e.g., Twitter: @UKUN_NewYork (\u201cWhat hope is there for \n2-state solution when communities are simply removed from the \nmap?\u201d) (Oct. 14, 2016); @FranceONU (Feb. 24, 2020) (\u201cNo further \nsettlements. No colonization.\u201d); @Turkey_UN (Apr. 23, 2020) \n(\u201cAll illegal settlement and demolition activities must stop.\u201d).  \n\n75 \nMoreover, Palestine\u2019s UN mission is a member of \nthe UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \nRights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP).  The \nmission\u2019s official mandate is to \u201cparticipate[] in the \nwork of \u2026 the Committee\u201d as part of its observer \nstatus. 26   The Committee officially \u201cfocuses its \nactivities on diplomatic efforts and initiatives to \nsupport \u2026 an end to the Israeli occupation\u201d and to \n\u201cmobilize the international\ncommunity to stay \nsteadfast in its support for the inalienable rights of \nthe Palestinian people.\u201d27  \u201cThrough its activities,\u201d the \nCommittee raises \u201cawareness of the political, human \nrights and humanitarian developments on the \nground\u201d and seeks \u201cto mobilize the broadest possible \ninternational support.\u201d28\nAs Judge Daniels recognized in Sokolow, speech \nabout the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an inherent \npart of a UN mission\u2019s official business (and the \nCEIRPP\u2019s mandate).  He explained \u201cthere are a lot of \nthings that you do to engage in UN business,\u201d \nincluding \u201cpersuad[ing] other members of the UN of \nyour position\u201d and finding \u201cpublic support for that \nposition.\u201d  JA 216-17.  A UN mission also must \ncommunicate \u201cwhy you\u2019re taking that position at the \nUN and why that\u2019s a legitimate position to take.\u201d  Ibid.  \nRespondents provided detail showing the activities of \nThese examples, and those below, were before the trial courts \nand are roughly contemporaneous with Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.  \n26  Annual Report, CEIRPP, UN Doc. A/75/35, \u00b6 31, at: \nhttps://bit.ly/43dTvRi.  \n27  Programme \nof \nWork \nfor \n2020, \nCEIRPP, \nUN \nDoc. \nA/AC.183/2020/1 (Feb. 7, 2020), at: https://bit.ly/3DdiDNB. \n28 Ibid.\n\n76 \ntheir UN mission were exactly the same as those of \nother UN missions.  Sokolow D.Ct. #1021 at 12-20. \nThe PSJVTA expressly provides that a court \ncannot consider Respondents\u2019 official UN business, \nmeetings with government officials, and \u201cany personal \nor official activities conducted ancillary\u201d to such \nactivities.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(F).  As Respondents \nhave consistently argued throughout these cases, \nPlaintiffs have never succeeded in explaining why the \nconduct alleged in their complaints (meeting, press \nconferences, social media posts, etc.) are not official \nUN business or diplomatic activities, or \u201cactivities \nconducted ancillary\u201d to such official business.29\nMoreover, Plaintiffs forfeited their arguments \nregarding Respondents\u2019 activities in the court of \nappeals.  Plaintiffs\u2019 opening briefs barely mentioned \nthe details of the purported activities.  Sokolow C.A. \nPls. Br. 11; Fuld C.A. Pls. Br. 48.  Plaintiffs\u2019 reply \nbriefs asked the court to forego deciding the activities \npredicate altogether.  Sokolow C.A. Pls. Reply 35 n.3; \nFuld C.A. Pls. Reply 26 n.7.  Nor do Plaintiffs raise, \neven now, any argument that official acts of \nRespondents\u2019 UN mission and staff do not constitute \n\u201cofficial business\u201d of the UN, or that the alleged \nactivities are not \u201cancillary\u201d to such official business.  \nThe parties submitted hundreds of pages to the trial \ncourts regarding the activities prong,30 but Plaintiffs \naddressed almost none of it on appeal\u2014even though \n29 Plaintiffs submitted depositions of the UN ambassador and his \nstaff.  See JA 620-912.  Yet they failed to find a single action \noutside of their official UN duties, much less outside of \u201cUN-\nrelated undertakings and \u2018ancillary\u2019 conduct.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a n.4, \n68a n.7, 220a n.1. \n30 See, e.g., Fuld D.Ct. #30, 42 & 47 and Sokolow D.Ct. #1018, \n1023, 1027, 1035, 1039 & 1066. \n\n77 \nRespondents maintained that none of their alleged \nactivities triggered the activities prong.  Fuld C.A. \nDefs. Br. 23 n.2, 46-48 & n.18-20.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have no basis to assert that it is \n\u201cuncontested\u201d Respondents engaged in conduct \nsatisfying the activities prong.   \nResolution of these open issues would require a \nremand, in addition to the resolution of a host of other \nunresolved issues.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is stable, but my model of the remaining uncertainty has become much sharper. The new observation, being an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external facts but rather confirmed the robustness of my existing model of the petitioners' case and precisely identified the critical missing information.\n\nMy belief state remains structured around the following key pillars derived from the petitioners' merits brief:\n*   **Core Legal Question:** The case still centers on whether the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA) and its \"deemed consent\" provision for personal jurisdiction violate the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause.\n*   **Petitioners' Arguments:** My knowledge of the petitioners' strategy is solid. It rests on:\n    1.  **Originalism:** The claim that the Fifth Amendment, as understood in 1791, imposed no due process limits on Congress's power to establish personal jurisdiction for federal courts, especially over foreign entities and extraterritorial conduct.\n    2.  **Federal vs. State Power:** The argument that modern personal jurisdiction limits (*International Shoe*, etc.) are rooted in the Fourteenth Amendment and principles of interstate federalism, and thus do not constrain the sovereign power of the federal government in matters of foreign policy and national security.\n    3.  **The *Mallory* Precedent:** The heavy reliance on *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* (2023) as a \"linchpin,\" arguing that if a corporation's registration to do business is consent, then the PLO/PA's conduct (e.g., terror-related payments) is an even more compelling basis for consent.\n*   **U.S. Government Position:** The fact that the United States is a co-petitioner (*United States v. PLO*, 24-151) remains a powerful signal in favor of the statute's constitutionality, lending the executive branch's weight on matters of foreign affairs and federal law.\n*   **Identified Uncertainty:** My model is now explicitly one-sided. The primary source of uncertainty\u2014the \"known unknown\"\u2014is the complete legal position of the respondents (the PLO and PA). To make a credible prediction, I must acquire their counter-arguments. Specifically, I need to know:\n    *   How will they rebut the petitioners' originalist claims about the Fifth Amendment?\n    *   How will they argue that the Fourteenth Amendment's jurisdictional jurisprudence *should* inform or be applied to the Fifth Amendment context?\n    *   Crucially, how will they distinguish the Court's recent holding in *Mallory*? Will they argue it's confined to corporate registration, inapplicable to foreign quasi-sovereign entities, or that the \"consent\" here is a legal fiction that violates due process?\n    *   What affirmative arguments will they raise to show that the PSJVTA is fundamentally unfair and violates due process, perhaps focusing on the lack of a genuine \"reciprocal bargain\" as the Second Circuit found?\n\nMy confidence in any specific outcome remains suspended. While the petitioners' arguments appear strong, particularly with the backing of the Solicitor General and the recent *Mallory* decision, I cannot evaluate their true strength without seeing the counter-arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of meta-cognition, significantly reinforces and refines my strategic approach to legal prediction tasks. It validates my existing heuristics and adds a new, crucial layer about process and planning.\n\nMy evolving design beliefs are:\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents:** This remains a foundational principle. The progression from the initial case facts to the Petition for Certiorari and now to the **Merits Briefs** is confirmed as the correct path for information gathering in a newly granted case.\n*   **Identify the \"Linchpin Precedent\":** This heuristic is validated. My internal reasoning confirms that understanding how both sides frame the *Mallory* decision is the central analytical task required to predict the outcome.\n*   **Track the Solicitor General:** The importance of the SG's position as a predictive variable is re-confirmed. My analysis of the petitioners' strength is heavily weighted by the SG's participation.\n*   **Map Argumentative Structure:** This heuristic is not just an analytical tool but also a planning tool. The act of mapping the petitioners' arguments immediately revealed the \"empty\" side of the map, directly pointing to the next necessary action.\n*   **New Heuristic - Iterative Uncertainty Reduction:** This observation demonstrates the power of a dynamic research strategy. I can now formalize this as a core design principle:\n    1.  **Ingest & Model:** After processing a major piece of information (like a petitioner's brief), pause to build an explicit model of the current state of knowledge.\n    2.  **Identify Max-Uncertainty:** Consciously identify the single biggest gap or \"known unknown\" in that model. In this instance, it's the respondents' entire counter-argument.\n    3.  **Targeted Acquisition:** Design the next information-gathering action to directly and efficiently resolve that specific uncertainty. My decision to seek the respondents' merits brief is a direct application of this principle.\n    This iterative cycle of modeling, identifying gaps, and targeted acquisition is more efficient than simply reading documents in a pre-set order and is a hallmark of sophisticated analysis."

They function as a proxy for 'intellectual momentum' behind certain arguments and are often tailored to the jurisprudential leanings of specific justices. Analyzing which arguments are being amplified, by whom (e.g., prominent scholars, former officials, interest groups), and for which presumed judicial audience will allow me to refine my prediction by assigning weights to the different decisional paths I've identified (originalism, modern due process, separation of powers). The gain is substantial but not transformative, as it's unlikely to introduce a completely new framework, but will instead add critical texture and evidence for the existing ones.\n\n**Design EIG (0.5):** This action tests the value of analyzing amicus briefs *after* the primary merits briefs are understood. It will help formalize a more granular sequence in my general strategy, moving beyond just 'read primary documents'. Success here could lead to a new heuristic, such as 'Map Amicus Constellations,' which involves analyzing the coalition of supporters behind each argument to gauge its perceived strength and target audience.

In \nthat role, one of his primary missions was to enact and \npursue policies that would lead to enduring peace in \nthe Middle East. Support for acts of terror in Gaza and \nthe West Bank by entities including the Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organization \n(PLO) is one of the primary obstacles to achieving \npeace in the region. As Secretary of State, Pompeo \n \n1 In accordance with Supreme Court Rule 37, counsel for all \nparties received notice of amicus\u2019s intent to file this brief at least \nten days before filing. No person or entity other than Secretary \nPompeo and his counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, \nand no person or entity other than Secretary Pompeo and his \ncounsel contributed money intended to fund the preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nsupported the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) as a \ncommonsense solution\u2014if entities like the PLO and \nPA promoted acts of terror while receiving American \naid or maintaining facilities in the United States, they \nshould be subject to U.S. federal court jurisdiction. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s decision undercuts Secretary \nPompeo\u2019s reasoned policy judgment that the PSJVTA \nadvances U.S. national security interests by providing \na mechanism to impose real costs on the PLO and PA \nfor supporting terrorism. The PSJVTA serves as a \ndeterrent against the PA\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, \nthrough which the PA furnishes terrorists and their \nfamilies with monthly financial support. The PSJVTA \nincentivizes the PA to adjust its actions and behavior. \nInvalidating the PSJVTA strips Congress and the \nExecutive of a key tool in their fight to protect \nAmericans abroad and to stabilize the Middle East. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe PSJVTA is a federal antiterrorism statute, \ncarefully crafted to discourage violent terror attacks \nagainst Americans abroad. In light of a horrific attack \ncoordinated by the PLO, Congress created a way for \nvictims to hold the PLO and similar organizations \naccountable in federal court. When lower courts \nrendered that system useless against the PLO and PA, \nCongress twice amended the legislation to ensure its \neffectiveness. The PSJVTA is the culmination of over \nthirty years of considered policy judgments by \nCongress \nand \nthe \nExecutive \nin \nthe \nfield \nof \ncounterterrorism, a field the Constitution entrusts to \nthe political branches.  \nThe PSJVTA effectively discourages further terror \nattacks. It provides powerful motivation for the PA to \nend its \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, a critical goal in the \n\n3 \n \nfight against terror. Moreover, subjecting the PLO and \nPA to monetary judgments for supporting violent acts \nagainst Americans cuts off avenues of financial \nsupport for would-be terrorists. This Court should \ngrant review to ensure that this integral part of federal \ncounterterrorism policy is operable. \nARGUMENT \nI. The \nSecond \nCircuit\u2019s \nDecision \nUnduly \nEncroaches \nUpon \nCongress\u2019s \nAnd \nThe \nExecutive\u2019s Role In Combatting Terrorism. \nIt is unequivocally the role of Congress and the \nExecutive to make decisions involving foreign policy \nand national security. Part of that role is enacting \nantiterrorism policies that protect Americans at home \nand abroad. The decision below\u2014invalidating one \nsuch policy created in coordination with the State \nDepartment and enacted with bipartisan support\u2014\nfrustrates the political branches\u2019 considered attempt to \nminimize the terror risk overseas. And it imposes real \nharms on Americans looking to their leaders to keep \nthem safe. \nA. Resolving this issue is critical to \nensuring that the political branches can \nexercise their constitutional role in \npreventing terrorism. \nDecisions of foreign policy, like those reflected in \nthe PSJVTA, \u201care wholly confided by our Constitution \nto the political departments of the government, \nExecutive and Legislative.\u201d Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. \nWaterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948). That \nis why on issues of national security, the judiciary\u2019s \n\u201cinquiry . . . is highly constrained.\u201d Trump v. Hawaii, \n585 U.S. 667, 704 (2018). At the intersection of foreign \n\n4 \n \npolicy and national security lies counterterrorism\u2014a \nfight that \u201c[e]veryone agrees . . . is an urgent objective \nof the highest order.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian L. \nProject, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010). It is a fight that \nCongress and the President attempted to advance \nwhen they passed and signed the PSJVTA. \nThe executive and legislative branches have the \nresources and expertise necessary to act in this \ncountry\u2019s best interests when it comes to fighting \nterrorism abroad. See Chi. & S. Air Lines, 333 U.S. at \n111; Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 284 \n(2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part). Despite the \ncritical importance of allowing the political branches \nto make reasoned judgments on fighting violent \nextremism, the decision below inhibits Congress and \nthe Executive\u2019s decisions in this area. To delay these \nbranches\u2019 exercise of their constitutionally delegated \nduties is to place Americans in harm\u2019s way. The \ninterests at stake in this case thus warrant immediate \nreview by this Court. \nB. The PSJVTA represents a considered \nand \npopular \npolicy \ndecision \nby \nCongress and the Executive. \nCongress has consistently proven its commitment \nto opening the courthouse doors to victims of PLO- and \nPA-backed terrorist attacks. Congress recognized the \nneed for legislation to that effect after PLO-supported \nterrorists hijacked a cruise ship, shooting wheelchair-\nbound Leon Klinghoffer and throwing him overboard. \n137 Cong. Rec. E1583\u201384 (daily ed. May 2, 1991) \n(statement of Rep. Edward Feighan); Pet. App. 4. \nThough Mr. Klinghoffer\u2019s widow was able to sue the \nPLO in the United States under admiralty law, others \ninjured on land or in the air had no recourse. 137 Cong. \n\n5 \n \nRec. E1583\u201384, supra. Organizations financing \nhorrific attacks on Americans faced no consequences \nin U.S. courts.  \nIn the aftermath of the attack on Mr. Klinghoffer \nand to discourage acts of terrorism perpetrated \nagainst Americans, Congress created a private cause \nof action for victims of overseas terrorism in the Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 1992 (ATA). 165 Cong. Rec. 7182 \n(2019). Providing this cause of action proved \nimmensely popular\u2014the Act passed unanimously. Id. \nFor over twenty years, the Act succeeded in its \npurpose. Americans injured abroad by terrorists sued \nthe PLO and PA in federal court and obtained \njudgments, putting pressure on these groups to stop \nsanctioning violent attacks. See, e.g., Biton v. \nPalestinian Interim Self-Gov\u2019t Auth., 252 F.R.D. 1 \n(D.D.C. 2008). But this policy crumbled when the \nSecond Circuit and D.C. Circuit held that federal \ncourts lacked personal jurisdiction over the PLO or the \nPA. Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d \n317 (2d Cir. 2016); Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 \nF.3d 45 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Victims and their families \nwere left without a domestic forum in which to bring \ntheir claims. \nResponding to those decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA) in the \nhopes of restoring federal court jurisdiction over the \nPLO and PA. The ATCA provided that entities \nconsented to personal jurisdiction in federal court by \naccepting certain forms of U.S. aid. Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, sec. 4(a), \u00a7 2334(e), 132 Stat. 3183 (2018). The PA, \nfrightened by the prospect of millions of dollars in \njudgments against them (like the $655.5 million \noriginally awarded in this case), chose to stop \naccepting the qualifying aid. Pet. App. 9a\u201310a, 62a. \n\n6 \n \nAfter that choice, the Second Circuit held that the \nATCA did not authorize personal jurisdiction over the \nPLO and PA. Pet. App. 10a.  \nTo remedy U.S. courts\u2019 lack of personal jurisdiction \nover the PA and PLO, Democratic and Republican \nsenators alike worked with the State Department to \ncreate the PSJVTA. Letter from James Lankford & \nChuck Grassley, Sens., to Antony Blinken, Sec\u2019y of \nState (Mar. 31, 2021). The PSJVTA enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport in Congress and support from the executive \nbranch. Secretary Pompeo wrote an official letter of \nsupport to Senator Chuck Grassley, urging him to \npush the PSJVTA forward to isolate and limit those \nwho would commit acts of terror in the Middle East. \nTime and time again, Congress and the President \ndemonstrated a commitment to allowing plaintiffs \nseeking compensation from the PLO and PA to sue in \nfederal court. But this commitment has been stymied \nat every turn by the lower courts. The Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision here has once more left terrorism victims and \ntheir families without justice.  \nII. Invalidating The PSJVTA Has Substantial \nNegative Effects On U.S. Counterterrorism \nEfforts. \nVitiating the ATA in its most critical application \nfrustrates U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Senator \nChuck Grassley, one of the PSJVTA\u2019s sponsors, \nemphasized that \u201c[b]y cutting terrorists\u2019 financial \nlifelines, the ATA is a key part of the U.S. arsenal in \nfighting terrorism and protecting American citizens.\u201d \n165 Cong. Rec. 7182, supra. That \u201ckey part\u201d of U.S. \ncounterterrorism efforts no longer applies to the PA \nand PLO, despite the deaths of over thirty Americans \nin last year\u2019s October 7 attacks. Lindsay Whitehurst, \n\n7 \n \nThe Justice Department Is Investigating the Deaths \nand Kidnappings of Americans in the Hamas Attack, \nAP \nNews \n(Dec. \n6, \n2023, \n1:23 \nPM), \nhttps://apnews.com/article/hamas-americans-killed-\nkidnapped-justice-department-investigation-\n64d851f794a6de4cbda40968dca50320. There are no \nother mechanisms to do what the PSJVTA does; \nstriking it down would be a great loss to U.S. efforts \ntoward peace in the Middle East. We urge this Court \nto resolve the question presented so that the political \nbranches \nmay \nresume \ntheir \nproductive \ncounterterrorism efforts. \nA. The PSJVTA deters the PA\u2019s \u201cpay-for-\nslay\u201d program and is a key aspect of the \nU.S. campaign to end terror attacks \nagainst Americans. \nThe PSJVTA provides that if, within 120 days of \nenactment, an organization \u201cmakes any payment, \ndirectly or indirectly\u201d to a person jailed for committing \nan act of terrorism against an American national or to \ntheir family by reason of the terrorist act, that \norganization \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction\u201d in U.S. district courts. Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082 (2019) \n(codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(A)(i)\u2013(ii)). This refers \nto the PA\u2019s perverse \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d policy, consisting of \nmonthly payments by the PA to those imprisoned for \nterrorism, or to their families if they died committing \nthe act. See Financially Rewarding Terrorism in the \nWest Bank: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Foreign \nAffs., 114th Cong. 1\u20132 (2016) (statement of Edward \nRoyce, Chairman, H. Comm. on Foreign Affs.). If the \nPA chooses to continue making these odious payments, \nthus encouraging more terrorist attacks and putting \n\n8 \n \nAmericans at risk, then under the PSJVTA it can be \nsued in U.S. courts.  \nSubjecting the PA to U.S. jurisdiction was not an \nempty or meaningless threat; Congress and the \nExecutive knew the PA was sensitive to the risk. Just \none year prior to passing the PSJVTA, Congress \nenacted the ATCA, to which the PA responded \ndecisively\u2014they stopped accepting much of the aid \nthey received from the U.S. to avoid tripping the \njurisdictional trigger. Pet. App. 9a\u201310a. Knowing this, \nthe bill\u2019s drafters crafted the PSJVTA to induce the PA \nto stop the \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program.  \nYet once again, the Act faced roadblocks in the \nfederal courts. The Second Circuit, finding the Act \nunconstitutional, \naffirmed \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndismissal of Petitioners\u2019 claims. Pet. App. 52a. That \ndecision was made in September of last year. Just four \nmonths after the Second Circuit effectively neutralized \nthe political branches\u2019 effort to end the \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d \nprogram, the PA announced they would be making \npayments to over 23,000 new individuals and their \nfamilies. The Ed. Bd., Palestinian \u2018Pay for Slay\u2019 Keeps \nGrowing, Wall St. J. (Jan. 15, 2024, 6:38 PM),. Over \n600 of those new payments will go to Hamas terrorists. \nId. Those who killed and injured American citizens \nwill receive financial rewards from the PA, who will \nface no justice in U.S. courts if this Court does not step \nin to resolve the issue.  \nB. Holding the PLO and PA financially \nliable for supporting terrorism is an \neffective means of discouraging further \nattacks. \nActs of terrorism require funding. One effective \nway to hinder further attacks is thus to disrupt \n\n9 \n \nterrorists\u2019 financial support. Allowing plaintiffs to \nobtain judgments against organizations who fund \nterrorism does just that. \u201c[B]y cutting terrorists\u2019 \nfinancial lifelines, the [ATCA] furthers the United \nStates\u2019 longstanding efforts to reduce global terrorism \nand thus protect Americans here and abroad.\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 115-858, at 3\u20134 (2018). This is not a novel \nidea. Subjecting terrorist organizations to civil suit \nhas been effective in discouraging violent attacks \nelsewhere. See Jack D. Smith & Gregory J. Cooper, \nDisrupting Terrorist Financing with Civil Litigation, \n41 Case W. Res. J. Int\u2019l L. 65, 77\u201379 (2009). Losing the \nPSJVTA means losing a tried-and-true way to \ndisincentivize further terrorist attacks.   \nOne might think American judgments against a \nforeign organization are practically hollow. But that is \nnot the case here. It is eminently clear that the PLO \nand PA expend substantial time and resources \nattempting to avoid adverse judgments in U.S. courts. \nThere are various examples of the PLO and PA asking \ncourts to reverse default judgments against them so \nthey can litigate on the merits. See, e.g., Ungar v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 599 F.3d 79 (1st Cir. 2010); \nKnox v. Palestine Liberation Org., 248 F.R.D. 420 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2008). These organizations\u2019 fervent desire to \navoid U.S. judgments demonstrates the PSJVTA\u2019s \neffectiveness. In obstructing the PSJVTA, the decision \nbelow risks giving the PLO and PA the go-ahead to \ncontinue funding acts of terror abroad. This Court \nshould instead resolve the issue to support the \nobjectives of both Congress and the Executive in \nenacting the PSJVTA: to subject the PA and PLO to \nfederal jurisdiction and, in doing so, halt the funding \nof terrorism perpetrated against Americans. \n\n10 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, this Court should \ngrant the writ of certiorari. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nASHLEY KELLER \n \nCounsel of Record \nKeller Postman LLC \n150 N.

In \nthat role, one of his primary missions was to enact and \npursue policies that would lead to enduring peace in \nthe Middle East. Support for acts of terror in Gaza and \nthe West Bank by entities including the Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) and Palestine Liberation Organization \n(PLO) is one of the primary obstacles to achieving \npeace in the region. As Secretary of State, Pompeo \n \n1 In accordance with Supreme Court Rule 37, counsel for all \nparties received notice of amicus\u2019s intent to file this brief at least \nten days before filing. No person or entity other than Secretary \nPompeo and his counsel authored this brief in whole or in part, \nand no person or entity other than Secretary Pompeo and his \ncounsel contributed money intended to fund the preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nsupported the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA) as a \ncommonsense solution\u2014if entities like the PLO and \nPA promoted acts of terror while receiving American \naid or maintaining facilities in the United States, they \nshould be subject to U.S. federal court jurisdiction. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s decision undercuts Secretary \nPompeo\u2019s reasoned policy judgment that the PSJVTA \nadvances U.S. national security interests by providing \na mechanism to impose real costs on the PLO and PA \nfor supporting terrorism. The PSJVTA serves as a \ndeterrent against the PA\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, \nthrough which the PA furnishes terrorists and their \nfamilies with monthly financial support. The PSJVTA \nincentivizes the PA to adjust its actions and behavior. \nInvalidating the PSJVTA strips Congress and the \nExecutive of a key tool in their fight to protect \nAmericans abroad and to stabilize the Middle East. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe PSJVTA is a federal antiterrorism statute, \ncarefully crafted to discourage violent terror attacks \nagainst Americans abroad. In light of a horrific attack \ncoordinated by the PLO, Congress created a way for \nvictims to hold the PLO and similar organizations \naccountable in federal court. When lower courts \nrendered that system useless against the PLO and PA, \nCongress twice amended the legislation to ensure its \neffectiveness. The PSJVTA is the culmination of over \nthirty years of considered policy judgments by \nCongress \nand \nthe \nExecutive \nin \nthe \nfield \nof \ncounterterrorism, a field the Constitution entrusts to \nthe political branches.  \nThe PSJVTA effectively discourages further terror \nattacks. It provides powerful motivation for the PA to \nend its \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program, a critical goal in the \n\n3 \n \nfight against terror. Moreover, subjecting the PLO and \nPA to monetary judgments for supporting violent acts \nagainst Americans cuts off avenues of financial \nsupport for would-be terrorists. This Court should \ngrant review to ensure that this integral part of federal \ncounterterrorism policy is operable. \nARGUMENT \nI. The \nSecond \nCircuit\u2019s \nDecision \nUnduly \nEncroaches \nUpon \nCongress\u2019s \nAnd \nThe \nExecutive\u2019s Role In Combatting Terrorism. \nIt is unequivocally the role of Congress and the \nExecutive to make decisions involving foreign policy \nand national security. Part of that role is enacting \nantiterrorism policies that protect Americans at home \nand abroad. The decision below\u2014invalidating one \nsuch policy created in coordination with the State \nDepartment and enacted with bipartisan support\u2014\nfrustrates the political branches\u2019 considered attempt to \nminimize the terror risk overseas. And it imposes real \nharms on Americans looking to their leaders to keep \nthem safe. \nA. Resolving this issue is critical to \nensuring that the political branches can \nexercise their constitutional role in \npreventing terrorism. \nDecisions of foreign policy, like those reflected in \nthe PSJVTA, \u201care wholly confided by our Constitution \nto the political departments of the government, \nExecutive and Legislative.\u201d Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc. v. \nWaterman S.S. Corp., 333 U.S. 103, 111 (1948). That \nis why on issues of national security, the judiciary\u2019s \n\u201cinquiry . . . is highly constrained.\u201d Trump v. Hawaii, \n585 U.S. 667, 704 (2018). At the intersection of foreign \n\n4 \n \npolicy and national security lies counterterrorism\u2014a \nfight that \u201c[e]veryone agrees . . . is an urgent objective \nof the highest order.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian L. \nProject, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010). It is a fight that \nCongress and the President attempted to advance \nwhen they passed and signed the PSJVTA. \nThe executive and legislative branches have the \nresources and expertise necessary to act in this \ncountry\u2019s best interests when it comes to fighting \nterrorism abroad. See Chi. & S. Air Lines, 333 U.S. at \n111; Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 284 \n(2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring in part). Despite the \ncritical importance of allowing the political branches \nto make reasoned judgments on fighting violent \nextremism, the decision below inhibits Congress and \nthe Executive\u2019s decisions in this area. To delay these \nbranches\u2019 exercise of their constitutionally delegated \nduties is to place Americans in harm\u2019s way. The \ninterests at stake in this case thus warrant immediate \nreview by this Court. \nB. The PSJVTA represents a considered \nand \npopular \npolicy \ndecision \nby \nCongress and the Executive. \nCongress has consistently proven its commitment \nto opening the courthouse doors to victims of PLO- and \nPA-backed terrorist attacks. Congress recognized the \nneed for legislation to that effect after PLO-supported \nterrorists hijacked a cruise ship, shooting wheelchair-\nbound Leon Klinghoffer and throwing him overboard. \n137 Cong. Rec. E1583\u201384 (daily ed. May 2, 1991) \n(statement of Rep. Edward Feighan); Pet. App. 4. \nThough Mr. Klinghoffer\u2019s widow was able to sue the \nPLO in the United States under admiralty law, others \ninjured on land or in the air had no recourse. 137 Cong. \n\n5 \n \nRec. E1583\u201384, supra. Organizations financing \nhorrific attacks on Americans faced no consequences \nin U.S. courts.  \nIn the aftermath of the attack on Mr. Klinghoffer \nand to discourage acts of terrorism perpetrated \nagainst Americans, Congress created a private cause \nof action for victims of overseas terrorism in the Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 1992 (ATA). 165 Cong. Rec. 7182 \n(2019). Providing this cause of action proved \nimmensely popular\u2014the Act passed unanimously. Id. \nFor over twenty years, the Act succeeded in its \npurpose. Americans injured abroad by terrorists sued \nthe PLO and PA in federal court and obtained \njudgments, putting pressure on these groups to stop \nsanctioning violent attacks. See, e.g., Biton v. \nPalestinian Interim Self-Gov\u2019t Auth., 252 F.R.D. 1 \n(D.D.C. 2008). But this policy crumbled when the \nSecond Circuit and D.C. Circuit held that federal \ncourts lacked personal jurisdiction over the PLO or the \nPA. Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d \n317 (2d Cir. 2016); Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 \nF.3d 45 (D.C. Cir. 2017). Victims and their families \nwere left without a domestic forum in which to bring \ntheir claims. \nResponding to those decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA) in the \nhopes of restoring federal court jurisdiction over the \nPLO and PA. The ATCA provided that entities \nconsented to personal jurisdiction in federal court by \naccepting certain forms of U.S. aid. Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, sec. 4(a), \u00a7 2334(e), 132 Stat. 3183 (2018). The PA, \nfrightened by the prospect of millions of dollars in \njudgments against them (like the $655.5 million \noriginally awarded in this case), chose to stop \naccepting the qualifying aid. Pet. App. 9a\u201310a, 62a. \n\n6 \n \nAfter that choice, the Second Circuit held that the \nATCA did not authorize personal jurisdiction over the \nPLO and PA. Pet. App. 10a.  \nTo remedy U.S. courts\u2019 lack of personal jurisdiction \nover the PA and PLO, Democratic and Republican \nsenators alike worked with the State Department to \ncreate the PSJVTA. Letter from James Lankford & \nChuck Grassley, Sens., to Antony Blinken, Sec\u2019y of \nState (Mar. 31, 2021). The PSJVTA enjoyed bipartisan \nsupport in Congress and support from the executive \nbranch. Secretary Pompeo wrote an official letter of \nsupport to Senator Chuck Grassley, urging him to \npush the PSJVTA forward to isolate and limit those \nwho would commit acts of terror in the Middle East. \nTime and time again, Congress and the President \ndemonstrated a commitment to allowing plaintiffs \nseeking compensation from the PLO and PA to sue in \nfederal court. But this commitment has been stymied \nat every turn by the lower courts. The Second Circuit\u2019s \ndecision here has once more left terrorism victims and \ntheir families without justice.  \nII. Invalidating The PSJVTA Has Substantial \nNegative Effects On U.S. Counterterrorism \nEfforts. \nVitiating the ATA in its most critical application \nfrustrates U.S. counterterrorism efforts. Senator \nChuck Grassley, one of the PSJVTA\u2019s sponsors, \nemphasized that \u201c[b]y cutting terrorists\u2019 financial \nlifelines, the ATA is a key part of the U.S. arsenal in \nfighting terrorism and protecting American citizens.\u201d \n165 Cong. Rec. 7182, supra. That \u201ckey part\u201d of U.S. \ncounterterrorism efforts no longer applies to the PA \nand PLO, despite the deaths of over thirty Americans \nin last year\u2019s October 7 attacks. Lindsay Whitehurst, \n\n7 \n \nThe Justice Department Is Investigating the Deaths \nand Kidnappings of Americans in the Hamas Attack, \nAP \nNews \n(Dec. \n6, \n2023, \n1:23 \nPM), \nhttps://apnews.com/article/hamas-americans-killed-\nkidnapped-justice-department-investigation-\n64d851f794a6de4cbda40968dca50320. There are no \nother mechanisms to do what the PSJVTA does; \nstriking it down would be a great loss to U.S. efforts \ntoward peace in the Middle East. We urge this Court \nto resolve the question presented so that the political \nbranches \nmay \nresume \ntheir \nproductive \ncounterterrorism efforts. \nA. The PSJVTA deters the PA\u2019s \u201cpay-for-\nslay\u201d program and is a key aspect of the \nU.S. campaign to end terror attacks \nagainst Americans. \nThe PSJVTA provides that if, within 120 days of \nenactment, an organization \u201cmakes any payment, \ndirectly or indirectly\u201d to a person jailed for committing \nan act of terrorism against an American national or to \ntheir family by reason of the terrorist act, that \norganization \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction\u201d in U.S. district courts. Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082 (2019) \n(codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(A)(i)\u2013(ii)). This refers \nto the PA\u2019s perverse \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d policy, consisting of \nmonthly payments by the PA to those imprisoned for \nterrorism, or to their families if they died committing \nthe act. See Financially Rewarding Terrorism in the \nWest Bank: Hearing Before the H. Comm. on Foreign \nAffs., 114th Cong. 1\u20132 (2016) (statement of Edward \nRoyce, Chairman, H. Comm. on Foreign Affs.). If the \nPA chooses to continue making these odious payments, \nthus encouraging more terrorist attacks and putting \n\n8 \n \nAmericans at risk, then under the PSJVTA it can be \nsued in U.S. courts.  \nSubjecting the PA to U.S. jurisdiction was not an \nempty or meaningless threat; Congress and the \nExecutive knew the PA was sensitive to the risk. Just \none year prior to passing the PSJVTA, Congress \nenacted the ATCA, to which the PA responded \ndecisively\u2014they stopped accepting much of the aid \nthey received from the U.S. to avoid tripping the \njurisdictional trigger. Pet. App. 9a\u201310a. Knowing this, \nthe bill\u2019s drafters crafted the PSJVTA to induce the PA \nto stop the \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d program.  \nYet once again, the Act faced roadblocks in the \nfederal courts. The Second Circuit, finding the Act \nunconstitutional, \naffirmed \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt\u2019s \ndismissal of Petitioners\u2019 claims. Pet. App. 52a. That \ndecision was made in September of last year. Just four \nmonths after the Second Circuit effectively neutralized \nthe political branches\u2019 effort to end the \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d \nprogram, the PA announced they would be making \npayments to over 23,000 new individuals and their \nfamilies. The Ed. Bd., Palestinian \u2018Pay for Slay\u2019 Keeps \nGrowing, Wall St. J. (Jan. 15, 2024, 6:38 PM),. Over \n600 of those new payments will go to Hamas terrorists. \nId. Those who killed and injured American citizens \nwill receive financial rewards from the PA, who will \nface no justice in U.S. courts if this Court does not step \nin to resolve the issue.  \nB. Holding the PLO and PA financially \nliable for supporting terrorism is an \neffective means of discouraging further \nattacks. \nActs of terrorism require funding. One effective \nway to hinder further attacks is thus to disrupt \n\n9 \n \nterrorists\u2019 financial support. Allowing plaintiffs to \nobtain judgments against organizations who fund \nterrorism does just that. \u201c[B]y cutting terrorists\u2019 \nfinancial lifelines, the [ATCA] furthers the United \nStates\u2019 longstanding efforts to reduce global terrorism \nand thus protect Americans here and abroad.\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 115-858, at 3\u20134 (2018). This is not a novel \nidea. Subjecting terrorist organizations to civil suit \nhas been effective in discouraging violent attacks \nelsewhere. See Jack D. Smith & Gregory J. Cooper, \nDisrupting Terrorist Financing with Civil Litigation, \n41 Case W. Res. J. Int\u2019l L. 65, 77\u201379 (2009). Losing the \nPSJVTA means losing a tried-and-true way to \ndisincentivize further terrorist attacks.   \nOne might think American judgments against a \nforeign organization are practically hollow. But that is \nnot the case here. It is eminently clear that the PLO \nand PA expend substantial time and resources \nattempting to avoid adverse judgments in U.S. courts. \nThere are various examples of the PLO and PA asking \ncourts to reverse default judgments against them so \nthey can litigate on the merits. See, e.g., Ungar v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 599 F.3d 79 (1st Cir. 2010); \nKnox v. Palestine Liberation Org., 248 F.R.D. 420 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2008). These organizations\u2019 fervent desire to \navoid U.S. judgments demonstrates the PSJVTA\u2019s \neffectiveness. In obstructing the PSJVTA, the decision \nbelow risks giving the PLO and PA the go-ahead to \ncontinue funding acts of terror abroad. This Court \nshould instead resolve the issue to support the \nobjectives of both Congress and the Executive in \nenacting the PSJVTA: to subject the PA and PLO to \nfederal jurisdiction and, in doing so, halt the funding \nof terrorism perpetrated against Americans. \n\n10 \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons stated above, this Court should \ngrant the writ of certiorari. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nASHLEY KELLER \n \nCounsel of Record \nKeller Postman LLC \n150 N.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has now achieved a critical balance. The acquisition of the respondents' merits brief has filled the major gap in my knowledge, allowing me to construct a dialectical understanding of the core legal conflicts. My belief state is no longer one-sided; it is now a comprehensive map of the competing arguments.\n\nMy updated beliefs are as follows:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict - The Nature of \"Consent\":** The case has crystallized around the meaning of consent in the context of personal jurisdiction.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** Consent can be established by statute based on a defendant's conduct. They rely on *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* to argue that if a corporation's registration to do business constitutes consent, then the PLO/PA's conduct (terror-related payments) is an even more compelling basis for \"deemed consent\" under the PSJVTA.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (New Information):** This \"deemed consent\" is a \"legislative fiat\" and a \"ruse.\" They argue that true consent, even when implied, must be based on a defendant's voluntary actions that \"amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of the court,\" citing *Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee*. They distinguish *Mallory* by arguing it was premised on a **reciprocal bargain**\u2014the corporation received the benefit of doing business in the state in exchange for consent. The PLO/PA, they contend, receive no such benefit from the U.S. government for the conduct that triggers jurisdiction (payments made abroad, UN activities in the U.S. permitted by international agreement, not U.S. law).\n\n*   **The Constitutional Debate - 5th vs. 14th Amendment:**\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** The stringent personal jurisdiction rules from *International Shoe* are a product of the 14th Amendment and interstate federalism, and do not constrain the sovereign power of the federal government under the 5th Amendment, especially in matters of foreign policy.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (New Information):** The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments reflect the same fundamental due process standards regarding personal jurisdiction. They argue that allowing Congress to impose jurisdiction based on constitutionally-inadequate conduct would \"eviscerate due process protections\" under either amendment.\n\n*   **The Battle over Originalism:** The historical ground is now contested territory.\n    *   **Petitioners' Originalism (Stable):** The Fifth Amendment, as understood in 1791, placed no limits on Congress's power to establish personal jurisdiction for federal courts.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter-Originalism (New Information):** They present a robust counter-narrative, arguing that Founding-era jurisprudence, informed by natural law and thinkers like Joseph Story (*Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws*), recognized territorial limits on jurisdiction as a core component of due process. They cite early cases like *Picquet v. Swan* (1828) to show that courts refused to exercise jurisdiction over defendants who were not present and had not consented, even when a statute seemed to permit it.\n\n*   **A New Decisional Path - Separation of Powers (New Information):** The respondents have introduced a powerful alternative argument that could allow the Court to avoid the thornier due process questions. They argue the PSJVTA violates the separation of powers by commanding a court to \"deem\" a fact (consent) to be true, thereby stripping the judiciary of its essential function of finding facts and applying law. They connect this to precedents like *Bank Markazi v. Peterson* and *United States v. Klein*.\n\n*   **Updated Prediction Model:** The respondents' brief significantly increases the probability that the Supreme Court will affirm the Second Circuit's decision and find the PSJVTA unconstitutional. The petitioners' case, which once appeared formidable due to the SG's backing and the *Mallory* precedent, now faces strong, direct rebuttals on every major point. The respondents' distinction of *Mallory* and their introduction of a separation of powers \"off-ramp\" provide the Court with multiple, well-reasoned paths to rule in their favor. The primary uncertainty is no longer *what* the arguments are, but *which framework* (originalism, modern due process, separation of powers) a majority of justices will find most persuasive.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation and the successful action that produced it have powerfully validated and refined my strategic framework for legal prediction. My meta-level understanding of effective analysis has matured significantly.\n\nMy design beliefs now incorporate the following principles:\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents:** This remains the bedrock principle. The progression from case facts to merits briefs is the confirmed optimal path for building a robust understanding.\n\n*   **Track the Solicitor General (with nuance):** The SG's participation remains a critical variable indicating a case's importance and lending weight to a position. However, this observation demonstrates that strong counter-arguments presented in a primary brief can provide the Court with a clear path to rule against the government. The SG's involvement raises the stakes but does not predetermine the winner.\n\n*   **New Heuristic - Build a Dialectical Map:** My previous heuristic of \"Map Argumentative Structure\" has evolved. It is not enough to map one side's arguments to find gaps. The superior method is to create a **dialectical map**, placing the petitioner's argument and the respondent's direct counter-argument side-by-side for each key issue. This creates a point-for-point view of the legal battlefield. For example:\n    *   **Issue:** *Mallory* Precedent\n    *   **Petitioner:** *Mallory* revives broad consent-based jurisdiction.\n    *   **Respondent:** *Mallory* is a narrow case requiring a reciprocal bargain, which is absent here.\n\n*   **New Heuristic - Identify \"Off-Ramps\":** The respondents' introduction of a separation of powers argument highlights a crucial pattern in Supreme Court litigation. Parties often provide the Court with narrower, alternative grounds for a decision (an \"off-ramp\") to avoid a sweeping and controversial constitutional ruling. A key strategic principle is now to actively search for these off-ramps (e.g., statutory interpretation, structural arguments like separation of powers, procedural issues) as they can be more attractive to a potential majority.\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction (Validated and Formalized):** This observation provides definitive proof of the value of my dynamic research strategy. The `Ingest -> Model -> Identify Gap -> Target -> Acquire` loop is now a formalized and validated core principle. By modeling the petitioners' case, I precisely identified the \"known unknown\" (the respondents' arguments), targeted it with a specific search, and acquired the exact information needed to advance my analysis. This iterative, targeted approach is demonstrably more efficient and effective than passive, linear information gathering."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case continues to grow in complexity and nuance. The introduction of a high-profile amicus brief on behalf of the petitioners has added a new dimension to their case, shifting some of the focus from pure legal doctrine to broader principles of foreign policy and separation of powers.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict - The Nature of \"Consent\" (Stable):** This remains the core doctrinal dispute.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** Consent can be statutorily \"deemed\" based on a defendant's conduct, per *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* The PLO/PA's terror-related payments are a compelling basis for such deemed consent.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (Stable):** This is a \"legislative fiat.\" True consent requires a voluntary submission to jurisdiction, as in *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*. They distinguish *Mallory* by highlighting the absence of a reciprocal bargain (the PLO/PA receives no benefit from the U.S. for the conduct that triggers jurisdiction).\n\n*   **The Constitutional Debate - 5th vs. 14th Amendment (Stable):** This foundational disagreement is unchanged.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** The 14th Amendment's *International Shoe* standard, rooted in interstate federalism, does not limit the federal government's sovereign power under the 5th Amendment, especially in foreign affairs.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (Stable):** The due process protections of both amendments are fundamentally the same regarding personal jurisdiction.\n\n*   **The Battle over Originalism (Stable):** The historical arguments remain in direct opposition.\n    *   **Petitioners' Originalism (Stable):** The Fifth Amendment, as originally understood, imposed no territorial limits on Congress's power to grant jurisdiction to federal courts.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter-Originalism (Stable):** Founding-era jurisprudence, informed by natural law and jurists like Joseph Story, recognized territorial limits as a core part of due process, citing cases like *Picquet v. Swan*.\n\n*   **The Separation of Powers Clash (Expanded and Contested):** What was previously a one-sided \"off-ramp\" for the respondents is now a contested battleground.\n    *   **Respondents' View (Stable):** The PSJVTA violates the separation of powers by commanding the judiciary to \"deem\" a jurisdictional fact (consent) to be true, stripping courts of their fact-finding function, akin to the issue in *United States v. Klein*.\n    *   **Petitioners' Counter (New Information from Amicus):** The Second Circuit's decision represents a judicial encroachment on the political branches' exclusive constitutional authority over foreign policy and national security. The amicus brief from former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo argues that counterterrorism policy is \"wholly confided\" to Congress and the Executive (*Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc.*), and courts should give extreme deference to their chosen methods, like the PSJVTA.\n\n*   **New Dimension - The Foreign Policy & National Security Frame (New Information):** The Pompeo amicus brief forcefully injects a policy-based argument for upholding the law. It contends that the PSJVTA is a vital and \"considered\" tool for U.S. counterterrorism, designed to deter the \"pay-for-slay\" program and disrupt terrorist financing. This argument frames the case not as a technical due process question, but as a matter of national security where the judiciary's role is \"highly constrained\" (*Trump v. Hawaii*).\n\n*   **Updated Prediction Model:** The respondents' direct rebuttals to the petitioners' core due process arguments remain legally robust. However, the petitioners' case is now bolstered by a powerful alternative framework of judicial deference to the political branches in foreign affairs. This new argument could be particularly persuasive to certain justices who prioritize executive power and national security. It provides a path for the Court to reverse the Second Circuit without deeply engaging the *Mallory* vs. *International Shoe* debate, instead ruling on broader institutional grounds. My confidence in a victory for the respondents has slightly decreased; the probability distribution has widened to account for the possibility that a majority coalesces around this national security deference argument. The key uncertainty is now a two-level question: 1) Will the Court decide this on narrow due process grounds or broad foreign policy grounds? 2) Within the chosen ground, which side's argument will prevail?",

My meta-level framework for legal prediction continues to evolve.\n\nMy design beliefs now incorporate these cumulative principles:\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents (Stable):** The bedrock principle remains unchanged. The sequential analysis of the case facts, petitioners' brief, respondents' brief, and now an amicus brief, has proven to be the optimal path for building a multi-layered and accurate model of the legal dispute.\n\n*   **Map the Political-Branch Ecosystem (Evolved Heuristic):** My previous heuristic to \"Track the Solicitor General\" was too narrow. This observation shows that in cases touching on foreign policy or national security, it is crucial to map the arguments from the entire political-branch \"ecosystem.\" This includes the current administration (via the SG), former executive officials (like Secretary Pompeo), and potentially legislative groups. These actors often introduce arguments centered on institutional power and policy that are distinct from, and sometimes more powerful than, the doctrinal arguments of the primary litigants.\n\n*   **Build a Dialectical Map (Validated and Expanded):** The value of mapping point-for-point argumentation is re-confirmed. This observation expands the map's complexity. It's not just Petitioner vs. Respondent on a single issue. It is now clear that there can be competing arguments on the same general principle (e.g., both sides now have a \"separation of powers\" claim) and different *types* of arguments (e.g., petitioners' legal argument from *Mallory* vs. their policy argument from the amicus brief).\n\n*   **Identify \"Off-Ramps\" and \"Alternative Frameworks\" (Evolved Heuristic):** My heuristic to find \"off-ramps\" (narrower grounds for a decision) is now supplemented by a more powerful concept: searching for \"alternative frameworks.\" The Pompeo brief does not offer a narrow escape; it attempts to reframe the entire case from a due process dispute into a national security deference case. Amicus briefs are therefore not just for reinforcement; they can be strategic attempts to change the lens through which the Court views the central conflict. A key task is now to identify when an amicus is merely supporting an existing argument versus when it is trying to change the game.\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction (Validated and Formalized):** The `Ingest -> Model -> Identify Gap -> Target -> Acquire` loop remains my core validated strategy. Having built a dialectical model from the merits briefs, my next implicit \"gap\" was understanding the arguments of other influential actors. The search for amicus briefs was a logical next step that successfully acquired information, adding a new and important dimension to my model and further reducing uncertainty about the potential paths to a final decision."

My prediction is currently based on incomplete, one-sided data, and this action will provide the necessary counter-arguments on every key issue (Mallory, foreign policy, separation of powers). The Design EIG is also high because this action serves as a direct and powerful validation of the newly formalized 'Perform Knowledge State Assessment' heuristic. Its success will confirm that pausing to identify and target the largest model imbalance is a highly efficient strategy for guiding the information-gathering process, thus refining my core design principles.",

For the same reasons, courts held \nthat Respondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot \nsupport jurisdiction.  Now, under the broad provisions \nof the PSJVTA, Petitioners assert that Respondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n\nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTION PRESENTED.......................................... i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ........................................ v \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 4 \nA. \nCourts Unanimously Agree \nRespondents Are Not Subject to \nPersonal Jurisdiction in the United \nStates. ....................................................... 5 \nB. \nCongress Tries Different Approaches \nto Jurisdiction in the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA. .................................................... 6 \nC. \nThe Lower Courts Unanimously Hold \nthat Applying the PSJVTA Would \nViolate Due Process. ................................. 7 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 10 \nARGUMENT ............................................................. 15 \nI. \nThe Act\u2019s \u201cDeemed Consent\u201d Provisions \nViolate Due Process. ....................................... 15 \nA.

App. 1a-5a.  \nINTRODUCTION  \nThe PSJVTA is the latest legislative attempt to \nundo an unbroken line of cases holding that \nRespondents PA and PLO are not subject to personal \njurisdiction in the United States for their alleged \ninvolvement in terrorist attacks in Israel and \nPalestine.  Time and again, courts have held that \nexercising personal jurisdiction over Respondents \nwould violate due process because the attacks did not \ntarget Americans, and Respondents lack any other \nconstitutionally-sufficient connection to the United \nStates.  Because jurisdictional due process protections \nare rooted in the Constitution, these decisions cannot \nbe undone by legislation. \nAs the Second Circuit held, the PSJVTA attempts \nan end-run around settled constitutional analysis by \ndeclaring that Respondents always shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d \nto \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction when they engage \nin the same conduct courts have previously held \ninsufficient to support jurisdiction under the Due \nProcess Clause.  Pet. App. 25a-38a, 44a. 1   The \nPSJVTA accordingly seeks to elide the constitutional \nboundaries of due process recognized in prior cases.   \nThe Second Circuit saw through this ruse, \nholding\u2014like every other federal court to consider the \nissue\u2014that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d imposed by legislative \nfiat cannot paper over the lack of any constitutionally-\nmeaningful connection between Respondents, the \nforum, and the conduct that gave rise to Plaintiffs\u2019 \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n2 \nclaims.  As the courts below recognized, the PSJVTA \nonly pretends to replace traditional due process \n\u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d \nanalysis \nwith \n\u201cconsent.\u201d  \nRespondents have not taken any actions that could be \nunderstood as submission to personal jurisdiction: \nthey did not sign a contract agreeing to jurisdiction, \nthey did not accept any benefit from the Government \nconditioned on submission to jurisdiction, and they \ndid not take any other actions signifying their express \nor implied agreement to litigate these disputes in the \nUnited States.  Rather, Respondents have repeatedly \nand successfully challenged personal jurisdiction on \nfacts nearly identical to those here. \nThe court of appeals scrupulously followed this \nCourt\u2019s guidance in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023) and Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (\u201cBauxites\u201d), 456 \nU.S. 694 (1982) in holding that Respondents\u2019 conduct \ndoes not meet due process standards for consent-\nbased jurisdiction.  Respondents have not taken any \naction that manifests submission to jurisdiction under \nBauxites.  And the PSJVTA does not grant any benefit \nto Respondents in exchange for submission to \njurisdiction that could bring this case closer to \nMallory.  The court of appeals thus explained that \n\u201cCongress cannot take conduct otherwise insufficient \nto support an inference of consent\u201d and \u201cbrand it as \n\u2018consent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 44a.   \nUnder Mallory, neither form of conduct relied upon \nby Petitioners\u2014making payments in Palestine and \nconducting UN-related activities in the United \nStates\u2014signals Respondents\u2019 submission to personal \njurisdiction in the United States.  As to the payments, \nthat is because the United States does not have \nantecedent authority to permit them in the first \nplace\u2014just as Pennsylvania could not offer a company \n\n3 \nthe right to do business in New Jersey in exchange for \nconsent to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania.  As to the \nactivity prong, the PSJVTA specifically excludes \n\u201cofficial\u201d UN business and \u201cancillary\u201d activities, does \nnot \nwaive \nor \nwithdraw \npreexisting \nstatutory \nrestrictions on Respondents\u2019 activities in the United \nStates, and does not permit any U.S. activity at all by \nRespondents.  In turn, since at least the PSJVTA\u2019s \neffective date, Respondents perform no U.S. activities \noutside the UN sphere (whether those activities are \ndenominated \u201cofficial\u201d UN activity or \u201cancillary\u201d \nactivity).  The PSJVTA merely avoids interfering with \nthe United Nations\u2019 preexisting authority to grant \ninternational actors \u201cinvitee\u201d status. \nAllowing Congress to impose \u201cconsent\u201d on \nRespondents in these circumstances would swallow \nthe due process test and eviscerate the meaning of \nconsent.  If due process required nothing more than \nnotice, then nothing would stop Congress from \ndecreeing that a defendant shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction by engaging in \nany activity anywhere in the world.  These are not \nmerely theoretical concerns.  That is precisely what \nthe PSJVTA purports to do here.  The Government\u2019s \nargument that such jurisdiction could satisfy \n\u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under a \u201cflexible\u201d due process \nstandard that \u201cdepends on the type of actor involved\u201d \n(Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 25), underscores Petitioners\u2019 failure to \noffer any meaningful or consistent guardrails.   \nNor can the PSJVTA be upheld as an exercise of \nthe enumerated power to punish extraterritorial \noffenses.  Although Petitioners significantly overread \nthe scope of that power, the bottom line is that \nCongress cannot impose personal jurisdiction as a \npunishment or sanction.  This Court\u2019s decisions hold \nthat personal jurisdiction must be independently \n\n4 \nestablished consistent with due process minimum \ncontacts even when Congress has the power to enact \nstatutes with extraterritorial substantive reach. \nNor does Plaintiffs\u2019 historical argument save the \nstatute.  The founders believed due process of law \nprotected the natural rights of individuals, and early \nAmerican courts regularly held that personal \njurisdiction protections were safeguarded from \nCongressional interference.  Neither the payments \nnor Respondents\u2019 alleged \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d UN-\nrelated actions are within the territorial authority of \nthe United States.  The Framers never imagined that \nCongress would have power to create jurisdiction over \nforeign actors for conduct not within the territorial \nlimits of, and not directed at, the United States.   \nSTATEMENT \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a.  The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \nand public schools, with over 155,000 government \nemployees.  Id. at 143a-44a.  Under the Oslo Accords, \nthe PLO conducts Palestinian foreign affairs, \nincluding operating its mission to the United Nations.  \nId. at 6a; see also JA 65-68 (State Dept. Statement of \nInterest).  The United States does not recognize \nRespondents as sovereign.  Gov\u2019t Br. 3; Pet. App. 153a.   \nRespondents \nare \ncurrently \nforbidden \nfrom \noperating in the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n5201(b), 5202; Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, \nPub. L. No. 109-446, \u00a7 7(a)2, 120 Stat. 3318 (22 U.S.C. \n2 Plaintiffs erroneously cite Section 7(b), rather than Section \n7(a), of the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, which is the \nprovision cited by the Second Circuit.

For the same reasons, courts held \nthat Respondents\u2019 alleged U.S. activities cannot \nsupport jurisdiction.  Now, under the broad provisions \nof the PSJVTA, Petitioners assert that Respondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction in the United \nStates by engaging in the same conduct previously \nheld insufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nas a matter of due process. \nThe question presented is:  \nWhether the Second Circuit correctly held that the \nPSJVTA violates due process by requiring courts to \n\u201cdeem\u201d that Respondents \u201chave consented\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction based on conduct that cannot \nsupport a presumption that Respondents have \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States.   \n\nii \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTION PRESENTED.......................................... i \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ........................................ v \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 4 \nA. \nCourts Unanimously Agree \nRespondents Are Not Subject to \nPersonal Jurisdiction in the United \nStates. ....................................................... 5 \nB. \nCongress Tries Different Approaches \nto Jurisdiction in the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA. .................................................... 6 \nC. \nThe Lower Courts Unanimously Hold \nthat Applying the PSJVTA Would \nViolate Due Process. ................................. 7 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 10 \nARGUMENT ............................................................. 15 \nI. \nThe Act\u2019s \u201cDeemed Consent\u201d Provisions \nViolate Due Process. ....................................... 15 \nA.

App. 1a-5a.  \nINTRODUCTION  \nThe PSJVTA is the latest legislative attempt to \nundo an unbroken line of cases holding that \nRespondents PA and PLO are not subject to personal \njurisdiction in the United States for their alleged \ninvolvement in terrorist attacks in Israel and \nPalestine.  Time and again, courts have held that \nexercising personal jurisdiction over Respondents \nwould violate due process because the attacks did not \ntarget Americans, and Respondents lack any other \nconstitutionally-sufficient connection to the United \nStates.  Because jurisdictional due process protections \nare rooted in the Constitution, these decisions cannot \nbe undone by legislation. \nAs the Second Circuit held, the PSJVTA attempts \nan end-run around settled constitutional analysis by \ndeclaring that Respondents always shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d \nto \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction when they engage \nin the same conduct courts have previously held \ninsufficient to support jurisdiction under the Due \nProcess Clause.  Pet. App. 25a-38a, 44a. 1   The \nPSJVTA accordingly seeks to elide the constitutional \nboundaries of due process recognized in prior cases.   \nThe Second Circuit saw through this ruse, \nholding\u2014like every other federal court to consider the \nissue\u2014that \u201cdeemed consent\u201d imposed by legislative \nfiat cannot paper over the lack of any constitutionally-\nmeaningful connection between Respondents, the \nforum, and the conduct that gave rise to Plaintiffs\u2019 \n1 Pet. App. refers to the appendix to Plaintiffs\u2019 petition.  \n\n2 \nclaims.  As the courts below recognized, the PSJVTA \nonly pretends to replace traditional due process \n\u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d \nanalysis \nwith \n\u201cconsent.\u201d  \nRespondents have not taken any actions that could be \nunderstood as submission to personal jurisdiction: \nthey did not sign a contract agreeing to jurisdiction, \nthey did not accept any benefit from the Government \nconditioned on submission to jurisdiction, and they \ndid not take any other actions signifying their express \nor implied agreement to litigate these disputes in the \nUnited States.  Rather, Respondents have repeatedly \nand successfully challenged personal jurisdiction on \nfacts nearly identical to those here. \nThe court of appeals scrupulously followed this \nCourt\u2019s guidance in Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023) and Ins. Corp. of Ireland, Ltd. v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee (\u201cBauxites\u201d), 456 \nU.S. 694 (1982) in holding that Respondents\u2019 conduct \ndoes not meet due process standards for consent-\nbased jurisdiction.  Respondents have not taken any \naction that manifests submission to jurisdiction under \nBauxites.  And the PSJVTA does not grant any benefit \nto Respondents in exchange for submission to \njurisdiction that could bring this case closer to \nMallory.  The court of appeals thus explained that \n\u201cCongress cannot take conduct otherwise insufficient \nto support an inference of consent\u201d and \u201cbrand it as \n\u2018consent.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 44a.   \nUnder Mallory, neither form of conduct relied upon \nby Petitioners\u2014making payments in Palestine and \nconducting UN-related activities in the United \nStates\u2014signals Respondents\u2019 submission to personal \njurisdiction in the United States.  As to the payments, \nthat is because the United States does not have \nantecedent authority to permit them in the first \nplace\u2014just as Pennsylvania could not offer a company \n\n3 \nthe right to do business in New Jersey in exchange for \nconsent to jurisdiction in Pennsylvania.  As to the \nactivity prong, the PSJVTA specifically excludes \n\u201cofficial\u201d UN business and \u201cancillary\u201d activities, does \nnot \nwaive \nor \nwithdraw \npreexisting \nstatutory \nrestrictions on Respondents\u2019 activities in the United \nStates, and does not permit any U.S. activity at all by \nRespondents.  In turn, since at least the PSJVTA\u2019s \neffective date, Respondents perform no U.S. activities \noutside the UN sphere (whether those activities are \ndenominated \u201cofficial\u201d UN activity or \u201cancillary\u201d \nactivity).  The PSJVTA merely avoids interfering with \nthe United Nations\u2019 preexisting authority to grant \ninternational actors \u201cinvitee\u201d status. \nAllowing Congress to impose \u201cconsent\u201d on \nRespondents in these circumstances would swallow \nthe due process test and eviscerate the meaning of \nconsent.  If due process required nothing more than \nnotice, then nothing would stop Congress from \ndecreeing that a defendant shall be \u201cdeemed\u201d to have \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction by engaging in \nany activity anywhere in the world.  These are not \nmerely theoretical concerns.  That is precisely what \nthe PSJVTA purports to do here.  The Government\u2019s \nargument that such jurisdiction could satisfy \n\u201cfundamental fairness\u201d under a \u201cflexible\u201d due process \nstandard that \u201cdepends on the type of actor involved\u201d \n(Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 25), underscores Petitioners\u2019 failure to \noffer any meaningful or consistent guardrails.   \nNor can the PSJVTA be upheld as an exercise of \nthe enumerated power to punish extraterritorial \noffenses.  Although Petitioners significantly overread \nthe scope of that power, the bottom line is that \nCongress cannot impose personal jurisdiction as a \npunishment or sanction.  This Court\u2019s decisions hold \nthat personal jurisdiction must be independently \n\n4 \nestablished consistent with due process minimum \ncontacts even when Congress has the power to enact \nstatutes with extraterritorial substantive reach. \nNor does Plaintiffs\u2019 historical argument save the \nstatute.  The founders believed due process of law \nprotected the natural rights of individuals, and early \nAmerican courts regularly held that personal \njurisdiction protections were safeguarded from \nCongressional interference.  Neither the payments \nnor Respondents\u2019 alleged \u201cofficial\u201d and \u201cancillary\u201d UN-\nrelated actions are within the territorial authority of \nthe United States.  The Framers never imagined that \nCongress would have power to create jurisdiction over \nforeign actors for conduct not within the territorial \nlimits of, and not directed at, the United States.   \nSTATEMENT \nThe PA is the domestic government of parts of the \nWest Bank and the Gaza Strip, collectively referred to \nas \u201cPalestine.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a.  The PA provides \nconventional government services, including public \nsafety, healthcare, transportation, a judicial system, \nand public schools, with over 155,000 government \nemployees.  Id. at 143a-44a.  Under the Oslo Accords, \nthe PLO conducts Palestinian foreign affairs, \nincluding operating its mission to the United Nations.  \nId. at 6a; see also JA 65-68 (State Dept. Statement of \nInterest).  The United States does not recognize \nRespondents as sovereign.  Gov\u2019t Br. 3; Pet. App. 153a.   \nRespondents \nare \ncurrently \nforbidden \nfrom \noperating in the United States.  See 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n5201(b), 5202; Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, \nPub. L. No. 109-446, \u00a7 7(a)2, 120 Stat. 3318 (22 U.S.C. \n2 Plaintiffs erroneously cite Section 7(b), rather than Section \n7(a), of the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, which is the \nprovision cited by the Second Circuit.  Pls. Br. 45 n.11 (citing Pet. \n\n5 \n\u00a7 2378b note); United States v. PLO, 695 F. Supp. 1456, \n1465-68, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988).  An invitation from the \nUnited Nations affords the sole exception, permitting \nPalestine\u2019s UN mission to conduct activities relating \nto its role as a UN Non-Member State \u201cinvitee.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 10a n.2.  The PLO had a diplomatic mission in \nWashington, D.C., but that office closed in 2018, \nbefore \nthe \nPSJVTA \nbecame \neffective. \n \nIbid.\nRespondents have no other offices and conduct no \nactivities in the United States.  Id. at 28a, 64a. \nA.\nCourts Unanimously Agree Respondents \nAre Not Subject to Personal Jurisdiction \nin the United States. \nBecause Respondents\u2019 alleged actions do not have \nany constitutionally-meaningful connection to the \nUnited States, federal courts have long held that \nexercising personal jurisdiction over Respondents for \nalleged attacks in Israel and Palestine would violate \ndue process.  In Sokolow, Plaintiffs brought Anti-\nTerrorism Act claims for attacks allegedly assisted by \nRespondents.  Id. at 140a.  The Second Circuit \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction because Respondents\u2019 \nU.S. activities were not related to the attacks, and the \nattacks themselves \u201cwere not expressly aimed at the \nUnited States.\u201d  Id. at 170a-78a.  That Americans \nwere injured was \u201crandom and fortuitous.\u201d  Id. at 170a.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 experts confirmed the \u201ckilling was indeed \nrandom\u201d as the attackers fired \u201cindiscriminately.\u201d  \nIbid.3\nApp. 28a n.9).  Section 7(a) prohibits the PA from operating in \nthe U.S. absent presidential certification.  The Government \nacknowledges Section 7(a) remains in effect.  Gov\u2019t Br. 7, 42. \n3 The D.C. Circuit reached the same conclusion in look-alike \ncases.  Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 58 (D.C. Cir. \n2017); Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., 923 F.3d 1115, 1127 (D.C. \n\n6 \nPlaintiffs sought review by this Court, but the \nUnited States recommended against certiorari.  Resp. \nApp. 7a.  It warned that Plaintiffs\u2019 Fifth Amendment \nanalysis was \u201cnot [] well developed\u201d and that the \ndecision did \u201cnot conflict with any decision of this \nCourt [or] implicate any conflict among the courts of \nappeals.\u201d  Id. at 13a, 21a-24a.  The United States \nrejected the argument that denying jurisdiction \nharmed other anti-terrorism efforts: \u201c[N]othing in the \ncourt\u2019s opinion calls into question the United States\u2019 \nability to prosecute defendants under the broader due \nprocess principles the courts have recognized in cases \ninvolving the application of U.S. criminal laws to \nconduct affecting U.S. citizens or interests.\u201d  Id. at 24a.  \nThis Court denied certiorari.  Sokolow v. PLO, 584 U.S. \n915 (2018). \nB.\nCongress Tries Different Approaches to \nJurisdiction in the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA. \nIn response to these decisions, Congress passed the \nAnti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (\u201cATCA\u201d), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183 (2018).  The ATCA \nprovided that Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted \neither of two government benefits: (1) specified U.S. \nforeign assistance, or (2) maintaining a U.S. office \npursuant to an Executive Branch waiver of the \nstatutory prohibitions on Respondents\u2019 activities in \nthe United States. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs sought to revive their case \nunder the ATCA by moving to recall the mandate.  \nThe Second Circuit denied their request because \nRespondents did not accept either of the government \nCir. 2019); Shatsky v. PLO, 955 F.3d 1016, 1037-38 (D.C. Cir. \n2020).  \n\n7 \nbenefits specified in the ATCA, and given the interest \nin judicial finality.  Pet. App. 134a-35a; see also\nKlieman, 923 F.3d at 1128.  The Sokolow plaintiffs \npetitioned for certiorari, but Congress intervened \nagain by enacting the PSJVTA in December 2019.   \nThe PSJVTA requires courts to always \u201cdeem\u201d that \nRespondents \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction if, \nafter certain dates, they engage in either of two types \nof conduct: (i) outside the United States, making \npayments relating to Palestinians imprisoned or \nkilled as a result of committing overseas attacks \nharming American nationals; or (ii) in the United \nStates, engaging in \u201cany activity\u201d other than UN \nparticipation, meetings with government officials, and \nactivities \u201cancillary\u201d thereto.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e).  The \nPSJVTA, in other words, takes the same conduct \npreviously held as insufficient to create personal \njurisdiction, and instructs courts to treat it as \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d to jurisdiction.     \nThis Court issued a GVR for further consideration \nin light of the PSJVTA.  Pet. App. 13a.  The Fuld\nplaintiffs filed a separate case, relying on the PSJVTA \nas the \u201csole basis\u201d for jurisdiction.  Ibid.  The \nGovernment intervened in both cases to defend the \nstatute. \nC.\nThe Lower Courts Unanimously Hold \nthat Applying the PSJVTA Would Violate \nDue Process.  \nRespondents raised an as-applied challenge to the \nPSJVTA, arguing that the conduct alleged by \nPlaintiffs could not give rise to valid \u201cconsent\u201d to \njurisdiction.  Sokolow C.A. Def. Supp. Br. #569 at 7 \n(\u201cPSJVTA \u2026 is unconstitutional as applied to \nDefendants in these cases\u201d); Fuld C.A. Def. Supp. Br. \n#222 at 7 (same); Sokolow & Fuld Oral Arg. (2d Cir. \n\n8 \nMay 3, 2023) at 20:30 (\u201cThis is not a facial challenge.  \nThis is an as applied challenge to the statute.\u201d).  Both \ndistrict courts held that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provisions violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause.  Pet. App. 15a, 60a.  They \nreviewed extensive evidence and briefing regarding \nthe factual predicates of the PSJVTA, but declined to \ndecide if the activities predicate was satisfied.  Id. at \n15a, 67a-68a, 74a.  Two other courts reached the same \nconclusion.  Shatsky v. PLO, No. 18-12355, 2022 WL \n826409, *4-5 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 18, 2022); Levine v. PLO, \n688 F. Supp. 3d 1001, 1010 (D. Colo. 2023).  \nThe Second Circuit affirmed, holding that the \nPSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d scheme \u201ccannot support \na fair and reasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 \nvoluntary agreement to proceed in a federal forum.\u201d  \nPet. App. 26a.  \u201cCongress cannot take conduct \notherwise insufficient to support an inference of \nconsent, brand it as \u2018consent,\u2019 and then decree that a \ndefendant, after some time has passed, is \u2018deemed to \nhave consented\u2019 to the loss of a due process right for \nengaging in that conduct.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  \u201cThis \nunprecedented \nframework \nfor \nconsent-based \njurisdiction,\u201d the court concluded, \u201cpredicated on \nconduct that is not \u2018of such a nature as to justify the \nfiction\u2019 of consent, cannot be reconciled with \n\u2018traditional notions of fair play and substantial \njustice.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  \nThe Second Circuit relied on this Court\u2019s recent \ndecision \nin \nMallory, \nwhich \n\u201cunderscores\u201d \nthe \ndifference \u201cbetween the PSJVTA and business \nregistration statutes,\u201d because unlike the statute at \nissue in Mallory, the \u201cPSJVTA does not require that \nthe PLO and the PA consent to jurisdiction as a \ncondition of securing a legal right to do business in the \nUnited States, which remains prohibited under \n\n9 \ncurrent law.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  Unlike the corporate \ndefendants in Mallory, Respondents did not accept \n\u201csome in-forum benefit in return for an agreement to \nbe amenable to suit in the United States.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt thus affirmed the dismissal in Fuld and denied \nthe motion to recall the Sokolow mandate.  Pet. App. \n52a, 70a.  \nThe Second Circuit then denied en banc review.  In \na concurrence to that denial, Judge Bianco (a member \nof the Panel) explained that nothing in the Panel\u2019s \nopinion requires an \u201cexchange of benefits\u201d as the sole \nbasis to infer consent, and that the PSJVTA in any \nevent falls outside the Mallory line of \u201cexchange of \nbenefits\u201d cases.  Id. at 212a-15a.  Adopting the new \n\u201cnexus\u201d tests proposed by Petitioners, he explained, \n\u201cwould allow Congress to subject any foreign entity to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States, even in the \nabsence of any contacts with the United States, if that \nentity knowingly and voluntary engages in any \nconduct around the world (with some undefined nexus \nto the United States) after Congress enacts legislation \ndeeming the continuation of that conduct to constitute \nconsent.\u201d  Id. at 216a.  This \u201cwould allow the \ngovernment to declare conduct to be consent, even if \nthat conduct could not reasonably be considered to be \nconsent.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n10 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. To establish valid \u201cconsent,\u201d a plaintiff must \ndemonstrate \u201cactions of the defendant\u201d that support a \n\u201cpresumption\u201d the defendant submitted to jurisdiction \nin the forum.  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-09 (discussing \nthe \u201cHammond Packing presumption\u201d).  A Bauxites \n\u201cpresumption\u201d of \u201clegal submission to \u2026 jurisdiction\u201d \nmust rest on conduct by the defendant that is \n\u201cmaterial\u201d or \u201crelated\u201d to the issue of jurisdiction over \nthe defendant.  Ibid.; see Pet. App. 31a (facts \nunderlying Hammond Packing presumption were \n\u201cmaterial\u201d and \u201crelated to\u201d jurisdiction).  In applying \nthis rule, this Court has distinguished between a \ndefendant\u2019s voluntary conduct signaling submission \nto jurisdiction, and \u201c\u2018mere assertions\u2019 of power\u201d by the \nforum to impose jurisdiction on a nonconsenting \ndefendant.  Id. at 704-05; see also College Savings \nBank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Educ. Expense \nBd., 527 U.S. 666, 675 (1999) (State must make \u201ca \n\u2018clear declaration\u2019 that it intends to submit itself to \nour jurisdiction\u201d).   \nAs one barometer for submission under Bauxites, \ncourts recognize a narrow category of \u201cimplied consent\u201d \nstatutes by which a party agrees to personal \njurisdiction by accepting a benefit conditioned by the \nforum on consent.  This Court\u2019s recent decision in \nMallory\u2014where all four opinions cited Bauxites\u2014falls \nsquarely within this category.  As the Court explained, \nthe business registration statute at issue in Mallory\nrequired foreign corporations to submit to jurisdiction \n\u201cin exchange for status as a registered foreign \ncorporation and the benefits that entails.\u201d  600 U.S. at \n127 (plurality op.) (emphasis added); see also id. at \n167 (Barrett, J., dissenting) (explaining the majority\u2019s \nstandard \u201ccasts [the statute] as setting the terms of a \nbargain\u201d).  Though this Court fractured on whether \n\n11 \nthe bargain was fair, everyone agreed that Norfolk \nSouthern had accepted the benefits of the bargain.  \nThis case is the opposite of Mallory.  The PSJVTA \noffers no exchange from which the presumption of \n\u201cconsent\u201d or submission can be reasonably inferred.  \nSee Pet. App. 28a, 35a-36a & n.13.  The PSJVTA \ncreates two triggers for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d jurisdiction.  \nIn the first, the statute provides that a payment \nprogram limited exclusively to Palestine, which courts \nhad previously held was not aimed at the United \nStates in any way, creates \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \njurisdiction in the United States.  Unlike the statute \nin Mallory, neither Congress nor the Executive has \nantecedent \nauthority \nto \ngrant \nRespondents \npermission to make, or not make, those payments.  \nThe PSJVTA simply punishes Respondents for the \nprogram.  Respondents have ended that program, but \nthe statute imposes personal jurisdiction for making \npayments that the United States had no power to \npermit or prohibit in the first place. \nThe second trigger provides that Respondents \nshall be \u201cdeemed\u201d to consent to jurisdiction if they \nundertake \u201cany activity\u201d in the United States that is \nnot part of or \u201cancillary\u201d to United Nations or \ndiplomatic activity.  Like Pennsylvania in Mallory, \nthe United States can exclude Respondents from its \nterritory.  And it has successfully done so.  But unlike \nthe statute in Mallory, the PSJVTA does not grant \nany territorial access to Respondents, does not waive \nor withdraw preexisting statutory restrictions on \nRespondents\u2019 U.S. activities, and does not permit any \nactivity at all by Respondents.  See Pet. App. 29a, 35a.  \nThe activities prong does not offer any \u201cbenefit\u201d for \nRespondents to accept, in exchange for their \npurported consent.  And in any event, Respondents \n\n12 \nhave not taken non-UN actions in the United States \nthat could trigger that prong in the first place.   \nThe Government\u2019s new \u201cexchange of undertakings\u201d \nrationale for the PSJVTA (Gov\u2019t Br. 20) does not solve \nthis problem.  The only \u201cbenefit\u201d offered to \nRespondents is the \u201cbenefit of avoiding jurisdiction in \nATA suits.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 41 (emphasis added).  This is \nentirely circular, and contrary to Bauxites, and would \nsupport consent jurisdiction in every instance where \nCongress purports to impose jurisdiction.   \n2. Petitioners\u2019 amorphous new warning-plus-nexus \ntest for consent jurisdiction supplants traditional \nminimum contacts on the one hand, and the \nBauxites/Mallory framework for deemed consent on \nthe other, yet provides no meaningful guardrails in \ntheir place.  See Pet. App. 35a-38a & n.13.  The test \nproposed by Petitioners is entirely ad hoc in both its \nformulation and application, see Gov\u2019t Br. 34-38, and \nprovides no prospective guidance on a dependable \nrule, or any limiting principle.  The grab-bag list of \nfactors advocated by the Government under its \n\u201cflexible\u201d approach to due process offers no general, \neven-handed rule for this Court to divine.  See ibid.   \nThe Court has already rejected the same \u201cnotice\u201d \nformulation of consent that Petitioners advance now, \nsee College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 679-80, and for \ngood reason.  Petitioners effectively ask whether \nCongress can impose jurisdiction on Respondents, \nwhen the actual text of the PSJVTA asks if \nRespondents can be deemed to have consented to \njurisdiction.  Implied consent \u201ccannot be based solely \non a government decree\u201d that the defendant \u201cconsents\u201d \nby engaging in \u201cactivities unrelated to being sued in \nthe forum.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  Otherwise, if \u201cnotice\u201d alone \ncould serve as a valid basis for implying consent to \njurisdiction, there is no end to the types of activities \n\n13 \nthat could give rise to \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \njurisdiction.   \nTo avoid that critique, Petitioners advocate a sea \nchange in Fifth Amendment jurisdictional due process, \ncontending that due process limits under the \nFourteenth Amendment have no application here.  \nBut as Mallory explained, distinctions \u201csounding in \nfederalism\u201d\u2014often \nurged \nas \nthe \nchief \nfactor \ndistinguishing due process under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendment\u2014play no role in analyzing \nthe constitutionality of a consent statute, as the \nPSJVTA purports to be.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144 \n(plurality op.); see also id. at 156 (Alito, J., concurring \nin part).  Moreover, no court has ever agreed that the \nFifth Amendment requires only a generic \u201cfairness\u201d \ntest uninformed by this Court\u2019s prior limitations on \npersonal jurisdiction.   \n3. The decision below is also faithful to the original \npublic understanding of the Fifth Amendment.  \nFounding-era sources indicate that due process \nlimited the extraterritorial reach of the federal courts.  \nEarly cases further demonstrate that due-process \nlimits on discriminatory legislation were seen as \nessential to protecting individual liberty.  These \nhistorical \nlimits \nwork \nagainst \nthe \nPSJVTA: \nRespondents\u2019 alleged UN activities are not considered \nto be within the territorial authority of the United \nStates; and the PSJVTA singles out Respondents to \nreceive less jurisdictional due process. \nPlaintiffs rely on the enumerated power to \u201cdefine \nand punish\u201d extraterritorial offenses (Art. I, \u00a7 8, cl.10).  \nThat clause does not apply here.  In any case, Bauxites \nand College Savings hold that jurisdiction cannot be \nimposed as \u201cpunishment\u201d or a \u201csanction\u201d for a \ndefendant\u2019s disfavored conduct.  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n706 (discussing Hovey v. Elliott, 167 U.S. 409 (1897)); \n\n14 \nCollege Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 686-87.  Nor does \nPlaintiffs\u2019 theory fit under Mallory, which instead \nrequired the forum\u2019s power to permit conduct on \ncondition and treated acceptance of permission as a \nwaiver.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144-45 (\u201cpersonal \njurisdiction is a personal defense that may be waived \nor forfeited\u201d by \u201caccepting an in-state benefit with \njurisdictional strings attached\u201d) (plurality op.); id. at \n147-48 (waiver occurs when \u201ca defendant \u2026 \nvoluntarily invoke[s] certain benefits from a State \nthat are conditioned on submitting to the State\u2019s \njurisdiction\u201d) (Jackson, J., concurring).  The PSJVTA \nincludes no such permission.  \n4. This Court may also affirm on the alternative \nground that the PSJVTA violates the separation-of-\npowers doctrine.  The PSJVTA attempts to usurp the \njudicial function by dictating that courts must always \nfind \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction if Respondents \nengage in certain activities.  In our system, courts \ndetermine whether conduct satisfies the due process \ntest for submission to jurisdiction, and courts have \nalready \nheld \nthat \nthose \nsame \nactivities \nare \ninsufficient to support the exercise of jurisdiction \nunder the Due Process Clause. \n5.  Finally, Plaintiffs misstate the factual record \nregarding Respondents\u2019 alleged activities in the \nUnited States.  No court has concluded that \nRespondents\u2019 activities were sufficient to trigger \njurisdiction under the activities prong.  And \nRespondents have consistently contested Plaintiffs\u2019 \nallegations that they engaged in any non-UN related \nactivities in the United States after the trigger date.   \n\n15 \nARGUMENT \nI.\nThe Act\u2019s \u201cDeemed Consent\u201d Provisions \nViolate Due Process. \n\u201cThe Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s \nliberty interest in not being subject to the binding \njudgments of a forum with which he has established \nno meaningful \u2018contacts, ties, or relations.\u2019\u201d  Burger \nKing Corp. v. Rudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 471-72 (1985) \n(quoting Int\u2019l Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n319 (1945)).  Because the \u201cassertion of jurisdiction\u201d \nover a foreign defendant \u201cexposes [the defendant] to \nthe State\u2019s coercive power,\u201d it is subject to review in \nfederal court for \u201ccompatibility\u201d with due process.  \nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 \nU.S. 915, 918 (2011) (holding assertion of personal \njurisdiction over foreign corporations violated due \nprocess).  The personal jurisdiction requirement \n\u201crepresents a restriction on judicial power not as a \nmatter of sovereignty, but as a matter of individual \nliberty.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 702. \nThis Court\u2019s cases have typically focused on \u201ctwo \nkinds of personal jurisdiction: general (sometimes \ncalled \nall-purpose) \njurisdiction \nand \nspecific \n(sometimes called case-linked) jurisdiction.\u201d  Ford \nMotor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Judicial Dist. Court, 592 \nU.S. 351, 358, 365 (2021).  General jurisdiction \n\u201cextends to \u2018any and all claims\u2019 brought against a \ndefendant,\u201d but is available \u201conly when a defendant is \n\u2018essentially at home\u2019\u201d in the forum.  Ibid.  Specific \njurisdiction \n\u201ccovers \ndefendants \nless \nintimately \nconnected\u201d to the forum, \u201cbut only as to a narrower \nclass of claims.\u201d  Id. at 359.  Specific jurisdiction \napplies when the defendant \u201ctake[s] some act by \nwhich it purposefully avails itself of the privilege of \nconducting activities within the forum,\u201d and the \n\n16 \nplaintiff\u2019s claims \u201carise out of or relate to the \ndefendant\u2019s contacts with the forum.\u201d  Ibid. (cleaned \nup). \nThis case, however, does not involve either of those \ntraditional forms of personal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. \n18a.  Respondents are not subject to general \njurisdiction, because they are not \u201cfairly regarded as \nat home\u201d in the United States.  See Livnat, 851 F.3d \nat 56-57 (explaining Respondents\u2019 \u201cheadquarters, \nofficials, and primary activities are all in the West \nBank\u201d).  And Respondents are not subject to specific \njurisdiction, because they have not engaged in any \n\u201csuit-related conduct\u201d in the United States.  Pet. App. \n166a; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 56-57; Shatsky, 955 F.3d at \n1037.  Contrary to the assertions of some amici,4 it is \nundisputed the attacks at issue \u201cwere not expressly \naimed at the United States,\u201d but rather \u201caffected \nUnited States citizens only because they were victims \nof indiscriminate violence that occurred abroad.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 168a, 170a; see also Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1124-\n26; Pet. App. 7a-9a.  Indeed, Petitioners do not argue \nthat Respondents are subject to either general or \nspecific jurisdiction in this case.5\n4 See, e.g., ACLJ Br. 8 (claiming \u201cthe crucial fact supporting \njurisdiction\u201d is \u201c[Respondents\u2019] ongoing funding of terrorist \nactivity towards the United States\u201d); id. at 17 (inaccurately \nasserting Respondents engaged in \u201ctargeted support of the \nkilling of Americans\u201d); House Br. 8 (claiming Congress intended \nto hold Respondents \u201caccountable \u2026 for their attacks on \nAmericans\u201d). \n5  In Fuld, plaintiffs did not allege that Respondents had \nsufficient contacts with the United States to support the exercise \nof general or specific jurisdiction.  JA 384-85 (identifying the \nPSJVTA as sole basis for personal jurisdiction); Pet. App. 12a-\n13a, 18a-19a.  The Fuld plaintiffs also did not challenge the \ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion that the complaint failed to sufficiently \n\n17 \nInstead, Petitioners rely on a third traditional \nbasis for establishing personal jurisdiction: consent.  \nLatching onto the \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions of the \nPSJVTA, \nPetitioners \nassert \nthat \nRespondents \n\u201cconsented\u201d to personal jurisdiction by engaging in \nprecisely the same types of activities previously held \ninsufficient to support the exercise of general or \nspecific jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.  \nPetitioners make this claim despite the fact that \nRespondents have contested jurisdiction at every turn, \nand have not taken any action that would reasonably \nsupport a presumption they have submitted to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States.  As every \ncourt to consider the issue has concluded, allowing \nCongress to impose \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction in such \ncircumstances would \u201cpush the concept of consent well \nbeyond its breaking point,\u201d letting \u201cfiction get the \nbetter of fact and mak[ing] a mockery of the Due \nProcess Clause.\u201d  Pet. App. 123a-24a. \nA. Implied Consent Must Be Based on Some \nActions of the Defendant that \u201cAmount \nto a Legal Submission to the Jurisdiction \nof the Court.\u201d \nAs this Court recently reaffirmed in Mallory, \n\u201c\u2018express or implied consent\u2019 can continue to ground \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014and consent may be manifested \nin various ways by word or deed.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. \nat 138 (plurality op.); see also id. at 153 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (\u201cConsent is a separate basis for \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d).  \u201cBecause the requirement of \npersonal jurisdiction represents first of all an \nallege the attack targeted Americans.  Pet. App. 104a n.4.  The \nSokolow plaintiffs do not now challenge the Second Circuit\u2019s \nholding that they likewise failed to establish general or specific \njurisdiction.  Pet. App. 157a-80a.   \n\n18 \nindividual right, it can, like other such rights, be \nwaived.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 703.  And in \ndetermining whether a statute gives rise to valid \nconsent to personal jurisdiction, Mallory confirmed \nthat this Court\u2019s prior decision in Bauxites sets forth \nthe appropriate standard.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n138, 145-46 (plurality op.); see also id. at 147-49 \n(Jackson, \nJ., \nconcurring) \n(finding \nBauxites\n\u201cparticularly instructive\u201d); id. at 153, 156 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part) (citing Bauxites); id. at 167 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (same). \nBauxites establishes two basic principles that \nguide the consent inquiry\u2014the second of which \nPetitioners \nlargely \nignore. \n \nFirst, \nBauxites\nacknowledged that there is no \u201cmagic words\u201d \nrequirement for consent to personal jurisdiction.  See \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 136 n.5.  \u201cA variety of legal \narrangements have been taken to represent express \nor implied consent to the personal jurisdiction of the \ncourt,\u201d \nincluding \nsubmission \nby \nappearance, \nstipulation, forum-selection clauses, and \u201cconstructive \nconsent\u201d through \u201cthe voluntary use of certain state \nprocedures.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 703-04.  Each of \nthese \u201clegal arrangements,\u201d the Court explained, may \nresult in an effective waiver of the personal-\njurisdiction requirement, because the defendant has \ntaken some actions that \u201camount to a legal submission \nto the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Id. at 704-05. \nIn many cases, determining whether a defendant\u2019s \nactions \u201camount to a legal submission to the \njurisdiction of the court\u201d is straightforward.  A party \nmay expressly agree\u2014through a forum-selection \nclause, for example\u2014to litigate a dispute in a \nparticular forum.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Equip. Rental, Ltd. \nv. Szukhent, 375 U.S. 311, 315-16 (1964) (\u201cparties to a \n\n19 \ncontract may agree in advance to submit to the \njurisdiction of a given court\u201d).  So long as the party\u2019s \nconsent was \u201cfreely negotiated\u201d and enforcement \nwould not be \u201cunreasonable and unjust,\u201d such \nprovisions \u201c[do] not offend due process.\u201d  Burger King, \n471 U.S. at 472 n.14 (internal quotations omitted). \nA party may also consent to personal jurisdiction \nby taking certain actions in the litigation itself, which \ndemonstrate the party\u2019s submission to the jurisdiction \nof the court.  This Court has held, for example, that a \nparty who \u201cvoluntarily participated in the entire \ncourse \nof \nproceedings\u201d \nwithout \nobjecting \nto \njurisdiction \n\u201cclearly \nimplied \n[its] \nconsent\u201d \nto \njurisdiction through its own conduct.  Roell v. \nWithrow, 538 U.S. 580, 584 (2003).  Similarly, the \nFederal Rules have long provided that a party submits \nto personal jurisdiction by filing a responsive \npleading, without objecting to personal jurisdiction.  \nSee Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h); see also Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n705 (explaining that \u201c[t]he expression of legal rights is \noften subject to certain procedural rules,\u201d and \n\u201cfail[ing] to follow those rules may well result in a \ncurtailment of the rights\u201d). \nThese canonical forms of consent are not at issue \nin this case, however, because Respondents have not \nexpressly consented to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States, or taken any action in the litigation \nitself demonstrating their submission to jurisdiction.6\nAnd in the absence of such conduct, determining \nwhether \na \ndefendant \nsubmitted \nto \npersonal \n6  To the contrary, Respondents have long maintained (in \nSokolow, for more than a decade) that they are not subject to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States, and moved to dismiss \nPetitioners\u2019 claims on that basis.  Sokolow C.A. Defs. Br. 14 (Nov. \n10, 2015) (describing history); Fuld C.A. Defs. Br. 29 (same). \n\n20 \njurisdiction is more difficult.  See Wellness Int\u2019l \nNetwork, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, 685-86 (2015) \n(explaining implied consent requires \u201ca deeply \nfactbound analysis\u201d to determine \u201cwhether [the \ndefendant\u2019s] actions evinced the requisite knowing \nand voluntary consent\u201d). \nSecond, in determining whether the defendant\u2019s \nconduct \u201camount[ed] to a legal submission to the \njurisdiction \nof \nthe \ncourt,\u201d \nBauxites \nexpressly \ndistinguished between conduct capable of supporting \na jurisdictional finding, and \u201c\u2018mere assertions\u2019 of \npower\u201d by the forum to impose jurisdiction on \nnonconsenting defendants.  456 U.S. at 704-05.   \nThe question in Bauxites was whether the \ndefendant\u2019s failure to comply with court-ordered \njurisdictional discovery could be treated as a \nconstructive waiver of its objection to personal \njurisdiction.  This Court held that it could, but only \nbecause \u201c[t]he preservation of due process was secured \nby the presumption\u201d that the defendant\u2019s specific \nconduct\u2014its \u201crefusal to produce evidence material to\u201d \nthe jurisdictional inquiry\u2014\u201cwas but an admission of \nthe want of merit in the asserted defense.\u201d  Id. at 705, \n709 (emphasis added; internal quotations omitted).  \nBy refusing to produce the requested jurisdictional \ndiscovery, the defendant implicitly acknowledged that \nit did have sufficient contacts with the forum to \nsupport the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Id. at \n706.  The Court thus held that it was fair to treat the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct as a constructive waiver of any \nobjection.  See ibid. (\u201c[T]he sanction is nothing more \nthan the invocation of a legal presumption, or what is \nthe same thing, the finding of a constructive waiver.\u201d). \nTo illustrate the \u201cdue process limits\u201d that apply to \nimplied consent, Bauxites distinguished an earlier \n\n21 \ncase\u2014Hovey, 167 U.S. 409\u2014in which this Court held \nthat \u201cit did violate due process for a court to take \nsimilar action as \u2018punishment\u2019 for failure to obey a \ncourt order\u201d unrelated to the asserted defense.  456 \nU.S. at 706 (emphasis added).  The defendant\u2019s \nconduct in that case\u2014failure \u201cto pay into the registry \nof the court a certain sum of money\u201d\u2014did not support \nthe presumption of a \u201cwant of merit\u201d in the asserted \ndefense.  Id. at 705-06.  Subjecting the defendant to \nthe \ncourt\u2019s \njurisdiction, \nthis \nCourt \nexplained, \ntherefore would constitute an improper penalty, \nrather than a valid presumption of constructive \nwaiver drawn from the defendant\u2019s own conduct.  Id.\nat 706. \nPetitioners ignore this central aspect of Bauxites\u2019 \nreasoning, \ndescribing \nthe \nopinion \nas \nmerely \n\u201ccanvassing factors that made consent \u2018just\u2019 and \nsatisfied due process.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 25; see also Pls. Br. \n36-39.  But Bauxites could not have been clearer in \nspecifying the reason it was fair to infer that the \ndefendant consented to personal jurisdiction: \u201c[T]he \npreservation of due process was secured by the \npresumption that the refusal to produce evidence \nmaterial to the administration of due process was but \nan admission of the want of merit in the asserted \ndefense.\u201d  Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 705 (quoting \nHammond Packing Co. v. Arkansas, 212 U.S. 322, \n350-51 (1909)).  The fact that the defendant\u2019s conduct \nwas material to jurisdiction, in other words, was \nprecisely what distinguished a permissible inference \nof consent from an improper penalty. \nThe same distinction between valid, implied \nconsent and the improper imposition of jurisdiction \nruns throughout this Court\u2019s cases addressing the \nwaiver of jurisdictional defenses.  In College Savings \n\n22 \nBank, for example, plaintiffs argued that a state \nagency \nwaived \nits \nimmunity \nand \n\u201cimpliedly\u201d \nconsented to jurisdiction in federal court by knowingly \nand voluntarily engaging in interstate marketing, \nafter a federal statute made clear that such activity \nwould subject it to jurisdiction for Lanham Act claims.  \n527 U.S. at 671, 676.  This Court emphatically \nrejected this \u201cconstructive-waiver\u201d theory, holding: \nThere is a fundamental difference between a \nState\u2019s expressing unequivocally that it waives \nits immunity, and Congress\u2019s expressing \nunequivocally its intention that if the State \ntakes certain action it shall be deemed to have \nwaived that immunity.  In the latter situation, \nthe most that can be said with certainty is that \nthe State has been put on notice that Congress \nintends to subject it to suits brought by \nindividuals.  That is very far from concluding \nthat the State made an \u201caltogether voluntary\u201d \ndecision to waive its immunity. \nId. at 680-81.  The constitutional requirement of \nknowing and voluntary consent would mean nothing, \nthe Court explained, if Congress had \u201c[the] power to \nexact constructive waivers\u201d of jurisdictional defenses \n\u201cthrough the exercise of Article I powers.\u201d  Id. at 683.  \nAccordingly, this Court held that merely providing \nnotice of Congress\u2019s intent to subject the defendant to \njurisdiction if it \u201cvoluntarily\u201d engaged in \u201cfederally \nregulated conduct\u201d was insufficient to establish a \nconstructive waiver.  Id. at 679-82. \nIn describing the circumstances in which plaintiffs \ncould demonstrate implied consent to jurisdiction, \nCollege Savings Bank located valid \u201cconsent\u201d in the \nsame place as many other implied consent statutes: \nthe defendant\u2019s acceptance of a government benefit or \n\n23 \nprivilege conditioned upon consent to jurisdiction.  As \nthe Court explained, Congress may \u201ccondition its \ngrant of [federal] funds to the States\u201d upon their \nwillingness to consent to jurisdiction in a federal \nforum.  Id. at 686-87.  The \u201cacceptance of the funds\u201d \nby the State would thereby signal its \u201cagreement\u201d or \nconsent to the condition attached.  Ibid.  The Court \nnoted, however, that accepting a \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cgratuity\u201d \nconditioned on consent to jurisdiction presents a \n\u201cfundamentally different\u201d case than the imposition of \njurisdiction by legislative fiat.  Ibid.  In the latter case, \n\u201cwhat Congress threatens if the State refuses to agree \nto its condition is not the denial of a gift or gratuity, \nbut a sanction.\u201d7 Ibid.\nThis Court has used the same barometer to \nevaluate other implied consent statutes as well, \nexamining whether the defendant signaled its \nagreement to personal jurisdiction by accepting a \ngovernment benefit or privilege with \u201cjurisdictional \n7 Petitioners criticize Respondents\u2019 (and the Second Circuit\u2019s) \nreliance on College Savings Bank, arguing that decision \naddresses state sovereign immunity rather than personal \njurisdiction.  Pls. Br. 41-42; Gov\u2019t Br. 39-40.  This Court\u2019s \ndecision, however, refutes that reading.  Relying on the \u201cclassic \ndescription of an effective waiver of a constitutional right,\u201d the \nCourt explained that \u201c[c]onstructive consent is not a doctrine \ncommonly associated with the surrender of constitutional rights.\u201d  \nCollege Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 681-82 (emphasis added).  \nBecause \u201c[s]tate sovereign immunity, no less than the right to \ntrial by jury in criminal cases, is constitutionally protected,\u201d \ncourts should \u201cindulge every reasonable presumption against \nwaiver.\u201d  Id. at 682.  Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertions, the \nprinciples underlying College Savings Bank are not limited to \nstate sovereign immunity, but rather apply more broadly to \nimplied waivers of constitutional protections. \n\n24 \nstrings attached.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (citing \nBauxites). \nMany states, for example, have enacted statutes \nconditioning the \u201cprivilege\u201d of driving on public roads \non consent to personal jurisdiction in the state.  In \nHess v. Pawloski, this Court held that such \u201cimplied \nconsent\u201d statutes do not violate due process because \nthe state maintains the antecedent authority \u201cto \nregulate the use of its highways,\u201d and \u201cto exclude a \nnon resident\u201d from that use unless they consent to \njurisdiction in the state.  274 U.S. 352, 356-57 (1927).  \nBy \u201caccept[ing]\u201d the \u201cprivileges\u201d of driving on public \nroads, a non-resident defendant \u201csignifi[es] \u2026 his \nagreement\u201d to consent to personal jurisdiction in the \nforum.  Id. at 354-57; see also Wuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 \nU.S. 13, 19 (1928) (\u201c[T]he act of a non resident in using \nthe highways of another state may be properly \ndeclared to be an agreement to accept service of \nsummons in a suit growing out of the use of the \nhighway\u2026\u201d). \nThis Court applied a similar analysis to the \nbusiness registration statute at issue in Mallory.  The \nstatutory scheme in that case required foreign \ncorporations to consent to personal jurisdiction \u201cin \nexchange for status as a registered foreign corporation \nand the benefits that entails.\u201d  600 U.S. at 127 \n(emphasis added).  In affirming the constitutionality \nof such implied-consent statutes, this Court explained \nthat a defendant may submit to jurisdiction by \n\u201caccepting an in-state benefit with jurisdictional \nstrings attached.\u201d  Id. at 145 (plurality op.) (citing \nBauxites).  \u201c[A] variety of legal arrangements may \nrepresent express or implied consent to personal \njurisdiction consistent with due process, and these \narrangements can include requiring at least some \n\n25 \ncompanies to consent to suit in exchange for access to \na State\u2019s markets.\u201d  Id. at 144 n.10 (emphasis added; \ncleaned up); see also id. at 147-48 (Jackson, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that \u201cone way to waive \npersonal-jurisdiction rights\u201d is to \u201cvoluntarily invoke \ncertain benefits from a State that are conditioned on \nsubmitting to the State\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d); id. at 167 \n(Barrett, J., dissenting) (noting the majority\u2019s \nstandard \u201ccasts [business registration statutes] as \nsetting the terms of a bargain\u201d).8\nIn addition to business registration and driver \nregistration statutes, many states have also adopted \ncorporate director statutes, which similarly \u201cdeem\u201d \nthat non-resident defendants \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction \nin the forum by accepting appointment to a \ncorporation\u2019s board of directors.  See, e.g., Armstrong \nv. Pomerance, 423 A.2d 174, 176 & n.4 (Del. 1980) \n(analyzing Delaware corporate director statute).  By \naccepting the benefits afforded to directors under \nstate law, a non-resident director impliedly consents \nto personal jurisdiction in the state for any claims \n8  As Justice Gorsuch explained, these types of exchange-of-\nbenefits statutes have a long history.  \u201cAs the use of the corporate \nform proliferated in the 19th century,\u201d \u201c[l]awmakers across the \ncountry soon responded\u201d by \u201cadopt[ing] statutes requiring out-of-\nstate corporations to consent to in-state suits in exchange for the \nrights to exploit the local market and to receive the full range of \nbenefits enjoyed by in-state corporations.\u201d  600 U.S. at 129-30 \n(emphasis added).  The statute at issue in Pennsylvania Fire Ins. \nCo. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. \n93 (1917), for example, required foreign corporations to \u201cagree[] \nto accept service of process in Missouri on any suit as a condition \nof doing business there.\u201d  Id. at 133.  Conversely, Respondents \nare not aware of any history (and Petitioners cite none) \npermitting a legislature to simply \u201cdeem\u201d that foreign defendants \n\u201chave consented\u201d to suit, in the absence of any benefit or privilege \nconditioned on consent. \n\n26 \nrelated to the corporation.  Ibid.; see also Swenson v. \nThibaut, 250 S.E.2d 279, 289-91 (N.C. Ct. App. 1978) \n(same). \nIn each of these cases, the defendant\u2019s acceptance \nof a benefit or privilege conditioned by the forum on \nconsent to jurisdiction signals the defendant\u2019s implied \nagreement to submit to jurisdiction\u2014just as a state\u2019s \nacceptance of a conditional \u201cgift\u201d or \u201cgratuity\u201d from \nthe federal government would signal its implied \nwaiver of sovereign immunity under College Savings \nBank.  By accepting the benefit provided by the forum, \nthe defendant enters a bargain whereby it consents to \npersonal jurisdiction in exchange for permission to \nengage in conduct the forum could otherwise prohibit.  \nIndeed, the exchange of \u201creciprocal obligations\u201d is \nexactly what makes the exercise of personal \njurisdiction \u201cfair\u201d to a defendant under the Due \nProcess Clause.  Ford, 592 U.S. at 367-68 (explaining \nthat \u201callowing jurisdiction in these cases treats Ford \nfairly\u201d because Ford enjoyed \u201cthe benefits and \nprotections\u201d of state law when doing business in the \nforum). \nAs this Court has recognized, however, implied \nconsent becomes a disguised form of legislatively-\nimposed jurisdiction when the forum does not offer \nany corresponding benefit for the defendant to accept \nor reject, in exchange for its consent to jurisdiction.  If \nthe forum does not have the antecedent authority to \npermit (or to prohibit) the conduct purportedly giving \nrise to \u201cconsent,\u201d the defendant\u2019s choice to engage in \nsuch conduct does not reflect any implied agreement \nto submit to jurisdiction, because the defendant\u2019s \nability to engage in the activity did not depend on any \nbenefit conferred by the forum in the first instance.  \nSee College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at 680-81 (holding \n\n27 \nCongress\u2019s bare \u201cintention\u201d to subject defendant to \njurisdiction failed to establish implied consent \nbecause \u201cthere is little reason to assume actual \nconsent based upon the [defendant\u2019s] mere presence \nin a field subject to congressional regulation\u201d). \nThis does not mean that reciprocity or an exchange \nof benefits is necessary to establish implied consent in \nevery case.9  As this Court reaffirmed in Mallory, a \n\u201cvariety of legal arrangements\u201d may give rise to valid \nconsent, and statutes conditioning a government \nbenefit on consent to jurisdiction in the forum are \nmerely one, commonly-accepted example.  See 600 \nU.S. at 144 & n.10; see also id. at 147-49 (Jackson, J., \nconcurring).  A defendant can also consent to personal \njurisdiction by appearing in court without objecting, \nvoluntarily agreeing to a forum-selection clause, \nviolating a jurisdictional discovery order, or engaging \nin any other conduct that \u201camount[s] to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 704-05.  But nothing in this Court\u2019s cases \nsuggests (as Petitioners claim) that the forum can \nsimply \u201cdeem\u201d that any conduct it chooses shall \nconstitute \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction, when the \n9 Petitioners repeatedly mischaracterize the decision below as \nholding that implied consent must \u201cbe based on \u2018reciprocal \nbargains\u2019 between the forum\u2019s sovereign and the defendant,\u201d or \nis limited to \u201creciprocal bargain[s]\u201d and \u201clitigation-related \nconduct.\u201d  Pls. Br. 5, 12, 37-38; see also Gov\u2019t Br. 15, 20.  But the \nSecond Circuit itself refuted any such suggestion, explaining \nthat \u201c[t]he receipt of a benefit from the forum is not a necessary \nprerequisite to a finding that a defendant has consented to \npersonal jurisdiction,\u201d but rather is simply one commonly-\naccepted mechanism that \u201ccan suffice under the circumstances to \n\u2018signal consent to jurisdiction.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 35a-36a n.13 \n(emphasis added). \n\n28 \nconduct itself does not support the presumption that \nthe defendant submitted to jurisdiction in the forum. \nB.\nRespondents Have Not Engaged in Any \nConduct Signaling Consent to Personal \nJurisdiction in the United States. \nMeasured against these standards, the PSJVTA \nfails \nto \nestablish \nvalid \nconsent \nto \npersonal \njurisdiction.  As the Second Circuit recognized, \nneither form of conduct relied upon by Petitioners\u2014\nmaking social welfare payments in Palestine or \nmaintaining a UN office and conducting UN-related \nactivities in the United States\u2014signals Respondents\u2019 \napproval or acceptance of personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States.  As to the payments, that is because \nthe United States does not have antecedent authority \nto permit them in the first place.  As to UN-related \nactivities, they are specifically exempted from the \nPSJVTA.  The PSJVTA does not waive preexisting \nrestrictions on Respondents\u2019 U.S. activity and does \nnot permit any U.S. activity by Respondents.  \nAccordingly, neither type of predicate conduct alleged \nby Plaintiffs provides a valid basis for \u201cdeeming\u201d that \nRespondents have \u201cconsented\u201d to jurisdiction under \nthe standards set forth in Bauxites and Mallory.  \n1. Social Welfare Payments Made Outside \nthe United States Do Not Support the \nPresumption \nthat \nRespondents \nSubmitted to Jurisdiction. \nThe first type of conduct specified by the \nPSJVTA\u2014payments made in Palestine to those \nimprisoned or killed as a result of committing attacks, \nor to their families\u2014has \u201cno direct connection to the \nUnited States, let alone to litigation in a United States \ncourt.\u201d  Pet. App. 108a.  The payments at issue \n\n29 \noccurred entirely outside the United States, under \nPalestinian law, were not within the power of the U.S. \ngovernment to permit, and were not directed at the \nUnited States.  Any decision to make (or stop making) \nsuch payments therefore reflects Respondents\u2019 own \ndomestic laws and policy choices,10 rather than some \nimplicit agreement to consent to jurisdiction in the \nUnited States. \nInferring consent to personal jurisdiction based on \nsuch payments would be doubly immaterial to \njurisdiction in this case, because courts have \nconsistently held that the same payments are \ninsufficient to establish the requisite \u201cconnection\u201d \nbetween Respondents, Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the \nUnited States to support the exercise of personal \njurisdiction.  See, e.g., Shatsky, 955 F.3d at 1022-23, \n1037 (holding alleged \u201cmartyr payments\u201d did not \nconfer specific jurisdiction).  As the Second Circuit \nrecognized, continuing to engage in the same, \nconstitutionally-insufficient \nconduct \n\u201ccannot \nreasonably be interpreted as signaling the defendants\u2019 \n\u2018intention to submit\u2019 to the authority of the United \nStates courts.\u201d  Pet. App. 26a.  \u201cRather, such activities \nallegedly constitute \u2018consent\u2019 under the PSJVTA only \nbecause Congress has labeled them that way.\u201d  Ibid.\n\u201cThis declaration of purported consent, predicated on \nconduct lacking any of the indicia of valid consent \npreviously recognized in the case law, fails to satisfy \nconstitutional due process.\u201d  Ibid.\nIn asserting that such payments may serve as a \nvalid basis for implied consent to jurisdiction, \n10 As explained below, Respondents no longer make payments \nbecause a person, or a family member, was killed or imprisoned \nin connection with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \n\n30 \nPetitioners repeatedly conflate federal authority to \npunish \nextraterritorial \nconduct \n(so-called \n\u201cprescriptive\u201d or \u201clegislative\u201d jurisdiction) and federal \nauthority to subject nonresident defendants to \npersonal \njurisdiction in \nU.S. \ncourts \n(so-called \n\u201cadjudicative\u201d jurisdiction).  Although Congress may \nlegislate that making such payments will subject a \nparty to potential liability,\n11  that prescriptive \nauthority does not answer the separate constitutional \nquestion whether Respondents can be forced to \nsubmit to adjudication of such claims in U.S. courts. \nPersonal jurisdiction \u201cis an important limitation \non the jurisdiction of the federal courts over purely \nextraterritorial activity that is independent of the \nextraterritorial reach of a federal statute or the court\u2019s \nsubject matter jurisdiction.\u201d  Litecubes, LLC v. N. \nLight Prods., 523 F.3d 1353, 1363 & n.10 (Fed. Cir. \n2008) (emphasis added).  Although Congress can \n\u201cextend[] a cause of action to reach extraterritorial \nactivity,\u201d it is well-established that a federal court can \nadjudicate such claims only if it \u201chas personal \njurisdiction over the defendants.\u201d  Id. at 1363.  In \nother words, Congress\u2019s \u201cprescriptive jurisdiction\u201d\u2014\nits authority to make federal law applicable to foreign \nconduct\u2014\u201cis activated only when there is personal \njurisdiction, often referred to as \u2018jurisdiction to \nadjudicate.\u2019\u201d  Laker Airways v. Sabena, Belgian World \nAirlines, 731 F.2d 909, 923 (D.C. Cir. 1984). \nAccordingly, even if Congress maintains the \nprescriptive authority to impose civil liability under \nU.S. law for extraterritorial payments, that authority \n11 Plaintiffs seek to justify jurisdiction to adjudicate by over-\nreading the Offenses Clause.  Respondents address this issue in \nSection III.C.   \n\n31 \ndoes not answer the separate question whether \nRespondents are subject to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States for claims related to such payments.  \nSee Pet. App. 180a (holding federal statute providing \nfor jurisdiction through service of process in ATA \ncases \u201cdoes not answer the constitutional question of \nwhether due process is satisfied\u201d).  Congress may \nobject to the payments as a matter of federal policy, \nand impose a variety of sanctions (e.g., ATA liability \nand conditions on foreign aid to Palestine) to \ndiscourage such payments.  But those policy concerns, \nstanding \nalone, \ndo \nnot \nsomehow \ntransform \nconstitutionally-insufficient conduct overseas into \ngrounds for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction \nin the United States.  The same limitation applies to \nall extraterritorial statutes, whether the punishment \nis direct (as in the Alien Tort Statute or Foreign \nCorrupt Practices Act) or collateral (as in the \nPSJVTA).  \nPetitioners also misleadingly suggest that the \npayments were closely linked to the United States \nbecause they were made \u201cfor terror attacks against \nAmericans.\u201d  See, e.g., Pls. Br. 3.  That assertion \noverlooks the courts\u2019 consistent holdings that the \nattacks at issue (and a fortiori any payments \npurportedly following from such attacks) did not\ntarget the United States, and \u201caffected United States \ncitizens \nonly \nbecause \nthey \nwere \nvictims \nof \nindiscriminate violence that occurred abroad.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 168a. \nImportantly, in February 2025 Respondents \nformally revoked the old payments program, so that \npayments will now use need-based qualifications that \n\u201capply to all families in need of assistance in \n\n32 \nPalestinian society.\u201d12  The EU already has lauded \nthis \u201cimportant step\u201d of \u201crestructuring the social \nwelfare system and revoking the \u2018prisoners and \nmartyrs\u2019 payment\u2019 mechanism.\u201d13\nTo be clear, however, the old program was \nintended to provide a \u201csocial safety net in the face of \nbrutal and oppressive living conditions under Israeli \nmilitary occupation.\u201d  See Carnegie Endowment for \nInt\u2019l Peace, Palestinian Prisoner Payments (2021).14\nThe PA provided monthly welfare payments to \nPalestinians imprisoned in Israel for political crimes \nand security offenses, to their families, and to the \nfamilies of Palestinians killed during political \nviolence.

Respondents\u2019 Alleged U.S. Activities \nFail to Establish Implied Consent to \nPersonal Jurisdiction. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 allegations under the \u201cactivities\u201d prong \nof the PSJVTA likewise fail to establish a valid basis \nfor inferring that Respondents consented to personal \njurisdiction, for two reasons: (1) Respondents\u2019 alleged \nU.S. activities do not support the presumption that \nthey have submitted to jurisdiction in the United \nStates, as courts have previously held the same \nconduct insufficient to support the exercise of personal \njurisdiction; \nand \n(2) \ncontrary \nto \nPetitioners\u2019 \nassertions, the PSJVTA does not offer any \u201cbenefit\u201d \nfor Respondents to \u201caccept,\u201d in exchange for their \npurported consent.   \nThe activities prong directs courts to \u201cdeem[]\u201d that \nRespondents \u201chave consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d \nif they maintain any office or conduct \u201cany activity\nwhile physically present in the United States\u201d\u2014\nregardless of whether that activity would support a \npresumption \nthat \nRespondents \nsubmitted \nto \njurisdiction in the United States.  See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(1) \n(emphasis \nadded). \n \nBy \nexpressly \nencompassing \u201cany activity\u201d conducted in the United \nStates (no matter how trivial or jurisdictionally-\ninsignificant), this provision fails to ensure that \nRespondents\u2019 purported \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction is \n\n34 \ngrounded in conduct capable of supporting a \njurisdictional finding as required by Bauxites and \nMallory.   \nThe specific conduct relied upon by Plaintiffs in \nthese cases illustrates this infirmity.  Relying on the \nactivities prong\u2019s broad language, the Fuld plaintiffs \nalleged that Respondents \u201cconsented\u201d to personal \njurisdiction in the United States when their UN \nmission issued a tweet highlighting \u201csurfing in Gaza.\u201d  \nJA 217.  Plaintiffs overlooked the date of the tweet \nand its hashtag, which referenced the UN\u2019s \nInternational Day of Sport for Development and \nPeace.  JA 218.  More importantly, such conduct \nobviously bears no relationship to Plaintiffs\u2019 claims, \nthe underlying attacks, or any purported agreement \nto litigate ATA claims in U.S. court.  Sending a \nmessage \npromoting \n\u201csurfing \nin \nGaza\u201d \ncannot \nreasonably be interpreted as signaling Respondents\u2019 \nagreement to submit to jurisdiction in U.S. court for \nclaims related to alleged terrorist attacks in Israel \nand Palestine years (and in some cases, decades) \nearlier. \nThe rest of Plaintiffs\u2019 jurisdictional claims are \nsimilarly incapable of supporting a presumption of \nconsent to jurisdiction.  Plaintiffs allege that \nRespondents maintained an office (Palestine\u2019s UN \nmission) in New York and engaged in press \nconferences and social media activity \u201cintended to \ninfluence the public\u201d and \u201caffect U.S. foreign policy\u201d \nwhile physically present in the United States.  JA \n409.16\n16 As explained further in Section V, these types of UN-related \nactivities (and \u201cancillary\u201d activities) cannot be considered as \ngrounds for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d under the PSJVTA. \n\n35 \nBut courts confronted with virtually identical (if \nnot more extensive) allegations have consistently held \nthat these types of activities are not material to \njurisdiction, as Bauxites requires.  That is, they do not\nestablish \na \nsufficient \nconnection \nbetween \nRespondents, the claims at issue, and the United \nStates to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nunder the Due Process Clause.  See, e.g., Pet. App. \n147a, 161a, 177a-78a (holding maintenance of office in \nWashington, D.C., retention of a lobbying firm, \n\u201cpromot[ing] the Palestinian cause in speeches and \nmedia appearances,\u201d and engaging in \u201cextensive \npublic relations activities\u201d to \u201cinfluence United States \npolicy\u201d were insufficient to establish personal \njurisdiction); Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1118, 1123-26 \n(holding alleged \u201ccampaign\u201d to \u201cinfluence\u201d U.S. \nforeign policy \u201cthrough the use of U.S. offices, \nfundraising, lobbying, [and] speaking engagements\u201d \ninsufficient).  As the Second Circuit recognized, the \ncontinuation of the same conduct previously held \ninsufficient to support the exercise of personal \njurisdiction cannot support a reasonable presumption \nthat, by engaging in such conduct, Respondents \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States. \nRather \nthan \nexplaining \nwhy \nthe \nsame, \nconstitutionally-insufficient conduct could support a \npresumption of submission to jurisdiction under \nBauxites and Mallory, Petitioners instead attempt to \nshoehorn this case into the line of \u201cbenefits\u201d cases \ndescribed above.  Petitioners assert that the U.S. \nActivities \nprong \nextracts \nvalid \n\u201cconsent\u201d \nby \nconditioning a government benefit (entry into the \nUnited States) on Respondents\u2019 purported agreement \nto submit to personal jurisdiction in U.S. courts.  See\nPls. Br. 43-45; Gov\u2019t Br. 27, 40-41.   \n\n36 \nAs the Second Circuit recognized, however, that \nargument fails because the PSJVTA does not \nauthorize Respondents to enter the United States, or \nto conduct any activities here.  Pet. App. 29a.  \u201cIndeed, \nthe statute does not offer any in-forum benefit, right, \nor privilege that the PLO and the PA could \n\u2018voluntarily invoke\u2019 in exchange for their submission \nto the federal courts.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  As the \nGovernment concedes (at 3), for decades \u201cCongress \nhas heavily restricted respondents\u2019 activities on U.S. \nsoil.\u201d  The PSJVTA does nothing to alter or remove \nthose restrictions, or to permit otherwise-prohibited \nactivities in the United States.  Accordingly, unlike \nthe \u201cbenefits\u201d cases described above, the PSJVTA does \nnot offer any government \u201cbenefit\u201d or privilege for \nRespondents to \u201caccept,\u201d in exchange for their \npurported consent to personal jurisdiction. \nThe activities prong\u2019s failure to establish valid, \nimplied consent to jurisdiction on these facts is \nperhaps best illustrated by contrasting the PSJVTA \nwith its predecessor statute, the ATCA.  More than \nthree decades ago, Congress enacted the Anti-\nTerrorism Act of 1987, which prohibits the PLO and \naffiliates from operating in the United States by \nmaking it unlawful to (1) \u201creceive anything of value \nexcept informational material from the PLO;\u201d (2) \n\u201cexpend funds from the PLO\u201d; or (3) \u201cestablish or \nmaintain an office, headquarters, premises, or other \nfacilities or establishments within the jurisdiction of \nthe United States at the behest or direction of, or with \nfunds provided by,\u201d the PLO.17  22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202.   \n17 The sole exception is for activities conducted by Respondents \nin furtherance of Palestine\u2019s role as a Permanent Observer at the \nUnited Nations.  As described below, the PSJVTA mirrors \n\n37 \nCongress passed the 1987 Act for the express \npurpose of denying the PLO and its affiliates the \n\u201cbenefit\u201d of \u201coperating in the United States.\u201d  See 22 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 5201(b).  And, consistent with that purpose, \nthe 1987 Act has been interpreted as a \u201cwide gauged \nrestriction of PLO activity within the United States,\u201d \nPLO, 695 F. Supp. at 1471, that deprives Respondents \nof the \u201cmany benefits which accrue to organizations \noperating in the United States, including political \nstability, \naccess \nto \nour \npress \nand \ncapital \ninfrastructure, and \u2026 the patina of legitimacy.\u201d  \nMendelsohn v. Meese, 695 F. Supp. 1474, 1484 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1988) (\u201cThe avowed interest asserted by \nCongress in favor of the ATA is \u2026 to deny the PLO the \nbenefits of operating in the United States.\u201d).18\nRecognizing those restrictions, the ATCA provided \nthat Respondents \u201cshall be deemed to have consented \nto personal jurisdiction\u201d if they accepted either of two \ngovernment benefits: (1) certain types of U.S. foreign \naid, or (2) the \u201cbenefit\u201d of a formal \u201cwaiver or \nsuspension\u201d of the prohibitions on the PLO\u2019s U.S. \nactivities under the 1987 Act, which would have \nallowed it to maintain a mission in Washington, D.C.  \nSee 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1) (2018) (superseded by \nPSJVTA).   \nIn defending the constitutionality of the ATCA, the \nGovernment specifically argued that because \u201c[t]he \nlongstanding law by providing that a court cannot consider UN \nactivities to determine personal jurisdiction. \n18 Several amici assume Respondents \u201coperate freely on U.S. \nsoil.\u201d  Grassley Br. 4; AFLF Br. 5; ACLJ Br. 5.  Untrue.  \nConsistent with the 1987 Act\u2019s prohibitions, Respondents do not \nmaintain any physical premises in the United States (other than \nPalestine\u2019s UN mission), and do not engage in any non-UN \nrelated activities here.  \n\n38 \npolitical branches have long imposed conditions on \nthese benefits,\u201d it was \u201creasonable and consistent with \nthe Fifth Amendment for Congress and the Executive \nto determine that the [PLO\u2019s] maintenance of an office \nin this country after a waiver \u2026, or the [PA\u2019s] \ncontinued receipt of certain foreign assistance, should \nbe \u2018deemed\u2019 consent to personal jurisdiction in civil \ncases under the ATA.\u201d  U.S. Brief 12-13, Klieman v. \nPalestinian Auth., No. 15-7034 (D.C. Cir. Mar. 13, \n2019) (emphasis added).  The ATCA satisfied Fifth \nAmendment due process, in other words, because it \ngrounded \u201cdeemed consent\u201d on Respondents\u2019 choice to \naccept or reject either of two distinct government \nbenefits \nconditioned \nupon \nconsent. \n \nThis \ninterpretation is consistent with Mallory, Hess, and \nthe other authorities described above, which similarly \nhold that acceptance of a government benefit with \n\u201cjurisdictional string attached\u201d may provide a valid \nbasis for inferring consent to personal jurisdiction.  \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 145.  \nThe PSJVTA, by contrast, does not permit any \nactivity by Respondents.  It does not offer to waive the \nprohibitions imposed by the 1987 Act, nor does it \npermit Respondents to conduct any previously-\nunauthorized activities in the United States.  The \nstatute therefore does not offer any benefit for \nRespondents to accept, in exchange for their \npurported \u201cconsent\u201d to personal jurisdiction.  \nRather than identifying conduct that might \nactually \ndemonstrate \nRespondents \nimpliedly \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States (such as \nthe acceptance of U.S. foreign aid or some other \ngovernment benefit), \u201cCongress simply took conduct \nin which the PLO and PA had previously engaged\u2014\nconduct that the Second and D.C. Circuits had held \n\n39 \nwas insufficient to support personal jurisdiction in \nWaldman I, Livnat, Shatsky, and Klieman\u2014and \ndeclared that such conduct \u2018shall be deemed\u2019 to be \nconsent.\u201d  Pet. App. 108a.  Because such conduct does \nnot support the presumption that Respondents \nsubmitted to jurisdiction in the United States, it fails \nto provide a valid basis for implied consent under this \nCourt\u2019s precedent. \nII.\nThis Court Should Reject Petitioners\u2019 \nAttempts to Rewrite Established Due \nProcess Standards. \nStripped of the fiction of \u201cconsent,\u201d the PSJVTA\nattempts to impose jurisdiction over Respondents \nbased on the same activities federal courts have \nalready \nheld \ninsufficient \nto \nsupport \npersonal \njurisdiction under the Due Process Clause.  But \ndeemed consent statutes cannot pass constitutional \nmuster merely by providing advance notice of \njurisdictional consequences, as Petitioners propose, \nwithout undermining fundamental due process \nprotections.  Petitioners fail to provide any sound \nreason for this Court to depart from well-established \nprecedent by applying a less demanding due process \nstandard in this case. \nA. Permitting Congress to Impose Consent \nto \nJurisdiction \nbased \non \nConstitutionally-inadequate \nConduct \nWould \nEviscerate \nDue \nProcess \nProtections. \nPetitioners fail to offer any consistent standard or \nlimiting principle for \u201cdeemed consent,\u201d instead \nproposing \nan \nentirely \nad \nhoc \nand \n\u201cflexible\u201d \nformulation.  Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 22, 38, 46.  They concede that \nconsent to personal jurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and \nvoluntary.\u201d  Pls. Br. 40.  But they attempt to redefine \n\n40 \nthat standard, asserting that a \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \nstatute satisfies due process if it merely provides \n\u201cnotice\u201d and is \u201cnot fundamentally unfair or \nexorbitant\u201d (the Government\u2019s version, Gov\u2019t Br. 1, 14, \n23), or gives \u201cfair warning\u201d and is \u201creasonable\u201d \n(Plaintiffs\u2019 version, Pls. Br. 24, 26). \nIn advancing these ever-shifting standards, \nPetitioners \u201cblur[] the requirements\u201d for specific \njurisdiction and consent.  Pet. App. 222a (Bianco, J., \nconcurring).  On the one hand, Petitioners contend \nthat \u201cconsent\u201d is a separate basis for personal \njurisdiction and do not argue that requirements for \ngeneral or specific jurisdiction have been met.  E.g., \nPls. Br. 36-37.  On the other hand, to defend the \nPSJVTA as creating valid \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction, \nPetitioners admittedly rely on \u201cnon-consent cases,\u201d see\nGov\u2019t Br. 25, that do not address \u201cdeemed consent\u201d \nstatutes at all.  Importing an interest-balancing test \ninto consent, Petitioners draw their purported \nstandards from cases like Ford and Burger King\u2014\nseminal \u201cminimum contacts\u201d cases.  Gov\u2019t Br. 25-26; \nPls. Br. 40-43.  But those cases squarely hold that \n\u201c[t]he Due Process Clause protects an individual\u2019s \nliberty interest in not being subject to the binding \njudgments of a forum with which he has established \nno meaningful contacts, ties, or relations.\u201d  Burger \nKing, 471 U.S. at 471-72 (emphasis added).  Of course, \ncourts examining whether personal jurisdiction may \nbe asserted over Respondents under a minimum \ncontacts analysis have resoundingly answered that \nquestion in the negative because Respondents lack \nany constitutionally-meaningful connection to the \nUnited States.  See supra I.B.2. \nPetitioners give no more than lip service to the \nconcept of consent, instead offering a framework \n\n41 \nunder which Congress can legislatively decree\njurisdiction if Respondents do not comply with \nCongress\u2019s demands.  Rather than establishing \nRespondents\u2019 \u201cconsent\u201d as a separate basis for \njurisdiction, \nPetitioners \nadvance \nthe \nsame \nformulation of \u201cconsent\u201d that College Savings Bank\nrejected \nas \nimpermissibly \nimposing \npersonal \njurisdiction by legislative fiat.  Writing for the Court, \nJustice Scalia drew the distinction between consent to \njurisdiction and imposed jurisdiction.  527 U.S. at 679-\n81.  Putting the defendant \u201con notice\u201d of Congress\u2019s\nintention to subject the defendant to suit, the Court \nexplained, remains \u201cvery far\u201d from demonstrating \nthat a defendant \u201cmade an \u2018altogether voluntary\u2019 \ndecision\u201d to submit to jurisdiction.  Id. at 681.  College \nSavings Bank\u2014just like Bauxites and Mallory\u2014\nrequires that a legislative presumption of consent to \njurisdiction must be based on conduct that can \nsupport a presumption of submission to jurisdiction.  \nId. at 675 (\u201caltogether voluntary\u201d consent, or a \n\u201cgratuity); id. at 676 (State must make \u201ca \u2018clear \ndeclaration\u2019 that it intends to submit itself to our \njurisdiction\u201d).  The Court of Appeals here applied the \nCollege Savings Bank framework to conclude that the \nPSJVTA is an attempt to impose jurisdiction\u2014not a \nconsent jurisdiction statute.  Pet. App. 39a-40a \n(applying College Savings Bank).   \nWith no dependable or predictable due process \ntest, Congress and state legislatures could simply \nenact statutes declaring that the same activities \ninsufficient under minimum contacts \u201cshall be \ndeemed consent\u201d to personal jurisdiction.  In theory, \nthe Government agrees it should be impermissible for \na State to \u201ccircumvent constitutional limits on \npersonal jurisdiction by simply declaring nonresident \ndefendants to have consented to suit.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 25.  \n\n42 \nBut under a mere \u201cnotice\u201d and not-\u201cexorbitant\u201d test, \nfor virtually any decision dismissing claims for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction, the legislature could simply \nrepackage the same contacts with the forum as \ngrounds for \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to jurisdiction.  Under \nDaimler AG v. Bauman, for example, a California \ncourt could not exercise jurisdiction over a foreign car \nmanufacturer \nand \nits \nU.S. \nsubsidiary, \nwhich \ndistributed vehicles to California dealerships, but \nwere incorporated and maintained their principal \nplaces of business elsewhere.  571 U.S. 117, 139 \n(2014).  Under Petitioners\u2019 reasoning, Congress could \ndeclare that any foreign corporation that distributed \nvehicles to California dealerships \u201cshall be deemed to \nhave consented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in the state.    \nThere is no clear, predictable, or limiting principle \nthat would cabin this new mechanism from use \nagainst all foreign actors in securities, antitrust, \ntrademark, and copyright cases to name just a few.  \nPet. App. 216a (Bianco, J., concurring).  Such a test \nwould substitute \u201cthe well-established requirement \nthat consent be knowing and voluntary with the \nconcept that all that is necessary is that a person\u2019s \nconduct be knowing and voluntary.\u201d  Ibid.  Under \nPetitioners\u2019 interpretation, Congress could \u201csubject \nany foreign entity to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States, even in the absence of any contacts \nwith the United States, if that entity knowingly and \nvoluntarily engages in any conduct around the world \n(with some undefined nexus to the United States) \nafter Congress enacts legislation deeming the \ncontinuation of that conduct to constitute consent to \npersonal jurisdiction in the United States courts.\u201d  \nIbid.  This framework would in fact allow Congress to \nimpose jurisdiction over domestic defendants, too, in \nevery type of federal question case.  See House Br. 5-6 \n\n43 \n(listing \u201ccorporate law and governance, bankruptcy \nand tax, criminal, environmental, civil rights, and \nlabor laws\u201d), and 12-14 (listing Helms-Burton, False \nClaims Act, and antitrust); Chamber Br. 28-29.  And \nit would \u201celevate the risk of foreign nations engaging \nin retaliatory assertions of jurisdiction over United \nStates citizens and companies.\u201d  Chamber Br. 26. \nPetitioners\u2019 vision of \u201cconsent\u201d offer no guardrails \nat all.  The Government contends repeatedly that due \nprocess is \u201cflexible,\u201d such that it can be measured on a \nsliding scale, with different standards \u201cdepend[ing] on \nthe type of actor involved.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 5, 22.  Petitioners \ndid not argue below that Respondents cannot \u201cinvoke \nthe same extent of due process limitations as any \nother defendant,\u201d Gov\u2019t Br. 5, and have therefore \nforfeited this argument, see Am. Nat. Bank & Tr. Co. \nof Chicago v. Haroco, Inc., 473 U.S. 606, 608 (1985).  \nBut such an ad hoc approach also underscores the \nfundamental absence of any principled standards for \ninterpreting or applying Petitioners\u2019 conception of due \nprocess.  It is unclear to whom the sliding scale of due \nprocess applies, what criteria determine who gets \nwhat degree of due process, and how those standards \ndiffer.  Petitioners note that Respondents would \u201clack \ndue process rights entirely\u201d if the United States \n\u201crecognized respondents as the government of a \nsovereign state.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 28.  But in that case, \nRespondents \n\u201cwould \nreceive \nthe \nprotection \nof \nsovereign immunity.\u201d Pet. App. 212a (Bianco, J., \nconcurring).   \nPetitioners prefer to place Respondents in a \ncategory of one, as though that saves the statute, \nnoting that the PSJVTA applies \u201conly to respondents \nand their successors and affiliates\u201d and a \u201cnarrow\u201d \nclass of claims.  Gov\u2019t Br. 18.  But as the Court of \n\n44 \nAppeals \nexplained, \n\u201c[s]uch \nsingling \nout \n[of \nRespondents] \ndoes \nnot \ncure \na \nconstitutional \ndeficiency.  Where, as here, a statute impinges on \nconstitutional rights, it cannot be salvaged on the \nbasis that it violates the rights of only a handful of \nsubjects.\u201d  Pet. App. 45a.   \nOn the contrary, the Government\u2019s defense that \nthe statute is targeted against sui generis groups \namplifies\u2014rather \nthan \nameliorates\u2014these \nconstitutional concerns.  The Constitution vests the \n\u201cjudicial powers\u201d in a non-political branch precisely to \nprotect \u201cthe rights of one person\u201d from the \u201ctyranny of \nshifting majorities.\u201d  INS v. Chadha, 462 U.S. 919, \n961-62 (1983) (Powell, J., concurring).  A statute (like \nthe PSJVTA) that singles out only two \u201csui generis\u201d \ngroups (the PA and PLO) for disparate treatment \ntherefore warrants more scrutiny, not less.  See City of \nBoerne v. Flores, 521 U.S. 507, 529 (1997) (holding \nthat if Congress were permitted to define the \nconstitutional protections afforded to individual \ngroups, \u201cit is difficult to conceive of a principle that \nwould limit congressional power\u201d).  \nThis Court should likewise reject Petitioners\u2019 \nargument that the PSJVTA\u2019s deemed consent \nprovisions are \u201creasonable\u201d because Congress thinks \nthey further \u201cnational-security and foreign-policy \ninterests.\u201d  See Gov\u2019t Br. 34-37; Pls. Br. 30-31, 43.  \nAlthough courts may defer to Congress on matters of \nlegislative policy, \u201crespect for Congress\u2019s policy \njudgments \u2026 can never extend so far as to disavow \nrestraints on federal power that the Constitution \ncarefully constructed.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of Indep. Bus. v. \nSebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 538 (2012).  \u201cOur precedents, \nold and new, make clear that concerns of national \nsecurity and foreign relations do not warrant \n\n45 \nabdication of the judicial role \u2026. [T]he Government\u2019s \n\u2018authority and expertise in these matters do not \nautomatically trump the Court\u2019s own obligation to \nsecure the protection that the Constitution grants to \nindividuals.\u2019\u201d  Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, \n561 U.S. 1, 34 (2010).  \nAccordingly, the Government\u2019s \u201cforeign affairs \npower ... , \u2018like every other governmental power, must \nbe exercised in subordination to the applicable \nprovisions of the Constitution.\u2019\u201d Am. Ins. Ass\u2019n v. \nGaramendi, 539 U.S. 396, 416 n.9 (2003).  Even in \ncases involving \u201cforeign affairs\u201d and \u201cnational \nsecurity,\u201d courts adhere to the well-settled rule that \u201ca \nstatute cannot grant personal jurisdiction where the \nConstitution forbids it.\u201d  Gilson v. Republic of Ire., 682 \nF.2d 1022, 1028 (D.C. Cir. 1982).  In Livnat, for \nexample, plaintiffs urged the court to depart from \n\u201cordinary due-process requirements\u201d and exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents because the \nATA reflected \u201cCongress\u2019s intent to provide redress in \nU.S. courts for terrorism abroad.\u201d  851 F.3d at 53.  The \nD.C. \nCircuit \nrejected \nthat \nargument, \nholding \n\u201cCongress \ncannot \nwish \naway \na \nconstitutional \nprovision.\u201d  Ibid.  Deference is even less appropriate \nwhere, as here, Congress\u2019s explicit purpose is to \nreverse \nfederal \ndecisions \nestablishing \nthe \nconstitutional limits of personal jurisdiction.  See City \nof Boerne, 521 U.S. at 536. \nPetitioners and their amici also greatly overstate \nthe significance of the PSJVTA, attempting to paint it \nas a \u201ccritical component of Congress\u2019s comprehensive \nanti-terror scheme.\u201d  Grassley Br. 4; see also Gov\u2019t Br. \n3 (\u201ckey foreign-policy and national-security tool\u201d); \nPompeo Br. 3 (\u201cimportant tool in the United States\u2019 \ncounterterrorism arsenal\u201d).  Despite that rhetoric, the \n\n46 \nPSJVTA applies only to Respondents\u2014two sui generis\nentities the courts have repeatedly found do not target \nAmericans.  By its plain terms, the PSJVTA does not \napply to Hamas, Hezbollah, the Islamic State, or any \nother terrorist group or state-sponsor of terrorism.   \nThere is similarly no merit to the assertion that the \ndecision below would \u201cgut\u201d the ATA, U.S. House Br. 2, \nor place Respondents \u201cbeyond the reach of Congress \nand American courts,\u201d Grassley Br. 5.  When a \ndefendant targets the United States or its citizens, or \nengages in conduct in the United States substantially \nconnected to terrorist attacks overseas, U.S. courts \ncan (and do) exercise personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant.  See, e.g., Mwani v. Bin Laden, 417 F.3d 1, \n11-14 (D.C. Cir. 2005) (foreign defendants who \n\u201corchestrated the bombing of the American embassy \nin Nairobi\u201d were subject to personal jurisdiction \nbecause they \u201cpurposefully directed their terror at the \nUnited States\u201d); Licci v. Lebanese Canadian Bank, \n732 F.3d 161, 169-74 (2d Cir. 2013) (foreign bank that \nused U.S. correspondent accounts to transfer funds for \nHezbollah was subject to personal jurisdiction).  The \nDue Process Clause precludes the exercise of personal \njurisdiction only when plaintiffs cannot establish the \nrequisite connection between the defendant\u2019s conduct, \nthe attack giving rise to plaintiffs\u2019 claims, and the \nforum.  See Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1126 (distinguishing \nclaims against Respondents from Mwani, in which the \ndefendants \u201cindisputably aimed to kill Americans\u201d). \nB.\nThe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \nReflect the Same Due Process Standards.  \nWhen evaluating the constitutionality of a \n\u201cconsent\u201d statute like the PSJVTA, the due process \nstandards \nunder \nthe \nFifth \nand \nFourteenth \nAmendments are the same.  The question is whether \n\n47 \nthe actions chosen by Congress to constitute consent \nsatisfy the standards for consent established by this \nCourt in Bauxites and Mallory.  Petitioners fail to \nidentify any reason why the standard for consent \nwould differ under the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.  Whether Congress, in a different \nstatute, \ncould \ndirectly \nimpose \njurisdiction \non \nRespondents is not at issue because, in the PSJVTA, \nCongress expressly chose a \u201cconsent\u201d mechanism.   \n1.  Petitioners argue that the primary difference \nbetween the due process analysis under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments is that the Fourteenth \nAmendment inquiry protects \u201cinterstate federalism\u201d \ninterests, \nwhich are \nabsent \nunder \nthe \nFifth \nAmendment.  See Pls. Br. 29-32; Gov\u2019t Br. 30-34.  For \nthat reason, Petitioners assert that the constraints on \npersonal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment are \n\u201cless restrictive than the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s.\u201d  \nGov\u2019t Br. 31. \nBut as this Court recently explained in Mallory, \npotential \ndue \nprocess \nconcerns \n\u201csounding \nin \nfederalism\u201d \nplay \nno \nrole \nin \nanalyzing \nthe \nconstitutionality of a consent statute\u2014even under the \n(purportedly more rigorous) Fourteenth Amendment.  \nSee Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144 (plurality op.); see also id.\nat 156 (Alito, J., concurring in part).  \u201cOur personal \njurisdiction cases have never found a Due Process \nClause problem sounding in federalism when an out-\nof-state defendant submits to suit in the forum state.  \nAfter all, personal jurisdiction is a personal defense \nthat may be waived or forfeited.\u201d  Ibid.\nThe Government also inaccurately claims that \n\u201c[i]n Mallory, five Justices agreed that federalism \nconcerns bear on the personal-jurisdiction analysis \neven in consent cases, albeit through different \n\n48 \nconstitutional mechanisms.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 32 (citing \nJustice Alito\u2019s concurrence and Justice Barrett\u2019s \ndissent).  That assertion is not faithful to Justice \nAlito\u2019s opinion, which joined the plurality in holding \nthat federalism concerns play no role in determining \nwhether a defendant has consented to personal \njurisdiction: \n[W]e have never held that a State\u2019s assertion of \njurisdiction unconstitutionally intruded on the \nprerogatives of another State when the \ndefendant had consented to jurisdiction in the \nforum State.  Indeed, it is hard to see how such \na decision could be justified.  The Due Process \nClause confers a right on \u2018person[s],\u2019 Amdt. 14, \n\u00a7 1, not States.  If a person voluntarily waives \nthat right, that choice should be honored. \n600 U.S. at 156 (Alito, J. concurring in part).  Contrary \nto the Government\u2019s assertions, five Justices thus \nplainly agreed that \u201cfederalism concerns\u201d do not bear \non the personal-jurisdiction analysis in consent cases.  \nFederalism interests thus fail to provide a valid \nreason for treating consent differently under the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendments. \n2.  If it reaches beyond consent, this Court should \nhold that the jurisdictional due process standards are \nsubstantively the same.  Every circuit to reach the \nissue agrees that the standards developed under the \nFourteenth Amendment apply under the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Pet. App. 49a-51a; Livnat, 851 F.3d \nat 54-56.   \nThe Fifth Circuit recently summarized the \nreasoning behind these decisions: \u201cBoth Due Process \nClauses use the same language and serve the same \npurpose, \nprotecting \nindividual \nliberty \nby \n\n49 \nguaranteeing \nlimits \non \npersonal \njurisdiction.\u201d  \nDouglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 235 & 238 n.22 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (\u201cEvery \ncourt that has considered this point agrees that the \nstandards mirror each other.\u201d).  The Eleventh Circuit \nsimilarly explained that \u201cthe operative language of \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments is materially \nidentical, and it would be incongruous for the same \nwords to generate markedly different doctrinal \nanalyses.\u201d  Herederos De Roberto Gomez Cabrera v. \nTeck Res. Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303, 1308 (11th Cir. 2022).  \nAs Justice Frankfurter explained: \u201cTo suppose that \n\u2018due process of law\u2019 meant one thing in the Fifth \nAmendment and another in the Fourteenth is too \nfrivolous to require elaborate rejection.\u201d  Malinski v. \nNew York, 324 U.S. 401, 415 (1945) (Frankfurter, J., \nconcurring).19\nNo case supports Petitioners\u2019 views that the due \nprocess standards are lower under the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Pet. App. 45a-46a.  Courts have long \nrejected the notion \u201cthat federalism\u2019s irrelevance in \nthe Fifth Amendment context justifies a \u2018more lenient\u2019 \nstandard for personal jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at 48a; \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 239 n.24 (collecting cases from \nvarious circuits).  Nor does any case suggest that the \nlack of federalism concerns changes the personal \nliberty analysis that underlies the doctrine of personal \njurisdiction, or that the quality or meaning of the \ncontacts (or the consent) must be different. \n19 The framers of the Fourteenth Amendment intended that \nidentical wording would create identical rights.  See Cong. Globe, \n39th Cong., 1st Sess. 1088-89 (1866) (purpose of amendment was \nto \u201cenforce the bill of rights as it stands in the Constitution \ntoday\u201d and the meaning of due process was that which \u201cthe courts \nhave settled [] long ago\u201d).  \n\n50 \nMoreover, this Court consistently assumes the \nminimum contacts due process analysis applies to \nfederal statutes, reflecting that the authority to \nlegislate extraterritorially does not create jurisdiction \nto adjudicate over foreign defendants.  See Kiobel v. \nRoyal Dutch Petroleum, 569 U.S. 108, 124-25 (2013) \n(Alien Tort Statute); id. at 139 (Breyer, J., concurring) \n(same); Jesner v. Arab Bank, PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 313, \n(2018) (Sotomayor, J., dissenting) (same); Mohamad v. \nPalestinian Auth., 566 U.S. 449, 460 (2012) (plaintiffs \nstill must establish \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d under the \nTorture Victim Protection Act); Abitron Austria \nGmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 445 (2023) \n(Sotomayor, \nJ. \nconcurring) \n(assuming \nforeign \ncompanies have personal jurisdiction defenses to \nLanham Act claims). \n3. Petitioners argue that application of minimum \ncontacts standards would be unfair, referencing other \njurisdictional standards.  Their examples are not \npersuasive.  \nThe Government argues that if Respondents were \n\u201cnatural persons,\u201d then \u201cthe mere act of serving them\u201d \nin the United States would suffice for tag jurisdiction \nunder Burnham.  See Gov\u2019t Br. 28-29.  But if \nRespondents were natural persons, they would have \nto physically enter the United States to be served with \ntag jurisdiction.  And, as the Government admits, \nPlaintiffs served process on Respondents\u2019 ambassador.  \nIbid.  Natural persons would not have an ambassador \n(even assuming that Burnham applies to diplomatic \nenvoys), so tag jurisdiction would not be available.20\n20 One amici even argues that service itself creates jurisdiction.  \nSachs Br. 27.  But service performed under the Federal Rules \nonly does so when \u201cexercising jurisdiction is consistent with the \n\n51 \nThe Government also compares Respondents to \ncorporations, claiming that personal jurisdiction \nwould \nbe \nappropriate \nif \nRespondents \nwere \n\u201ccorporations registered to do business in New York\u201d \nand New York had a corporate registration statute \n\u201clike the one upheld in Mallory.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. 41-42.  This \ncomparison actually supports Respondents.  Under \nthe ATCA, Congress stated that specific benefits \n(certain foreign aid or an Executive waiver to have an \noffice in the U.S.) were conditioned on consent to \njurisdiction, just like Pennsylvania conditioned the \nbenefit of doing business in the state on submission to \njurisdiction in Mallory.  But unlike Norfolk Southern, \nRespondents did not accept the benefit conditioned on \nconsent, just like any foreign corporation could avoid \npersonal jurisdiction in Pennsylvania by refusing to \nregister.   \nThe Government further argues that the United \nStates has a special relationship with Respondents.  \nBut it cites laws limiting Respondents\u2019 presence in the \nUnited States, restricting foreign assistance, and \npunishing them for interacting with international \nbodies.  Gov\u2019t Br. 35-36.  Those are one-sided penalties, \nnot actions by Respondents that might signify \nsubmission to jurisdiction.  \nThe Government also argues that Respondents \nshould not be treated like \u201crun-of-the-mill foreign \nprivate defendants for due process purposes,\u201d but \nshould receive some lesser subset of Fifth Amendment \ndue process rights.  Gov\u2019t Br. 35-36.  It did not raise \nUnited States Constitution and laws.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(2)(B).  \nAnd that question turns on whether Respondents \u201creally \nsubmitted to proceedings.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 144.  In any case, \nneither Petitioner makes this argument, nor did the courts below \npass on it. \n\n52 \nthis argument below, and so it is waived.  More \nimportantly, it presents no authority for the novel \nidea that some persons should be entitled to less \nprocess than others when convenient for the \nGovernment.  This is a dangerous doctrine, which \nwould quickly create different classes of people \nentitled to different classes of due process.  As \nexplained below, infra at III.D, this is exactly the kind \nof position the Due Process Clause was designed to \nprotect against.  \nPlaintiffs, in turn, argue that the correct \ncomparison for purposes of fairness is to criminal \ncases.  Pls. Br. 14, 29, 32-33.  But the fulcrum of their \ncomparison has nothing to do with personal \njurisdiction.  It is not controversial, but it is entirely \nirrelevant to personal jurisdiction, that the Second \nCircuit has found a sufficient \u201cnexus\u201d for Congress to \nenact an extraterritorial criminal statute when the \nstatute focuses on \u201cactivity [that aims] to cause harm \ninside the United States or to U.S. citizens or \ninterests.\u201d  United States v. Sanchez, 972 F.3d 156, \n169 (2d Cir. 2020) (citation omitted).   \nBut that begs the question whether Congress can \ngo further and legislate that all defendants sued \nunder such laws are subject to personal jurisdiction in \nsuits making such civil claims.  The Second Circuit \nrejected that assertion, Pet. App. 180a-81a, and this \nCourt denied certiorari after the Solicitor General saw \nno conflict with any decision of this Court.  CVSG Br. \n14-16, No. 16-1071 (U.S. Feb. 22, 2018). \nUnderscoring \nthe \nirrelevance \nof \nlegislative \nauthority to enact laws criminalizing extraterritorial \noffenses, \u201cin a criminal case, personal jurisdiction is \nbased on the physical presence of the defendant in the \nforum, \nindependent \nof \nany \nminimum-contacts \n\n53 \nanalysis.\u201d  CVSG Br. 21, Fed. Ins. Co. v. Saudi Arabia, \nNo. 08-640 (U.S. May 29, 2009).  Physical presence is \nrequired even if the United States must conduct a \n\u201cforcible abduction\u201d of an individual abroad.  United \nStates v. Alvarez-Machain, 504 U.S. 655, 661, 670 \n(1992) (abducted from Mexico); United States v. Yunis, \n924 F.2d 1086, 1089 (D.C. Cir. 1991) (terrorist lured \ninto international waters).  Due process standards in \ncivil cases do not require physical presence, but \ninstead the more lenient standard of a forum-\nconnection consistent with due process.  \n4.  Finally, one amicus argues Respondents are not \npersons under the Fifth Amendment.  Chamber Br. 5-\n16.  This Court should ignore this argument as neither \nPetitioner raises it here.  In any case, two Circuits \nhave expressly held that Respondents are persons \nunder the Due Process Clause.  Pet. App. 153a-54a; \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 49-53 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  The \nGovernment has also acknowledged the unbroken line \nof authority holding that Respondents are \u201cpersons.\u201d  \nU.S. Amicus Br. 9-12, Sokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 \n(U.S. Feb. 22, 2018).  This Court has presupposed \nRespondents are \u201cpersons\u201d when contrasting a \nstatute\u2019s use of the word \u201cindividual,\u201d which does not \ninclude Respondents, with use of the word \u201cperson,\u201d \nwhich would include entities like Respondents.  \nMohamad, 566 U.S. at 454-55.  This Court has \nsimilarly assumed that unincorporated associations \n(which is how Respondents are classified in the \nUnited States, see Pet. App. 159a) are entitled to due \nprocess just like corporations.  California State \nAutomobile Association Inter-Insurance Bureau v. \nMaloney, 341 U.S. 105, 108 (1951); Joint Anti-Fascist \nRefugee Committee v. McGrath, 341 U.S. 123, 140-41 \n(1951).   \n\n54 \nNor should the issue be controversial.  The \u201cDue \nProcess Clause applies to all \u2018persons\u2019 within the \nUnited States, including aliens, whether their \npresence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or \npermanent.\u201d  Zadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 \n(2001).  Because foreign defendants are \u201cforced to \nappear in the United States\u201d to answer potential \nclaims, they are \u201centitled to the protection of the Due \nProcess Clause.\u201d  GSS Grp. Ltd. v. Nat\u2019l Port Auth.,\n680 F.3d 805, 816 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  Amici\u2019s argument \nalso relies on treating Respondents like sovereigns.  \nChamber Br. 6.  But Respondents lack \u201cattributes of \nsovereignty like sovereign immunity\u201d and \u201cterritorial \nsecurity\u201d and do not enjoy other \u201cspecial privileges\u201d \nthat are \u201cavailable only to entities that are juridical \nequals in the eyes of the United States.\u201d  Livnat, 851 \nF.3d at 50-51. \nIII.\nThe Original Meaning of Due Process \nImposes Limitations on Jurisdiction.    \nThe Court should not upend well-settled law on the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause based on \nscant historical evidence.  As the Government and a \nleading proponent of Plaintiffs\u2019 maximalist position \nagree, \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 theory is not easily confirmed as \na \nhistorical \nmatter\u201d \nbecause \n\u201c[s]howing \nthat \nFounding-era due process didn\u2019t limit federal personal \njurisdiction is an exercise in proving a negative.\u201d  \nGov\u2019t Br. 47 (citation omitted); Sachs Br. 7.  \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \u201c[e]vidence of the understanding of those \nwho crafted the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause is surprisingly slim.\u201d  Lawrence Rosenthal, \nDoes Due Process Have an Original Meaning? On \nOriginalism, Due Process, Procedural Innovation ... \nand Parking Tickets, 60 Okla. L. Rev. 1, 29 (2007).  \nContrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 broad claims (Pls. Br. 18-19), \n\n55 \n\u201cneither Madison nor anyone else involved in the \nprocess made any substantive comments about its \nmeaning.\u201d  Id. at 29, 52 (calling the same kinds of \nevidence relied upon by Plaintiffs \u201cmurky and \nincomplete\u201d).  As members of this Court have \nexplained, when the proponent of a historical claim \nthat would overturn longstanding precedent admits \nthat it is speculative, wisdom counsels against \nadopting that position.  Amy Coney Barrett, \nOriginalism and Stare Decisis, 92 Notre Dame L. Rev. \n1921, 1924 & n.8 (2017); Amy Coney Barrett & John \nCopeland Nagle, Congressional Originalism, 19 U. Pa. \nJ. Const. L. 1, 11 (2016) (history is only \u201cconclusive \nwhen it is determinate\u201d); Gamble v. United States, 587 \nU.S. 678, 722-23 (2019) (Thomas, J., concurring) \n(declining to overturn precedent where \u201chistorical \nrecord present[ed] knotty issues about the original \nmeaning of the Fifth Amendment,\u201d insufficient to \nrender precedent \u201cdemonstrably erroneous\u201d).  \nPlaintiffs also failed to raise this argument below, \ndepriving the Second Circuit of an opportunity to \naddress it.  On appeal, only the Fuld plaintiffs raised \noriginalism, and only to argue for a \u201crelaxed\u201d or \n\u201cnexus\u201d standard\u2014very different from the extreme \nposition they take before this Court.21 See Fuld C.A. \nPls. Br. 49, 61.  The Court should decline to consider \nsuch arguments.  See Springfield v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. \n257, 259 (1987) (\u201cWe ordinarily will not decide \nquestions not raised or litigated in the lower courts.\u201d). \n21 Plaintiffs first introduced their maximalist theory in their \npetition for rehearing en banc.  See Hoover v. Ronwin, 466 U.S. \n558, 574 n.25 (1984) (argument made \u201cfor the first time\u201d at the \nrehearing stage \u201cprecludes our consideration\u201d). \n\n56 \nThe argument fails regardless.  The founders \nbelieved due process protected the natural, unwritten \nrights of individuals.  Early courts regularly held that \npersonal jurisdiction was one of those rights protected \nfrom the power of the \u201csovereign\u201d and the \u201clegislature.\u201d  \nThey also believed that due process precluded \ndiscriminatory \nstatutes \nthat \nsought \nto \nstrip \nprotections from specific individuals or groups.  The \nPSJVTA transgresses these limitations\u2014and early \nAmerican courts would have struck it down. \nA. Founding-era Judges Believed that Due \nProcess Restrained Legislative Power \nand Protected Natural Rights. \nFor early Americans, due process rights had a long \nhistory of protecting individuals against legislative \nacts.  \u201cThe due process and law-of-the-land clauses of \nthe American state and federal constitutions originate \nin Magna Charta and the English customary \nconstitution.  This is uncontroversial.\u201d  Nathan S. \nChapman & Michael W. McConnell, Due Process As \nSeparation of Powers, 121 Yale L.J. 1672, 1681, 1722-\n23 (2012).  The Due Process Clause \u201cgrew out of the \n\u2018law of the land\u2019 provision of Magna Carta and its later \nmanifestations in English statutory law.\u2019\u201d  O\u2019Bannon \nv. Town Ct. Nursing Ctr., 447 U.S. 773, 792 n.2 (1980) \n(Blackmun, J. concurring).   \nAs this Court explained, due process requires \ncourts to decide if any \u201cprocess\u201d ordered by Congress \nis \u201cin conflict\u201d with \u201cthe constitution itself\u201d and \nwhether it contravenes the \u201csettled usages and modes \nof proceeding existing in the common and statute law \nof England.\u201d  Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Imp. \nCo., 59 U.S. 272, 277 (1855).  Legislative acts were \noverturned when contrary to \u201cdue process of law,\u201d \nwhich was also called the \u201claw of the land.\u201d  Id. at 276; \n\n57 \nEdward Coke, The Second Part of the Institutes of the \nLaws of England at 50-55 (London, 6th Ed. 1772) (the \nphrase \u201cby the Law of the Land\u201d is also \u201crendered, \nwithout due process of Law\u201d).   \n \u201c[A]t least one common, public understanding of \nthe Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment at the \ntime it was ratified in 1791 was that it protected \nunenumerated natural and customary rights against \nencroachment by Congress.\u201d  Frederick Mark Gedicks, \nAn Originalist Defense of Substantive Due Process: \nMagna Carta, Higher-Law Constitutionalism, and the \nFifth Amendment, 58 Emory L.J. 585, 596 (2009) \n(emphasis added);  see also 3 Jonathan Elliot, The \nDebates in the Several State Conventions on the \nAdoption of the Federal Constitution, 451 (2d ed. 1836) \n(\u201cA bill of rights is only an acknowledgment of the \npreexisting claim to rights in the people.\u201d (quoting \nVirginia legislator George Nicholas)).   \nEarly cases applied these limitations, unwritten in \npositive law but widely-understood, to overturn \nlegislative acts.  See, e.g., Bowman v. Middleton, 1 Bay \n252 (1792) (holding that law was \u201cagainst common \nright, as well as against Magna Charta\u201d); Zylstra v. \nCorp. of City of Charleston, 1 Bay 382, 384 (1794) \n(refusing to enforce law because \u201cthe trial by jury is a \ncommon law right; not the creature of the constitution, \nbut originating in time immemorial; it is the \ninheritance of every individual citizen\u201d); Taylor v. \nPorter & Ford, 4 Hill 140, 145 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1843).   \nPlaintiffs seek to exclude personal jurisdiction \nsafeguards from those protected rights inherited from \nEngland, but early judges called personal jurisdiction \nan \u201ceternal principle of justice\u201d that may not be \nexercised \u201cover persons not owing [the State] \nallegiance or not subjected to [its] jurisdiction by being \n\n58 \nfound within [its] limits.\u201d  Mills v. Duryee, 11 U.S. 481, \n486 (1813) (Johnson, J., dissenting).  Justice Story \nexplained \nthat \n\u201cAmerican \ncourts\u201d \nhad \n\u201cfully \nrecognized\u201d the English limits on jurisdiction over \npersons that were not physically \u201cpresent\u201d \u201cwithin the \njurisdiction.\u201d  Joseph Story, Commentaries on the \nConflict of Laws, \u00a7 545 (1834); see id., \u00a7\u00a7 537-550 \n(discussing personal jurisdiction).   \nScholars may disagree about whether the founders \nwere correct \u201cthat the law of the land bound \nParliament\u201d \nin \nEngland, \n\u201cbut \nrevolutionary \nAmericans believed that it did, and that is all that \nmatters.\u201d  Gedicks, 58 Emory L.J. at 657.  American \ndue process became \u201ca restraint on the legislative \u2026 \npowers of the government, and cannot be so construed \nas to leave congress free to make any process \u2018due \nprocess of law,\u2019 by its mere will.\u201d  Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 \nU.S. at 276 (emphasis added); Appeal of Ervine, 16 Pa. \n256, 268 (1851) (rejecting proposition that the \nlegislature can determine what counts as \u201cdue \nprocess\u201d).  \nB.\nEarly Courts Applied Customary Due \nProcess Rights Inherited From English \nLaw to Limit Personal Jurisdiction.   \nAmong the important customary rights inherited \nfrom eighteenth-century English law, and zealously \nprotected by early American courts, were limits on \npersonal jurisdiction.  Historically, English \u201ccommon \nlaw courts neither exercised nor believed they could \nexercise jurisdiction in personal actions without \neither physical custody of the defendant or an \nappearance by him.\u201d  Nathan Levy, Jr., Mesne Process \nin Personal Actions at Common Law and the Power \nDoctrine, 78 Yale L.J. 52, 94 (1968).  American courts \nadopted that doctrine, which protected individual \n\n59 \nrights as an inherent due process limitation on \nsovereignty:  \u201cThe general rule is that all sovereignty \nis strictly local, and cannot be exercised beyond the \nterritorial limits.  This flows from the nature of \nsovereignty, which being supreme power, cannot exist \nwhere it is not supreme.\u201d  The Schooner Exch. v. \nMcFaddon, 11 U.S. 116, 126-27 (1812).   \nThe strength of this doctrine is shown in Picquet v. \nSwan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 611-13 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828), \nwhere Justice Story, riding circuit, explained that \njurisdiction \ndid \nnot \nextend \noutside \nnational \nboundaries.  Service of process was originally a means \nof affirming that the defendant\u2019s person was within \nthe sovereign\u2019s territorial boundaries and, because of \nthat presence, subject to the in personam jurisdiction \nof its courts.  Justice Story explained that \u201cno \nsovereignty can extend its process beyond its \nterritorial limits, to subject either persons or property \nto its judicial decisions,\u201d and \u201c[e]ven the court of king\u2019s \nbench in England, though a court of general \njurisdiction, never imagined, that it could serve \nprocess in Scotland, Ireland, or the colonies, to compel \nan appearance, or justify a judgment against persons \nresiding therein at the time of the commencement of \nthe suit.\u201d  19 F. Cas. at 611-12.  Picquet affirmed that \nexerting jurisdiction \u201cbeyond those limits; and any \nattempt to act upon persons or things beyond them, \nwould be deemed an usurpation of foreign sovereignty, \nnot justified or acknowledged by the law of nations.\u201d  \nIbid.  Picquet concluded that \u201c[e]very exertion of \nauthority beyond this limit is a mere nullity.\u201d  Ibid. \nNot surprisingly, Justice Story\u2019s other writings \nreflect this limited view of federal jurisdiction.  He \nexplained that \u201cjurisdiction, to be rightfully exercised, \nmust be founded either upon the person being within \n\n60 \nthe territory, or upon the thing being within the \nterritory; for, otherwise, there can be no sovereignty \nexerted.\u201d  Story, Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws\n\u00a7 539.  As such, \u201cno state or nation can, by its laws, \ndirectly affect, or bind property out of its own territory, \nor persons not resident therein.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 20 (\u201cno \nsovereign has a right to give the law beyond his own \ndominions\u201d).   \nPlaintiffs twist Justice Story\u2019s words to mean the \nopposite of what Picquet actually says.  Plaintiffs \nclaim that Congress could order the federal courts to \nsummon a foreigner \u201cfrom the other end of the globe\u201d \nand that if Congress had \u201cprescribed such a rule, the \ncourt would certainly be bound to follow it.\u201d  Pls. Br. \n25.  The first quote is part of an argument that Justice \nStory rejected as \u201cso repugnant to the general rights \nand sovereignty of other nations\u201d to be an implausible \nreading of a statute.  19 F. Cas. at 613.  The second \nquote (\u201cbound to follow it\u201d) explicitly discussed in rem\njurisdiction (\u201cby attachment\u201d).  The preceding \nsentence in the opinion (beginning with \u201cUnless\u201d) \nstated that serving a summons \u201cby any attachment\u201d \nof \u201cproperty, however small, within the district\u201d can \ncreate an \u201cin invitum\u201d judgment against an \u201calien, \nwho has never been within the United States.\u201d  Id. at \n615.  That quote affirms Justice Story\u2019s belief that \nCongress had authority to create expansive in rem\njurisdiction even based on small amounts of property, \nand the courts would be \u201cbound to follow it.\u201d  Ibid.  But \nthat only contrasts with Justice Story\u2019s repeated \nstatements that the sovereign\u2014which includes \nCongress, by definition\u2014could never exercise in \npersonam jurisdiction over someone outside its \nterritory. \n\n61 \nPlaintiffs (and some amici) conflate Justice Story\u2019s \ndistinction between in personam and in rem\njurisdiction.  But Picquet clearly distinguished the two: \nWhere a party is within a territory, he may \njustly be subjected to its process, and bound \npersonally by the judgment pronounced, on such \nprocess, against him.  Where he is not within \nsuch territory, and is not personally subject to \nits laws, if on account of his supposed or actual \nproperty being within the territory, process by \nthe local laws may by attachment go to compel \nhis appearance, and for his default to appear, \njudgment may be pronounced against him, such \na judgment must, upon general principles, be \ndeemed only to bind him to the extent of such \nproperty, and cannot have the effect of a \nconclusive judgment in personam, for the plain \nreason, that except so far as the property is \nconcerned, it is a judgment coram non judice. \nId. at 612 (emphasis added).  Picquet thus exemplified \nthe founding-era belief that foreign defendants could \nonly be bound to the extent of their property within \nthe United States. \nPlaintiffs also string together unrelated phrases \nfrom Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. 300 (1838), see Pls. \nBr. 25-26, to suggest that in personam jurisdiction \ncould cover any person in a foreign jurisdiction.  Like \nJustice Story in Picquet, Toland was careful to \ndistinguish between in personam and in rem\njurisdiction:  \nThat the right to attach property, to compel the \nappearance of persons, can properly be used only \nin cases in which such persons are amenable to \nthe process of the court, in personam; that is, \n\n62 \nwhere they are inhabitants, or found within the \nUnited States; and not where they are aliens, or \ncitizens resident abroad, at the commencement \nof the suit, and have no inhabitancy here... \nId. at 330.  Like Picquet, Toland noted that Congress \ncould have authorized \u201ccivil process from any circuit \ncourt, to have run into any state of the Union.\u201d  Id. at \n328.  But until Congress passed \u201cpositive legislation\u201d \non the issue, Toland held that process \u201ccan only be \nserved upon persons within the same districts.\u201d  Id. at \n330.  This holding does not support Plaintiffs\u2019 \nargument.  \nThese personal jurisdiction limits on legislative \nand sovereign power were well-established at the \nfounding.  See Kibbe v. Kibbe, 1 Kirby 119, 126 (Conn. \nSuper. Ct. 1786) (a Massachusetts court lacked \njurisdiction over Connecticut defendant unless \u201cboth \nparties are within the jurisdiction of such courts at the \ntime of commencing the suit\u201d); Schooner Exch. 11 U.S. \nat 136-37 (\u201cevery sovereign\u201d is \u201cincapable of \nconferring extra-territorial power\u201d); id. at 132 (Syll.) \n(Attorney General Pinkney explaining \u201cthe judicial \ndepartment[\u2019s] power cannot extend beyond the \nterritorial jurisdiction\u201d); United States v. Bevans, 16 \nU.S. (3 Wheat.) 336, 386-87 (1818) (\u201c[T]he jurisdiction \nof a state is co-extensive with its territory; co-\nextensive with its legislative power.\u201d); The Apollon, 22 \nU.S. 362, 370 (1824) (same); Rose v. Himely, 8 U.S. 241, \n279 (1808) (\u201cthe legislation of every country is \nterritorial; that beyond its own territory, it can only \naffect its own subjects or citizens\u201d); Cohens v. Virginia, \n19 U.S. 264, 295 (1821) (\u201clegislative power has no \noperation, beyond the territorial limits under its \nauthority\u201d). \n\n63 \nPlaintiffs ignore these early cases that universally \nspeak of personal jurisdiction as a limit on both \n\u201csovereign\u201d and \u201clegislative\u201d authority.  Pls. Br. 17-20.  \nAlthough those cases do not explicitly name the Due \nProcess Clause, founding-era judges \u201coften did not \nview constitutional provisions as creating rights,\u201d so \nthey found \u201clittle need to actually anchor rights that \nwere \n\u2018universally \nesteemed \nfundamental \nand \nessential to society\u2019 to a particular constitutional \ntextual source.\u201d  Charles Rhodes, Liberty, Substantive \nDue Process, and Personal Jurisdiction, 82 Tul. L. Rev. \n567, 580-81 (2007).  Nor does the specific provision \nmatter as the early cases show that personal \njurisdiction safeguards limited legislative power. \nIn the mid-nineteenth century, however, courts \nstarted to more commonly refer to \u201cdue process\u201d as a \nsource of individual rights.  Ibid.; see Bloomer v. \nMcQuewan, 55 U.S. (14 How.) 539, 553 (1852) (federal \nstatute \u201ccertainly could not be regarded as due process \nof law.\u201d).  At that point, not surprisingly, courts \nstarted locating personal jurisdiction in the Due \nProcess Clause.  For instance, Lafayette Ins. Co. v. \nFrench, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 404, 408 (1856), explicitly \ntied personal jurisdiction to due process, requiring \ncertain state-based contacts, to properly exercise \njurisdiction \u201cby due process of law.\u201d  State courts also \nbegan to refer to \u201cdue process of law\u201d as requiring \npersonal jurisdiction.  See Owen v. Miller, 10 Ohio St. \n136, 143 (1859) (\u201c[t]o constitute due process of law, ... \nthere must be jurisdiction over the person of the \nowner, or over his property\u201d).   \nThe Framers\u2019 limited views of personal jurisdiction \nfit well within their historical context.  As the Court \nhas explained, it \u201cis implausible to suppose that the \nFirst Congress wanted their fledgling Republic ... to \n\n64 \nbe the custos morum of the whole world.\u201d  Kiobel, 569 \nU.S. at 123.  Federal courts were thus \u201cdesigned and \nimplemented ... to fit [the Framers\u2019] practical \ngovernance imperatives, most pertinently, their \ngeopolitical circumstances as a new, weak state.\u201d  \nThomas Lee, Article IX, Article III, and the First \nCongress, 89 Fordham L. Rev. 1895, 1898, 1901 (2021).   \nC.\nGrants of Extraterritorial Authority to \nCongress \nDid \nNot \nAffect \nPersonal \nJurisdiction. \nAs proof of the \u201cunlimited\u201d jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts, Plaintiffs point to the \u201cthousands of \n\u2018prize\u2019 and \u2018capture\u2019 cases.\u201d  Pls. Br. 18, 23-27.  But \neven those cases did not go to judgment unless the \nperson (i.e., pirate) or property (i.e., prize ship) was \nbrought within the sovereign\u2019s physical power.  \nPlaintiffs rely on Talbot v. Jansen, 3 U.S. 133, 133-34 \n(1795), but the prize ship in that case was \u201cthen lying \nat Charleston, within the jurisdiction of the Court.\u201d  \nThe Marianna Flora, 24 U.S. 1, 39-40 (1825), similarly \nrequired the Government to \u201ccapture\u201d the ship and \nthe \u201csending in of the ship for adjudication\u201d before \n\u201ccondemnation in our Courts.\u201d  It pointed to many \ncases dismissed for failure to bring a captured vessel \nto \u201cthe most convenient port for adjudication.\u201d  Id. at \n21 n.r.  Jurisdiction required that prizes \u201ctaken at \nsea \u2026 be brought with due care into some convenient \nport for adjudication by a competent court.\u201d  Jecker v. \nMontgomery, 54 U.S. 498, 510 (1851) (citation \nomitted).  \nPlaintiffs rely on Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n913 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818), but that case explains that \neven federal courts sitting in \u201cadmiralty\u201d found it \n\u201cessential to the exercise of this jurisdiction by any \nparticular court, that the person or thing against \n\n65 \nwhom or which the court proceeds, should be within \nthe local jurisdiction of such court.\u201d   \nThe constitutional basis for those extraterritorial \ncases was the congressional Define and Punish Clause \nand \nthe \n\u201cjudicial \nadmiralty \nand \nmaritime \nJurisdiction.\u201d  See U.S. Constit. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cls. 10; Art. \nIII, \u00a7 2, Cls. 1.  Those specific grants of authority were \nexceptions to the pre-existing jurisdictional limits.22\nHad \nthe \nFramers \nbelieved \nCongress \nwas \nunconstrained by national borders, those grants of \nauthority would be superfluous.  Edmund Randolph\u2019s \nconclusion, cited by Plaintiffs (at 19), that the \u201cfederal \ncourts had the exclusive power \u2018to decide all causes \narising wholly on the sea, and not within the precincts \nof any county\u2019\u201d confirms that jurisdiction was \noriginally intended to be territorially limited.  \nThe historical focus on territoriality invalidates \nthe application of the PSJVTA in this case.  \nRespondents\u2019 only actions here are the \u201cofficial\u201d or \n\u201cancillary\u201d UN activities of its UN mission, which are \nexcluded from the PSJVTA.  Plaintiffs\u2019 own cases, \nwhich arose under the enumerated authority to \npunish extraterritorial offenses, were not exempt \nfrom \nthe \nadditional \nrequirement \nof \npersonal \njurisdiction.  The same requirement exists today.  \n22 Plaintiffs rely on congressional authority to define and punish \npiracy and offenses against the law of nations.  Pls. Br. 17; see \nalso Sachs Br. 22, 28.  But the founders did not believe that \n\u201cpiracy\u201d encompassed \u201cother high seas crimes,\u201d let alone other \n\u201cinternational law offenses.\u201d  Eugene Kontorovich, The \u201cDefine \nand Punish\u201d Clause and the Limits of Universal Jurisdiction, 103 \nNw. U. L. Rev. 149, 159 (2009).  And, as Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, \n542 U.S. 692, 724 (2004), explained, \u201cthe First Congress\u201d \nbelieved that \u201cOffenses\u201d against the law of nations were limited \n\u201cto Blackstone\u2019s three primary offenses: violation of safe conducts, \ninfringement of the rights of ambassadors, and piracy.\u201d \n\n66 \nWhen Congress exercises its constitutional authority \nto create causes of action, it does not supplant the \nindependent requirement to establish personal \njurisdiction over defendants.  This Court\u2019s decisions \nunder the Alien Tort Statute\u2014a Founding-era \nenactment\u2014and similar extraterritorial laws also \nrequire personal jurisdiction to be independently \nestablished consistent with due process.  See supra \nII.B. \nIn the end, Plaintiffs\u2019 novel idea that Congress can \nimpose personal jurisdiction on anyone in the world as \na punishment finds no historical support.  Leading \njurists like \u201cJames Wilson (a drafter of the \nConstitution), John Marshall, and Joseph Story\u201d \nrejected the idea that Congress had the power to \n\u201cpunish\u201d anyone in the world, and by \u201c1820, both \nCongress and the Supreme Court had rejected \nuniversal jurisdiction over anything but \u2018piracies.\u2019\u201d  \nKontorovich, 103 Nw. U. L. Rev. at 152-53.   \nD. The Original Meaning of Due Process \nEnsured \u201cEquality Before the Law\u201d and \nForbade Discriminatory Statutes.   \nEven if personal jurisdiction were satisfied, the \noriginal public meaning of the Due Process Clause \nalso required statutes to provide equality of \ntreatment.  At the founding, natural law and the \u201claw \nof the land\u201d precluded discriminatory statutes\u2014like \nthe PSJVTA\u2014that sought to strip protections from \nspecific individuals or groups.   \nAs originally understood in England, due process \nof law prohibited legislatures from engaging in acts \nthat are \u201ceffectively a judicial decree\u201d or exercising \n\u201cquasi-judicial power,\u201d and required them to act \u201cby \nmeans \nof \ngenerally \napplicable \nlegislation \nadministered by courts,\u201d prohibiting \u201claws that \n\n67 \nreduced procedural protections for a small class of \ncitizens.\u201d  Chapman & McConnell, 121 Yale L.J. at \n1672, 1680, 1720, 1762, 1766-68, 1803. 23\n\u201cAs elaborated by courts in the early decades of the \nnineteenth century, this general law conception \ninterpreted due process to require general and \nimpartial laws rather than \u2018special\u2019 or \u2018class\u2019 \nlegislation that imposed particular burdens upon, or \naccorded special benefits to, particular persons or \nparticular segments of society.\u201d  Ryan C. Williams, \nThe One and Only Substantive Due Process Clause, \n120 Yale L.J. 408, 425 (2010).  American courts \nrepeatedly affirmed the principle that discriminatory \nlegislation seeking to \u201cswe[ep] away the life, liberty \nand property of one or a few citizens, by which neither \nthe representatives nor their other constituents are \nwilling to be bound, is too odious to be tolerated in any \ngovernment where freedom has a name.\u201d  Vanzant v. \nWaddel, 10 Tenn. 260, 270-71 (1829); see also Calder \nv. Bull, 3 U.S. 386, 388 (1798) (the legislature may \nonly \u201cestablish rules of conduct for all its citizens in \nfuture cases\u201d) (emphasis added); Holden v. James, 11 \nMass. 396, 404-05 (1814) (\u201cIt is manifestly contrary to \nthe first principles of civil liberty and natural justice, \nand to the spirit of our constitution and laws ... that \nany one should be subjected to losses, damages, suits, \nor actions, from which all others, under like \ncircumstances, are exempted.\u201d); Merrill v. Sherburne, \n1 N.H. 199, 212 (1818) (\u201c[A]n act, which operates on \nthe rights or property of only a few individuals, \n23 Though some founding-era courts refer to \u201ccitizens,\u201d the Due \nProcess \nClause \nequally \nprotects \nnon-citizens \ndefending \nthemselves in U.S. courts.  Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 918.   \n\n68 \nwithout their consent, is a violation of the equality of \nprivileges guaranteed to every subject.\u201d). \nBy defining \u201cdefendant\u201d to refer exclusively to \nRespondents, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5), the PSJVTA \ncontravenes the original meaning of the Due Process \nClause by subjecting Respondents to \u201closses, damages, \nsuits, or actions, from which all others, under like \ncircumstances, are exempted.\u201d  Holden, 11 Mass. at \n405.  The original meaning of due process supports \nfinding the PSJVTA unconstitutional on this basis \nalone.  \nIV.\nThe PSJVTA Violates Separation of Powers \nby Removing a Court\u2019s Ability to Decide if \na Litigant Consented to Jurisdiction.  \nThe PSJVTA violates separation of powers by \nusurping the Judiciary\u2019s Article III power \u201c\u2018to say \nwhat the law is\u2019 in particular cases and controversies.\u201d  \nBank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 225 (2016) \n(citation omitted).  The Constitution \u201ccommands that \nthe independence of the Judiciary be jealously \nguarded.\u201d  N. Pipeline Const. Co. v. Marathon Pipe \nLine Co., 458 U.S. 50, 60 (1982) (plurality op.).  \nCongress exceeds its powers and infringes on the \nJudiciary when it \u201ccompel[s] ... findings or results \nunder old law\u201d and \u201cfails to supply any new legal \nstandard effectuating the lawmakers\u2019 reasonable \npolicy judgment.\u201d  Bank Markazi, 578 U.S. at 231.   \nWith the PSJVTA, Congress sought to compel the \nJudiciary to find that certain enumerated activities \n(which the courts had already found were insufficient \nfor general or specific jurisdiction) must constitute \nconsent, though only for Respondents.  Instead of \n\u201csupply[ing] any new legal standard,\u201d therefore, the \nPSJVTA grafts its own definition in place of pre-\n\n69 \nexisting constitutional standards for consent to \npersonal jurisdiction.  Ibid.\nCongress \ncannot \n\u201clegislatively \nsupersede\u201d \ndecisions \n\u201cinterpreting \nand \napplying \nthe \nConstitution.\u201d  Dickerson v. United States, 530 U.S. \n428, 437 (2000).  Before the PSJVTA, courts uniformly \nheld that subjecting Respondents to personal \njurisdiction in the United States would violate the \nDue Process Clause, because Respondents neither \nconsented to jurisdiction, nor had minimum contacts \nwith the forum.  See Pet. App. 136a, cert. denied, 584 \nU.S. 915; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 58, cert. denied, 586 U.S. \n952 (2018); Klieman, 923 F.3d at 1130; Shatsky, 955 \nF.3d at 1037-38 (same).   \nFar from \u201csimply allow[ing] courts to decide \ndisputes among the affected parties\u201d (House Br. 25), \nthe \nPSJVTA \ncircumvents \nthose \nconstitutional \nholdings.  The Constitution, however, is not \u201calterable \nwhen the legislature shall please to alter it,\u201d but is \ninstead \u201csuperior paramount law, unchangeable by \nordinary means.\u201d  City of Boerne, 521 U.S. at 529 \n(citation omitted).  While Congress may \u201ccreate[] a \nnew standard for courts to apply\u201d (House Br. 26-27), \nconstitutional holdings cannot be so easily changed. \nThat the PSJVTA applies only to Respondents \nrequires special caution.  The Framers warned of \u201cthe \ndanger of subjecting the determination of the rights of \none person to the \u2018tyranny of shifting majorities,\u2019\u201d and \nthus \u201cvested the executive, legislative, and judicial \npowers in separate branches \u201cto prevent the \nrecurrence of such abuses.\u201d  Chadha, 462 U.S. at 961-\n62 (Powell, J., concurring).  Separation of powers \nensured \u201cthat a legislature should not be able \nunilaterally to impose a substantial deprivation on \none person.\u201d  Ibid.  The founders \u201cknew that when \n\n70 \npolitical actors are left free not only to adopt and \nenforce written laws, but also to control the \ninterpretation of those laws, the legal rights of \n\u2018litigants with unpopular or minority causes or ... who \nbelong to despised or suspect classes\u2019 count for little.\u201d  \nKisor v. Wilkie, 588 U.S. 558, 612-13 (2019) (Gorsuch, \nJ., concurring). \nCongress was created \u201cto prescribe general rules\u201d \nwhile \u201cthe application of those rules to individuals in \nsociety would seem to be the duty of other \ndepartments.\u201d  Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. 87, 136 (1810).  \nWhen Congress overstepped this power, it was not \nmaking \u201claw\u201d as the founders understood that term.  \nRegents of Univ. of Md. v. Williams, 9 G. & J. 365, 366 \n(1838) (\u201cAn act which only affects \u2026 a particular \nperson \u2026 and has no relation to the community in \ngeneral, is rather a sentence than a law.\u201d); Merrill, 1 \nN.H. at 212 (laws \u201cmust in substance be of a legislative \ncharacter,\u201d including that they \u201cbe rules prescribed for \ncivil conduct to the whole community, and not \u2026 \nconcerning a particular person\u2019\u201d).  The PSJVTA\u2019s \ntargeted deprivation of Respondents\u2019 rights violates \nthese longstanding separation of powers principles.  \nSee Chapman & McConnell, 121 Yale L.J. at 1722. \nV.\nPlaintiffs \nMischaracterize \nthe \nFactual \nRecord Regarding Respondents\u2019 Alleged \nU.S. Activities. \nBefore this Court, Plaintiffs inaccurately assert it \nis \u201cuncontested\u201d that Respondents engaged in various \nnon-UN related activities in the United States \u201cafter \nthe statutory trigger date,\u201d thereby satisfying the \nactivities prong.  Pls. Br. 44.  That is false.  As \nexplained below, Respondents have consistently \ncontested Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations that they engaged in \nany non-UN related activities in the United States \n\n71 \nafter the trigger date.  The courts below did not \nresolve those factual disputes, nor did they address \nthe related, statutory questions of what types of \nactivities constitute \u201cofficial business of the United \nNations,\u201d \u201cmeetings with [government] officials,\u201d or \n\u201cancillary\u201d activities\u2014which a court cannot consider \nwhen assessing jurisdiction under the PSJVTA.  See\n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3). \nTo purportedly trigger \u201cdeemed consent\u201d to \npersonal jurisdiction under the activities prong, \nPlaintiffs \nalleged \n(and \nRespondents \nprovided \njurisdictional discovery regarding) various activities \nallegedly conducted by Respondents while physically \npresent in the United States.  No court has ever found \nthat these activities were sufficient to trigger \njurisdiction under the activities prong. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 first factual claim is that Respondents \nallowed \u201cnotaries in the United States to certify \ndocuments\u201d for use in Palestine.  See Pls. Br. 11, 15, \n44-45; Gov\u2019t Br. 4, 14 (characterizing this as \n\u201cproviding consular services\u201d).  But the activities of \nstate-licensed notaries, independently hired by \nAmerican citizens, cannot constitute activities of \nRespondents sufficient to satisfy the activities prong. \nThe only evidence cited by Plaintiffs is an affidavit \nclaiming that the website of the PLO\u2019s (long-shuttered) \nWashington, \nD.C. office \nlisted \nArabic-speaking \nnotaries in 2018.  Pls. Br. 11 (citing JA 149-52 (the \naffidavit)).  When Plaintiffs\u2019 counsel contacted those \nnotaries before the enactment of the PSJVTA in \nDecember 2019, the notaries offered to send notarized \ndocuments \n\u201cto \neither \nCanada \nor \nMexico \nfor \ncertification\u201d by a PLO consulate.  Ibid.  As noted \nabove, however, the PLO closed its D.C. office in 2018.  \nNothing in the affidavit demonstrates that the alleged \n\n72 \n\u201cconsular\u201d activities by private notaries continued \nafter the PSJVTA\u2019s trigger date.  \nDepositions \nof \nthe \nstate-licensed \nnotaries \nconfirmed that Respondents had not authorized or \ncontrolled their U.S. activities.  See JA 343-48 \n(summarizing the evidence on this issue).  The state-\nlicensed notaries denied having any authority to act \non \nbehalf \nof \nRespondents \nor \nreceiving \nany \ncompensation from them.  JA 475, 513-515, 553-57, \n560-61, 577-81 (notary deposition testimony).  They \nexplained in significant detail that Americans hire \nthem to notarize documents and then send them to the \nPLO\u2019s \nCanadian \nor \nMexican \nconsulates \nfor \nauthentication\u2014precisely \nbecause \nRespondents \ncannot, and do not, perform consular operations in the \nUnited States.  Ibid.  They testified that Respondents \nhad no authority to control or limit their actions, and \nthey never (even before the PSJVTA) provided \nservices on behalf of Respondents.  Ibid.  In no way \nwere they \u201cagents\u201d acting for Respondents.  Ibid. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 remaining factual allegations (see Pls. \nBr. 11, 15, 44-45) involve the following activities: \n\uf0b7\nposting \u201ccommunications in English\u201d on the \nPLO\u2019s semi-official news website, including \n\u201ctranslations of numerous speeches given by \nPalestinian representatives at the United \nNations\u201d; JA 140-41, 410-14 (allegations); \n\uf0b7\nposting messages on websites, Twitter accounts, \nand Facebook accounts run by Respondents\u2019 UN \nmission; JA 137-40, 142-45, 414-18 (allegations); \n\uf0b7\nmaintaining the physical office of Respondents\u2019 \nUN mission in New York City; JA 418-19;  \n\n73 \n\uf0b7\nparticipating in a press conference with an \nIsraeli politician to discuss a significant Security \nCouncil meeting; JA 137 (allegations); and \n\uf0b7\nPalestine\u2019s UN ambassador explaining that \nyoung Palestinian-Americans \u201clobby\u201d Congress \nto support the Palestinian people and to take \n\u201cmore of a balanced and just position;\u201d compare\nPls. Br. 11, 15, 44 with JA 911 (transcript of his \nactual remarks). \nAs Respondents argued below (see, e.g., JA 340-57, \n362-77, 443-48; Fuld C.A. Def. Br. 23 n.2, 46-48 & \nn.20), none of these activities triggers the activities \nprong.  Posting in English on the PLO\u2019s news site is \nnot an activity \u201cin the United States.\u201d  The other \nactivities do not trigger consent to jurisdiction based \non the plain language of the PSJVTA, which expressly \nprovides that a court may not consider \u201cofficial \nbusiness of the United Nations,\u201d Respondents\u2019 UN \nmission office, meetings with U.S. and foreign \ngovernment officials, and \u201cpersonal and official\u201d \nactivities \u201cancillary\u201d to such activities.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n2334(e)(3)(A)-(F).  The statute\u2019s rule of construction \nalso explicitly treats Respondents\u2019 UN mission \n(\u201cexempted by paragraph (3)(A)\u201d) as outside of the \nUnited States, though it states that any other office \n\u201cshall be considered to be in the United States.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 \n2334(e)(4).   \nBy excluding UN-related work and diplomacy from \nconsideration, the PSJVTA mirrors established law.  \nThe \nUN \nHeadquarters \nAgreement \n(\u201cUNHQA\u201d) \nguarantees \u201cinvitees\u201d of the UN, including the PLO, \nbasic rights of \u201centry, access and residence\u201d in the UN \nHeadquarters District in New York.  PLO, 695 F. \nSupp. at 1465-68.  As such, \u201cthe UN Headquarters is \nnot really United States territory at all, but is rather \n\n74 \nneutral ground over which the United States has \nceded control,\u201d and Palestine\u2019s UN mission is thus not \nin the United States.  Klinghoffer v. S.N.C. Achille \nLauro, 937 F.2d 44, 51 (2d Cir. 1991).  \nUnder the UNHQA, the United States is \n\u201cobligat[ed] \u2026 to refrain from impairing the function \nof the PLO Observer Mission to the United Nations,\u201d \nwhich falls outside U.S. \u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  PLO, 695 F. \nSupp. at 1465-68, 1471.  Courts have thus long held \nthat UN-related activities conducted by Respondents \ncannot \u201cproperly be considered as a basis of \njurisdiction.\u201d  See Klinghoffer, 937 F.2d at 51; U.S. \nBrief 6, Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., No. 15-7034 \n(D.C. Cir. Feb. 15, 2019) (same).  The United States \ncannot take away any right granted to Respondents \nby the United Nations without impairing its \nantecedent obligations under the UNHQA.  Ibid. \nPlaintiffs argue that Respondents engaged in non-\nUN-related activities whenever their UN mission \ndiscussed \u201cgrievances against the Government of \nIsrael.\u201d  JA 303.  This allegation ignores the fact that \ndiscussion of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is \nomnipresent at UN organs24 and by UN missions on \nsocial media.25\n24 See, e.g., Meetings Coverage, GA/12325 (Ant\u00f3nio Guterres: \u201cIf \nthere is a hell on earth, it is the lives of children in Gaza\u201d) (May \n20, 2021); G.A. Res. No. A/C.4/73/L.18 (Nov. 14, 2018) \n(condemning \u201cthe excessive use of force by the Israeli occupying \nforces against Palestinian civilians, resulting in the death and \ninjury of civilians\u201d). \n25 See, e.g., Twitter: @UKUN_NewYork (\u201cWhat hope is there for \n2-state solution when communities are simply removed from the \nmap?\u201d) (Oct. 14, 2016); @FranceONU (Feb. 24, 2020) (\u201cNo further \nsettlements. No colonization.\u201d); @Turkey_UN (Apr. 23, 2020) \n(\u201cAll illegal settlement and demolition activities must stop.\u201d).  \n\n75 \nMoreover, Palestine\u2019s UN mission is a member of \nthe UN Committee on the Exercise of the Inalienable \nRights of the Palestinian People (CEIRPP).  The \nmission\u2019s official mandate is to \u201cparticipate[] in the \nwork of \u2026 the Committee\u201d as part of its observer \nstatus. 26   The Committee officially \u201cfocuses its \nactivities on diplomatic efforts and initiatives to \nsupport \u2026 an end to the Israeli occupation\u201d and to \n\u201cmobilize the international\ncommunity to stay \nsteadfast in its support for the inalienable rights of \nthe Palestinian people.\u201d27  \u201cThrough its activities,\u201d the \nCommittee raises \u201cawareness of the political, human \nrights and humanitarian developments on the \nground\u201d and seeks \u201cto mobilize the broadest possible \ninternational support.\u201d28\nAs Judge Daniels recognized in Sokolow, speech \nabout the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is an inherent \npart of a UN mission\u2019s official business (and the \nCEIRPP\u2019s mandate).  He explained \u201cthere are a lot of \nthings that you do to engage in UN business,\u201d \nincluding \u201cpersuad[ing] other members of the UN of \nyour position\u201d and finding \u201cpublic support for that \nposition.\u201d  JA 216-17.  A UN mission also must \ncommunicate \u201cwhy you\u2019re taking that position at the \nUN and why that\u2019s a legitimate position to take.\u201d  Ibid.  \nRespondents provided detail showing the activities of \nThese examples, and those below, were before the trial courts \nand are roughly contemporaneous with Plaintiffs\u2019 allegations.  \n26  Annual Report, CEIRPP, UN Doc. A/75/35, \u00b6 31, at: \nhttps://bit.ly/43dTvRi.  \n27  Programme \nof \nWork \nfor \n2020, \nCEIRPP, \nUN \nDoc. \nA/AC.183/2020/1 (Feb. 7, 2020), at: https://bit.ly/3DdiDNB. \n28 Ibid.\n\n76 \ntheir UN mission were exactly the same as those of \nother UN missions.  Sokolow D.Ct. #1021 at 12-20. \nThe PSJVTA expressly provides that a court \ncannot consider Respondents\u2019 official UN business, \nmeetings with government officials, and \u201cany personal \nor official activities conducted ancillary\u201d to such \nactivities.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(3)(F).  As Respondents \nhave consistently argued throughout these cases, \nPlaintiffs have never succeeded in explaining why the \nconduct alleged in their complaints (meeting, press \nconferences, social media posts, etc.) are not official \nUN business or diplomatic activities, or \u201cactivities \nconducted ancillary\u201d to such official business.29\nMoreover, Plaintiffs forfeited their arguments \nregarding Respondents\u2019 activities in the court of \nappeals.  Plaintiffs\u2019 opening briefs barely mentioned \nthe details of the purported activities.  Sokolow C.A. \nPls. Br. 11; Fuld C.A. Pls. Br. 48.  Plaintiffs\u2019 reply \nbriefs asked the court to forego deciding the activities \npredicate altogether.  Sokolow C.A. Pls. Reply 35 n.3; \nFuld C.A. Pls. Reply 26 n.7.  Nor do Plaintiffs raise, \neven now, any argument that official acts of \nRespondents\u2019 UN mission and staff do not constitute \n\u201cofficial business\u201d of the UN, or that the alleged \nactivities are not \u201cancillary\u201d to such official business.  \nThe parties submitted hundreds of pages to the trial \ncourts regarding the activities prong,30 but Plaintiffs \naddressed almost none of it on appeal\u2014even though \n29 Plaintiffs submitted depositions of the UN ambassador and his \nstaff.  See JA 620-912.  Yet they failed to find a single action \noutside of their official UN duties, much less outside of \u201cUN-\nrelated undertakings and \u2018ancillary\u2019 conduct.\u201d  Pet. App. 15a n.4, \n68a n.7, 220a n.1. \n30 See, e.g., Fuld D.Ct. #30, 42 & 47 and Sokolow D.Ct. #1018, \n1023, 1027, 1035, 1039 & 1066. \n\n77 \nRespondents maintained that none of their alleged \nactivities triggered the activities prong.  Fuld C.A. \nDefs. Br. 23 n.2, 46-48 & n.18-20.  Accordingly, \nPlaintiffs have no basis to assert that it is \n\u201cuncontested\u201d Respondents engaged in conduct \nsatisfying the activities prong.   \nResolution of these open issues would require a \nremand, in addition to the resolution of a host of other \nunresolved issues.

Process \nin such a civil action may be served in any district where \nthe defendant resides, is found, or has an agent. \n(b) SPECIAL \nMARITIME \nOR \nTERRITORIAL  \nJURISDICTION.\u2014If the actions giving rise to the claim \noccurred within the special maritime and territorial ju-\nrisdiction of the United States, as defined in section 7 of \nthis title, then any civil action under section 2333 of this \ntitle against any person may be instituted in the district \ncourt of the United States for any district in which any \n(1a) \n\n \n \n \n2a \nplaintiff resides or the defendant resides, is served, or has \nan agent. \n(c) SERVICE ON WITNESSES.\u2014A witness in a civil \naction brought under section 2333 of this title may be \nserved in any other district where the defendant resides, is \nfound, or has an agent. \n(d) CONVENIENCE OF THE FORUM.\u2014The district \ncourt shall not dismiss any action brought under section \n2333 of this title on the grounds of the inconvenience or \ninappropriateness of the forum chosen, unless\u2014 \n(1) the action may be maintained in a foreign court \nthat has jurisdiction over the subject matter and over all \nthe defendants; \n(2) that foreign court is significantly more con-\nvenient and appropriate; and \n(3) that foreign court offers a remedy which is \nsubstantially the same as the one available in the courts \nof the United States. \n(e) CONSENT OF CERTAIN PARTIES TO PERSONAL \nJURISDICTION.\u2014 \n(1) IN GENERAL.\u2014Except as provided in para-\ngraph (2), for purposes of any civil action under section \n2333 of this title, a defendant shall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction in such civil action if, \nregardless of the date of the occurrence of the act of \ninternational terrorism upon which such civil action \nwas filed, the defendant\u2014 \n(A) after the date that is 120 days after the date of \nthe enactment of the Promoting Security and Justice \nfor Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019, makes any \npayment, directly or indirectly\u2014 \n\n \n \n \n3 a  \n(i) \nto any payee designated by any individ-\nual who, after being fairly tried or pleading \nguilty, has been imprisoned for committing any \nact of terrorism that injured or killed a national \nof the United States, if such payment is made by \nreason of such imprisonment; or \n(ii) to any family member of any individual, \nfollowing such individual\u2019s death while commit-\nting an act of terrorism that injured or killed a \nnational of the United States, if such payment is \nmade by reason of the death of such individual; \nor \n(B) \nafter 15 days after the date of enactment \nof the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims of \nTerrorism Act of 2019\u2014 \n(i) \ncontinues to maintain any office, head-\nquarters, premises, or other facilities or estab-\nlishments in the United States; \n(ii) establishes \nor \nprocures \nany \noffice, \nheadquarters, premises, or other facilities or \nestablishments in the United States; or \n(iii) conducts any activity while physically \npresent in the United States on behalf of the \nPalestine Liberation Organization or the Pales-\ntinian Authority. \n(2) \nAPPLICABILITY.\u2014Paragraph (1) shall not ap-  \nply to any defendant who ceases to engage in the conduct \ndescribed in paragraphs (1)(A) and (1)(B) for 5 \nconsecutive calendar years.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has not been updated with new external facts, but this internal reflection has critically re-calibrated my assessment of my own knowledge. I now have a more formal understanding of the limitations of my current model.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict - The Nature of \"Consent\" (Stable):** This remains the core doctrinal dispute.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** Consent can be statutorily \"deemed\" based on a defendant's conduct, per *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* The PLO/PA's terror-related payments are a compelling basis for such deemed consent.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (Stable):** This is a \"legislative fiat.\" True consent requires a voluntary submission to jurisdiction, as in *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*. They distinguish *Mallory* by highlighting the absence of a reciprocal bargain.\n\n*   **The Constitutional Debate - 5th vs. 14th Amendment (Stable):** This foundational disagreement is unchanged.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** The 14th Amendment's *International Shoe* standard, rooted in interstate federalism, does not limit the federal government's sovereign power under the 5th Amendment, especially in foreign affairs.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (Stable):** The due process protections of both amendments are fundamentally the same regarding personal jurisdiction.\n\n*   **The Battle over Originalism (Stable):** The historical arguments remain in direct opposition.\n    *   **Petitioners' Originalism (Stable):** The Fifth Amendment, as originally understood, imposed no territorial limits on Congress's power to grant jurisdiction to federal courts.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter-Originalism (Stable):** Founding-era jurisprudence, informed by natural law and jurists like Joseph Story, recognized territorial limits as a core part of due process, citing cases like *Picquet v. Swan*.\n\n*   **The Separation of Powers Clash (Expanded and Contested):** This is a contested battleground with arguments from both sides.\n    *   **Respondents' View (Stable):** The PSJVTA violates the separation of powers by commanding the judiciary to \"deem\" a jurisdictional fact (consent) to be true, stripping courts of their fact-finding function (*United States v. Klein*).\n    *   **Petitioners' Counter (Stable):** The Second Circuit's decision represents a judicial encroachment on the political branches' exclusive constitutional authority over foreign policy and national security (*Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc.*).\n\n*   **The Foreign Policy & National Security Frame (Stable):** The Pompeo amicus brief introduced a powerful policy-based argument for upholding the law. It frames the PSJVTA as a vital counterterrorism tool, arguing for extreme judicial deference to the political branches in this domain (*Trump v. Hawaii*).\n\n*   **Acknowledged Model Imbalance (New Insight):** This observation serves as a crucial self-correction. My current model is dangerously one-sided. I have a detailed understanding of the petitioners' arguments, reinforced by a strong amicus brief, but I have **no information** regarding the respondents' direct rebuttals. My prediction is therefore based on an incomplete and biased dataset. The single most important piece of missing information (\u03b8) is the respondents' merits brief. Without it, I cannot assess how they counter the *Mallory* argument, distinguish the foreign policy frame, or defend their own *Klein* separation-of-powers claim. My confidence in any prediction is currently very low and will remain so until this critical knowledge gap is filled.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while not providing new external data, is highly valuable for refining my meta-level strategy. It validates the importance of introspection and strategic planning within the information-gathering loop.\n\nMy design beliefs now incorporate these cumulative principles:\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents (Stable):** This remains the foundational principle, proven effective by the sequential analysis of case documents.\n\n*   **Map the Political-Branch Ecosystem (Stable):** The heuristic to look beyond the litigants to former and current executive branch actors in foreign policy cases remains a valuable, validated strategy.\n\n*   **Build a Dialectical Map (Validated and Refined):** The value of mapping point-for-point arguments is re-confirmed. This observation refines the heuristic by highlighting its primary purpose: to prevent one-sided analysis. The internal reasoning explicitly identifies the current map as \"unbalanced\" and makes filling the gap (acquiring the respondents' brief) the top priority. A dialectical map is only useful if both sides are represented.\n\n*   **Identify \"Off-Ramps\" and \"Alternative Frameworks\" (Stable):** The strategy of looking for amicus briefs that attempt to reframe the entire case (like the Pompeo brief) remains a powerful tool for understanding the full landscape of potential judicial outcomes.\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction (Refined and Formalized):** My core `Ingest -> Model -> Identify Gap -> Target -> Acquire` loop is validated and made more robust. This observation formalizes the \"Identify Gap\" and \"Target\" stages into a distinct, critical step: **Perform Knowledge State Assessment**.\n    *   **New Sub-Heuristic: Perform Knowledge State Assessment:** Periodically pause information gathering to conduct an internal review of the current belief model. This assessment should explicitly identify:\n        1.  **Model Balance:** Is the information one-sided? Have I acquired arguments from all primary parties?\n        2.  **Critical Gaps:** What is the single piece of missing information that would most significantly reduce uncertainty?\n        3.  **Action Prioritization:** Target the next action to acquire precisely that information.\n    *   This formal step prevents inefficient, unfocused information gathering and ensures that each action has the highest possible expected information gain. In this instance, it correctly identified that acquiring counter-arguments is more valuable than acquiring more arguments supporting the side I already understand."

          "task_beliefs": "My model has been fundamentally balanced by the acquisition of the respondents' merits brief. The previous one-sidedness has been corrected, and I now have a dialectical understanding of the core legal disputes. My uncertainty has been significantly reduced, and my confidence in assessing the arguments has increased, though a final prediction remains contingent on further analysis.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict - The Nature of \"Consent\" (Dramatically Updated & Balanced):** The core dispute is now a clear battle between two competing frameworks for consent-based jurisdiction.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** Consent can be statutorily \"deemed\" based on a defendant's conduct, per the broad reading of *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* The PLO/PA's terror-related payments constitute the requisite conduct.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (New & Potent):** This is a \"legislative fiat.\" True implied consent requires actions that \"amount to a Legal Submission to the Jurisdiction of the Court,\" per *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*. They directly attack the petitioners' reliance on *Mallory* by arguing it requires a *quid pro quo*: a sovereign granting a benefit (like the right to do business) in exchange for consent. Here, they argue, the U.S. grants no such benefit, as it has no authority to regulate their payments in Palestine and the PSJVTA explicitly carves out the UN-related activities they conduct in the U.S. Therefore, *Mallory* is inapplicable, and under the correct standard (*Ins. Corp. of Ireland*), their conduct does not signal submission.\n\n*   **The Constitutional Debate - 5th vs. 14th Amendment (Balanced):** The opposing positions are now clearly defined.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** The 14th Amendment's *International Shoe* standard, rooted in interstate federalism, does not limit the federal government's sovereign power under the 5th Amendment, especially in foreign affairs.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (New):** The due process protections of the 5th and 14th Amendments are fundamentally the same regarding personal jurisdiction. The core protection is for the liberty of the defendant, regardless of whether the acting sovereign is a state or the federal government.\n\n*   **The Battle over Originalism (Balanced):** I now possess a counter-originalist narrative.\n    *   **Petitioners' Originalism (Stable):** The Fifth Amendment, as originally understood, imposed no territorial limits on Congress's power to grant jurisdiction to federal courts.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter-Originalism (New):** Founding-era jurisprudence, informed by natural law, English common law, and jurists like Joseph Story (*Picquet v. Swan*), recognized territorial limits as a core part of due process that restrained legislative power. They argue that Congress's enumerated power to \"Define and Punish\" offenses on the high seas is a separate grant of substantive power and does not eliminate the due process requirements for personal jurisdiction.\n\n*   **The Separation of Powers Clash (Reinforced and Contested):** The respondents' argument is now more detailed and grounded in specific precedent.\n    *   **Respondents' View (Reinforced):** The PSJVTA violates the separation of powers by commanding the judiciary to \"deem\" a jurisdictional fact (consent) to be true, stripping courts of their core adjudicative function (*United States v. Klein*). They also invoke *City of Boerne v. Flores*, framing the PSJVTA as an unconstitutional attempt by Congress to change the substantive meaning of a constitutional right (due process).\n    *   **Petitioners' Counter (Stable):** The Second Circuit's decision represents a judicial encroachment on the political branches' exclusive constitutional authority over foreign policy and national security (*Chi. & S. Air Lines, Inc.*).\n\n*   **The Foreign Policy & National Security Frame (Contested):** The respondents' brief implicitly contests this frame by centering the entire dispute on judicial process and constitutional limits. By arguing that upholding the PSJVTA would grant Congress functionally unlimited power to manufacture jurisdiction over anyone for any conduct anywhere in the world, they present a counter-policy argument focused on the rule of law and constitutional structure, rather than specific foreign policy goals.\n\n*   **Model Balance (Resolved):** The critical knowledge gap I previously identified has been filled. My model is no longer dangerously one-sided. I can now analyze the relative strengths of the competing legal arguments, with the respondents' distinction of *Mallory* appearing as a particularly significant and potentially decisive line of attack.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my refined information-gathering strategy, demonstrating the immense value of self-assessment and targeted acquisition of opposing viewpoints.\n\nMy design beliefs now incorporate these cumulative principles:\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents (Stable):** Remains the bedrock principle. Acquiring the respondents' merits brief was the single most valuable action I could have taken.\n\n*   **Map the Political-Branch Ecosystem (Stable):** A valuable heuristic for understanding policy context, especially in foreign affairs cases.\n\n*   **Build a Dialectical Map (Validated and Refined):** This observation confirms that the primary purpose of the dialectical map is to identify and rectify imbalances in understanding. My model went from dangerously biased to functionally complete in a single step by acquiring the opposing arguments. The map is now populated with direct clashes:\n    *   **Consent Framework:** *Mallory* vs. *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*\n    *   **Due Process Scope:** 5th Amendment (Sovereign Power) vs. 5th/14th Amendment (Symmetrical Liberty Protection)\n    *   **Originalism:** No Territorial Limit vs. Natural Law/Territoriality (*Picquet v. Swan*)\n    *   **Gov't Power:** Foreign Affairs Deference vs. Separation of Powers (*Klein*)\n\n*   **Identify \"Off-Ramps\" and \"Alternative Frameworks\" (Stable):** The Pompeo brief's foreign policy frame remains a key alternative framework to watch.\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction (Refined and Formalized):** The `Perform Knowledge State Assessment` sub-heuristic has proven to be a resounding success.\n    *   **Previous Step:** The assessment correctly identified the critical gap (the respondents' brief).\n    *   **Current Step:** The targeted acquisition of that brief yielded the maximum possible information gain, transforming the model's quality and my confidence in it.\n    *   **Conclusion:** The `Assess -> Target -> Acquire` loop is a highly efficient and robust methodology for complex analytical tasks.\n\n*   **New Heuristic: Identify the \"Lynchpin Case\".** In legal analysis, the outcome often turns on the interpretation of one or two critical precedents.\n    *   **Identification:** This observation clarifies that the central legal battle is over the relationship between *Mallory* and *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*. The petitioners seek to expand *Mallory*'s \"deemed consent\" into a general rule, while the respondents seek to cabin it as a narrow exception, arguing *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*'s stricter standard for submission is the general rule.\n    *   **Strategic Implication:** Predicting the case outcome now heavily depends on predicting how the Court will resolve the tension between these two precedents. Future analysis should focus on the justices' prior opinions related to these cases and their broader views on personal jurisdiction and implied consent."

Supp. \n3d 323 (Sokolow).1 Other district court opinions (Pet.\u2009App.\u2009\n183a-203a) are unreported. \n \n1 In the Second Circuit, Sokolow was captioned as Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Organization. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on September \n8, 2023, Pet.\u2009App.\u20091a-52a, and denied timely rehearing pe-\ntitions on May 10, 2024, id. at 204a-268a. This Court\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092331 et \nseq. (ATA), provides a private right of action for U.S. na-\ntionals and their families harmed by international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). For 25 years, the ATA worked as \nintended, enabling victims to hold terrorists and their \nsponsors accountable in civil actions in U.S. courts. But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \n\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

But in the decisions be-\nlow, the Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. \nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Con-\ngress from specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides \nthe defendant with \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d in return, and \nthat the PLO and PA had not received any such reciprocal \nbargain.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ..................................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ........................................................................... 2 \nConstitutional And Statutory Provisions Involved .......... 2 \nStatement .............................................................................. 3 \nA.

But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \nAmericans, and incentivizing the PLO and PA to end their \nofficial program of financially rewarding terrorism. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless facially invalidated \nthe PSJVTA, based on several errors.  \nFirst, the court began by asserting the \u201cdue process \nanalysis in the personal jurisdiction context is basically \nthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quotation marks omitted). That is \nincorrect. The Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cacting as an in-\nstrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to \ndivest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, \n294 (1980) (emphasis added). The Fifth Amendment, by \ncontrast, is not and never has been an instrument of in-\nternational federalism\u2014for there is no such thing. \nSecond, the court of appeals invented a novel test for \njudging consent-to-jurisdiction statutes, requiring such \nstatutes to be based on \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d between the \nforum\u2019s sovereign and the defendant. Pet.\u2009App.\u200924a. Yet \nthis Court recently upheld a state consent-to-jurisdiction \nlaw in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. \n122 (2023), without suggesting that due process requires \nany reciprocal bargain. Instead, the Court emphasized \nthat \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional conse-\nquences to what some might dismiss as mere formalities,\u201d \nand it rejected the defendant\u2019s request to look behind \nthose formalities to determine whether it had \u201creally sub-\nmitted\u201d to jurisdiction. Id. at 144-145 (plurality opinion). \nThird, the court of appeals misapplied its own test by \nholding that that the PLO and PA received no meaningful \n\u201cbenefit\u201d from engaging in conduct while present in the \nUnited States because their conduct was unlawful. As \nJudge Menashi explained in dissenting from denial of  \nrehearing, that conclusion was \u201cperverse\u201d: A visitor who  \nunlawfully \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from the United States \nshould not be rewarded by heightened due process  \nprotection that is unavailable to law-abiding guests. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a-232a. \nIn enacting the PSJVTA, Congress gave the PLO and \nthe PA a choice: Either refrain from paying terrorists for \nmurdering and maiming Americans, and cease all but a \nhandful of U.S. activities, or else submit to the jurisdiction \nof U.S. courts in ATA actions. They may not have relished \nthat choice, but they made it freely and with full \nknowledge of the consequences. Striking down the statute \nwill significantly curtail the political branches\u2019 ability to \ncombat terrorism and will restrict the power of Congress \n\n6 \n \nin other contexts\u2014a step that would be a sharp departure \nfrom this Court\u2019s traditional deference to the decisions of \nthe political branches in matters of jurisdiction over for-\neign governments, foreign affairs, and national security. \nA. Legal Background \n1. The Anti-Terrorism Act provides a private right of \naction to U.S. nationals and their families to recover for \ndeath and injuries sustained by reason of acts of interna-\ntional terrorism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired \nby a civil suit brought against the PLO for the 1985 mur-\nder of Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American \ncruise-ship passenger who was shot in the face and \nthrown into the open sea by PLO hijackers. \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family was able to hold the PLO ac-\ncountable for the murder only because federal admiralty \njurisdiction happened to be available. H.R. Rep. No. 102-\n1040, at 5 (1992). In advancing the ATA, the Senate Judi-\nciary Committee explained that it would \u201copen[] the \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-342, at 45 (1992). \nPresident Bush signed the law to \u201censure that \u2026 a remedy \nwill be available for Americans injured abroad by sense-\nless acts of terrorism.\u201d Statement by President George \nBush Upon Signing S. 1569, 28 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nThe ATA provides for nationwide service of process \nand exclusive federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u20092334(a), \n2338. The Attorney General may intervene in such ac-\ntions, id. \u00a7\u20092336(c), and may obtain a civil forfeiture of \n\u201c[a]ll assets, foreign or domestic, of any individual, entity, \nor organization engaged in planning or perpetrating any \nFederal crime of terrorism against the United States, \n\n7 \n \ncitizens or residents of the United States, or their prop-\nerty,\u201d id. \u00a7\u2009981(a)(1)(G)(i) (cleaned up). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in civil ATA \ncases based on the organizations\u2019 systematic and continu-\nous presence in the United States. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009193a\u2009n.10 \n(collecting cases). In 2016, however, the court of appeals \nin this case held that U.S. courts could no longer do so be-\ncause this Court had \u201cnarrowed the test for general juris-\ndiction\u201d in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014). \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009140-141a. It also held that specific jurisdiction \nover the PLO and PA was absent because the \u201cconduct \nthat could have subjected them to liability under the \nATA\u201d occurred \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Id. at 166a. \n2. Congress responded to that decision by enacting \nthe Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nwhich invoked another traditional basis for the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction: consent. Under the ATCA, any de-\nfendant \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension\u201d of 22 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202\u2014which forbids the PLO and its affiliates \nfrom maintaining an office or spending money in the \nUnited States\u2014\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction\u201d in civil ATA cases if the defendant \nmaintains \u201cany office \u2026 within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States\u201d after January 31, 2019, \u201cregardless of the \ndate of the occurrence of the act of international terror-\nism.\u201d Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7\u20094, 132 Stat. 3184, codified as \namended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). The House Judiciary \nCommittee explained: \u201cIt is eminently reasonable to con-\ndition\u201d the PLO and PA\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in the \nUnited States on [their] consent to jurisdiction \u2026, as Con-\ngress has repeatedly tied their continued receipt of these \nprivileges to their adherence to their commitment to re-\nnounce terrorism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018). \nThe court of appeals in this case then held that the \nATCA\u2019s factual predicates had not been met. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009\n\n8 \n \n10a-11a. In response, Congress again amended the ATA \nby enacting the PSJVTA. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. \nIX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 308, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e). \nThe PSJVTA has two operative prongs: \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(A) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 120 days after the \nlaw\u2019s enactment, the defendant makes any payment \nto a designee of an individual imprisoned for, or \nkilled while, committing a terror attack that killed \nor injured a national of the United States, if the pay-\nment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d such death or impris-\nonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d prong. \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(B) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 15 days after en-\nactment, the defendant \u201cconducts any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization or the Pales-\ntinian Authority.\u201d Subparagraph (1)(B) is subject to \nsix exceptions, including maintaining an office or \nconducting an activity \u201cexclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Na-\ntions.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(A), (B). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cU.S.-activities\u201d prong. \nB. Factual and Procedural Background \n1. These cases arose out of a series of terror attacks \nin Israel that killed and injured dozens of U.S. nationals. \nAlan Bauer and his seven-year-old son were walking down \na crowded street when a suicide bomber directed by a \nlieutenant in the PA intelligence service blew himself up, \nsending shrapnel through the boy\u2019s brain. The damage \nwas permanent. A bomb tore through Scott Goldberg\u2019s \n\n9 \n \nbody on a city bus while he was on his way to work; he left \na widow and seven children. The suicide bomber was a PA \npolice officer\u2014recruited and directed by a team of other \nPA officers. The PA gave him a hero\u2019s funeral. Four plain-\ntiffs were killed by a massive bomb detonated in a univer-\nsity cafeteria at lunchtime. Their parents learned about \nthe attack while at home in the United States\u2014some by \nrecognizing the bodies or personal effects of their children \non the television news. See Sokolow\u2009C.A.\u2009App.\u20094072-4076, \n4084-4086, 4948-4994, 5288, 5543-5574, 6450, 6454, 6487-\n6489, 6697, 6700, 6852, 7014-7015. \nA terrorist stabbed Ari Fuld, an American citizen and \nfather of four, just hours after Mahmoud Abbas, the \nChairman of the PLO and President of the PA, falsely \nclaimed that the Israeli Government was planning to es-\ntablish Jewish prayer zones inside the al-Aqsa Mosque, \none of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. J.A.\u2009420. \n2. The plaintiff families sued under the ATA in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nIn Sokolow, after a seven-week trial with testimony \nfrom 50 witnesses, the jury found that the PLO and PA, \nacting through their employees, perpetrated the six at-\ntacks at issue and that the PLO and PA knowingly pro-\nvided material support to organizations designated by the \nState Department as foreign terrorist organizations. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009141a. The jury awarded plaintiffs $218.5 million \nin damages, which was automatically trebled under the \nATA to $655.5 million. Ibid. \nOn appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the judgment \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. Ibid. The court rejected \nplaintiffs\u2019 argument that governmental entities like the \nPLO and PA were not \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process \nClause, holding that the PLO and PA enjoy due process \nrights precisely because \u201cneither the PLO nor the PA is \nrecognized by the United States as a sovereign state.\u201d Id. \nat 153a. It also held that the test for personal jurisdiction \n\n10 \n \nis \u201cthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Id. at 156a. Applying Fourteenth Amendment \nstandards, the court of appeals held that U.S. courts could \nnot exercise general jurisdiction because the PLO and PA \nwere \u201cat home\u201d in \u201cPalestine,\u201d id. at 160a, and could not \nexercise specific jurisdiction because the conduct giving \nrise to liability \u201coccurred entirely outside the territorial \njurisdiction of the United States,\u201d id. at 167a. This Court \ndenied review. 138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018). \nBipartisan sponsors introduced the ATCA in Con-\ngress a few weeks later. 164 Cong. Rec. S2926 (May 24, \n2018). They explained that \u201crecent Federal court deci-\nsions\u201d had \u201cseverely undermined the ability of American \nvictims to bring terrorists to justice.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. \nS5103-01 (July 19, 2018) (Sen. Grassley); see 164 Cong. \nRec. H6617-18 (July 23, 2018) (Rep. Nadler). The House \nJudiciary Committee explained that the bill\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d \nwas \u201cto better ensure that victims of international terror-\nism can obtain justice in United States courts.\u201d H.R. Rep. \nNo. 115-858, at 2 (2018). President Trump signed the bill \ninto law. Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7\u20094, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs then moved to recall the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s mandate in light of the ATCA. The court de-\nnied the motion, finding that the ATCA\u2019s factual predi-\ncates had not been satisfied. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009133a. The Sokolow \nplaintiffs again sought this Court\u2019s review. While their pe-\ntition was pending, Congress enacted the PSJVTA. This \nCourt granted the petition, vacated the judgment below, \nand remanded in light of the new statute. 140 S. Ct. 2714 \n(2020). The Second Circuit in turn remanded to the dis-\ntrict court. \n3. On remand in Sokolow, and on a Rule 12(b)(2) mo-\ntion in Fuld, the PLO and PA challenged the PSJVTA on \nthe ground that it facially violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause. The United States intervened in \nboth cases. \n\n11 \n \na. In Sokolow, the district court determined that the \nPLO and PA engaged in conduct meeting the pay-for-slay \nprong, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A), finding that they \u201cmade \npayments after April 18, 2020 to the families of individuals \nkilled while committing acts of terrorism, that the pay-\nments were made because the individuals engaged in ter-\nrorism, and that the terrorism harmed U.S. nationals.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200985a. Ample evidence supported the findings: \nConsistent with their long history of supporting and glo-\nrifying terrorism, the PLO and PA have an official policy \nof rewarding terrorists (or their next of kin) for attacking \nJews. J.A.\u2009156-157. These payments \u201care not social wel-\nfare or charity to the needy.\u201d Ibid. They are provided to \n\u201crich and poor alike,\u201d without regard to financial condi-\ntion. Ibid. They are unavailable to those who commit \u201cor-\ndinary\u201d crimes. Id. at 159. The PLO and PA made pay-\nments for at least 175 Palestinian individuals killed while \nor imprisoned for committing terror attacks that killed or \ninjured Americans. J.A.\u200969-135; Sokolow D. Ct. Doc. 1015-\n1. The payees included perpetrators of the attacks at issue \nin Sokolow. See Sokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc. 1015, at 11. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs asked the district court to \nmake factual findings that the PLO and PA engaged in \nconduct meeting the U.S.-activities prong, by engaging in \n\u201cactivit[ies] while physically present in the United States\u201d \nthat did not fall within any statutory exemption, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B)(iii). Plaintiffs offered evidence that, after \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s trigger date, PLO and PA officials dissem-\ninated public-relations material in the United States urg-\ning supporters to lobby the U.S. Government and public \nin support of their political agenda; gave speeches at U.S. \nuniversities and local venues; and authorized PA-depu-\ntized notaries in the United States to certify documents \nfor use in territories administered by the PA. See J.A.\u2009\n149-152, 275, 282-285, 616-913. The district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \n\n12 \n \nin these types of activities,\u201d but declined to determine \nwhether they fell within any statutory exemption. Pet.\u2009\nApp.\u200973a-75a. \nThe Fuld district court assumed without deciding \nthat both prongs had been satisfied. Id. at 101a-102a & \nn.3. \nb. Both district courts held the law facially unconsti-\ntutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. Id. at 74a-77a, 87a-92a, 108a-125a. In their \nview, this Court\u2019s decision in Daimler had rendered \u201cob-\nsolete\u201d consent-to-jurisdiction cases decided under pre-\nInternational Shoe precedents. Id. at 76a, 112a n.6. \n4. The Second Circuit heard the cases in tandem and \naffirmed. Id. at 1a-70a. \na. Like the district courts, the court of appeals ac-\ncepted that the PLO and PA had engaged in consent-man-\nifesting conduct by paying terrorists who had murdered \nAmericans, and it assumed that they had conducted non-\nexempt activities within the United States. Id. at 38a, 68a \nn.7. The Second Circuit also did not dispute that the \nPSJVTA meets \u201cminimum due process requirements,\u201d by \nproviding fair warning to the defendants and by reasona-\nbly advancing legitimate governmental interests. Id. at \n29a-30a. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless held the PSJVTA \nunconstitutional on its face. In the court\u2019s view, under the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to jurisdiction must be based on a \u201creciprocal bar-\ngain\u201d with the government or else must derive from \u201cliti-\ngation-related conduct.\u201d Id. at 24a-26a. The court also \nheld that the PLO and PA\u2019s permission to be present in \nthe United States and to engage in activities here does not \ncount as a constitutionally cognizable \u201cbenefit\u201d because \ntheir consent-manifesting conduct was \u201cprohibited\u201d by \nlaw. Id. at 28a. \n\n13 \n \nb. Plaintiffs and the United States sought rehearing \nen banc. The Second Circuit denied the petitions. Id. at \n208a. Judge Menashi dissented, joined in full or part by \nChief Judge Livingston and Judges Sullivan and Park. Id. \nat\u2009229a-267a. In Judge Menashi\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he panel\u2019s de-\ncision lacks a basis in the Constitution and cannot be rec-\nonciled with Supreme Court precedent on personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d Id. at 230a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The PSJVTA satisfies Fifth Amendment stand-\nards. \nA. As the Fifth Amendment was understood when \nratified, the guarantee of \u201cdue process of law\u201d did not pro-\nhibit the adjudication of conduct arising outside U.S. ter-\nritory. Cases arising outside the United States were com-\nmon in the Revolutionary Era, and Article III was framed \nby lawyers and judges who had been deeply involved in \nmany such cases. The Constitution expressly permits the \nadjudication of extraterritorial cases, and the Framers \nexplained that congruence between the reach of the legis-\nlative and judicial powers was intentional. The First Con-\ngress authorized extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Judi-\nciary Act of 1789 and the Crimes Act of 1790. \nWhen the Due Process Clause was ratified, no one un-\nderstood it to disturb prior practice. Although scholars \nhave adopted different views about its original meaning, \nno evidence suggests that anyone in 1791 thought the \nClause would limit adjudication of extraterritorial con-\nduct.  \nB.  The PSJVTA also satisfies Fifth Amendment due \nprocess standards under this Court\u2019s precedents. In the \nyears following ratification, the Court repeatedly con-\nfirmed that the judicial power of the United States ex-\ntends to cases involving conduct occurring outside the Na-\ntion\u2019s borders. Jurisdictional limits did exist, but they \n\n14 \n \nwere supplied by the law of nations, which Congress could \noverride by a clear command. \nOver time, this Court came to impose territorial limits \non the States under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. But even as it did so, the Court con-\ntinued to approve adjudication of federal cases arising ex-\ntraterritorially. Because the PSJVTA reflects express \ncongressional authorization to adjudicate disputes under \nU.S. law based on extraterritorial conduct, and because it \nis not arbitrary or fundamentally unfair, it does not run \nafoul of this Court\u2019s precedents applying the Fifth \nAmendment. \nC.  The Second Circuit held that personal jurisdiction \nin civil cases under the Fifth Amendment is governed by \nrules developed under the Fourteenth Amendment. But \nthose rules serve interstate federalism, preventing a \nState from infringing other States\u2019 sovereignty by adjudi-\ncating disputes with little connection to the forum. Such \nconcerns do not apply to the Federal Government. \nThe Second Circuit also erred by imposing a stricter \nstandard for civil cases than for criminal ones. Federal \ncases\u2014whether civil or criminal\u2014should be governed by \na single Fifth Amendment standard. It makes no sense to \nallow federal courts to impose criminal penalties (impris-\nonment or death) but not civil penalties (money damages) \nfor the same extraterritorial conduct. \nII.  Even if Fourteenth Amendment standards ap-\nplied, the PSJVTA would satisfy them. \nA.  In Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023), this Court upheld Pennsylvania\u2019s con-\nsent-to-jurisdiction statute against a Fourteenth Amend-\nment challenge. The Second Circuit attempted to distin-\nguish Mallory on the theory that the defendant there re-\nceived a \u201creciprocal bargain\u201d from Pennsylvania, but the \ndecision did not rest on that ground. Rather, the Court \n\n15 \n \nexplained that accepting an in-state benefit with jurisdic-\ntional strings attached was merely one means of construc-\ntively consenting to personal jurisdiction; another is by \nengaging in conduct specified by law as constituting sub-\nmission to jurisdiction, as happened here. This case fol-\nlows a fortiori from Mallory, because the Federal Gov-\nernment has a vital interest in the adjudication of anti-ter-\nrorism cases involving American victims. In contrast, as \nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court observed, the statute in \nMallory advanced no legitimate state interest. \nB.  The PLO and PA\u2019s consent was knowing and vol-\nuntary, because they had fair warning of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction, which they engaged in \nvolitionally. The PSJVTA also meets the traditional due \nprocess standard of reasonableness within the context of \nour federal system. \nC.  Even if the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d \ntest were valid, it would be satisfied here. The PLO and \nPA have received a \u201cbenefit\u201d from the United States by \nexercising \u201cthe privilege of residing and conducting busi-\nness in the United States\u2014not to mention furthering \ntheir political goals at the expense of American lives.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a (Menashi, J., dissenting). Their U.S. activ-\nities include notarizing documents for official use in their \nhome territories, posting on U.S.-based social media plat-\nforms to raise public awareness and bring attention to \ntheir cause, and meeting with local groups to encourage \nthem to lobby Congress to support that cause. \nThe Second Circuit denied the relevance of those U.S. \nactivities on the ground that they were all unlawful. That \nassertion is legally incorrect: The PLO and PA are not le-\ngally barred from conducting any activities in the United \nStates. The court\u2019s reasoning is also illogical: Someone \nwho conducts illegal activities in the forum obviously ex-\ntracts a benefit from the forum. A contrary rule would \n\n16 \n \nperversely give law-breakers due process protections un-\navailable to law-abiding persons. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE PSJVTA SATISFIES FIFTH AMENDMENT STANDARDS \nAt the Founding, the federal Judiciary\u2019s power to ad-\njudicate disputes was understood to be coextensive with \nCongress\u2019s power to legislate\u2014which included matters \narising abroad. Indeed, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause was not seen as a constraint on congressional \npower over personal jurisdiction at all: \u201cIf Congress \nwanted to exercise exorbitant [personal] jurisdiction \u2026 a \nfederal court \u2018would certainly be bound to follow it, and \nproceed upon the law.\u2019\u201d Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited \nJurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, \n1706 (2020) (quoting Picquet, 19 F. Cas. at 615) (Sachs). \nThe decision below, by subjecting Congress to the \nsame jurisdictional limitations that apply to the States, \nimproperly \u201ctakes the Fourteenth Amendment as given, \nand remakes the Fifth Amendment in its image.\u201d Id. at \n1705. Such \u201creverse incorporation\u201d of Fourteenth Amend-\nment standards into the Fifth Amendment is contrary to \nthis Court\u2019s precedents. Although the Court has long re-\nstricted the States\u2019 jurisdiction over disputes arising out-\nside their boundaries, it has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial cases to go forward in the federal courts, ex-\nplaining that such cases lie within Congress\u2019s power to au-\nthorize. Accepting the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning would \nresult in an upside-down regime in which unrecognized \nforeign governments enjoy due process protection una-\nvailable to States of the Union, and defendants in civil \ncases enjoy greater due process protections than defend-\nants in criminal cases arising out of the exact same con-\nduct. \n\n17 \n \nA. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Original Public Meaning \nImposed No Limit On Personal Jurisdiction \nThe Constitution expressly authorizes adjudication of \ncases arising from extraterritorial conduct. This power \nwas an intentional feature of the constitutional plan, re-\nflecting common practice during the Revolutionary Era, \nincluding in cases tried and adjudicated by the Framers \nthemselves. Ratification of the Due Process Clause did \nnot alter that feature. To the contrary, the most authori-\ntative interpreters of the Bill of Rights\u2014the First Con-\ngress and this Court\u2014continued the pre-constitutional \npractice of permitting adjudication of claims against for-\neign defendants arising from conduct abroad. \n1. Before The Fifth Amendment, Extraterritorial \nCases Were Permitted \nThe Constitution\u2019s text expressly vests Congress and \nthe Judiciary with extraterritorial powers. Most obvi-\nously, Congress may \u201cdefine and punish Piracies and Fel-\nonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against \nthe Law of Nations\u201d and \u201cmake Rules concerning Cap-\ntures on Land and Water.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u20098, Cls. 10, \n11. And what Congress can legislate, the Judiciary can ad-\njudicate: \u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in \nLaw and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the \nLaws of the United States, and Treaties made \u2026 under \ntheir Authority.\u201d Id. Art. III, \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 1 (emphasis added). \nThe Constitution empowers the Judiciary to adjudicate \ncases arising extraterritorially in other respects, too, in-\ncluding \u201call Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,\u201d \nibid., and \u201call Crimes \u2026 not committed within any State,\u201d \nid. \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 3. \nJudicial power commensurate with extraterritorial \nlegislative power was a deliberate feature of the constitu-\ntional plan. At the Philadelphia Convention, leading dele-\ngates explained that judicial power should be coextensive \n\n18 \n \nwith legislative power. For example, James Madison ex-\nplained that \u201c[a]n effective Judiciary establishment com-\nmensurate to the legislative authority, was essential.\u201d 1 \nRecords of the Federal Convention 124 (Max Farrand ed., \n1911) (Farrand). James Wilson agreed: \u201cthe Judicial \nshould be commensurate to the legislative and Executive \nAuthority.\u201d Id. at 237 n.18. In The Federalist, Hamilton \nobserved that \u201c[i]f there are such things as political axi-\noms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government \nbeing co-extensive with its legislative, may be ranked \namong the number.\u201d The Federalist No. 80, at 588 (Ham-\nilton ed. 1864). Madison, Wilson, and other Founders also \nexpressed this view at the ratifying conventions. In Penn-\nsylvania, for instance, Wilson explained that without such \nparity, the Federal Government would be \u201cgive[n] power \nto make laws, and no power to carry them into effect.\u201d 2 \nDebates on the Federal Constitution 469 (Jonathan Elliot, \n2d ed. 1836) (Elliott); see 3 Elliot at 532 (Madison); id. at \n517 (Pendelton in Virginia); 4 Elliot at 156-158 (Davie in \nNorth Carolina). \nPermitting adjudication of cases arising from extra-\nterritorial conduct had a strong antecedent in practice. \nCourts in the newly independent United States adjudi-\ncated thousands of \u201cprize\u201d and \u201ccapture\u201d cases. See \nHenry J. Bourguignon, The First Federal Court: The \nFederal Appellate Prize Court of the American Revolu-\ntion 1775-1787, at 75-77 (1977) (Bourguignon). Such cases \ngenerally arose from extraterritorial events. E.g., \nDarby v. Brig Erstern, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 34, 35 (Fed. Ct. \nApp. 1782); Miller v. The Resolution, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 19, \n20-21 (Fed. Ct. App. 1781). Leading delegates arrived at \nthe Philadelphia Convention with extensive experience as \nlawyers and judges in those very cases. See Deirdre Mask \n& Paul MacMahon, The Revolutionary War Prize Cases \nand the Origins of Diversity Jurisdiction, 63 Buff. L. \nRev. 477 (2015); Bourguignon at 328-329; see also Letter \n\n19 \n \nfrom E. Randolph to J. Madison (Apr. 19, 1782), \nbit.ly/40i7aUC; Letter from J. Madison to E. Randolph \n(May 1, 1782), bit.ly/3DWIY2F. \nAfter ratification, the First Congress exercised its au-\nthority to prescribe extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Ju-\ndiciary Act of 1789 granted the federal courts jurisdiction \nover \u201ccivil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d \narising \u201cupon the high seas,\u201d and over crimes committed \n\u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 20, \u00a7\u20099, 1 Stat. 76-77. The Crimes \nAct of 1790 similarly authorized prosecution of crimes \ncommitted \u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 9, \u00a7\u00a7\u20098-13, 1 Stat. \n113-115. This Court has \u201coften looked to laws enacted by \n[the First] Congress as evidence of the original under-\nstanding of the meaning of [the Bill of Rights].\u201d Collins v. \nVirginia, 584 U.S. 586, 613 n.3 (2018) (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(collecting cases). \nLeading Framers confirmed that extraterritorial ju-\nrisdiction was intended. During deliberations on the Judi-\nciary Act, Madison\u2014who earlier that summer had drafted \nand introduced the Bill of Rights\u2014reiterated his view \nthat the judicial power \u201cought to be commensurate with \nthe other branches of the Government.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. \n843 (Aug. 29, 1789). And the following year, Edmund Ran-\ndolph prepared a report in which he concluded that the \nfederal courts had the exclusive power \u201cto decide all \ncauses arising wholly on the sea, and not within the pre-\ncincts of any county.\u201d Edmund Randolph, Report from the \nAttorney General on the Judiciary System of the United \nStates (Dec. 31, 1790), reprinted in 1 American State Pa-\npers, Miscellaneous 22 (1834).2 \n \n2 Before serving as the first Attorney General, Randolph was a \nmember of the Committee on Detail at the Philadelphia Convention, \nand the \u201cfirst draft\u201d of the Constitution is in his handwriting. See \nWilliam Ewald, The Committee of Detail, 28 Const. Commentary \n197, 220 (2012). \n\n20 \n \n2. The Fifth Amendment Did Not Change The \nJurisdictional Baseline \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s text and history provide no \nindication that it was understood to change the pre-ratifi-\ncation baseline. Indeed, scholarship confirms that no one \nin 1791 understood the Due Process Clause to restrict the \njudicial power of the United States at all, much less to \nlimit federal jurisdiction to the adjudication of cases aris-\ning within the Nation\u2019s borders. Rather, three principal \nschools of thought have emerged about the meaning of the \nwords \u201cdue process of law\u201d\u2014and none of them involves \npersonal jurisdiction. \nOne view of the phrase\u2019s original public meaning was \nthat a deprivation of rights had to be judicial, that is, \n\u201cpreceded by certain procedural protections characteris-\ntic of judicial process.\u201d Nathan S. Chapman & Michael W. \nMcConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 \nYale L.J. 1672, 1679 (2012) (Chapman & McConnell); see \nUnited States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U.S. 159, 168 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., concurring); United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1, 36 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). This view \ndraws support from early state practice, most promi-\nnently New York\u2019s 1787 statutory bill of rights and an oft-\ncited speech by Alexander Hamilton, both of which refer-\nence \u201cdue process of law.\u201d See Ryan C. Williams, The One \nand Only Substantive Due Process Clause, 120 Yale L.J. \n408, 441-443 (2010) (Williams); see also id. at 437-445; \nChapman & McConnell at 1703-1717. Consistent with this \nview, this Court in Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & \nImprovement Co., 59 U.S. (18. How.) 272 (1856), held that \nCongress may not deprive a person of property except un-\nder \u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding,\u201d which give \nthe defendant the benefit of a judge (\u201cjudex\u201d), as well as \n\u201cregular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial ac-\ncording to some settled course of judicial proceedings.\u201d \nId. at 277, 280. \n\n21 \n \nAn alternative originalist view emphasizes a nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess,\u201d as \u201cwrits or precepts \nduly issued (usually by a court) or arising by operation of \nlaw.\u201d Max Crema & Lawrence B. Solum, The Original \nMeaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amend-\nment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, 462 (2022). Proponents of this \nview note that, in Founding-era legal documents, the nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess\u201d was much more com-\nmonly used than the broader (though still procedural) \n\u201ccourse of proceedings\u201d sense, which was more often ex-\npressed as \u201cdue course of law.\u201d Id. at 488-508. They also \nsuggest that the records of the ratifying convention of \nNew York\u2014the only State to include the  phrase \u201cdue pro-\ncess\u201d in its proposed amendments\u2014show an evolution of \nthe proposal from \u201cLaw of the Land\u201d to \u201cDue Course of \nLaw\u201d and then to \u201cDue Process of Law.\u201d Id. at 508 & n.257 \n(citation omitted). \nThis Court\u2019s traditional view of the Due Process \nClause has been that it embodies a \u201csubstantive\u201d aspect \n\u201cintended to secure the individual from the arbitrary ex-\nercise of the powers of government.\u201d Albright v. Oliver, \n510 U.S. 266, 272 (1994) (plurality opinion) (quotation \nmarks omitted). This Court has scrutinized federal stat-\nutes under that standard to ensure that they are \u201csup-\nported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by ra-\ntional means.\u201d United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 30-\n31 (1994); see Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, \n465 (1991). Under this view, \u201c[t]he party asserting a Fifth \nAmendment due process violation must overcome a pre-\nsumption of constitutionality and establish that the legis-\nlature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\u201d Nat\u2019l \nR.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. \nCo., 470 U.S. 451, 472 (1985) (quotation marks omitted). \nScholars debate whether this view took root in American \nlaw before or after ratification of the Fifth Amendment. \nCompare Crema & Solum at 513-518; Williams at 428-454; \n\n22 \n \nChapman & McConnell at 1676 n.5; with Chapman & \nMcConnell at 1676-1677 n.6. \n3. The PSJVTA Does Not Deprive The PLO And \nPA Of Any Due Process Right Recognized At \nThe Founding \nMeasuring the PSJVTA\u2019s constitutionality against \nthe original public meaning of the Fifth Amendment, this \nis an easy case regardless of which view one accepts. \nNothing in the statute interferes with the PLO and PA\u2019s \nability to defend themselves before a court of law applying \n\u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding.\u201d Denezpi v. \nUnited States, 596 U.S. 591, 617 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., dis-\nsenting) (quoting Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. (18 How.) at \n277). The statute does not deprive them of the benefit of \nan independent judge, or of \u201cregular allegations, oppor-\ntunity to answer, and a trial according to some settled \ncourse of judicial proceedings.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. \n(18 How.) at 280. And in both Fuld and Sokolow, the PLO \nand PA were served with a writ (i.e., a summons) in the \nUnited States, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(a). See \nSokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20092; Fuld\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20098, 9. \nThis Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents re-\nquire no more. Nothing about the PSJVTA is \u201carbitrary \nand irrational.\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger, 470 U.S. at 472 \n(quotation marks omitted). It reasonably advances vital \ninterests of the United States. It disrupts and deters sup-\nport for terrorism, which is \u201can urgent objective of the \nhighest order.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian L. Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 28 (2010). It advances the protection of U.S. citi-\nzens abroad. See Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, \n687 (2019) (\u201cspecial protection [abroad] for U.S. nationals \nserves key national interests\u201d). It promotes the Federal \nGovernment\u2019s interest in ensuring \u201cfair compensation for \nAmerican victims of terrorism from those responsible for \ntheir losses.\u201d J.A.\u200968. And it furthers U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives, because the PLO and PA\u2019s pay-for-slay \n\n23 \n \npolicies \u201cthreaten prospects for peace, pushing the chance \nfor a Palestinian state further and further out of reach.\u201d \n163 Cong. Rec. H9650 (daily ed. Dec. 5, 2017) (Rep. En-\ngel). \nB. This Court Has Never Blocked Congress From \nAuthorizing Personal Jurisdiction Over Conduct \nArising Abroad \nIn the years immediately following ratification of the \nFifth Amendment, this Court confirmed that the judicial \npower of the United States extends to cases involving con-\nduct occurring outside the Nation\u2019s borders. Later, even \nas this Court imposed territorial limits on the States un-\nder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment, it repeatedly rejected the imposition of such limita-\ntions on the Federal Government. \n1. Before The Lochner Era, This Court Never \nStruck Down Any Jurisdictional Statute On \nDue Process Grounds \n\u201cFor the first 150 years of the Republic, today\u2019s con-\nventional view of personal jurisdiction wasn\u2019t so conven-\ntional\u2026. Jurisdictional limits have always been with us, \nbut Fifth Amendment limits are a recent innovation.\u201d \nSachs at 1706, 1708. \nOriginally, extraterritorial jurisdiction was governed \nby the law of nations, which included rules for determin-\ning the circumstances under which \u201cone state\u2019s judgments \n[should] be received or rejected in another\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. \nat 1718. In some cases, the law of nations permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction. In Penhallow v. Doane\u2019s Admin-\nistrators, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 54 (1795), this Court enforced \nresolutions adopted by the Continental Congress provid-\ning for trials and appeals in cases of the capture of enemy \nships on the high seas. Id. at 80-81 (opinion of Patterson, \nJ.). The power to provide for adjudication in such cases, \nthe Court explained, was an incident of the Nation\u2019s \n\n24 \n \ninherent \u201cexternal sovereignty.\u201d Id. at 91 (opinion of Ire-\ndell, J.). And in Talbot v. Janson, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 133 \n(1795), the Court unanimously affirmed the exercise of ju-\nrisdiction over a civil claim for damages arising out of an \nincident on the high seas. As Justice Iredell explained, \n\u201ctrespasses committed against the general law of nations, \nare enquirable, and may be proceeded against, in any na-\ntion where no special exemption can be maintained, either \nby the general law of nations, or by some treaty which for-\nbids or restrains it.\u201d Id. at 159-160.3 Thus, the availability \nof extraterritorial jurisdiction ordinarily followed back-\nground legal principles established under the law of na-\ntions. \nHowever, Congress could override the law of nations \nby a clear command. See Murray v. Schooner Charming \nBetsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804). Thus Justice \nWashington explained that federal courts had no \u201cgen-\neral\u201d authority \u201cto issue process into another district, ex-\ncept in cases where such authority has been specially be-\nstowed, by some law of the United States.\u201d Ex parte Gra-\nham, 10 F. Cas. at 912 (emphasis added). If it was \u201cthe will \nof congress to vest in the courts of the United States an \nextra-territorial jurisdiction in prize causes, over persons \nand things found in a district other than that from which \nthe process issued,\u201d then the courts would be bound to fol-\nlow Congress\u2019s instruction. Id. at 913; see ibid. (\u201cthe ex-\nercise of jurisdiction over persons not inhabitants of, or \nfound within the district where the suit is brought\u201d pre-\nsents \u201cdifficulties, which, in the opinion of the court, noth-\ning but an act of congress can remove\u201d). \n \n3 Of the seven members of the Court who participated in one or \nboth of these cases, four (Rutledge, Wilson, Blair, and Patterson) \nserved as delegates at the Philadelphia Convention. 1 Farrand 1-2. \nThe other three served in their respective States\u2019 ratifying conven-\ntions. 2 Elliott 178 (Cushing); id.at 206 (Jay); 4 Elliott 1 (Iredell). \n\n25 \n \nUnder federal legislation, exercising jurisdiction in \ncases arising outside of U.S. territory became established \npractice. \u201cThe prosecution and punishment of extraterri-\ntorial crimes, including crimes committed by aliens, was \none of the federal government\u2019s top priorities\u201d in the dec-\nades following ratification, and \u201cthe federal government \nprincipally used two enforcement mechanisms\u2014punish-\nment after criminal trial, and civil forfeiture after a con-\ndemnation by a federal court sitting in admiralty.\u201d Na-\nthan S. Chapman, Due Process Abroad, 112 Nw. U. L. \nRev. 377, 409 (2017) (Chapman). \u201cAmericans appeared to \nbelieve that both enforcement mechanisms were con-\nsistent with due process of law.\u201d Id. at 410. Treatises of \nthe era similarly confirm that the federal courts could \nproperly exercise jurisdiction over extraterritorial con-\nduct. See, e.g., 1 James Kent, Commentaries on Ameri-\ncan Law 186 (6th ed. 1826) (\u201cIt is of no importance, for the \npurpose of giving jurisdiction, on whom or where a pirat-\nical offence has been committed.\u201d). \nPerhaps the clearest articulation of Congress\u2019s power \nto create jurisdiction over foreign conduct\u2014even in the \nface of general principles of the law of nations to the con-\ntrary\u2014is Picquet v. Swan. There, Justice Story explained \nthat Congress could enact a law providing that \u201ca subject \nof England, or France, or Russia, having a controversy \nwith one of our own citizens, may be summoned from the \nother end of the globe to obey our process, and submit to \nthe judgment of our courts.\u201d 19 F.\u2009Cas. at 613. And though \nsuch a law might be \u201crepugnant to the general rights and \nsovereignty of other nations,\u201d yet \u201c[i]f congress had pre-\nscribed such a rule, the court would certainly be bound to \nfollow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at 613, 615.  \nThis Court endorsed Picquet\u2019s reasoning in Toland v. \nSprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300 (1838), explaining that \u201cpos-\nitive legislation\u201d would be necessary to authorize federal \ncourts to hear cases involving \u201cpersons in a foreign \n\n26 \n \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 330. And in The Marianna Flora, 24 \nU.S. (11 Wheat.) 1 (1826) (Story, J.), the Court held that \neven though, as a general matter, \u201cforeign ships are not \nto be governed by our municipal regulations,\u201d still Con-\ngress could direct that a ship captured on the high seas be \nbrought to the United States for adjudication \u201cin our \nCourts.\u201d Id. at 18. \u201c[W]hatever may be the responsibility \nincurred by the nation to foreign powers, in executing \nsuch laws,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthere can be no doubt \nthat Courts of justice are bound to obey and administer \nthem.\u201d Ibid.; see ibid. (\u201c[T]he act of Congress is decisive \non this subject.\u201d).4 \nCongress also had the power to override the law of \nnations with respect to a State\u2019s recognition of \u201cforeign\u201d \n(i.e., out-of-state) judgments. In D\u2019Arcy v. Ketchum, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) 165 (1851), this Court noted Congress\u2019s \nauthority to \u201calter[] the rule\u201d regarding when the judg-\nments of one State\u2019s courts must be recognized by those \nof another. Id. at 174-175. There, a 1790 law required the \nStates to afford \u201cfaith and credit\u201d to the judicial proceed-\nings of other States. Ibid.; see Act of May 26, 1790, ch. 11, \n1 Stat. 122, codified as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091738 (2012). \nThe question was whether that law required recognition \nof a judgment even \u201cwhen the defendant had not been \nserved with process or voluntarily made defence,\u201d despite \nthe fact that such a proceeding would violate \u201cthe interna-\ntional law as it existed among the States in 1790.\u201d D\u2019Arcy, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) at 176. The Court ultimately concluded \n \n4 See also United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610, 631 \n(1818) (\u201cThe constitution having conferred on congress the power of \ndefining and punishing piracy, there can be no doubt of the right of \nthe legislature to enact laws punishing pirates, although they may \nbe foreigners, and may have committed no particular offence \nagainst the United States.\u201d); United States v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 \nWheat.) 153, 158-160 (1820) (broadly construing the constitutional \ngrant to Congress). \n\n27 \n \nthat \u201cCongress did not intend to overthrow the old rule by \nthe enactment,\u201d but the Court did not question\u2014indeed, \nit presumed\u2014that Congress had authority \u201cto declare a \nnew rule.\u201d Ibid. \nIn sum, the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwas understood to be proper if it comported with the law \nof nations or if Congress so provided. No case went the \nother way: \u201c[N]ot until the Civil War did a single court, \nstate or federal, hold a personal-jurisdiction statute inva-\nlid on due process grounds.\u201d Sachs at 1712; accord Chap-\nman at 442. \n2. After This Court Began Restricting State Power \nUnder The Fourteenth Amendment, It Rejected \nAnalogous Restrictions Under The Fifth \nTerritorial restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction emerged during the Lochner era, when this \nCourt began invoking due process to restrict state author-\nity to adjudicate cases involving conduct occurring in \nother States. See, e.g., Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 \nU.S. 394, 403 (1917); Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills \nv. Menefee, 237 U.S. 189, 194-195 (1915); see generally \nStephen E. Sachs, Pennoyer Was Right, 95 Tex. L. Rev. \n1249, 1252 (2017); Patrick J. Borchers, The Death of the \nConstitutional Law of Personal Jurisdiction: From Pen-\nnoyer to Burnham and Back Again, 24 U.C. Davis L. Rev. \n19, 43-51 (1990). These decisions were grounded in con-\ncerns about the division of power among the States, and \nin particular the impermissibility of \u201cattempt[ing] to ex-\ntend the authority and control of a state beyond its own \nterritory.\u201d Baker, 242 U.S. at 403. \nDuring the same era, however, this Court repeatedly \nreaffirmed that the Fifth Amendment affords \u201cno ground \nfor constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurposes of shutting [the federal] government off from \n\n28 \n \nthe exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by \nvirtue of its sovereignty.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. 299, 306 (1914) (emphasis added); see Burnet v. \nBrooks, 288 U.S. 378, 403-405 (1933) (same); Cook v. Tait, \n265 U.S. 47, 55-56 (1924) (same). \u201c[T]he limitations of the \nConstitution are barriers bordering the states and pre-\nventing them from transcending the limits of their author-\nity, and thus destroying the rights of other states,\u201d the \nCourt explained, but such interstate-federalism concerns \nhave no application to the national sovereign. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. at 306.5 \nFollowing its pathmarking decision in International \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), this Court \nhas continued to restrict state-court personal jurisdiction \nas \u201ca consequence of territorial limitations on the power \nof the respective States.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. \n235, 251 (1958). Yet the Court has been careful to make \nclear it was not holding that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment im-\nposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction by a federal court.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017). Moreover, \nthe Court has consistently expressed an expansive view \nabout the territorial competence of the national govern-\nment: \u201cIf Congress has provided an unmistakable instruc-\ntion that the provision is extraterritorial, then claims al-\nleging exclusively foreign conduct may proceed,\u201d Abitron \nAustria GmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 \n \n5 In admiralty cases, which raise no interstate-federalism con-\ncerns, the Court continued to apply the longstanding rule that \u201cthe \nbare circumstance of where the cause of action arose [has not] been \ntreated as determinative of the power of the court to exercise dis-\ncretion whether to take jurisdiction.\u201d Canada Malting Co. v. Pat-\nterson S.S., 285 U.S. 413, 422 (1932); Charter Shipping Co. v. \nBowring, Jones & Tidy, 281 U.S. 515, 517 (1930); Panama R.R. Co. \nv. Napier Shipping Co., 166 U.S. 280, 285 (1897); The Belgenland, \n114 U.S. 355, 358-359 (1885). \n\n29 \n \n(2023), a principle that remains true \u201cregardless of \nwhether the particular statute regulates conduct, affords \nrelief, or merely confers jurisdiction,\u201d RJR Nabisco, Inc. \nv. Eur. Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 326 (2016). \nIn sum, this Court has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction where Congress so provides and \nhas consistently declined to extend Fourteenth Amend-\nment limits to the Federal Government. The PSJVTA fits \ncomfortably within its precedents. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Reasoning Was Unsound \nThe Second Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018due process analy-\nsis\u2019 in the personal jurisdiction context \u2018is basically the \nsame under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments,\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quoting Pet.\u2009App.\u2009156a), and that \n\u201cthe [Fifth Amendment] due process test for asserting ju-\nrisdiction over extraterritorial criminal conduct \u2026 differs \nfrom the test applicable in this civil case,\u201d id. at 175a (em-\nphasis added; citation omitted). The court accordingly re-\nfused to apply to the PSJVTA \u201cthe broader [i.e., less-re-\nstrictive] Fifth Amendment standard used for personal \njurisdiction in criminal cases.\u201d Id. at 49a. \nThat reasoning was doubly unsound. Federal cases \nare not governed by the Fourteenth Amendment stand-\nard, which protects interstate federalism. Instead, federal \ncases\u2014not only criminal cases but also civil cases\u2014are \ngoverned by a single Fifth Amendment standard. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Conflation Of Fifth And \nFourteenth Amendment Standards Disregards \nInterstate Federalism \nPrinciples of interstate federalism limit a State\u2019s as-\nsertion of personal jurisdiction \u201cto ensure that States with \n\u2018little legitimate interest\u2019 in a suit do not encroach on \nStates more affected by the controversy.\u201d Ford Motor Co. \nv. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 360 (2021) \n(quoting Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263). Thus, in \n\n30 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, the Court explained that such \nrestrictions \u201censure that the States, through their courts, \ndo not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by \ntheir status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system\u201d and \nheld that \u201cthe Due Process Clause, acting as an instru-\nment of interstate federalism, may \u2026 divest the State of \nits power to render a valid judgment.\u201d 444 U.S. at 292, 294. \nThe Court has emphasized that allowing a State to assert \njurisdiction \u201cin an inappropriate case \u2026 would upset the \nfederal balance, which posits that each State has a sover-\neignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other \nStates.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. \n873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion). And the Court has re-\niterated that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of each State implies a \nlimitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States,\u201d and \ninsofar as personal jurisdiction is concerned, \u201cthis feder-\nalism interest may be decisive.\u201d Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. \nat 263 (cleaned up). \nThis case is different. It concerns federal claims re-\ngarding attacks on American nationals that must be adju-\ndicated in federal court under federal law. Congress cre-\nated these claims to further federal interests in national \nsecurity and foreign affairs. The Constitution allocates \npower over such matters exclusively to the national gov-\nernment. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 395 \n(2012). \u201cPower over external affairs is not shared by the \nStates,\u201d but instead \u201cis vested in the national government \nexclusively.\u201d United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 233 \n(1942); see Wendy Perdue, Aliens, the Internet, and \n\u201cPurposeful Availment,\u201d: A Reassessment of Fifth \nAmendment Limits On Personal Jurisdiction, 98 Nw. U. \nL. Rev. 455, 461 (2004) (\u201cStates are situated within the \nUnited States quite differently than is the United States \nwithin the international community.\u201d). \nWhereas federalism limitations on the individual \nStates inhere in the \u201cconstitutional plan,\u201d a \u201cforeign State \n\n31 \n \nlies outside the structure of the Union.\u201d Principality of \nMonaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 (1934). The Con-\nstitution limits each State\u2019s extraterritorial regulatory \npowers because they necessarily conflict with the regula-\ntory interests of other States. See Healy v. Beer Inst., \nInc., 491 U.S. 324, 336 (1989). In contrast, \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian Am. \nOil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991); see Gamble, 587 U.S. at \n687 (\u201c[M]urder of a U.S. national is an offense to the \nUnited States as much as it is to the country where the \nmurder occurred.\u201d). \nThe foreign-relations context here highlights the im-\nprudence of imposing interstate-federalism limitations on \nCongress. Congress\u2019s judgments in the foreign-relations \ncontext merit \u201cspecial respect\u201d because they involve \u201ca \nbalance that it is the prerogative of the political branches \nto make.\u201d Jesner v. Arab Bank PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 273 \n(2018). \u201cCongress has the undisputed power to decide, as \na matter of federal law, whether and under what circum-\nstances foreign nations should be amenable to suit in the \nUnited States,\u201d Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nige-\nria, 461 U.S. 480, 493 (1983), and the Court should be re-\nluctant to strip Congress of that power when it comes to \nnon-sovereign governments. The PLO and PA are foreign \npolitical entities that aspire to international statehood; as \nsuch, their amenability to suit in federal court should lie \nsolely in the hands of the political branches, not the Judi-\nciary. As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, \u201c[b]ecause the \nPLO purports to be an independent sovereign entity, we \nhave little difficulty concluding that it falls into [the] cate-\ngory\u201d of entities that \u201cexist outside the constitutional \ncompact and have no rights or responsibilities under it.\u201d \nConstitutionality of Closing the Palestine Information \nOffice, an Affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organiza-\ntion, 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 105 (1987). \n\n32 \n \nThe Second Circuit got this backwards, holding that \nthe PLO and PA have due process rights because they are \nnot \u201crecognized by the United States as a sovereign \nstate.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200994a, 153a. According to the court, allow-\ning the political branches to subject the PLO and PA to \nsuit would infringe their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d Id. at 30a \nn.11. Judge Menashi explained why this was wrong: \n[F]oreign states are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to rights \nunder the Due Process Clause. So if tomorrow the \nDepartment of State recognized the PA as the sover-\neign government of \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2014as the defendants \nbelieve it is\u2014then there would be no question at all \nthat the PSJVTA is constitutional and that the Due \nProcess Clause is not implicated. Fundamental con-\nstitutional rights are not typically so contingent. \nId. at 238a (citation omitted). \n2. The Second Circuit Incorrectly Applied A \nStricter Standard To Civil Cases Than To \nCriminal Cases \nThe Second Circuit acknowledged that the PSJVTA \nsatisfies \u201cbasic principles of due process.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200930a. \nIt also acknowledged that, in the context of criminal pros-\necutions against foreign defendants, the Fifth Amend-\nment permits the exercise of jurisdiction over a defendant \nwho harms American nationals or interests abroad. See \nUnited States v. Epskamp, 832 F.3d 154, 168 (2d Cir. \n2016).6 The court nevertheless held that, in the context of \na civil dispute, Congress must do more than merely sat-\nisfy these \u201cminimum due process requirements.\u201d \n \n6 Every Circuit to have considered the issue agrees. See United \nStates v. Murillo, 826 F.3d 152, 156-157 (4th Cir. 2016); United \nStates v. Rafoi, 60 F.4th 982, 995 (5th Cir. 2023); United States v. \nIossifov, 45 F.4th 899, 914 (6th Cir. 2022); United States v. Perlaza, \n439 F.3d 1149, 1162 (9th Cir. 2006). \n\n33 \n \nPet.\u2009App.\u200930a. The Second Circuit\u2019s position is thus that \nthe United States may imprison or impose the death pen-\nalty on a foreign person for extraterritorial conduct, but it \ncrosses a red line for the United States to allow a civil \nclaim for money damages against the same person for the \nsame conduct. \nThat makes no sense. As Judge Elrod put it in a case \nconcerning the same issue: \u201cIt is nonsense on stilts to hold \nthat allowing a civil lawsuit against a foreign defendant \nfor foreign conduct violates due process but that a crimi-\nnal prosecution against the same defendant for the same \nforeign conduct does not.\u201d Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Ka-\nbushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 270 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(dissenting). \nOutside the context of personal jurisdiction, this \nCourt has sometimes required a stricter due process \nstandard in criminal cases than in civil cases. See, e.g., \nTurner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 442 (2011); Addington v. \nTexas, 441 U.S. 418, 429-432 (1979). But it has never sug-\ngested that the inverse should be true: that a stricter \nstandard applies in civil cases than in criminal cases. It \nwould be incongruous to make it harder to deprive a de-\nfendant of property in a civil case than to deprive a de-\nfendant of liberty (or even life) in a criminal case arising \nout of the same facts. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment\u2014\nwhich contains only a single Due Process Clause, applica-\nble to civil and criminal cases alike\u2014supports such a rule. \nII. THE \nPSJVTA \nWOULD \nSATISFY \nFOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT STANDARDS \nEven if the Court were to import Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process standards for the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases into the Fifth Amendment, the \nPSJVTA easily satisfies those standards. That conclusion \nfollows a fortiori from Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Rail-\nway Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), which upheld a State\u2019s \n\n34 \n \nauthority to deem registration to do business in the state \nas signifying consent to be sued there. The United States \nmay likewise deem the PLO and PA\u2019s payments to terror-\nists who murdered or maimed U.S. nationals and U.S. ac-\ntivities as signifying their consent to suit in federal anti-\nterrorism cases involving U.S. victims. \nLike the statute in Mallory, the PSJVTA provided \nthe PLO and PA with advance notice of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction in United States courts. \nMoreover, the PSJVTA unquestionably serves legitimate \ngovernmental interests\u2014which the statute in Mallory did \nnot.  \nEven if this Court were to adopt the Second Circuit\u2019s \nnew rule that consent to suit must be part of a \u201creciprocal \nbargain\u201d in order to be valid, the PSJVTA would pass that \ntest too: The PLO and PA obtain valuable benefits from \nengaging in activities within the United States. \nA. This Is A Stronger Case For Jurisdiction Than \nMallory \nFor more than a century and a half\u2014and as recently \nas two Terms ago\u2014this Court has consistently held that \na State has the right to deem specified conduct as consti-\ntuting consent to personal jurisdiction, including by treat-\ning presence as consent to be sued there. The United \nStates, as the national sovereign, is at least equally enti-\ntled to treat specified conduct, including entry into its ter-\nritory, as consent to suit on federal claims in federal \ncourts. \n1. \u201cBoth at the time of the founding and the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption, the Anglo-American legal \ntradition recognized that a tribunal\u2019s competence was \ngenerally constrained only by the \u2018territorial limits\u2019 of the \nsovereign that created it.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128 (plu-\nrality opinion) (quoting Joseph Story, Commentaries on \nthe Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u2009539, pp. 450-451 (1834)). As a result, \n\n35 \n \n\u201can in personam suit \u2026 could be maintained by anyone on \nany claim in any place \u2026 \u2018wherever the [defendant] may \nbe found.\u2019\u201d Id. at 128-129 (quoting Massie v. Watts, 10 \nU.S. (6 Cranch) 148, 158 (1810)). Even a defendant\u2019s tran-\nsitory presence within the jurisdiction sufficed upon ser-\nvice of process there. See Burnham v. Superior Ct. of \nCal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990). \n\u201cAs the use of the corporate form proliferated in the \n19th century, the question arose how to adapt the tradi-\ntional rule about transitory actions for individuals to arti-\nficial persons created by law.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 129. \nIn many States, the answer was to treat an artificial en-\ntity\u2019s presence within the State as constructive consent to \nbe sued there. Id. at 129-130. While many of those statutes \nlimited such consent to suits \u201cby in-state plaintiffs,\u201d oth-\ners required foreign entities \u201cto defend themselves there \nagainst any manner of suit.\u201d Id. at 130. \nThis Court consistently upheld such statutes against \ndue process challenges. In St. Clair v. Cox, 106 U.S. 350 \n(1882), for instance, the Court upheld a Michigan statute \nthat implied consent to service of process\u2014and thus to \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014\u201cas a condition upon which a for-\neign corporation shall be permitted to do business within \nher limits.\u201d Id. at 356. So long as the state\u2019s jurisdictional \ninterest was \u201creasonable\u201d and the defendant had actual \n\u201cnotice of [the] suit,\u201d due process imposed no barrier. \nIbid. And in Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Is-\nsue Mining Co., 243 U.S. 93 (1917), the Court held that \nMissouri, by construing its consent-to-jurisdiction statute \nas permitting general jurisdiction upon the (required) ap-\npointment of the superintendent of insurance to receive \nprocess, \u201cdid not deprive the defendant of due process of \nlaw even if it took the defendant by surprise.\u201d Id. at 95. \n2. This Court recently confirmed the continuing vital-\nity of consent-to-jurisdiction statutes in Mallory. There, a \nVirginia-headquartered railroad corporation registered \n\n36 \n \nwith the Pennsylvania Department of State as a condition \nof doing business within the State. See 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. \n\u00a7\u2009411(a). Under a separate statute, such \u201cqualification as \na foreign corporation\u201d was deemed consent to appear in \nthe courts of the State on \u201cany cause of action.\u201d \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u20095301(a)(2)(i), (b). Based on such \ndeemed consent, a former employee sued the railroad in \nPennsylvania for injuries stemming from activities in Vir-\nginia and Ohio. \nThis Court held that the railroad\u2019s consent was a valid \nbasis for suit under the Fourteenth Amendment. Writing \nfor a four-Justice plurality, Justice Gorsuch explained \nthat the railroad had \u201cagreed to be found in Pennsylvania \nand answer any suit there,\u201d even if its contacts with the \nState did not support general or specific jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 135. Such consent was sufficient, he explained, be-\ncause \u201cpersonal jurisdiction is a personal defense that \nmay be waived or forfeited.\u201d Id. at 144. And waiver may \noccur by operation of law, just as readily as by any express \nstatement: Business-registration statutes are among the \n\u201c\u2018variety of legal arrangements [that] have been taken to \nrepresent express or implied consent\u2019 to personal jurisdic-\ntion consistent with due process.\u201d Id. at 136 n.5 (quoting \nInsurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703-704 (1982)) (cleaned up). \nJustice Alito agreed on this point to form a majority. \n\u201cConsent is a separate basis for personal jurisdiction,\u201d he \nexplained, and the railroad \u201chad clear notice that Penn-\nsylvania considered its registration as consent to general \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 153. Justice Alito nevertheless ex-\npressed doubt that \u201cthe Constitution permits a State to \nimpose such a submission-to-jurisdiction requirement.\u201d \nId. at 150. That kind of state law, he explained, creates \nserious tensions with \u201cthe very nature of the federal sys-\ntem that the Constitution created and in numerous provi-\nsions that bear on States\u2019 interactions with one another.\u201d \n\n37 \n \nId. at 154. However, Justice Alito concluded that limits \nimposed by interstate federalism would be better seated \nsomewhere other than the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause. Id. at 150. \nMallory controls here. Like the Pennsylvania statute \nat issue there, the PSJVTA clearly specifies in advance, \nand gives fair warning of, the conduct by which \u201ca defend-\nant shall be deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1).  \nIndeed, in important respects, this is a far easier case \nthan Mallory. There, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \nheld that the State had \u201cno legitimate interest in a contro-\nversy with no connection to the Commonwealth that was \nfiled by a non-resident against a foreign corporation that \nis not at home here.\u201d Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 266 \nA.3d 542, 567 (Pa. 2021). Here, by contrast, the PSJVTA \napplies only to cases involving terrorism against Ameri-\ncan victims and their families, a topic of preeminent fed-\neral concern. Moreover, unlike Pennsylvania\u2019s business-\nregistration statute, which required a foreign corporation \nto submit to general jurisdiction\u2014including in suits under \nnon-Pennsylvania causes of action\u2014the PSJVTA applies \nonly to a single category of federal cases. And whereas \nPennsylvania\u2019s practical and legal right to exclude from \nthe State a railroad engaged in interstate commerce was \nsuspect, the United States undoubtedly has authority to \nexclude the PLO and PA from its territory. \n3. The Second Circuit read Mallory as being limited \nto circumstances where the defendant \u201caccepted a gov-\nernment benefit from the forum, in return for which the \ndefendant [was] required to submit itself to suit in the fo-\nrum.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200923a-24a. According to the court, consent-\n\n38 \n \nto-jurisdiction statutes must be based on \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d to pass constitutional muster. Id. at 24a.7 \nThis reciprocal-bargains theory was novel. As Judge \nMenashi explained, the Second Circuit simply \u201cinvented a \nnew requirement that applies when Congress or a state \nlegislature attempts to extend personal jurisdiction \nthrough a deemed-consent statute.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009240a-241a \nn.11. \u201cAlthough there are cases holding that a defendant\u2019s \nreceipt of a benefit can be deemed to be consent,\u201d there \ndoes not appear to be \u201cany case holding that such receipt \nof a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Id. at 123a n.10 \n(Furman, J.) (citations omitted; emphasis added). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 reciprocal-bargain test reflects \na basic logic error. While \u201caccepting an in-state benefit \nwith jurisdictional strings attached\u201d is one way for a state \nto provide for consent to personal jurisdiction, Mallory, \n600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion), it is not the only way. \nTo the contrary, even a \u201ctrivial thing\u201d like taking \u201cone \nstep\u201d across an \u201cinvisible state line\u201d can lead to \u201cjurisdic-\ntional consequences [that] are immediate and serious.\u201d \nIbid. Or as Justice Jackson explained, a defendant may \nconsent to jurisdiction \u201cmore than one way,\u201d including: \n(1) \u201cexplicitly or implicitly consenting,\u201d by engaging in \nconduct deemed consent under law; (2) by \u201cfail[ing] to fol-\nlow specific procedural rules\u201d; or (3) by \u201cvoluntarily in-\nvoking certain benefits from a State that are conditioned \non submitting to the State\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 147-148. \nThe Second Circuit simply erased the first category. As \nJustice Jackson summarized: \nRegardless of whether a defendant relinquishes its \npersonal-jurisdiction \nrights \nexpressly \nor \n \n7 The court carved out an exception from its government-benefit \nrule for \u201clitigation-related activities,\u201d id. at 22a-24a, but did not ex-\nplain why such activities are sufficient without \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains.\u201d \n\n39 \n \nconstructively, the basic teaching of Insurance Corp. \nof Ireland is the same: When a defendant chooses to \nengage in behavior that \u201camount[s] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d the Due Process \nClause poses no barrier to the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 148 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-705) (brack-\nets in original). \nThe Second Circuit rested its holding on the rationale \nthat the \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d deemed to manifest consent \nto jurisdiction under the PSJVTA is not a sufficiently \nclose \u201cproxy for actual consent.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200938a (emphasis \nadded). That echoes the railroad\u2019s argument in Mallory: \nIt asserted that the statue was a \u201ccoercive assertion of ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d such that its consent was not \u201ctrue consent.\u201d \nResp.\u2009Br. at 3, 7, Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway \nCo., 600 U.S. 122 (2023) (No. 21-1168). The railroad thus \nargued it had \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 144 (plurality opinion). \nThis Court rejected the argument. \u201c[A] legion of \nprecedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional consequences to what \nsome might dismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145. \n\u201c[U]nder [those] precedents a variety of \u2018actions of the de-\nfendant\u2019 that may seem like technicalities nonetheless can \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of a \ncourt.\u2019 That was so before International Shoe, and it re-\nmains so today.\u201d Id. at 146 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n704-705) (citation omitted). Justice Alito agreed: There \nwas no due process violation because the defendant \u201cacted \nwith knowledge of state law when it registered,\u201d such that \nthe Court may \u201cpresume that by registering, it consented \nto all valid conditions imposed by state law.\u201d Id. at 151 \n(cleaned up). \n\n40 \n \nB. The PSJVTA Also Satisfies Traditional Due \nProcess Standards \nThis Court\u2019s rules for personal jurisdiction require \nthat the defendant receive \u201cfair warning\u201d and that \nmaintenance of the suit must be \u201creasonable, in the con-\ntext of our federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, \n592 U.S. at 358 (citations omitted). The PSJVTA easily \nsatisfies both requirements. \n1. The requirement of \u201cfair warning\u201d ensures that \n\u201c[a] defendant can \u2026 structure its primary conduct to \nlessen or avoid exposure to a given State\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. at \n360 (cleaned up). In the context of implied consent, that \nmeans the conduct that will subject the defendant to the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d \nWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, 685 \n(2015). Here, the PLO and PA knowingly and voluntarily \nconsented to federal jurisdiction under the PSJVTA. \nTheir consent was knowing because the PSJVTA de-\nscribes, in advance, exactly what actions would be deemed \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in civil cases under the \nATA. Indeed, the PLO and PA received actual notice of \nthe PSJVTA: Before the law took effect, they represented \nto the D.C. Circuit that they \u201cmight never make covered \npayments.\u201d Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org., 955 \nF.3d 1016, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2020). Thus, when they later \nmade pay-for-slay payments, they did so knowing that it \nwould vest U.S. courts with jurisdiction over them. \nTheir conduct was also voluntary. Actions are \u201cvol-\nuntary within the meaning of the Due Process Clause\u201d if \nthey are the product of \u201ca free and unconstrained will.\u201d \nOregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 304 (1985) (citation omit-\nted). Conduct is \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d by contrast, only if it arises \nfrom \u201ccoercive activity of the State.\u201d Colorado v. Con-\nnelly, 479 U.S. 157, 165 (1986). \n\n41 \n \nThe PSJVTA gave the PLO and PA a clear and vol-\nuntary choice: either cease engaging in the conduct spec-\nified in the law, or submit to jurisdiction in the United \nStates. That was not coercion. In North Carolina v. Al-\nford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), a criminal defendant argued that \nhis guilty plea to a murder charge was not \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in \nthe sense required by the Due Process Clause, because \nthe evidence against him presented a serious risk that the \nState would put him to death if he went to trial. Id. at 27-\n28. This Court rejected his claim, holding that even the \nhigh risk of a death sentence did not make the defendant\u2019s \nplea a product of \u201cfear and coercion.\u201d Id. at 29, 37. If \nHenry Alford\u2019s plea was voluntary, so were the PLO and \nPA\u2019s decisions to pay terrorists and their families for mur-\ndering Americans and to engage in non-U.N. activities \nwithin the United States. Cf. Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 \nU.S. 212, 219 n.8 (1978) (\u201cthe legal system is replete with \nsituations requiring the making of difficult judgments as \nto which course to follow,\u201d but that does not make those \nchoices involuntary) (cleaned up). \nThe Second Circuit questioned whether constructive \nwaivers of constitutional rights are ever truly \u201cvoluntary.\u201d \nSee Pet.\u2009App.\u200939a-43a. Relying on dicta from College Sav-\nings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \nExpense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999), the court stated that \nconstitutional rights cannot be waived by constructive \nconsent, and that a person\u2019s \u201cability to \u2018abandon\u2019 the rele-\nvant predicate conduct \u2018has no bearing upon the voluntar-\niness of the asserted waiver.\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200940a (quoting 527 \nU.S. at 684) (brackets omitted). That reading of College \nSavings is mistaken. \nIn College Savings, the question was whether a State, \nby engaging in trademark-related activities regulated by \nthe Lanham Act, could be deemed as having implicitly \nwaived its immunity from suit under that Act. 527 U.S. at \n669. The Court held that it could not, and that Congress \n\n42 \n \ndid not have authority \u201cto exact constructive waivers of \nsovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I pow-\ners.\u201d Id. at 683. The Court stated in dicta that constructive \nwaivers are \u201csimply unheard of in the context of other con-\nstitutionally protected privileges,\u201d id. at 681, and that \nCongress\u2019s clear notice of the conduct giving rise to con-\nstructive consent could \u201chave no bearing upon the volun-\ntariness of the waiver\u201d of State sovereign immunity, id. at \n684. \nThe dicta in College Savings is uninstructive here. \nSovereign immunity and personal jurisdiction differ in \nrelevant ways. A State\u2019s immunity is a fundamental as-\npect of the sovereignty that the States enjoyed before the \nratification of the Constitution; as such, it goes to the very \nheart of our federal system. Personal jurisdiction, by con-\ntrast, is a matter of \u201cindividual liberty\u201d that can \u201cbe \nwaived\u201d through \u201cexpress or implied consent.\u201d Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 702-703. And this Court has specifically re-\njected the argument that \u201cthere is something unique \nabout the requirement of personal jurisdiction, which pre-\nvents it from being established or waived like other \nrights.\u201d Id. at 706; accord Mallory, 600 U.S. at 149 (Jack-\nson, J., concurring).8 \n2. The PSJVTA is also \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, 592 U.S. \nat 358 (citation omitted). Making this assessment requires \n\u201ca forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d \nJ. McIntyre, 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion).  \n \n8 This Court has upheld constructive waivers of constitutional \nrights by statute in other contexts as well. See, e.g., Birchfield v. \nNorth Dakota, 579 U.S. 438 (2016) (Fourth Amendment); South Da-\nkota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (1983) (Fifth Amendment); Bank of Co-\nlumbia v. Okely, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 235 (1819) (Seventh Amend-\nment). \n\n43 \n \nIn Ford Motor, this Court found that \u201cprinciples of \n\u2018interstate federalism\u2019 support[ed jurisdiction\u201d in the \nplaintiffs\u2019 home states, which had \u201csignificant interests at \nstake\u201d in \u201cproviding their residents with a convenient fo-\nrum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state ac-\ntors, as well as enforcing their own safety regulations.\u201d \n592 U.S. at 368 (cleaned up). Here, the \u201cinterests at stake\u201d \nare those of the national sovereign. As discussed above, \nthe PSJVTA advances national security and foreign policy \ninterests distinct to the United States. See pp. 22-23, 30-\n31, supra. The United States is the only forum where \nAmerican victims of international terrorism (and their \nfamilies) can obtain redress under the ATA. And adjudi-\ncation of such suits does not encroach on the sovereignty \nof another body in our constitutional system. \nC. \nEven If A Reciprocal Benefit Was Required, The \nPLO and PA Received One \nEven if receipt of some \u201cbenefit\u201d was required, the \nPLO and PA have received one: They have obtained \u201cthe \nprivilege of residing and conducting business in the \nUnited States\u2014not to mention furthering their political \ngoals at the expense of American lives.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009231a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting). \nAs an initial matter, the United States has the abso-\nlute power to exclude the PLO and PA from its territory\u2014\nas it did for many years. J.A.\u2009276-279.9 The power to ex-\nclude includes the lesser power to admit on condition of \nconsent to personal jurisdiction. See Washington ex rel. \nBond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Ct. of Wash., 289 \nU.S. 361, 364-365 (1933) (\u201cqualification of a foreign corpo-\nration in accordance with the statutes permitting its entry \n \n9 The United States could exclude the PLO and PA even if doing \nso would violate our treaty obligations to the United Nations. \nUnited States v. Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F. Supp. 1456, 1463-\n1465, 1468-1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). \n\n44 \n \ninto the state constitutes an assent on its part to all the \nreasonable conditions imposed,\u201d including consent to ju-\nrisdiction); Hess v. Pawlowski, 274 U.S. 352, 356 (1927) \n(similar); St. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356 (similar); Baltimore & \nOhio R.R. Co. v. Harris, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 65, 81 (1871) \n(similar). \nThe PLO and PA have benefitted from their presence \nin the United States, including by engaging in activities \nother than those \u201cundertaken exclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Nations.\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(B). It is uncontested that after the \nstatutory trigger date, their U.S.-based officers, employ-\nees, and agents met with U.S.-based groups to encourage \nthem to \u201clobby[] the government, lobby[] Congress\u201d to \nsupport \u201cjustice for the Palestinian people\u201d; used U.S.-\nbased social media platforms to \u201craise public awareness\u201d \nand \u201cbring attention\u201d to their cause; and notarized docu-\nments in the United States for use in Palestinian territo-\nries. J.A.\u2009282-288. In Sokolow, the district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \nin these types of activities.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200973a.10 Their ability \nto engage in these activities while physically present in \nthe United States was a meaningful benefit. Cf. Burnham, \n495 U.S. at 637 (Brennan, J., concurring) (defendant re-\nceived \u201csignificant benefits\u201d by visiting forum State for \nthree days). \nThe Second Circuit dismissed all of these U.S. activi-\nties as irrelevant. According to the court, \u201cfederal law has \nlong prohibited [the PLO and PA] from engaging in any \n \n10 Opposing certiorari, the PLO and PA contended that petitioners \nforfeited the argument that their U.S. activities meet the PSJVTA\u2019s \nterms. Br.\u2009in\u2009Opp.\u200917-18. That is false. Petitioners told the court of \nappeals that \u201cremands would be required [to consider the U.S.-ac-\ntivities prong] if this Court adopts Defendants\u2019 unprecedented \u2018ben-\nefit\u2019 theory.\u201d Fuld\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A.\u2009Br.\u20096; Sokolow\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A. \nBr.\u20096. \n\n45 \n \nactivities or maintaining any offices in the United States.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200928a. As a result, the court concluded, the \nPSJVTA \u201cexacts \u2018deemed\u2019 consent \u2026 without conferring \nany rights or benefits on [them] in return.\u201d Id. at 29a. That \nreasoning is both legally and logically flawed. \nAs a legal matter, the court was incorrect that all the \nPLO and PA\u2019s activities in the United States were prohib-\nited by federal law. The relevant statute merely forbids \nthem to \u201cexpend funds\u201d or maintain an office in the United \nStates (other than their U.N. mission). 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202; \nsee Application of Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 to Diplo-\nmatic Visit of Palestinian Delegation, 46 Op. O.L.C. __, \nat 2 (slip op. Oct. 28, 2022). Their non-expenditure activi-\nties\u2014including notarizing documents, holding meetings \nwith community groups, public speaking, publishing, and \nissuing political statements on social-media\u2014are not for-\nbidden by \u00a7\u20095202.11 \nAs a logical matter, the court was incorrect that if all \ntheir activities had been unlawful, the PLO and PA would \nhave received no benefit from conducting activities within \nthe United States. The legality or illegality of their activi-\nties has no bearing on the question whether they benefited \nfrom the society, economy, and governmental protection \nof the United States. Indeed, if Congress were to prohibit \nthem from engaging in any U.S. activities, and if they \nwere to flout that law, that would only make the PSJVTA \nmore reasonable, not less. As Judge Menashi explained, \n\u201ca foreign actor that conducts unauthorized business in \nthe United States has obtained an even greater benefit \nfrom the forum than the foreign actor that complies with \nAmerican law,\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009250a, and it would be \u201cperverse\u201d \n \n11 The court also cited (Pet.\u2009App.\u200928a\u2009n.9) Section 7(b) of the Pales-\ntinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-446. But that \nstatute is inapplicable at this time, because no ministry, agency, or \ninstrumentality of the PA is controlled by Hamas. See ibid. (incor-\nporating 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092378b). \n\n46 \n \nto give the law-breaker protection that a law-abiding for-\neigner lacks, id. at 231a. \nTo see this point, consider an analogous consent stat-\nute. \u201c[A]ll 50 States have adopted implied consent laws \nthat require motorists, as a condition of operating a motor \nvehicle within the State, to consent to [blood alcohol con-\ntent] testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained on \nsuspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\u201d Missouri v. \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013). Under the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal benefits\u201d test, these implied-consent \nstatues would be constitutional only as applied to validly \nlicensed drivers who exchange consent for the \u201cprivilege \nof driving on state roads.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200937a\u2009n.14 (citation \nomitted). They would be unconstitutional as applied to \nmotorists whose licenses have been suspended or revoked \nbecause such persons are already \u201cprohibited\u201d from driv-\ning under existing law. No principle of due process im-\nposes such irrational limits on the political branches. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed. \n\n47 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL SILVERMAN \nTHE SILVERMAN LAW  \nFIRM, PLLC \n16 Squadron Blvd. \nNew York, NY 10956 \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMANN \nTHE LAW OFFICE OF  \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMAN, P.C. \n150 Broadway, Ste. 900 \nNew York, NY 10038 \nBRIAN M.

Findings; determinations \n(a) Findings \nThe Congress finds that\u2014 \n*\u2009*\u2009* \n(2) the Palestine Liberation Organization (hereafter \nin this chapter referred to as the \u201cPLO\u201d) was directly re-\nsponsible for the murder of an American citizen on the \nAchille Lauro cruise liner in 1985, and a member of the \nPLO\u2019s Executive Committee is under indictment in the \nUnited States for the murder of that American citizen; \n(3) the head of the PLO has been implicated in the \nmurder of a United States Ambassador overseas; \n(4) the PLO and its constituent groups have taken \ncredit for, and been implicated in, the murders of dozens \nof American citizens abroad; *\u2009*\u2009* \n(b) Determinations \nTherefore, the Congress determines that the PLO \nand its affiliates are a terrorist organization and a threat \nto the interests of the United States, its allies, and to in-\nternational law and should not benefit from operating in \nthe United States. \n\u00a7\u20091003. Prohibitions regarding PLO  \n\n2a \n \n \nIt shall be unlawful, if the purpose be to further the \ninterests of the Palestine Liberation Organization or any \nof its constituent groups, any successor to any of those, or \nany agents thereof, on or after the effective date of this \nchapter\u2014 \n(1) to receive anything of value except informational \nmaterial from the PLO or any of its constituent groups, \nany successor thereto, or any agents thereof; \n(2) to expend funds from the PLO or any of its con-\nstituent groups, any successor thereto, or any agents \nthereof; or \n(3) notwithstanding any provision of law to the con-\ntrary, to establish or maintain an office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments within the \njurisdiction of the United States at the behest or direction \nof, or with funds provided by the Palestine Liberation Or-\nganization or any of its constituent groups, any successor \nto any of those, or any agents thereof. \n \n*\u2009*\u2009* \n \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, Pub.

Definitions \nAs used in this chapter\u2014 \n(1) the term \u201cinternational terrorism\u201d means activi-\nties that\u2014 \n(A) involve violent acts or acts dangerous to human \nlife that are a violation of the criminal laws of the United \nStates or of any State, or that would be a criminal violation \nif committed within the jurisdiction of the United States \nor of any State; \n\n3a \n \n \n(B) appear to be intended\u2014 \n(i) to intimidate or coerce a civilian population; \n(ii) to influence the policy of a government by intimi-\ndation or coercion; or \n(iii) to affect the conduct of a government by mass de-\nstruction, assassination, or kidnapping; and \n(C) occur primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction \nof the United States, or transcend national boundaries in \nterms of the means by which they are accomplished, the \npersons they appear intended to intimidate or coerce, or \nthe locale in which their perpetrators operate or seek asy-\nlum; *\u2009*\u2009* \n\u00a7\u20092333. Civil Remedies \n(a) ACTION AND JURISDICTION.\u2014Any national of the \nUnited States injured in his or her person, property, or \nbusiness by reason of an act of international terrorism, or \nhis or her estate, survivors, or heirs, may sue therefor in \nany appropriate district court of the United States and \nshall recover threefold the damages he or she sustains and \nthe cost of the suit, including attorney\u2019s fees. *\u2009*\u2009* \n\u00a7\u20092334.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the core legal disputes is now stable and dialectically balanced. This observation, being an internal reflection, does not introduce new external evidence but rather solidifies my analytical path forward and identifies the next key area of uncertainty.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict - The Nature of \"Consent\" (Stable & Balanced):** The primary legal question remains the clash between two models of consent-based jurisdiction. My model is now focused on how the Court will resolve this tension.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** Consent can be statutorily \"deemed\" based on a defendant's conduct (*Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.*).\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (Stable):** True implied consent requires conduct that constitutes a \"Legal Submission to the Jurisdiction of the Court\" (*Ins. Corp. of Ireland*), which they argue is absent here because the U.S. offers no *quid pro quo* for the defendants' actions in Palestine. The distinction of *Mallory* as a case involving a benefit (doing business) granted by the sovereign remains the respondents' most powerful argument.\n\n*   **The Constitutional Debate - 5th vs. 14th Amendment (Stable & Balanced):** The competing interpretations of due process are clearly delineated.\n    *   **Petitioners' View (Stable):** The 14th Amendment's federalism-based limits (*International Shoe*) do not constrain the national sovereign's power under the 5th Amendment, especially in foreign affairs.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter (Stable):** The due process protections of the 5th and 14th Amendments are coextensive, protecting individual liberty from any sovereign, state or federal.\n\n*   **The Battle over Originalism (Stable & Balanced):** The historical arguments are set.\n    *   **Petitioners' Originalism (Stable):** The Fifth Amendment historically imposed no territorial limits on federal court jurisdiction.\n    *   **Respondents' Counter-Originalism (Stable):** Founding-era jurisprudence, influenced by natural law and jurists like Story (*Picquet v. Swan*), incorporated territorial limits as a fundamental aspect of due process.\n\n*   **The Separation of Powers Clash (Stable & Balanced):** The conflict over institutional roles is a key secondary battleground.\n    *   **Respondents' View (Stable):** The PSJVTA is an unconstitutional legislative command for the judiciary to \"deem\" a jurisdictional fact, violating the principles of *United States v. Klein* and *City of Boerne v. Flores*.\n    *   **Petitioners' Counter (Stable):** The Second Circuit's ruling is a judicial usurpation of the political branches' foreign policy authority.\n\n*   **New Belief - The Solicitor General as a Key Variable (New Hypothesis):** My analysis has identified the next critical inflection point. The United States is listed as a petitioner, meaning the Solicitor General (SG) has filed a brief. The SG's position is exceptionally influential, often referred to as the \"tenth justice.\" This brief will provide a powerful signal regarding:\n    *   **Doctrinal Alignment:** Which side of the *Mallory* / *Ins. Corp. of Ireland* debate the Executive Branch supports.\n    *   **Separation of Powers:** How the Executive Branch views the PSJVTA's impact on judicial power versus its own foreign policy prerogatives.\n    *   **Judicial Deference:** The extent to which the government will argue for judicial deference to Congress in this area.\n    *   **My current uncertainty is now focused:** While the legal arguments are mapped, their relative weight is unclear. The SG's brief is the single most likely source to clarify which arguments the Court will find most persuasive.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of self-reflection and planning, strongly validates my refined analytical methodology. It demonstrates the power of a structured, iterative process in navigating complex legal questions.\n\nMy design beliefs have been reinforced and are becoming more integrated:\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents (Stable):** Remains the core principle. My internal reasoning confirms that after acquiring the petitioner and respondent briefs, the next logical primary source is the brief for the United States.\n\n*   **Map the Political-Branch Ecosystem (Reinforced & Actionable):** This heuristic has now directly generated a high-priority action. My thought process explicitly identified the Executive Branch (via the Solicitor General) as a key node in the ecosystem whose position must be known. This moves the heuristic from a passive mapping tool to an active driver of the information-gathering strategy.\n\n*   **Build a Dialectical Map (Validated):** The map is now serving its purpose perfectly. Having achieved a balanced state, it allows me to see the entire landscape and ask, \"What actor or argument could tip the scales?\" The answer, guided by the Political-Branch Ecosystem map, is the Solicitor General.\n\n*   **Identify \"Off-Ramps\" and \"Alternative Frameworks\" (Stable):** The SG's brief is a potential source for a new off-ramp or a strong endorsement of an existing one (like the foreign policy frame). I will be analyzing it with this in mind.\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction (Validated & Operationalized):** The `Assess -> Target -> Acquire` loop is now my confirmed operational model.\n    *   **Assess:** My internal monologue was a formal assessment, summarizing the current balanced-but-incomplete knowledge state.\n    *   **Target:** The assessment logically concluded that the highest-value, missing piece of information is the SG's brief.\n    *   **Acquire:** My next planned action will be to acquire and analyze this specific document.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This demonstrates the efficiency of the loop. Instead of randomly searching for information, I am systematically identifying and filling the most critical knowledge gaps.\n\n*   **Identify the \"Lynchpin Case\" (Reinforced):** This heuristic is now integrated with my planning. My next step is not just to \"read the SG brief,\" but to read it with a specific question in mind: \"How does the U.S. government argue the Court should resolve the tension between *Mallory* and *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*?\" This targeted analysis, focused on the lynchpin, will be far more efficient and insightful."

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA \nby enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay the designee of any terrorist convicted \nof or killed while committing a terror attack against \nan American national, and the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the conviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); or  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct[] any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the 2020 trigger dates. But in the decisions be-\nlow, the Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. \nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Con-\ngress from specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides \nthe defendant with \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d in return, and \nthat the PLO and PA had not received any such reciprocal \nbargain.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ..................................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ........................................................................... 2 \nConstitutional And Statutory Provisions Involved .......... 2 \nStatement .............................................................................. 3 \nA.

This Court\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092331 et \nseq. (ATA), provides a private right of action for U.S. na-\ntionals and their families harmed by international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). For 25 years, the ATA worked as \nintended, enabling victims to hold terrorists and their \nsponsors accountable in civil actions in U.S. courts. But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \n\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In 2019, Congress amended the ATA \nby enacting the Promoting Security and Justice for Vic-\ntims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA). Under the PSJVTA, the \nPalestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Palestinian \nAuthority (PA) \u201cshall be deemed to have consented to per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in an ATA action if:  \n(a) more than 120 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they pay the designee of any terrorist convicted \nof or killed while committing a terror attack against \nan American national, and the payment is made \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the conviction or terror attack, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A); or  \n(b) more than 15 days after the statute\u2019s enact-\nment, they \u201cconduct[] any activity\u201d while physically \npresent in the United States (with limited excep-\ntions), id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). \nThe PLO and PA engaged in both categories of con-\nduct after the 2020 trigger dates. But in the decisions be-\nlow, the Second Circuit facially invalidated the PSJVTA. \nThe court held that the Fifth Amendment forbids Con-\ngress from specifying conduct that triggers a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to federal jurisdiction unless the statute provides \nthe defendant with \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d in return, and \nthat the PLO and PA had not received any such reciprocal \nbargain.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment.  \n \n\n \n(ii) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nOpinions Below ..................................................................... 1 \nJurisdiction ........................................................................... 2 \nConstitutional And Statutory Provisions Involved .......... 2 \nStatement .............................................................................. 3 \nA.

This Court\u2019s ju-\nrisdiction rests on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant constitutional and statutory provisions are \nreproduced in the Appendix. \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSTATEMENT \nThe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092331 et \nseq. (ATA), provides a private right of action for U.S. na-\ntionals and their families harmed by international terror-\nism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). For 25 years, the ATA worked as \nintended, enabling victims to hold terrorists and their \nsponsors accountable in civil actions in U.S. courts. But in \n2016, the Second Circuit held that the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment forbids the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases if the defendant\u2019s liability-creat-\ning conduct occurs \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Pet.\u2009App. \n154a-157a, 168a-169a. \nIn response to that decision and others in its wake, \nCongress twice amended the ATA, providing that certain \nconduct by the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (PA), would be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases. \nThe most-recent enactment, the Promoting Security and \nJustice for Victims of Terrorism Act (PSJVTA), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 3082-3085, pro-\nvides that the PLO and PA are deemed to consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they (a) pay terrorists \nwho were killed in or imprisoned for terror attacks \nagainst Americans, and they make such payments \u201cby \nreason of\u201d the terrorists\u2019 death or imprisonment arising \nfrom such attacks; or (b) conduct \u201cany activity while phys-\nically present in the United States,\u201d with certain excep-\ntions. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1). \nCongress passed the law so that ATA suits could be \n\u201cresolved in a manner that provides just compensation to \nthe victims.\u201d PSJVTA \u00a7\u2009903(b)(4)(A), 133 Stat. 3083, note \nfollowing 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333. Congress also included a rule \nof construction requiring that the statute \u201cbe liberally \nconstrued to carry out the purposes of Congress to pro-\nvide relief for victims of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u2009903(d)(1)(A). \n\n4 \n \nThe question here is whether this statute, enacted to \n\u201cprovide relief for victims of terrorism,\u201d ibid., violates the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment. When \nmeasured against the original public meaning of \u201cdue pro-\ncess of law\u201d in 1791, this is an easy case. At the Founding, \nthe Fifth Amendment was not understood to prohibit the \nadjudication of cases arising from conduct outside the \nUnited States. Restrictions on personal jurisdiction arose \nnot from anything in the Constitution, but rather from the \nlaw of nations, which Congress was free to override. See \nPicquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) \n(No. 11,134) (Story, J.); Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. 911, \n912 (No. 5,657) (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (Washington, J.). \nThis is also an easy case under the Court\u2019s Fifth \nAmendment precedents. The Court has repeatedly taught \nthat federal courts can adjudicate federal cases arising \nfrom extraterritorial conduct when Congress so provides, \nand that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \u201cinterstate feder-\nalism\u201d restrictions do not affect the sovereign preroga-\ntives of the national government. The PSJVTA amply sat-\nisfies the basic due process requirements of fair warning \nand non-arbitrariness established in this Court\u2019s prece-\ndents: It advances the Federal Government\u2019s legitimate \nforeign policy and national security interests by deterring \nand disrupting terrorism, protecting and compensating \nAmericans, and incentivizing the PLO and PA to end their \nofficial program of financially rewarding terrorism. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless facially invalidated \nthe PSJVTA, based on several errors.  \nFirst, the court began by asserting the \u201cdue process \nanalysis in the personal jurisdiction context is basically \nthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quotation marks omitted). That is \nincorrect. The Fourteenth Amendment, \u201cacting as an in-\nstrument of interstate federalism, may sometimes act to \ndivest the State of its power to render a valid judgment.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, \n294 (1980) (emphasis added). The Fifth Amendment, by \ncontrast, is not and never has been an instrument of in-\nternational federalism\u2014for there is no such thing. \nSecond, the court of appeals invented a novel test for \njudging consent-to-jurisdiction statutes, requiring such \nstatutes to be based on \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d between the \nforum\u2019s sovereign and the defendant. Pet.\u2009App.\u200924a. Yet \nthis Court recently upheld a state consent-to-jurisdiction \nlaw in Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. \n122 (2023), without suggesting that due process requires \nany reciprocal bargain. Instead, the Court emphasized \nthat \u201ca legion of precedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional conse-\nquences to what some might dismiss as mere formalities,\u201d \nand it rejected the defendant\u2019s request to look behind \nthose formalities to determine whether it had \u201creally sub-\nmitted\u201d to jurisdiction. Id. at 144-145 (plurality opinion). \nThird, the court of appeals misapplied its own test by \nholding that that the PLO and PA received no meaningful \n\u201cbenefit\u201d from engaging in conduct while present in the \nUnited States because their conduct was unlawful. As \nJudge Menashi explained in dissenting from denial of  \nrehearing, that conclusion was \u201cperverse\u201d: A visitor who  \nunlawfully \u201cextract[s] a benefit\u201d from the United States \nshould not be rewarded by heightened due process  \nprotection that is unavailable to law-abiding guests. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a-232a. \nIn enacting the PSJVTA, Congress gave the PLO and \nthe PA a choice: Either refrain from paying terrorists for \nmurdering and maiming Americans, and cease all but a \nhandful of U.S. activities, or else submit to the jurisdiction \nof U.S. courts in ATA actions. They may not have relished \nthat choice, but they made it freely and with full \nknowledge of the consequences. Striking down the statute \nwill significantly curtail the political branches\u2019 ability to \ncombat terrorism and will restrict the power of Congress \n\n6 \n \nin other contexts\u2014a step that would be a sharp departure \nfrom this Court\u2019s traditional deference to the decisions of \nthe political branches in matters of jurisdiction over for-\neign governments, foreign affairs, and national security. \nA. Legal Background \n1. The Anti-Terrorism Act provides a private right of \naction to U.S. nationals and their families to recover for \ndeath and injuries sustained by reason of acts of interna-\ntional terrorism. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092333(a). The law was inspired \nby a civil suit brought against the PLO for the 1985 mur-\nder of Leon Klinghoffer, a wheelchair-bound American \ncruise-ship passenger who was shot in the face and \nthrown into the open sea by PLO hijackers. \nKlinghoffer\u2019s family was able to hold the PLO ac-\ncountable for the murder only because federal admiralty \njurisdiction happened to be available. H.R. Rep. No. 102-\n1040, at 5 (1992). In advancing the ATA, the Senate Judi-\nciary Committee explained that it would \u201copen[] the \ncourthouse door to victims of international terrorism,\u201d by \n\u201cextend[ing] the same jurisdictional structure that under-\ngirds the reach of American criminal law to the civil rem-\nedies that it defines.\u201d S. Rep. No. 102-342, at 45 (1992). \nPresident Bush signed the law to \u201censure that \u2026 a remedy \nwill be available for Americans injured abroad by sense-\nless acts of terrorism.\u201d Statement by President George \nBush Upon Signing S. 1569, 28 Weekly Comp. Pres. Docs. \n2112 (Oct. 29, 1992). \nThe ATA provides for nationwide service of process \nand exclusive federal jurisdiction. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7\u20092334(a), \n2338. The Attorney General may intervene in such ac-\ntions, id. \u00a7\u20092336(c), and may obtain a civil forfeiture of \n\u201c[a]ll assets, foreign or domestic, of any individual, entity, \nor organization engaged in planning or perpetrating any \nFederal crime of terrorism against the United States, \n\n7 \n \ncitizens or residents of the United States, or their prop-\nerty,\u201d id. \u00a7\u2009981(a)(1)(G)(i) (cleaned up). \nFor nearly 25 years, federal courts exercised general \npersonal jurisdiction over the PLO and the PA in civil ATA \ncases based on the organizations\u2019 systematic and continu-\nous presence in the United States. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009193a\u2009n.10 \n(collecting cases). In 2016, however, the court of appeals \nin this case held that U.S. courts could no longer do so be-\ncause this Court had \u201cnarrowed the test for general juris-\ndiction\u201d in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 (2014). \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009140-141a. It also held that specific jurisdiction \nover the PLO and PA was absent because the \u201cconduct \nthat could have subjected them to liability under the \nATA\u201d occurred \u201coutside the United States.\u201d Id. at 166a. \n2. Congress responded to that decision by enacting \nthe Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nwhich invoked another traditional basis for the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction: consent. Under the ATCA, any de-\nfendant \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or suspension\u201d of 22 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202\u2014which forbids the PLO and its affiliates \nfrom maintaining an office or spending money in the \nUnited States\u2014\u201cshall be deemed to have consented to \npersonal jurisdiction\u201d in civil ATA cases if the defendant \nmaintains \u201cany office \u2026 within the jurisdiction of the \nUnited States\u201d after January 31, 2019, \u201cregardless of the \ndate of the occurrence of the act of international terror-\nism.\u201d Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7\u20094, 132 Stat. 3184, codified as \namended, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B). The House Judiciary \nCommittee explained: \u201cIt is eminently reasonable to con-\ndition\u201d the PLO and PA\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in the \nUnited States on [their] consent to jurisdiction \u2026, as Con-\ngress has repeatedly tied their continued receipt of these \nprivileges to their adherence to their commitment to re-\nnounce terrorism.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7 (2018). \nThe court of appeals in this case then held that the \nATCA\u2019s factual predicates had not been met. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009\n\n8 \n \n10a-11a. In response, Congress again amended the ATA \nby enacting the PSJVTA. Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. \nIX, \u00a7\u2009903, 133 Stat. 308, codified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e). \nThe PSJVTA has two operative prongs: \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(A) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 120 days after the \nlaw\u2019s enactment, the defendant makes any payment \nto a designee of an individual imprisoned for, or \nkilled while, committing a terror attack that killed \nor injured a national of the United States, if the pay-\nment is made \u201cby reason of\u201d such death or impris-\nonment. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cpay-for-slay\u201d prong. \n\u2022 Subparagraph (1)(B) provides that the PLO and PA \nare deemed to have consented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in civil ATA cases if, at least 15 days after en-\nactment, the defendant \u201cconducts any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe Palestine Liberation Organization or the Pales-\ntinian Authority.\u201d Subparagraph (1)(B) is subject to \nsix exceptions, including maintaining an office or \nconducting an activity \u201cexclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Na-\ntions.\u201d Id. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(A), (B). This provision is \nknown as the statute\u2019s \u201cU.S.-activities\u201d prong. \nB. Factual and Procedural Background \n1. These cases arose out of a series of terror attacks \nin Israel that killed and injured dozens of U.S. nationals. \nAlan Bauer and his seven-year-old son were walking down \na crowded street when a suicide bomber directed by a \nlieutenant in the PA intelligence service blew himself up, \nsending shrapnel through the boy\u2019s brain. The damage \nwas permanent. A bomb tore through Scott Goldberg\u2019s \n\n9 \n \nbody on a city bus while he was on his way to work; he left \na widow and seven children. The suicide bomber was a PA \npolice officer\u2014recruited and directed by a team of other \nPA officers. The PA gave him a hero\u2019s funeral. Four plain-\ntiffs were killed by a massive bomb detonated in a univer-\nsity cafeteria at lunchtime. Their parents learned about \nthe attack while at home in the United States\u2014some by \nrecognizing the bodies or personal effects of their children \non the television news. See Sokolow\u2009C.A.\u2009App.\u20094072-4076, \n4084-4086, 4948-4994, 5288, 5543-5574, 6450, 6454, 6487-\n6489, 6697, 6700, 6852, 7014-7015. \nA terrorist stabbed Ari Fuld, an American citizen and \nfather of four, just hours after Mahmoud Abbas, the \nChairman of the PLO and President of the PA, falsely \nclaimed that the Israeli Government was planning to es-\ntablish Jewish prayer zones inside the al-Aqsa Mosque, \none of Islam\u2019s holiest sites. J.A.\u2009420. \n2. The plaintiff families sued under the ATA in the \nU.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. \nIn Sokolow, after a seven-week trial with testimony \nfrom 50 witnesses, the jury found that the PLO and PA, \nacting through their employees, perpetrated the six at-\ntacks at issue and that the PLO and PA knowingly pro-\nvided material support to organizations designated by the \nState Department as foreign terrorist organizations. \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009141a. The jury awarded plaintiffs $218.5 million \nin damages, which was automatically trebled under the \nATA to $655.5 million. Ibid. \nOn appeal, the Second Circuit vacated the judgment \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. Ibid. The court rejected \nplaintiffs\u2019 argument that governmental entities like the \nPLO and PA were not \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process \nClause, holding that the PLO and PA enjoy due process \nrights precisely because \u201cneither the PLO nor the PA is \nrecognized by the United States as a sovereign state.\u201d Id. \nat 153a. It also held that the test for personal jurisdiction \n\n10 \n \nis \u201cthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments.\u201d Id. at 156a. Applying Fourteenth Amendment \nstandards, the court of appeals held that U.S. courts could \nnot exercise general jurisdiction because the PLO and PA \nwere \u201cat home\u201d in \u201cPalestine,\u201d id. at 160a, and could not \nexercise specific jurisdiction because the conduct giving \nrise to liability \u201coccurred entirely outside the territorial \njurisdiction of the United States,\u201d id. at 167a. This Court \ndenied review. 138 S. Ct. 1438 (2018). \nBipartisan sponsors introduced the ATCA in Con-\ngress a few weeks later. 164 Cong. Rec. S2926 (May 24, \n2018). They explained that \u201crecent Federal court deci-\nsions\u201d had \u201cseverely undermined the ability of American \nvictims to bring terrorists to justice.\u201d 164 Cong. Rec. \nS5103-01 (July 19, 2018) (Sen. Grassley); see 164 Cong. \nRec. H6617-18 (July 23, 2018) (Rep. Nadler). The House \nJudiciary Committee explained that the bill\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d \nwas \u201cto better ensure that victims of international terror-\nism can obtain justice in United States courts.\u201d H.R. Rep. \nNo. 115-858, at 2 (2018). President Trump signed the bill \ninto law. Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7\u20094, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs then moved to recall the Sec-\nond Circuit\u2019s mandate in light of the ATCA. The court de-\nnied the motion, finding that the ATCA\u2019s factual predi-\ncates had not been satisfied. Pet.\u2009App.\u2009133a. The Sokolow \nplaintiffs again sought this Court\u2019s review. While their pe-\ntition was pending, Congress enacted the PSJVTA. This \nCourt granted the petition, vacated the judgment below, \nand remanded in light of the new statute. 140 S. Ct. 2714 \n(2020). The Second Circuit in turn remanded to the dis-\ntrict court. \n3. On remand in Sokolow, and on a Rule 12(b)(2) mo-\ntion in Fuld, the PLO and PA challenged the PSJVTA on \nthe ground that it facially violated the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause. The United States intervened in \nboth cases. \n\n11 \n \na. In Sokolow, the district court determined that the \nPLO and PA engaged in conduct meeting the pay-for-slay \nprong, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(A), finding that they \u201cmade \npayments after April 18, 2020 to the families of individuals \nkilled while committing acts of terrorism, that the pay-\nments were made because the individuals engaged in ter-\nrorism, and that the terrorism harmed U.S. nationals.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200985a. Ample evidence supported the findings: \nConsistent with their long history of supporting and glo-\nrifying terrorism, the PLO and PA have an official policy \nof rewarding terrorists (or their next of kin) for attacking \nJews. J.A.\u2009156-157. These payments \u201care not social wel-\nfare or charity to the needy.\u201d Ibid. They are provided to \n\u201crich and poor alike,\u201d without regard to financial condi-\ntion. Ibid. They are unavailable to those who commit \u201cor-\ndinary\u201d crimes. Id. at 159. The PLO and PA made pay-\nments for at least 175 Palestinian individuals killed while \nor imprisoned for committing terror attacks that killed or \ninjured Americans. J.A.\u200969-135; Sokolow D. Ct. Doc. 1015-\n1. The payees included perpetrators of the attacks at issue \nin Sokolow. See Sokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc. 1015, at 11. \nThe Sokolow plaintiffs asked the district court to \nmake factual findings that the PLO and PA engaged in \nconduct meeting the U.S.-activities prong, by engaging in \n\u201cactivit[ies] while physically present in the United States\u201d \nthat did not fall within any statutory exemption, 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u20092334(e)(1)(B)(iii). Plaintiffs offered evidence that, after \nthe PSJVTA\u2019s trigger date, PLO and PA officials dissem-\ninated public-relations material in the United States urg-\ning supporters to lobby the U.S. Government and public \nin support of their political agenda; gave speeches at U.S. \nuniversities and local venues; and authorized PA-depu-\ntized notaries in the United States to certify documents \nfor use in territories administered by the PA. See J.A.\u2009\n149-152, 275, 282-285, 616-913. The district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \n\n12 \n \nin these types of activities,\u201d but declined to determine \nwhether they fell within any statutory exemption. Pet.\u2009\nApp.\u200973a-75a. \nThe Fuld district court assumed without deciding \nthat both prongs had been satisfied. Id. at 101a-102a & \nn.3. \nb. Both district courts held the law facially unconsti-\ntutional under the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment. Id. at 74a-77a, 87a-92a, 108a-125a. In their \nview, this Court\u2019s decision in Daimler had rendered \u201cob-\nsolete\u201d consent-to-jurisdiction cases decided under pre-\nInternational Shoe precedents. Id. at 76a, 112a n.6. \n4. The Second Circuit heard the cases in tandem and \naffirmed. Id. at 1a-70a. \na. Like the district courts, the court of appeals ac-\ncepted that the PLO and PA had engaged in consent-man-\nifesting conduct by paying terrorists who had murdered \nAmericans, and it assumed that they had conducted non-\nexempt activities within the United States. Id. at 38a, 68a \nn.7. The Second Circuit also did not dispute that the \nPSJVTA meets \u201cminimum due process requirements,\u201d by \nproviding fair warning to the defendants and by reasona-\nbly advancing legitimate governmental interests. Id. at \n29a-30a. \nThe Second Circuit nevertheless held the PSJVTA \nunconstitutional on its face. In the court\u2019s view, under the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, a defendant\u2019s \nconsent to jurisdiction must be based on a \u201creciprocal bar-\ngain\u201d with the government or else must derive from \u201cliti-\ngation-related conduct.\u201d Id. at 24a-26a. The court also \nheld that the PLO and PA\u2019s permission to be present in \nthe United States and to engage in activities here does not \ncount as a constitutionally cognizable \u201cbenefit\u201d because \ntheir consent-manifesting conduct was \u201cprohibited\u201d by \nlaw. Id. at 28a. \n\n13 \n \nb. Plaintiffs and the United States sought rehearing \nen banc. The Second Circuit denied the petitions. Id. at \n208a. Judge Menashi dissented, joined in full or part by \nChief Judge Livingston and Judges Sullivan and Park. Id. \nat\u2009229a-267a. In Judge Menashi\u2019s view, \u201c[t]he panel\u2019s de-\ncision lacks a basis in the Constitution and cannot be rec-\nonciled with Supreme Court precedent on personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d Id. at 230a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  The PSJVTA satisfies Fifth Amendment stand-\nards. \nA. As the Fifth Amendment was understood when \nratified, the guarantee of \u201cdue process of law\u201d did not pro-\nhibit the adjudication of conduct arising outside U.S. ter-\nritory. Cases arising outside the United States were com-\nmon in the Revolutionary Era, and Article III was framed \nby lawyers and judges who had been deeply involved in \nmany such cases. The Constitution expressly permits the \nadjudication of extraterritorial cases, and the Framers \nexplained that congruence between the reach of the legis-\nlative and judicial powers was intentional. The First Con-\ngress authorized extraterritorial jurisdiction in the Judi-\nciary Act of 1789 and the Crimes Act of 1790. \nWhen the Due Process Clause was ratified, no one un-\nderstood it to disturb prior practice. Although scholars \nhave adopted different views about its original meaning, \nno evidence suggests that anyone in 1791 thought the \nClause would limit adjudication of extraterritorial con-\nduct.  \nB.  The PSJVTA also satisfies Fifth Amendment due \nprocess standards under this Court\u2019s precedents. In the \nyears following ratification, the Court repeatedly con-\nfirmed that the judicial power of the United States ex-\ntends to cases involving conduct occurring outside the Na-\ntion\u2019s borders. Jurisdictional limits did exist, but they \n\n14 \n \nwere supplied by the law of nations, which Congress could \noverride by a clear command. \nOver time, this Court came to impose territorial limits \non the States under the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment. But even as it did so, the Court con-\ntinued to approve adjudication of federal cases arising ex-\ntraterritorially. Because the PSJVTA reflects express \ncongressional authorization to adjudicate disputes under \nU.S. law based on extraterritorial conduct, and because it \nis not arbitrary or fundamentally unfair, it does not run \nafoul of this Court\u2019s precedents applying the Fifth \nAmendment. \nC.  The Second Circuit held that personal jurisdiction \nin civil cases under the Fifth Amendment is governed by \nrules developed under the Fourteenth Amendment. But \nthose rules serve interstate federalism, preventing a \nState from infringing other States\u2019 sovereignty by adjudi-\ncating disputes with little connection to the forum. Such \nconcerns do not apply to the Federal Government. \nThe Second Circuit also erred by imposing a stricter \nstandard for civil cases than for criminal ones. Federal \ncases\u2014whether civil or criminal\u2014should be governed by \na single Fifth Amendment standard. It makes no sense to \nallow federal courts to impose criminal penalties (impris-\nonment or death) but not civil penalties (money damages) \nfor the same extraterritorial conduct. \nII.  Even if Fourteenth Amendment standards ap-\nplied, the PSJVTA would satisfy them. \nA.  In Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 \nU.S. 122 (2023), this Court upheld Pennsylvania\u2019s con-\nsent-to-jurisdiction statute against a Fourteenth Amend-\nment challenge. The Second Circuit attempted to distin-\nguish Mallory on the theory that the defendant there re-\nceived a \u201creciprocal bargain\u201d from Pennsylvania, but the \ndecision did not rest on that ground. Rather, the Court \n\n15 \n \nexplained that accepting an in-state benefit with jurisdic-\ntional strings attached was merely one means of construc-\ntively consenting to personal jurisdiction; another is by \nengaging in conduct specified by law as constituting sub-\nmission to jurisdiction, as happened here. This case fol-\nlows a fortiori from Mallory, because the Federal Gov-\nernment has a vital interest in the adjudication of anti-ter-\nrorism cases involving American victims. In contrast, as \nthe Pennsylvania Supreme Court observed, the statute in \nMallory advanced no legitimate state interest. \nB.  The PLO and PA\u2019s consent was knowing and vol-\nuntary, because they had fair warning of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction, which they engaged in \nvolitionally. The PSJVTA also meets the traditional due \nprocess standard of reasonableness within the context of \nour federal system. \nC.  Even if the Second Circuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal bargains\u201d \ntest were valid, it would be satisfied here. The PLO and \nPA have received a \u201cbenefit\u201d from the United States by \nexercising \u201cthe privilege of residing and conducting busi-\nness in the United States\u2014not to mention furthering \ntheir political goals at the expense of American lives.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u2009231a (Menashi, J., dissenting). Their U.S. activ-\nities include notarizing documents for official use in their \nhome territories, posting on U.S.-based social media plat-\nforms to raise public awareness and bring attention to \ntheir cause, and meeting with local groups to encourage \nthem to lobby Congress to support that cause. \nThe Second Circuit denied the relevance of those U.S. \nactivities on the ground that they were all unlawful. That \nassertion is legally incorrect: The PLO and PA are not le-\ngally barred from conducting any activities in the United \nStates. The court\u2019s reasoning is also illogical: Someone \nwho conducts illegal activities in the forum obviously ex-\ntracts a benefit from the forum. A contrary rule would \n\n16 \n \nperversely give law-breakers due process protections un-\navailable to law-abiding persons. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE PSJVTA SATISFIES FIFTH AMENDMENT STANDARDS \nAt the Founding, the federal Judiciary\u2019s power to ad-\njudicate disputes was understood to be coextensive with \nCongress\u2019s power to legislate\u2014which included matters \narising abroad. Indeed, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause was not seen as a constraint on congressional \npower over personal jurisdiction at all: \u201cIf Congress \nwanted to exercise exorbitant [personal] jurisdiction \u2026 a \nfederal court \u2018would certainly be bound to follow it, and \nproceed upon the law.\u2019\u201d Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited \nJurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, \n1706 (2020) (quoting Picquet, 19 F. Cas. at 615) (Sachs). \nThe decision below, by subjecting Congress to the \nsame jurisdictional limitations that apply to the States, \nimproperly \u201ctakes the Fourteenth Amendment as given, \nand remakes the Fifth Amendment in its image.\u201d Id. at \n1705. Such \u201creverse incorporation\u201d of Fourteenth Amend-\nment standards into the Fifth Amendment is contrary to \nthis Court\u2019s precedents. Although the Court has long re-\nstricted the States\u2019 jurisdiction over disputes arising out-\nside their boundaries, it has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial cases to go forward in the federal courts, ex-\nplaining that such cases lie within Congress\u2019s power to au-\nthorize. Accepting the Second Circuit\u2019s reasoning would \nresult in an upside-down regime in which unrecognized \nforeign governments enjoy due process protection una-\nvailable to States of the Union, and defendants in civil \ncases enjoy greater due process protections than defend-\nants in criminal cases arising out of the exact same con-\nduct. \n\n17 \n \nA. The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Original Public Meaning \nImposed No Limit On Personal Jurisdiction \nThe Constitution expressly authorizes adjudication of \ncases arising from extraterritorial conduct. This power \nwas an intentional feature of the constitutional plan, re-\nflecting common practice during the Revolutionary Era, \nincluding in cases tried and adjudicated by the Framers \nthemselves. Ratification of the Due Process Clause did \nnot alter that feature. To the contrary, the most authori-\ntative interpreters of the Bill of Rights\u2014the First Con-\ngress and this Court\u2014continued the pre-constitutional \npractice of permitting adjudication of claims against for-\neign defendants arising from conduct abroad. \n1. Before The Fifth Amendment, Extraterritorial \nCases Were Permitted \nThe Constitution\u2019s text expressly vests Congress and \nthe Judiciary with extraterritorial powers. Most obvi-\nously, Congress may \u201cdefine and punish Piracies and Fel-\nonies committed on the high Seas, and Offences against \nthe Law of Nations\u201d and \u201cmake Rules concerning Cap-\ntures on Land and Water.\u201d U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7\u20098, Cls. 10, \n11. And what Congress can legislate, the Judiciary can ad-\njudicate: \u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, in \nLaw and Equity, arising under this Constitution, the \nLaws of the United States, and Treaties made \u2026 under \ntheir Authority.\u201d Id. Art. III, \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 1 (emphasis added). \nThe Constitution empowers the Judiciary to adjudicate \ncases arising extraterritorially in other respects, too, in-\ncluding \u201call Cases of admiralty and maritime Jurisdiction,\u201d \nibid., and \u201call Crimes \u2026 not committed within any State,\u201d \nid. \u00a7\u20092, Cl. 3. \nJudicial power commensurate with extraterritorial \nlegislative power was a deliberate feature of the constitu-\ntional plan. At the Philadelphia Convention, leading dele-\ngates explained that judicial power should be coextensive \n\n18 \n \nwith legislative power. For example, James Madison ex-\nplained that \u201c[a]n effective Judiciary establishment com-\nmensurate to the legislative authority, was essential.\u201d 1 \nRecords of the Federal Convention 124 (Max Farrand ed., \n1911) (Farrand). James Wilson agreed: \u201cthe Judicial \nshould be commensurate to the legislative and Executive \nAuthority.\u201d Id. at 237 n.18. In The Federalist, Hamilton \nobserved that \u201c[i]f there are such things as political axi-\noms, the propriety of the judicial power of a government \nbeing co-extensive with its legislative, may be ranked \namong the number.\u201d The Federalist No. 80, at 588 (Ham-\nilton ed. 1864). Madison, Wilson, and other Founders also \nexpressed this view at the ratifying conventions. In Penn-\nsylvania, for instance, Wilson explained that without such \nparity, the Federal Government would be \u201cgive[n] power \nto make laws, and no power to carry them into effect.\u201d 2 \nDebates on the Federal Constitution 469 (Jonathan Elliot, \n2d ed. 1836) (Elliott); see 3 Elliot at 532 (Madison); id. at \n517 (Pendelton in Virginia); 4 Elliot at 156-158 (Davie in \nNorth Carolina). \nPermitting adjudication of cases arising from extra-\nterritorial conduct had a strong antecedent in practice. \nCourts in the newly independent United States adjudi-\ncated thousands of \u201cprize\u201d and \u201ccapture\u201d cases. See \nHenry J. Bourguignon, The First Federal Court: The \nFederal Appellate Prize Court of the American Revolu-\ntion 1775-1787, at 75-77 (1977) (Bourguignon). Such cases \ngenerally arose from extraterritorial events. E.g., \nDarby v. Brig Erstern, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 34, 35 (Fed. Ct. \nApp. 1782); Miller v. The Resolution, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 19, \n20-21 (Fed. Ct. App. 1781). Leading delegates arrived at \nthe Philadelphia Convention with extensive experience as \nlawyers and judges in those very cases. See Deirdre Mask \n& Paul MacMahon, The Revolutionary War Prize Cases \nand the Origins of Diversity Jurisdiction, 63 Buff. L. \nRev. 477 (2015); Bourguignon at 328-329; see also Letter \n\n19 \n \nfrom E. Randolph to J. Madison (Apr. 19, 1782), \nbit.ly/40i7aUC; Letter from J. Madison to E. Randolph \n(May 1, 1782), bit.ly/3DWIY2F. \nAfter ratification, the First Congress exercised its au-\nthority to prescribe extraterritorial jurisdiction. The Ju-\ndiciary Act of 1789 granted the federal courts jurisdiction \nover \u201ccivil causes of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction\u201d \narising \u201cupon the high seas,\u201d and over crimes committed \n\u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 20, \u00a7\u20099, 1 Stat. 76-77. The Crimes \nAct of 1790 similarly authorized prosecution of crimes \ncommitted \u201cupon the high seas.\u201d Ch. 9, \u00a7\u00a7\u20098-13, 1 Stat. \n113-115. This Court has \u201coften looked to laws enacted by \n[the First] Congress as evidence of the original under-\nstanding of the meaning of [the Bill of Rights].\u201d Collins v. \nVirginia, 584 U.S. 586, 613 n.3 (2018) (Alito, J., dissenting) \n(collecting cases). \nLeading Framers confirmed that extraterritorial ju-\nrisdiction was intended. During deliberations on the Judi-\nciary Act, Madison\u2014who earlier that summer had drafted \nand introduced the Bill of Rights\u2014reiterated his view \nthat the judicial power \u201cought to be commensurate with \nthe other branches of the Government.\u201d 1 Annals of Cong. \n843 (Aug. 29, 1789). And the following year, Edmund Ran-\ndolph prepared a report in which he concluded that the \nfederal courts had the exclusive power \u201cto decide all \ncauses arising wholly on the sea, and not within the pre-\ncincts of any county.\u201d Edmund Randolph, Report from the \nAttorney General on the Judiciary System of the United \nStates (Dec. 31, 1790), reprinted in 1 American State Pa-\npers, Miscellaneous 22 (1834).2 \n \n2 Before serving as the first Attorney General, Randolph was a \nmember of the Committee on Detail at the Philadelphia Convention, \nand the \u201cfirst draft\u201d of the Constitution is in his handwriting. See \nWilliam Ewald, The Committee of Detail, 28 Const. Commentary \n197, 220 (2012). \n\n20 \n \n2. The Fifth Amendment Did Not Change The \nJurisdictional Baseline \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s text and history provide no \nindication that it was understood to change the pre-ratifi-\ncation baseline. Indeed, scholarship confirms that no one \nin 1791 understood the Due Process Clause to restrict the \njudicial power of the United States at all, much less to \nlimit federal jurisdiction to the adjudication of cases aris-\ning within the Nation\u2019s borders. Rather, three principal \nschools of thought have emerged about the meaning of the \nwords \u201cdue process of law\u201d\u2014and none of them involves \npersonal jurisdiction. \nOne view of the phrase\u2019s original public meaning was \nthat a deprivation of rights had to be judicial, that is, \n\u201cpreceded by certain procedural protections characteris-\ntic of judicial process.\u201d Nathan S. Chapman & Michael W. \nMcConnell, Due Process as Separation of Powers, 121 \nYale L.J. 1672, 1679 (2012) (Chapman & McConnell); see \nUnited States v. Vaello Madero, 596 U.S. 159, 168 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., concurring); United States v. Arthrex, Inc., \n594 U.S. 1, 36 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). This view \ndraws support from early state practice, most promi-\nnently New York\u2019s 1787 statutory bill of rights and an oft-\ncited speech by Alexander Hamilton, both of which refer-\nence \u201cdue process of law.\u201d See Ryan C. Williams, The One \nand Only Substantive Due Process Clause, 120 Yale L.J. \n408, 441-443 (2010) (Williams); see also id. at 437-445; \nChapman & McConnell at 1703-1717. Consistent with this \nview, this Court in Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & \nImprovement Co., 59 U.S. (18. How.) 272 (1856), held that \nCongress may not deprive a person of property except un-\nder \u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding,\u201d which give \nthe defendant the benefit of a judge (\u201cjudex\u201d), as well as \n\u201cregular allegations, opportunity to answer, and a trial ac-\ncording to some settled course of judicial proceedings.\u201d \nId. at 277, 280. \n\n21 \n \nAn alternative originalist view emphasizes a nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess,\u201d as \u201cwrits or precepts \nduly issued (usually by a court) or arising by operation of \nlaw.\u201d Max Crema & Lawrence B. Solum, The Original \nMeaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amend-\nment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, 462 (2022). Proponents of this \nview note that, in Founding-era legal documents, the nar-\nrower sense of the word \u201cprocess\u201d was much more com-\nmonly used than the broader (though still procedural) \n\u201ccourse of proceedings\u201d sense, which was more often ex-\npressed as \u201cdue course of law.\u201d Id. at 488-508. They also \nsuggest that the records of the ratifying convention of \nNew York\u2014the only State to include the  phrase \u201cdue pro-\ncess\u201d in its proposed amendments\u2014show an evolution of \nthe proposal from \u201cLaw of the Land\u201d to \u201cDue Course of \nLaw\u201d and then to \u201cDue Process of Law.\u201d Id. at 508 & n.257 \n(citation omitted). \nThis Court\u2019s traditional view of the Due Process \nClause has been that it embodies a \u201csubstantive\u201d aspect \n\u201cintended to secure the individual from the arbitrary ex-\nercise of the powers of government.\u201d Albright v. Oliver, \n510 U.S. 266, 272 (1994) (plurality opinion) (quotation \nmarks omitted). This Court has scrutinized federal stat-\nutes under that standard to ensure that they are \u201csup-\nported by a legitimate legislative purpose furthered by ra-\ntional means.\u201d United States v. Carlton, 512 U.S. 26, 30-\n31 (1994); see Chapman v. United States, 500 U.S. 453, \n465 (1991). Under this view, \u201c[t]he party asserting a Fifth \nAmendment due process violation must overcome a pre-\nsumption of constitutionality and establish that the legis-\nlature has acted in an arbitrary and irrational way.\u201d Nat\u2019l \nR.R. Passenger Corp. v. Atchison Topeka & Santa Fe Ry. \nCo., 470 U.S. 451, 472 (1985) (quotation marks omitted). \nScholars debate whether this view took root in American \nlaw before or after ratification of the Fifth Amendment. \nCompare Crema & Solum at 513-518; Williams at 428-454; \n\n22 \n \nChapman & McConnell at 1676 n.5; with Chapman & \nMcConnell at 1676-1677 n.6. \n3. The PSJVTA Does Not Deprive The PLO And \nPA Of Any Due Process Right Recognized At \nThe Founding \nMeasuring the PSJVTA\u2019s constitutionality against \nthe original public meaning of the Fifth Amendment, this \nis an easy case regardless of which view one accepts. \nNothing in the statute interferes with the PLO and PA\u2019s \nability to defend themselves before a court of law applying \n\u201csettled usages and modes of proceeding.\u201d Denezpi v. \nUnited States, 596 U.S. 591, 617 (2022) (Gorsuch, J., dis-\nsenting) (quoting Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. (18 How.) at \n277). The statute does not deprive them of the benefit of \nan independent judge, or of \u201cregular allegations, oppor-\ntunity to answer, and a trial according to some settled \ncourse of judicial proceedings.\u201d Murray\u2019s Lessee, 59 U.S. \n(18 How.) at 280. And in both Fuld and Sokolow, the PLO \nand PA were served with a writ (i.e., a summons) in the \nUnited States, as authorized by 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(a). See \nSokolow\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20092; Fuld\u2009D.\u2009Ct.\u2009Doc.\u20098, 9. \nThis Court\u2019s substantive due process precedents re-\nquire no more. Nothing about the PSJVTA is \u201carbitrary \nand irrational.\u201d Nat\u2019l R.R. Passenger, 470 U.S. at 472 \n(quotation marks omitted). It reasonably advances vital \ninterests of the United States. It disrupts and deters sup-\nport for terrorism, which is \u201can urgent objective of the \nhighest order.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian L. Project, 561 \nU.S. 1, 28 (2010). It advances the protection of U.S. citi-\nzens abroad. See Gamble v. United States, 587 U.S. 678, \n687 (2019) (\u201cspecial protection [abroad] for U.S. nationals \nserves key national interests\u201d). It promotes the Federal \nGovernment\u2019s interest in ensuring \u201cfair compensation for \nAmerican victims of terrorism from those responsible for \ntheir losses.\u201d J.A.\u200968. And it furthers U.S. foreign policy \nobjectives, because the PLO and PA\u2019s pay-for-slay \n\n23 \n \npolicies \u201cthreaten prospects for peace, pushing the chance \nfor a Palestinian state further and further out of reach.\u201d \n163 Cong. Rec. H9650 (daily ed. Dec. 5, 2017) (Rep. En-\ngel). \nB. This Court Has Never Blocked Congress From \nAuthorizing Personal Jurisdiction Over Conduct \nArising Abroad \nIn the years immediately following ratification of the \nFifth Amendment, this Court confirmed that the judicial \npower of the United States extends to cases involving con-\nduct occurring outside the Nation\u2019s borders. Later, even \nas this Court imposed territorial limits on the States un-\nder the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment, it repeatedly rejected the imposition of such limita-\ntions on the Federal Government. \n1. Before The Lochner Era, This Court Never \nStruck Down Any Jurisdictional Statute On \nDue Process Grounds \n\u201cFor the first 150 years of the Republic, today\u2019s con-\nventional view of personal jurisdiction wasn\u2019t so conven-\ntional\u2026. Jurisdictional limits have always been with us, \nbut Fifth Amendment limits are a recent innovation.\u201d \nSachs at 1706, 1708. \nOriginally, extraterritorial jurisdiction was governed \nby the law of nations, which included rules for determin-\ning the circumstances under which \u201cone state\u2019s judgments \n[should] be received or rejected in another\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. \nat 1718. In some cases, the law of nations permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction. In Penhallow v. Doane\u2019s Admin-\nistrators, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 54 (1795), this Court enforced \nresolutions adopted by the Continental Congress provid-\ning for trials and appeals in cases of the capture of enemy \nships on the high seas. Id. at 80-81 (opinion of Patterson, \nJ.). The power to provide for adjudication in such cases, \nthe Court explained, was an incident of the Nation\u2019s \n\n24 \n \ninherent \u201cexternal sovereignty.\u201d Id. at 91 (opinion of Ire-\ndell, J.). And in Talbot v. Janson, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 133 \n(1795), the Court unanimously affirmed the exercise of ju-\nrisdiction over a civil claim for damages arising out of an \nincident on the high seas. As Justice Iredell explained, \n\u201ctrespasses committed against the general law of nations, \nare enquirable, and may be proceeded against, in any na-\ntion where no special exemption can be maintained, either \nby the general law of nations, or by some treaty which for-\nbids or restrains it.\u201d Id. at 159-160.3 Thus, the availability \nof extraterritorial jurisdiction ordinarily followed back-\nground legal principles established under the law of na-\ntions. \nHowever, Congress could override the law of nations \nby a clear command. See Murray v. Schooner Charming \nBetsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804). Thus Justice \nWashington explained that federal courts had no \u201cgen-\neral\u201d authority \u201cto issue process into another district, ex-\ncept in cases where such authority has been specially be-\nstowed, by some law of the United States.\u201d Ex parte Gra-\nham, 10 F. Cas. at 912 (emphasis added). If it was \u201cthe will \nof congress to vest in the courts of the United States an \nextra-territorial jurisdiction in prize causes, over persons \nand things found in a district other than that from which \nthe process issued,\u201d then the courts would be bound to fol-\nlow Congress\u2019s instruction. Id. at 913; see ibid. (\u201cthe ex-\nercise of jurisdiction over persons not inhabitants of, or \nfound within the district where the suit is brought\u201d pre-\nsents \u201cdifficulties, which, in the opinion of the court, noth-\ning but an act of congress can remove\u201d). \n \n3 Of the seven members of the Court who participated in one or \nboth of these cases, four (Rutledge, Wilson, Blair, and Patterson) \nserved as delegates at the Philadelphia Convention. 1 Farrand 1-2. \nThe other three served in their respective States\u2019 ratifying conven-\ntions. 2 Elliott 178 (Cushing); id.at 206 (Jay); 4 Elliott 1 (Iredell). \n\n25 \n \nUnder federal legislation, exercising jurisdiction in \ncases arising outside of U.S. territory became established \npractice. \u201cThe prosecution and punishment of extraterri-\ntorial crimes, including crimes committed by aliens, was \none of the federal government\u2019s top priorities\u201d in the dec-\nades following ratification, and \u201cthe federal government \nprincipally used two enforcement mechanisms\u2014punish-\nment after criminal trial, and civil forfeiture after a con-\ndemnation by a federal court sitting in admiralty.\u201d Na-\nthan S. Chapman, Due Process Abroad, 112 Nw. U. L. \nRev. 377, 409 (2017) (Chapman). \u201cAmericans appeared to \nbelieve that both enforcement mechanisms were con-\nsistent with due process of law.\u201d Id. at 410. Treatises of \nthe era similarly confirm that the federal courts could \nproperly exercise jurisdiction over extraterritorial con-\nduct. See, e.g., 1 James Kent, Commentaries on Ameri-\ncan Law 186 (6th ed. 1826) (\u201cIt is of no importance, for the \npurpose of giving jurisdiction, on whom or where a pirat-\nical offence has been committed.\u201d). \nPerhaps the clearest articulation of Congress\u2019s power \nto create jurisdiction over foreign conduct\u2014even in the \nface of general principles of the law of nations to the con-\ntrary\u2014is Picquet v. Swan. There, Justice Story explained \nthat Congress could enact a law providing that \u201ca subject \nof England, or France, or Russia, having a controversy \nwith one of our own citizens, may be summoned from the \nother end of the globe to obey our process, and submit to \nthe judgment of our courts.\u201d 19 F.\u2009Cas. at 613. And though \nsuch a law might be \u201crepugnant to the general rights and \nsovereignty of other nations,\u201d yet \u201c[i]f congress had pre-\nscribed such a rule, the court would certainly be bound to \nfollow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at 613, 615.  \nThis Court endorsed Picquet\u2019s reasoning in Toland v. \nSprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300 (1838), explaining that \u201cpos-\nitive legislation\u201d would be necessary to authorize federal \ncourts to hear cases involving \u201cpersons in a foreign \n\n26 \n \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 330. And in The Marianna Flora, 24 \nU.S. (11 Wheat.) 1 (1826) (Story, J.), the Court held that \neven though, as a general matter, \u201cforeign ships are not \nto be governed by our municipal regulations,\u201d still Con-\ngress could direct that a ship captured on the high seas be \nbrought to the United States for adjudication \u201cin our \nCourts.\u201d Id. at 18. \u201c[W]hatever may be the responsibility \nincurred by the nation to foreign powers, in executing \nsuch laws,\u201d the Court explained, \u201cthere can be no doubt \nthat Courts of justice are bound to obey and administer \nthem.\u201d Ibid.; see ibid. (\u201c[T]he act of Congress is decisive \non this subject.\u201d).4 \nCongress also had the power to override the law of \nnations with respect to a State\u2019s recognition of \u201cforeign\u201d \n(i.e., out-of-state) judgments. In D\u2019Arcy v. Ketchum, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) 165 (1851), this Court noted Congress\u2019s \nauthority to \u201calter[] the rule\u201d regarding when the judg-\nments of one State\u2019s courts must be recognized by those \nof another. Id. at 174-175. There, a 1790 law required the \nStates to afford \u201cfaith and credit\u201d to the judicial proceed-\nings of other States. Ibid.; see Act of May 26, 1790, ch. 11, \n1 Stat. 122, codified as amended, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20091738 (2012). \nThe question was whether that law required recognition \nof a judgment even \u201cwhen the defendant had not been \nserved with process or voluntarily made defence,\u201d despite \nthe fact that such a proceeding would violate \u201cthe interna-\ntional law as it existed among the States in 1790.\u201d D\u2019Arcy, \n52 U.S. (11 How.) at 176. The Court ultimately concluded \n \n4 See also United States v. Palmer, 16 U.S. (3 Wheat.) 610, 631 \n(1818) (\u201cThe constitution having conferred on congress the power of \ndefining and punishing piracy, there can be no doubt of the right of \nthe legislature to enact laws punishing pirates, although they may \nbe foreigners, and may have committed no particular offence \nagainst the United States.\u201d); United States v. Smith, 18 U.S. (5 \nWheat.) 153, 158-160 (1820) (broadly construing the constitutional \ngrant to Congress). \n\n27 \n \nthat \u201cCongress did not intend to overthrow the old rule by \nthe enactment,\u201d but the Court did not question\u2014indeed, \nit presumed\u2014that Congress had authority \u201cto declare a \nnew rule.\u201d Ibid. \nIn sum, the exercise of extraterritorial jurisdiction \nwas understood to be proper if it comported with the law \nof nations or if Congress so provided. No case went the \nother way: \u201c[N]ot until the Civil War did a single court, \nstate or federal, hold a personal-jurisdiction statute inva-\nlid on due process grounds.\u201d Sachs at 1712; accord Chap-\nman at 442. \n2. After This Court Began Restricting State Power \nUnder The Fourteenth Amendment, It Rejected \nAnalogous Restrictions Under The Fifth \nTerritorial restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction emerged during the Lochner era, when this \nCourt began invoking due process to restrict state author-\nity to adjudicate cases involving conduct occurring in \nother States. See, e.g., Baker v. Baker, Eccles & Co., 242 \nU.S. 394, 403 (1917); Riverside & Dan River Cotton Mills \nv. Menefee, 237 U.S. 189, 194-195 (1915); see generally \nStephen E. Sachs, Pennoyer Was Right, 95 Tex. L. Rev. \n1249, 1252 (2017); Patrick J. Borchers, The Death of the \nConstitutional Law of Personal Jurisdiction: From Pen-\nnoyer to Burnham and Back Again, 24 U.C. Davis L. Rev. \n19, 43-51 (1990). These decisions were grounded in con-\ncerns about the division of power among the States, and \nin particular the impermissibility of \u201cattempt[ing] to ex-\ntend the authority and control of a state beyond its own \nterritory.\u201d Baker, 242 U.S. at 403. \nDuring the same era, however, this Court repeatedly \nreaffirmed that the Fifth Amendment affords \u201cno ground \nfor constructing an imaginary constitutional barrier \naround the exterior confines of the United States for the \npurposes of shutting [the federal] government off from \n\n28 \n \nthe exertion of powers which inherently belong to it by \nvirtue of its sovereignty.\u201d United States v. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. 299, 306 (1914) (emphasis added); see Burnet v. \nBrooks, 288 U.S. 378, 403-405 (1933) (same); Cook v. Tait, \n265 U.S. 47, 55-56 (1924) (same). \u201c[T]he limitations of the \nConstitution are barriers bordering the states and pre-\nventing them from transcending the limits of their author-\nity, and thus destroying the rights of other states,\u201d the \nCourt explained, but such interstate-federalism concerns \nhave no application to the national sovereign. Bennett, 232 \nU.S. at 306.5 \nFollowing its pathmarking decision in International \nShoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), this Court \nhas continued to restrict state-court personal jurisdiction \nas \u201ca consequence of territorial limitations on the power \nof the respective States.\u201d Hanson v. Denckla, 357 U.S. \n235, 251 (1958). Yet the Court has been careful to make \nclear it was not holding that \u201cthe Fifth Amendment im-\nposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction by a federal court.\u201d Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017). Moreover, \nthe Court has consistently expressed an expansive view \nabout the territorial competence of the national govern-\nment: \u201cIf Congress has provided an unmistakable instruc-\ntion that the provision is extraterritorial, then claims al-\nleging exclusively foreign conduct may proceed,\u201d Abitron \nAustria GmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 \n \n5 In admiralty cases, which raise no interstate-federalism con-\ncerns, the Court continued to apply the longstanding rule that \u201cthe \nbare circumstance of where the cause of action arose [has not] been \ntreated as determinative of the power of the court to exercise dis-\ncretion whether to take jurisdiction.\u201d Canada Malting Co. v. Pat-\nterson S.S., 285 U.S. 413, 422 (1932); Charter Shipping Co. v. \nBowring, Jones & Tidy, 281 U.S. 515, 517 (1930); Panama R.R. Co. \nv. Napier Shipping Co., 166 U.S. 280, 285 (1897); The Belgenland, \n114 U.S. 355, 358-359 (1885). \n\n29 \n \n(2023), a principle that remains true \u201cregardless of \nwhether the particular statute regulates conduct, affords \nrelief, or merely confers jurisdiction,\u201d RJR Nabisco, Inc. \nv. Eur. Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 326 (2016). \nIn sum, this Court has consistently permitted extra-\nterritorial jurisdiction where Congress so provides and \nhas consistently declined to extend Fourteenth Amend-\nment limits to the Federal Government. The PSJVTA fits \ncomfortably within its precedents. \nC. The Second Circuit\u2019s Reasoning Was Unsound \nThe Second Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018due process analy-\nsis\u2019 in the personal jurisdiction context \u2018is basically the \nsame under both the Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nments,\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u20097a (quoting Pet.\u2009App.\u2009156a), and that \n\u201cthe [Fifth Amendment] due process test for asserting ju-\nrisdiction over extraterritorial criminal conduct \u2026 differs \nfrom the test applicable in this civil case,\u201d id. at 175a (em-\nphasis added; citation omitted). The court accordingly re-\nfused to apply to the PSJVTA \u201cthe broader [i.e., less-re-\nstrictive] Fifth Amendment standard used for personal \njurisdiction in criminal cases.\u201d Id. at 49a. \nThat reasoning was doubly unsound. Federal cases \nare not governed by the Fourteenth Amendment stand-\nard, which protects interstate federalism. Instead, federal \ncases\u2014not only criminal cases but also civil cases\u2014are \ngoverned by a single Fifth Amendment standard. \n1. The Second Circuit\u2019s Conflation Of Fifth And \nFourteenth Amendment Standards Disregards \nInterstate Federalism \nPrinciples of interstate federalism limit a State\u2019s as-\nsertion of personal jurisdiction \u201cto ensure that States with \n\u2018little legitimate interest\u2019 in a suit do not encroach on \nStates more affected by the controversy.\u201d Ford Motor Co. \nv. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 360 (2021) \n(quoting Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263). Thus, in \n\n30 \n \nWorld-Wide Volkswagen, the Court explained that such \nrestrictions \u201censure that the States, through their courts, \ndo not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them by \ntheir status as coequal sovereigns in a federal system\u201d and \nheld that \u201cthe Due Process Clause, acting as an instru-\nment of interstate federalism, may \u2026 divest the State of \nits power to render a valid judgment.\u201d 444 U.S. at 292, 294. \nThe Court has emphasized that allowing a State to assert \njurisdiction \u201cin an inappropriate case \u2026 would upset the \nfederal balance, which posits that each State has a sover-\neignty that is not subject to unlawful intrusion by other \nStates.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. \n873, 884 (2011) (plurality opinion). And the Court has re-\niterated that \u201c[t]he sovereignty of each State implies a \nlimitation on the sovereignty of all its sister States,\u201d and \ninsofar as personal jurisdiction is concerned, \u201cthis feder-\nalism interest may be decisive.\u201d Bristol-Myers, 582 U.S. \nat 263 (cleaned up). \nThis case is different. It concerns federal claims re-\ngarding attacks on American nationals that must be adju-\ndicated in federal court under federal law. Congress cre-\nated these claims to further federal interests in national \nsecurity and foreign affairs. The Constitution allocates \npower over such matters exclusively to the national gov-\nernment. See Arizona v. United States, 567 U.S. 387, 395 \n(2012). \u201cPower over external affairs is not shared by the \nStates,\u201d but instead \u201cis vested in the national government \nexclusively.\u201d United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203, 233 \n(1942); see Wendy Perdue, Aliens, the Internet, and \n\u201cPurposeful Availment,\u201d: A Reassessment of Fifth \nAmendment Limits On Personal Jurisdiction, 98 Nw. U. \nL. Rev. 455, 461 (2004) (\u201cStates are situated within the \nUnited States quite differently than is the United States \nwithin the international community.\u201d). \nWhereas federalism limitations on the individual \nStates inhere in the \u201cconstitutional plan,\u201d a \u201cforeign State \n\n31 \n \nlies outside the structure of the Union.\u201d Principality of \nMonaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 (1934). The Con-\nstitution limits each State\u2019s extraterritorial regulatory \npowers because they necessarily conflict with the regula-\ntory interests of other States. See Healy v. Beer Inst., \nInc., 491 U.S. 324, 336 (1989). In contrast, \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d EEOC v. Arabian Am. \nOil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991); see Gamble, 587 U.S. at \n687 (\u201c[M]urder of a U.S. national is an offense to the \nUnited States as much as it is to the country where the \nmurder occurred.\u201d). \nThe foreign-relations context here highlights the im-\nprudence of imposing interstate-federalism limitations on \nCongress. Congress\u2019s judgments in the foreign-relations \ncontext merit \u201cspecial respect\u201d because they involve \u201ca \nbalance that it is the prerogative of the political branches \nto make.\u201d Jesner v. Arab Bank PLC, 584 U.S. 241, 273 \n(2018). \u201cCongress has the undisputed power to decide, as \na matter of federal law, whether and under what circum-\nstances foreign nations should be amenable to suit in the \nUnited States,\u201d Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nige-\nria, 461 U.S. 480, 493 (1983), and the Court should be re-\nluctant to strip Congress of that power when it comes to \nnon-sovereign governments. The PLO and PA are foreign \npolitical entities that aspire to international statehood; as \nsuch, their amenability to suit in federal court should lie \nsolely in the hands of the political branches, not the Judi-\nciary. As the Office of Legal Counsel put it, \u201c[b]ecause the \nPLO purports to be an independent sovereign entity, we \nhave little difficulty concluding that it falls into [the] cate-\ngory\u201d of entities that \u201cexist outside the constitutional \ncompact and have no rights or responsibilities under it.\u201d \nConstitutionality of Closing the Palestine Information \nOffice, an Affiliate of the Palestine Liberation Organiza-\ntion, 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 105 (1987). \n\n32 \n \nThe Second Circuit got this backwards, holding that \nthe PLO and PA have due process rights because they are \nnot \u201crecognized by the United States as a sovereign \nstate.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200994a, 153a. According to the court, allow-\ning the political branches to subject the PLO and PA to \nsuit would infringe their \u201cfundamental rights.\u201d Id. at 30a \nn.11. Judge Menashi explained why this was wrong: \n[F]oreign states are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to rights \nunder the Due Process Clause. So if tomorrow the \nDepartment of State recognized the PA as the sover-\neign government of \u201cPalestine\u201d\u2014as the defendants \nbelieve it is\u2014then there would be no question at all \nthat the PSJVTA is constitutional and that the Due \nProcess Clause is not implicated. Fundamental con-\nstitutional rights are not typically so contingent. \nId. at 238a (citation omitted). \n2. The Second Circuit Incorrectly Applied A \nStricter Standard To Civil Cases Than To \nCriminal Cases \nThe Second Circuit acknowledged that the PSJVTA \nsatisfies \u201cbasic principles of due process.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200930a. \nIt also acknowledged that, in the context of criminal pros-\necutions against foreign defendants, the Fifth Amend-\nment permits the exercise of jurisdiction over a defendant \nwho harms American nationals or interests abroad. See \nUnited States v. Epskamp, 832 F.3d 154, 168 (2d Cir. \n2016).6 The court nevertheless held that, in the context of \na civil dispute, Congress must do more than merely sat-\nisfy these \u201cminimum due process requirements.\u201d \n \n6 Every Circuit to have considered the issue agrees. See United \nStates v. Murillo, 826 F.3d 152, 156-157 (4th Cir. 2016); United \nStates v. Rafoi, 60 F.4th 982, 995 (5th Cir. 2023); United States v. \nIossifov, 45 F.4th 899, 914 (6th Cir. 2022); United States v. Perlaza, \n439 F.3d 1149, 1162 (9th Cir. 2006). \n\n33 \n \nPet.\u2009App.\u200930a. The Second Circuit\u2019s position is thus that \nthe United States may imprison or impose the death pen-\nalty on a foreign person for extraterritorial conduct, but it \ncrosses a red line for the United States to allow a civil \nclaim for money damages against the same person for the \nsame conduct. \nThat makes no sense. As Judge Elrod put it in a case \nconcerning the same issue: \u201cIt is nonsense on stilts to hold \nthat allowing a civil lawsuit against a foreign defendant \nfor foreign conduct violates due process but that a crimi-\nnal prosecution against the same defendant for the same \nforeign conduct does not.\u201d Douglass v. Nippon Yusen Ka-\nbushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 270 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) \n(dissenting). \nOutside the context of personal jurisdiction, this \nCourt has sometimes required a stricter due process \nstandard in criminal cases than in civil cases. See, e.g., \nTurner v. Rogers, 564 U.S. 431, 442 (2011); Addington v. \nTexas, 441 U.S. 418, 429-432 (1979). But it has never sug-\ngested that the inverse should be true: that a stricter \nstandard applies in civil cases than in criminal cases. It \nwould be incongruous to make it harder to deprive a de-\nfendant of property in a civil case than to deprive a de-\nfendant of liberty (or even life) in a criminal case arising \nout of the same facts. Nothing in the Fifth Amendment\u2014\nwhich contains only a single Due Process Clause, applica-\nble to civil and criminal cases alike\u2014supports such a rule. \nII. THE \nPSJVTA \nWOULD \nSATISFY \nFOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT STANDARDS \nEven if the Court were to import Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process standards for the exercise of personal \njurisdiction in civil cases into the Fifth Amendment, the \nPSJVTA easily satisfies those standards. That conclusion \nfollows a fortiori from Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Rail-\nway Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), which upheld a State\u2019s \n\n34 \n \nauthority to deem registration to do business in the state \nas signifying consent to be sued there. The United States \nmay likewise deem the PLO and PA\u2019s payments to terror-\nists who murdered or maimed U.S. nationals and U.S. ac-\ntivities as signifying their consent to suit in federal anti-\nterrorism cases involving U.S. victims. \nLike the statute in Mallory, the PSJVTA provided \nthe PLO and PA with advance notice of the conduct that \nwould subject them to jurisdiction in United States courts. \nMoreover, the PSJVTA unquestionably serves legitimate \ngovernmental interests\u2014which the statute in Mallory did \nnot.  \nEven if this Court were to adopt the Second Circuit\u2019s \nnew rule that consent to suit must be part of a \u201creciprocal \nbargain\u201d in order to be valid, the PSJVTA would pass that \ntest too: The PLO and PA obtain valuable benefits from \nengaging in activities within the United States. \nA. This Is A Stronger Case For Jurisdiction Than \nMallory \nFor more than a century and a half\u2014and as recently \nas two Terms ago\u2014this Court has consistently held that \na State has the right to deem specified conduct as consti-\ntuting consent to personal jurisdiction, including by treat-\ning presence as consent to be sued there. The United \nStates, as the national sovereign, is at least equally enti-\ntled to treat specified conduct, including entry into its ter-\nritory, as consent to suit on federal claims in federal \ncourts. \n1. \u201cBoth at the time of the founding and the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s adoption, the Anglo-American legal \ntradition recognized that a tribunal\u2019s competence was \ngenerally constrained only by the \u2018territorial limits\u2019 of the \nsovereign that created it.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 128 (plu-\nrality opinion) (quoting Joseph Story, Commentaries on \nthe Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u2009539, pp. 450-451 (1834)). As a result, \n\n35 \n \n\u201can in personam suit \u2026 could be maintained by anyone on \nany claim in any place \u2026 \u2018wherever the [defendant] may \nbe found.\u2019\u201d Id. at 128-129 (quoting Massie v. Watts, 10 \nU.S. (6 Cranch) 148, 158 (1810)). Even a defendant\u2019s tran-\nsitory presence within the jurisdiction sufficed upon ser-\nvice of process there. See Burnham v. Superior Ct. of \nCal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990). \n\u201cAs the use of the corporate form proliferated in the \n19th century, the question arose how to adapt the tradi-\ntional rule about transitory actions for individuals to arti-\nficial persons created by law.\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 129. \nIn many States, the answer was to treat an artificial en-\ntity\u2019s presence within the State as constructive consent to \nbe sued there. Id. at 129-130. While many of those statutes \nlimited such consent to suits \u201cby in-state plaintiffs,\u201d oth-\ners required foreign entities \u201cto defend themselves there \nagainst any manner of suit.\u201d Id. at 130. \nThis Court consistently upheld such statutes against \ndue process challenges. In St. Clair v. Cox, 106 U.S. 350 \n(1882), for instance, the Court upheld a Michigan statute \nthat implied consent to service of process\u2014and thus to \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014\u201cas a condition upon which a for-\neign corporation shall be permitted to do business within \nher limits.\u201d Id. at 356. So long as the state\u2019s jurisdictional \ninterest was \u201creasonable\u201d and the defendant had actual \n\u201cnotice of [the] suit,\u201d due process imposed no barrier. \nIbid. And in Pennsylvania Fire Insurance Co. v. Gold Is-\nsue Mining Co., 243 U.S. 93 (1917), the Court held that \nMissouri, by construing its consent-to-jurisdiction statute \nas permitting general jurisdiction upon the (required) ap-\npointment of the superintendent of insurance to receive \nprocess, \u201cdid not deprive the defendant of due process of \nlaw even if it took the defendant by surprise.\u201d Id. at 95. \n2. This Court recently confirmed the continuing vital-\nity of consent-to-jurisdiction statutes in Mallory. There, a \nVirginia-headquartered railroad corporation registered \n\n36 \n \nwith the Pennsylvania Department of State as a condition \nof doing business within the State. See 15 Pa. Cons. Stat. \n\u00a7\u2009411(a). Under a separate statute, such \u201cqualification as \na foreign corporation\u201d was deemed consent to appear in \nthe courts of the State on \u201cany cause of action.\u201d \n42 Pa. Cons. Stat. \u00a7\u20095301(a)(2)(i), (b). Based on such \ndeemed consent, a former employee sued the railroad in \nPennsylvania for injuries stemming from activities in Vir-\nginia and Ohio. \nThis Court held that the railroad\u2019s consent was a valid \nbasis for suit under the Fourteenth Amendment. Writing \nfor a four-Justice plurality, Justice Gorsuch explained \nthat the railroad had \u201cagreed to be found in Pennsylvania \nand answer any suit there,\u201d even if its contacts with the \nState did not support general or specific jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 135. Such consent was sufficient, he explained, be-\ncause \u201cpersonal jurisdiction is a personal defense that \nmay be waived or forfeited.\u201d Id. at 144. And waiver may \noccur by operation of law, just as readily as by any express \nstatement: Business-registration statutes are among the \n\u201c\u2018variety of legal arrangements [that] have been taken to \nrepresent express or implied consent\u2019 to personal jurisdic-\ntion consistent with due process.\u201d Id. at 136 n.5 (quoting \nInsurance Corp. of Ireland v. Compagnie des Bauxites de \nGuinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703-704 (1982)) (cleaned up). \nJustice Alito agreed on this point to form a majority. \n\u201cConsent is a separate basis for personal jurisdiction,\u201d he \nexplained, and the railroad \u201chad clear notice that Penn-\nsylvania considered its registration as consent to general \njurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 153. Justice Alito nevertheless ex-\npressed doubt that \u201cthe Constitution permits a State to \nimpose such a submission-to-jurisdiction requirement.\u201d \nId. at 150. That kind of state law, he explained, creates \nserious tensions with \u201cthe very nature of the federal sys-\ntem that the Constitution created and in numerous provi-\nsions that bear on States\u2019 interactions with one another.\u201d \n\n37 \n \nId. at 154. However, Justice Alito concluded that limits \nimposed by interstate federalism would be better seated \nsomewhere other than the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause. Id. at 150. \nMallory controls here. Like the Pennsylvania statute \nat issue there, the PSJVTA clearly specifies in advance, \nand gives fair warning of, the conduct by which \u201ca defend-\nant shall be deemed to have consented to personal juris-\ndiction.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(1).  \nIndeed, in important respects, this is a far easier case \nthan Mallory. There, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court \nheld that the State had \u201cno legitimate interest in a contro-\nversy with no connection to the Commonwealth that was \nfiled by a non-resident against a foreign corporation that \nis not at home here.\u201d Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 266 \nA.3d 542, 567 (Pa. 2021). Here, by contrast, the PSJVTA \napplies only to cases involving terrorism against Ameri-\ncan victims and their families, a topic of preeminent fed-\neral concern. Moreover, unlike Pennsylvania\u2019s business-\nregistration statute, which required a foreign corporation \nto submit to general jurisdiction\u2014including in suits under \nnon-Pennsylvania causes of action\u2014the PSJVTA applies \nonly to a single category of federal cases. And whereas \nPennsylvania\u2019s practical and legal right to exclude from \nthe State a railroad engaged in interstate commerce was \nsuspect, the United States undoubtedly has authority to \nexclude the PLO and PA from its territory. \n3. The Second Circuit read Mallory as being limited \nto circumstances where the defendant \u201caccepted a gov-\nernment benefit from the forum, in return for which the \ndefendant [was] required to submit itself to suit in the fo-\nrum.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200923a-24a. According to the court, consent-\n\n38 \n \nto-jurisdiction statutes must be based on \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d to pass constitutional muster. Id. at 24a.7 \nThis reciprocal-bargains theory was novel. As Judge \nMenashi explained, the Second Circuit simply \u201cinvented a \nnew requirement that applies when Congress or a state \nlegislature attempts to extend personal jurisdiction \nthrough a deemed-consent statute.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009240a-241a \nn.11. \u201cAlthough there are cases holding that a defendant\u2019s \nreceipt of a benefit can be deemed to be consent,\u201d there \ndoes not appear to be \u201cany case holding that such receipt \nof a benefit is a necessary condition.\u201d Id. at 123a n.10 \n(Furman, J.) (citations omitted; emphasis added). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 reciprocal-bargain test reflects \na basic logic error. While \u201caccepting an in-state benefit \nwith jurisdictional strings attached\u201d is one way for a state \nto provide for consent to personal jurisdiction, Mallory, \n600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion), it is not the only way. \nTo the contrary, even a \u201ctrivial thing\u201d like taking \u201cone \nstep\u201d across an \u201cinvisible state line\u201d can lead to \u201cjurisdic-\ntional consequences [that] are immediate and serious.\u201d \nIbid. Or as Justice Jackson explained, a defendant may \nconsent to jurisdiction \u201cmore than one way,\u201d including: \n(1) \u201cexplicitly or implicitly consenting,\u201d by engaging in \nconduct deemed consent under law; (2) by \u201cfail[ing] to fol-\nlow specific procedural rules\u201d; or (3) by \u201cvoluntarily in-\nvoking certain benefits from a State that are conditioned \non submitting to the State\u2019s jurisdiction.\u201d Id. at 147-148. \nThe Second Circuit simply erased the first category. As \nJustice Jackson summarized: \nRegardless of whether a defendant relinquishes its \npersonal-jurisdiction \nrights \nexpressly \nor \n \n7 The court carved out an exception from its government-benefit \nrule for \u201clitigation-related activities,\u201d id. at 22a-24a, but did not ex-\nplain why such activities are sufficient without \u201creciprocal bar-\ngains.\u201d \n\n39 \n \nconstructively, the basic teaching of Insurance Corp. \nof Ireland is the same: When a defendant chooses to \nengage in behavior that \u201camount[s] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u201d the Due Process \nClause poses no barrier to the court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction.\u201d \nId. at 148 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704-705) (brack-\nets in original). \nThe Second Circuit rested its holding on the rationale \nthat the \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d deemed to manifest consent \nto jurisdiction under the PSJVTA is not a sufficiently \nclose \u201cproxy for actual consent.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200938a (emphasis \nadded). That echoes the railroad\u2019s argument in Mallory: \nIt asserted that the statue was a \u201ccoercive assertion of ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d such that its consent was not \u201ctrue consent.\u201d \nResp.\u2009Br. at 3, 7, Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway \nCo., 600 U.S. 122 (2023) (No. 21-1168). The railroad thus \nargued it had \u201cnot really submitted\u201d to jurisdiction. 600 \nU.S. at 144 (plurality opinion). \nThis Court rejected the argument. \u201c[A] legion of \nprecedents \u2026 attach jurisdictional consequences to what \nsome might dismiss as mere formalities.\u201d Id. at 145. \n\u201c[U]nder [those] precedents a variety of \u2018actions of the de-\nfendant\u2019 that may seem like technicalities nonetheless can \n\u2018amount to a legal submission to the jurisdiction of a \ncourt.\u2019 That was so before International Shoe, and it re-\nmains so today.\u201d Id. at 146 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at \n704-705) (citation omitted). Justice Alito agreed: There \nwas no due process violation because the defendant \u201cacted \nwith knowledge of state law when it registered,\u201d such that \nthe Court may \u201cpresume that by registering, it consented \nto all valid conditions imposed by state law.\u201d Id. at 151 \n(cleaned up). \n\n40 \n \nB. The PSJVTA Also Satisfies Traditional Due \nProcess Standards \nThis Court\u2019s rules for personal jurisdiction require \nthat the defendant receive \u201cfair warning\u201d and that \nmaintenance of the suit must be \u201creasonable, in the con-\ntext of our federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, \n592 U.S. at 358 (citations omitted). The PSJVTA easily \nsatisfies both requirements. \n1. The requirement of \u201cfair warning\u201d ensures that \n\u201c[a] defendant can \u2026 structure its primary conduct to \nlessen or avoid exposure to a given State\u2019s courts.\u201d Id. at \n360 (cleaned up). In the context of implied consent, that \nmeans the conduct that will subject the defendant to the \ncourt\u2019s jurisdiction must be \u201cknowing and voluntary.\u201d \nWellness Int\u2019l Network, Ltd. v. Sharif, 575 U.S. 665, 685 \n(2015). Here, the PLO and PA knowingly and voluntarily \nconsented to federal jurisdiction under the PSJVTA. \nTheir consent was knowing because the PSJVTA de-\nscribes, in advance, exactly what actions would be deemed \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in civil cases under the \nATA. Indeed, the PLO and PA received actual notice of \nthe PSJVTA: Before the law took effect, they represented \nto the D.C. Circuit that they \u201cmight never make covered \npayments.\u201d Shatsky v. Palestine Liberation Org., 955 \nF.3d 1016, 1038 (D.C. Cir. 2020). Thus, when they later \nmade pay-for-slay payments, they did so knowing that it \nwould vest U.S. courts with jurisdiction over them. \nTheir conduct was also voluntary. Actions are \u201cvol-\nuntary within the meaning of the Due Process Clause\u201d if \nthey are the product of \u201ca free and unconstrained will.\u201d \nOregon v. Elstad, 470 U.S. 298, 304 (1985) (citation omit-\nted). Conduct is \u201cinvoluntary,\u201d by contrast, only if it arises \nfrom \u201ccoercive activity of the State.\u201d Colorado v. Con-\nnelly, 479 U.S. 157, 165 (1986). \n\n41 \n \nThe PSJVTA gave the PLO and PA a clear and vol-\nuntary choice: either cease engaging in the conduct spec-\nified in the law, or submit to jurisdiction in the United \nStates. That was not coercion. In North Carolina v. Al-\nford, 400 U.S. 25 (1970), a criminal defendant argued that \nhis guilty plea to a murder charge was not \u201cvoluntary,\u201d in \nthe sense required by the Due Process Clause, because \nthe evidence against him presented a serious risk that the \nState would put him to death if he went to trial. Id. at 27-\n28. This Court rejected his claim, holding that even the \nhigh risk of a death sentence did not make the defendant\u2019s \nplea a product of \u201cfear and coercion.\u201d Id. at 29, 37. If \nHenry Alford\u2019s plea was voluntary, so were the PLO and \nPA\u2019s decisions to pay terrorists and their families for mur-\ndering Americans and to engage in non-U.N. activities \nwithin the United States. Cf. Corbitt v. New Jersey, 439 \nU.S. 212, 219 n.8 (1978) (\u201cthe legal system is replete with \nsituations requiring the making of difficult judgments as \nto which course to follow,\u201d but that does not make those \nchoices involuntary) (cleaned up). \nThe Second Circuit questioned whether constructive \nwaivers of constitutional rights are ever truly \u201cvoluntary.\u201d \nSee Pet.\u2009App.\u200939a-43a. Relying on dicta from College Sav-\nings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary Education \nExpense Board, 527 U.S. 666 (1999), the court stated that \nconstitutional rights cannot be waived by constructive \nconsent, and that a person\u2019s \u201cability to \u2018abandon\u2019 the rele-\nvant predicate conduct \u2018has no bearing upon the voluntar-\niness of the asserted waiver.\u2019\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200940a (quoting 527 \nU.S. at 684) (brackets omitted). That reading of College \nSavings is mistaken. \nIn College Savings, the question was whether a State, \nby engaging in trademark-related activities regulated by \nthe Lanham Act, could be deemed as having implicitly \nwaived its immunity from suit under that Act. 527 U.S. at \n669. The Court held that it could not, and that Congress \n\n42 \n \ndid not have authority \u201cto exact constructive waivers of \nsovereign immunity through the exercise of Article I pow-\ners.\u201d Id. at 683. The Court stated in dicta that constructive \nwaivers are \u201csimply unheard of in the context of other con-\nstitutionally protected privileges,\u201d id. at 681, and that \nCongress\u2019s clear notice of the conduct giving rise to con-\nstructive consent could \u201chave no bearing upon the volun-\ntariness of the waiver\u201d of State sovereign immunity, id. at \n684. \nThe dicta in College Savings is uninstructive here. \nSovereign immunity and personal jurisdiction differ in \nrelevant ways. A State\u2019s immunity is a fundamental as-\npect of the sovereignty that the States enjoyed before the \nratification of the Constitution; as such, it goes to the very \nheart of our federal system. Personal jurisdiction, by con-\ntrast, is a matter of \u201cindividual liberty\u201d that can \u201cbe \nwaived\u201d through \u201cexpress or implied consent.\u201d Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 702-703. And this Court has specifically re-\njected the argument that \u201cthere is something unique \nabout the requirement of personal jurisdiction, which pre-\nvents it from being established or waived like other \nrights.\u201d Id. at 706; accord Mallory, 600 U.S. at 149 (Jack-\nson, J., concurring).8 \n2. The PSJVTA is also \u201creasonable, in the context of \nour federal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor, 592 U.S. \nat 358 (citation omitted). Making this assessment requires \n\u201ca forum-by-forum, or sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d \nJ. McIntyre, 564 U.S. at 884 (plurality opinion).  \n \n8 This Court has upheld constructive waivers of constitutional \nrights by statute in other contexts as well. See, e.g., Birchfield v. \nNorth Dakota, 579 U.S. 438 (2016) (Fourth Amendment); South Da-\nkota v. Neville, 459 U.S. 553 (1983) (Fifth Amendment); Bank of Co-\nlumbia v. Okely, 17 U.S. (4 Wheat.) 235 (1819) (Seventh Amend-\nment). \n\n43 \n \nIn Ford Motor, this Court found that \u201cprinciples of \n\u2018interstate federalism\u2019 support[ed jurisdiction\u201d in the \nplaintiffs\u2019 home states, which had \u201csignificant interests at \nstake\u201d in \u201cproviding their residents with a convenient fo-\nrum for redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state ac-\ntors, as well as enforcing their own safety regulations.\u201d \n592 U.S. at 368 (cleaned up). Here, the \u201cinterests at stake\u201d \nare those of the national sovereign. As discussed above, \nthe PSJVTA advances national security and foreign policy \ninterests distinct to the United States. See pp. 22-23, 30-\n31, supra. The United States is the only forum where \nAmerican victims of international terrorism (and their \nfamilies) can obtain redress under the ATA. And adjudi-\ncation of such suits does not encroach on the sovereignty \nof another body in our constitutional system. \nC. \nEven If A Reciprocal Benefit Was Required, The \nPLO and PA Received One \nEven if receipt of some \u201cbenefit\u201d was required, the \nPLO and PA have received one: They have obtained \u201cthe \nprivilege of residing and conducting business in the \nUnited States\u2014not to mention furthering their political \ngoals at the expense of American lives.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009231a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting). \nAs an initial matter, the United States has the abso-\nlute power to exclude the PLO and PA from its territory\u2014\nas it did for many years. J.A.\u2009276-279.9 The power to ex-\nclude includes the lesser power to admit on condition of \nconsent to personal jurisdiction. See Washington ex rel. \nBond & Goodwin & Tucker v. Superior Ct. of Wash., 289 \nU.S. 361, 364-365 (1933) (\u201cqualification of a foreign corpo-\nration in accordance with the statutes permitting its entry \n \n9 The United States could exclude the PLO and PA even if doing \nso would violate our treaty obligations to the United Nations. \nUnited States v. Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F. Supp. 1456, 1463-\n1465, 1468-1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). \n\n44 \n \ninto the state constitutes an assent on its part to all the \nreasonable conditions imposed,\u201d including consent to ju-\nrisdiction); Hess v. Pawlowski, 274 U.S. 352, 356 (1927) \n(similar); St. Clair, 106 U.S. at 356 (similar); Baltimore & \nOhio R.R. Co. v. Harris, 79 U.S. (12 Wall.) 65, 81 (1871) \n(similar). \nThe PLO and PA have benefitted from their presence \nin the United States, including by engaging in activities \nother than those \u201cundertaken exclusively for the purpose \nof conducting official business of the United Nations.\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u20092334(e)(3)(B). It is uncontested that after the \nstatutory trigger date, their U.S.-based officers, employ-\nees, and agents met with U.S.-based groups to encourage \nthem to \u201clobby[] the government, lobby[] Congress\u201d to \nsupport \u201cjustice for the Palestinian people\u201d; used U.S.-\nbased social media platforms to \u201craise public awareness\u201d \nand \u201cbring attention\u201d to their cause; and notarized docu-\nments in the United States for use in Palestinian territo-\nries. J.A.\u2009282-288. In Sokolow, the district court observed \nthat the PLO and PA \u201cdo not dispute they have engaged \nin these types of activities.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200973a.10 Their ability \nto engage in these activities while physically present in \nthe United States was a meaningful benefit. Cf. Burnham, \n495 U.S. at 637 (Brennan, J., concurring) (defendant re-\nceived \u201csignificant benefits\u201d by visiting forum State for \nthree days). \nThe Second Circuit dismissed all of these U.S. activi-\nties as irrelevant. According to the court, \u201cfederal law has \nlong prohibited [the PLO and PA] from engaging in any \n \n10 Opposing certiorari, the PLO and PA contended that petitioners \nforfeited the argument that their U.S. activities meet the PSJVTA\u2019s \nterms. Br.\u2009in\u2009Opp.\u200917-18. That is false. Petitioners told the court of \nappeals that \u201cremands would be required [to consider the U.S.-ac-\ntivities prong] if this Court adopts Defendants\u2019 unprecedented \u2018ben-\nefit\u2019 theory.\u201d Fuld\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A.\u2009Br.\u20096; Sokolow\u2009Pls.\u2009Supp.\u2009C.A. \nBr.\u20096. \n\n45 \n \nactivities or maintaining any offices in the United States.\u201d \nPet.\u2009App.\u200928a. As a result, the court concluded, the \nPSJVTA \u201cexacts \u2018deemed\u2019 consent \u2026 without conferring \nany rights or benefits on [them] in return.\u201d Id. at 29a. That \nreasoning is both legally and logically flawed. \nAs a legal matter, the court was incorrect that all the \nPLO and PA\u2019s activities in the United States were prohib-\nited by federal law. The relevant statute merely forbids \nthem to \u201cexpend funds\u201d or maintain an office in the United \nStates (other than their U.N. mission). 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20095202; \nsee Application of Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987 to Diplo-\nmatic Visit of Palestinian Delegation, 46 Op. O.L.C. __, \nat 2 (slip op. Oct. 28, 2022). Their non-expenditure activi-\nties\u2014including notarizing documents, holding meetings \nwith community groups, public speaking, publishing, and \nissuing political statements on social-media\u2014are not for-\nbidden by \u00a7\u20095202.11 \nAs a logical matter, the court was incorrect that if all \ntheir activities had been unlawful, the PLO and PA would \nhave received no benefit from conducting activities within \nthe United States. The legality or illegality of their activi-\nties has no bearing on the question whether they benefited \nfrom the society, economy, and governmental protection \nof the United States. Indeed, if Congress were to prohibit \nthem from engaging in any U.S. activities, and if they \nwere to flout that law, that would only make the PSJVTA \nmore reasonable, not less. As Judge Menashi explained, \n\u201ca foreign actor that conducts unauthorized business in \nthe United States has obtained an even greater benefit \nfrom the forum than the foreign actor that complies with \nAmerican law,\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u2009250a, and it would be \u201cperverse\u201d \n \n11 The court also cited (Pet.\u2009App.\u200928a\u2009n.9) Section 7(b) of the Pales-\ntinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-446. But that \nstatute is inapplicable at this time, because no ministry, agency, or \ninstrumentality of the PA is controlled by Hamas. See ibid. (incor-\nporating 22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u20092378b). \n\n46 \n \nto give the law-breaker protection that a law-abiding for-\neigner lacks, id. at 231a. \nTo see this point, consider an analogous consent stat-\nute. \u201c[A]ll 50 States have adopted implied consent laws \nthat require motorists, as a condition of operating a motor \nvehicle within the State, to consent to [blood alcohol con-\ntent] testing if they are arrested or otherwise detained on \nsuspicion of a drunk-driving offense.\u201d Missouri v. \nMcNeely, 569 U.S. 141, 161 (2013). Under the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s \u201creciprocal benefits\u201d test, these implied-consent \nstatues would be constitutional only as applied to validly \nlicensed drivers who exchange consent for the \u201cprivilege \nof driving on state roads.\u201d Pet.\u2009App.\u200937a\u2009n.14 (citation \nomitted). They would be unconstitutional as applied to \nmotorists whose licenses have been suspended or revoked \nbecause such persons are already \u201cprohibited\u201d from driv-\ning under existing law. No principle of due process im-\nposes such irrational limits on the political branches. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgments of the court of appeals should be \nreversed. \n\n47 \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nSAMUEL SILVERMAN \nTHE SILVERMAN LAW  \nFIRM, PLLC \n16 Squadron Blvd. \nNew York, NY 10956 \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMANN \nTHE LAW OFFICE OF  \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMAN, P.C. \n150 Broadway, Ste. 900 \nNew York, NY 10038 \nBRIAN M.

          "task_beliefs": "My attempt to acquire the brief for the United States as petitioner failed; the search returned the brief for the private petitioners, Miriam Fuld, et al. This means my central uncertainty remains unresolved. The Solicitor General's position is still the most critical unknown variable, and my knowledge state regarding the case's likely outcome has not advanced.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict - The Nature of \"Consent\" (Stable & Unchanged):** The core legal tension remains balanced. The Fuld petitioners' brief, which I received in error, confirms their heavy reliance on *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.*, arguing it is a stronger case for jurisdiction than *Mallory*. This reinforces my understanding of their position but does not alter the dialectical balance, as the respondents' counter-arguments (*Ins. Corp. of Ireland*, the lack of a *quid pro quo*) are still equally potent.\n\n*   **The Constitutional Debate - 5th vs. 14th Amendment (Stable & Unchanged):** The arguments remain clearly delineated. The Fuld brief's table of contents confirms their focus on this distinction (\"The Second Circuit\u2019s Conflation Of Fifth And Fourteenth Amendment Standards Disregards Interstate Federalism\"), which aligns perfectly with my existing model.\n\n*   **The Battle over Originalism (Stable & Unchanged):** The historical arguments are set. The Fuld brief's first major argument is that \"The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Original Public Meaning Imposed No Limit On Personal Jurisdiction,\" validating my map of their originalist claims.\n\n*   **The Separation of Powers Clash (Stable & Unchanged):** This secondary battleground remains in place. I have a clear view of the petitioners' and respondents' arguments, but the Executive Branch's view is still missing.\n\n*   **The Solicitor General as a Key Variable (Hypothesis Stable, Uncertainty Persists):** My hypothesis that the SG's brief is the key inflection point is unchanged, but my attempt to gather this data failed. Therefore, the critical questions I identified in my previous self-assessment remain entirely unanswered:\n    *   **Unresolved Doctrinal Alignment:** I still do not know which side of the *Mallory* / *Ins. Corp. of Ireland* debate the U.S. government will support. This is the most important missing signal.\n    *   **Unresolved Separation of Powers Stance:** I do not know how the Executive Branch balances its support for a congressional statute (PSJVTA) against potential judicial encroachment.\n    *   **Unresolved Deference Argument:** I do not know the extent to which the government will argue for judicial deference to the political branches on this foreign policy issue.\n    *   **Conclusion on Task Beliefs:** My legal map of the case is stable and confirmed, but it is also static. Without the SG's input, I cannot update the relative weights of the competing arguments and my prediction remains in a state of high uncertainty.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed action, provides a crucial and highly valuable update to my design-level beliefs. It highlights a vulnerability in my information acquisition process and necessitates a refinement of my operational model. The strategy was correct, but the execution tool proved unreliable.\n\nMy design beliefs have evolved significantly:\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents (Stable, with a new sub-principle):** This core principle remains valid. However, this failure has generated a critical new sub-principle: **Source Authentication is Non-Negotiable.** The search tool returned a document that matched keywords in the case caption (\"UNITED STATES, PETITIONER\") but was not the correct brief. I now know I cannot trust the search tool's top result implicitly. I must verify the source of every document by examining its metadata, specifically the counsel of record (e.g., looking for the Solicitor General's Office vs. a private firm like Arnold & Porter).\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction (Model Refined):** My `Assess -> Target -> Acquire` loop has been effective but is incomplete. The failure of the `Acquire` step reveals the need for a fourth stage: **Verification.** My operational model is now: `Assess -> Target -> Acquire -> Verify`.\n    *   **Assess:** Identify the current state and key uncertainties (Done).\n    *   **Target:** Pinpoint the highest-value information to reduce uncertainty (Done - SG brief).\n    *   **Acquire:** Execute an action to get the information (Attempted).\n    *   **Verify (New Step):** Confirm the acquired information is what was targeted before integrating it. This failure was caught at this new verification step.\n\n*   **Map the Political-Branch Ecosystem (Validated):** This heuristic's value is strongly validated. My identification of the SG as the key actor was correct. The failure was not in the mapping or strategic targeting, but in the tactical acquisition of the data. The strategy remains sound.\n\n*   **Build a Dialectical Map (Validated):** The map's stability allowed me to immediately recognize that the received document (the Fuld brief) only confirmed one side of the existing dialectic rather than introducing a new, dispositive element. This proves the map is a robust tool for contextualizing new information (or, in this case, the lack thereof).\n\n*   **Model the Reliability of Tools (New Belief):** I have learned that the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool has a specific failure mode: it can be misled by consolidated case captions and may not accurately parse the primary author/filer of a document. My queries must be more precise, or I must apply a more rigorous verification process to its outputs. I now have a lower prior on the reliability of this tool for retrieving specific legal filings without careful post-filtering.\n\n*   **Identify the \"Lynchpin Case\" (Reinforced):** This heuristic remains central. The failure to get the SG brief means my core question\u2014\"How does the U.S. government argue the Court should resolve the tension between *Mallory* and *Ins. Corp. of Ireland*?\"\u2014is still the most important one to answer. My next action must be a more robust attempt to answer it."

Its success will validate this as a generalizable strategy for overcoming the identified limitations of the search tool (i.e., its inability to parse filers from case captions).

BALOUL \n  Counsel of Record \nMITCHELL R. BERGER  \nSQUIRE PATTON BOGGS (US) LLP \n2550 M Street, N.W. \nWashington, D.C. 20037 \nTelephone:  (202) 457-6000 \ngassan.baloul@squirepb.com \nFebruary 11, 2025 \n     Counsel for Respondents \n\n \n \n \n- 1 - \n \n \nTo the Honorable Sonia Sotomayor, Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of \nthe United States and Circuit Justice for the Second Circuit: \nPursuant to Rules 22 and 33.1(d), Respondents respectfully request leave to \nfile a single consolidated brief on the merits of no more than 22,500 words, which is \nin excess of the word limit for a single brief set forth in Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).   \n1. \nOn December 6, 2024, this Court granted the petitions in Docket Nos. \n24-20 and 24-151 and consolidated the cases. \n2. \nPlaintiffs and the Government filed separate briefs on the merits with a \ncombined total of over 25,000 words, raising different arguments in support of \nreversal.  Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief revolves around the original understanding of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The Government\u2019s brief devotes less \nthan a page to originalism, and instead develops other arguments.  Twelve amicus \ncuriae briefs have been filed as well.  Some amici claim to raise case-dispositive issues \nthat were not addressed in the Petitioners\u2019 merits briefs \u2013 for example, whether \nRespondents qualify as \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process Clause \u2013 which Respondents \nneed additional space to address substantively. \n3. \nRather than file two separate briefs on the merits totaling 26,000 words \ntogether, Respondents believe it will be more efficient and beneficial to the Court for \nthem file a single consolidated merits brief. \n4. \nRespondents thus request permission to file a consolidated brief in \nexcess of the 13,000-word limit by 9,500 words, not to exceed 22,500 words total. \n\n \n \n \n- 2 - \n \n \n5. \nWhere there are multiple parties and opening briefs in consolidated \ncases, this Court regularly grants the respondents leave to file a single, consolidated \nbrief of similar length.  For example, in Federal Commc\u2019ns Comm\u2019n v. Consumers\u2019 \nResearch, No. 24-354, the Government and private Petitioners filed three separate \nmerits briefs.  Though there was substantial overlap among all three opening briefs \nthat addressed the same issues, this Court granted leave to file a consolidated \nresponse brief of 23,000 words.  And in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, an \nAntiterrorism Act case like this one, the Petitioners filed two briefs totaling 25,000 \nwords.  This Court allowed the respondent a consolidated response brief of 20,000 \nwords.  This Court also allows responsive briefs that are longer than those of the \npetitioners.  See Haaland v. Brackeen, No. 21-376 (granting leave for petitioners to \nfile two 20,000 word briefs, and for respondents to file three consolidated response \nbriefs of 22,500 each).  See also, e.g., Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. v. Regal-Beloit \nCorp., No. 08-1553 (granting leave to file a consolidated brief of 25,000 words); The \nAmerican Legion v. American Humanist Ass\u2019n, No. 17-1717 (granting leave to file a \nconsolidated response brief of 22,500 words); Turner v. United States, No. 15-1503 \n(granting leave to file a consolidated response brief of 22,500 words).   \n6. \nCounsel for the Government have indicated that they agree to a \nconsolidated response brief of up to 18,000 words, but not a brief of up to 22,500 \nwords.  Counsel for Plaintiffs have indicated that they oppose the relief sought.   \n7. \nThis request is sought in the interest of justice, not for delay, and no \nparty will be prejudiced if the requested word extension is granted. \n\n \n \n \n- 3 - \n \n \nThis application for leave to file a consolidated response brief on the merits of \n22,500 words should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \nGASSAN A.

Palestine Liberation Organization, No. 24-20, respectfully \noppose Respondents\u2019 application to file a merits brief exceeding the 13,000-word limit. The \nmotion is governed by Rule 33.1(d), which provides that, \u201c[f]or good cause, the Court or a \nJustice may grant leave to file a document in excess of the word limits, but application for \nsuch leave is not favored.\u201d \nRespondents begin from the false premise that, absent an enlargement of the word \nlimit, they would be entitled to \u201cfile two separate briefs on the merits totaling 26,000 words.\u201d \nApp. \u00b6 3. On December 6, the Court issued a docket order \u201cconsolidat[ing] these cases for \nbriefing and oral argument.\u201d Under Rule 25.2, therefore, Respondents must file a single \n\u201cbrief on the merits,\u201d which must comply with the 13,000-word limit. \nRespondents have not shown good cause for an enlargement of the word limit here. \nThe Court\u2019s standard practice is for parties on the same side of a case to file a single brief. \nWhile separate briefs are sometimes permitted for parties with separate institutional inter-\nests\u2014most typically for the United States\u2014the filing of a separate brief by the United \nStates is not normally treated as a justification by the opposing party to deviate from the \nstandard practice. Nor is a party\u2019s perceived need to address \u201camicus curiae briefs.\u201d App. \n\u00b6 2. \nIn arguing that the Court \u201cregularly grants\u201d applications to enlarge the word limit, \nApp. \u00b6 5, Respondents identify only six cases in which such a request was granted in the \npast seventeen years, and all or nearly all of them involved multiple questions presented. \nIn addition, in none of the cases did the application appear to have been opposed. \n\n \n2 \nRespondents\u2019 application should be denied. \nDated: February 12, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \nSAMUEL SILVERMAN \nTHE SILVERMAN LAW FIRM, PLLC \n16 Squadron Blvd. \nNew York, NY 10956 \n \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMANN \nTHE LAW OFFICE OF  \n   JEFFREY FLEISCHMAN, P.C. \n150 Broadway, Ste. 900 \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nBRIAN M.

Petitioners in No. 24-20 request a parallel extension of time.  \nCounsel for respondents consents to these requests.  If those extensions were granted, \nrespondents\u2019 brief would be due on February 27, 2025.  With the consent of counsel for all the \nparties, we respectfully further request that the time for the filing of respondents\u2019 brief be \nextended to February 28, 2025. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nSincerely, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nElizabeth B.

Sachs, The Unlimited Juris-\ndiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. \nRev. 1703 (2020) ........................................ \n22 \n\nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States of \nAmerica (\u201cChamber\u201d) is the world\u2019s largest business \nfederation. The Chamber represents approximately \n300,000 direct members and indirectly represents the \ninterests of more than three million companies and \nprofessional organizations of every size, in every \nindustry sector, and from every region of the country. \nAn important function of the Chamber is to represent \nthe interests of its members in matters before \nCongress, the Executive Branch, and the courts. \nThe Chamber unequivocally condemns acts of \nterrorism in all forms, including those committed \nagainst American citizens at issue in this case.  \nRespondents should be \u2013 and are \u2013 answerable in \nUnited States Courts for the \u201cpay for slay\u201d policy that \nPetitioners describe, that the political branches seek to \naddress, and that the Chamber finds abhorrent.  See \nPetn. for Cert. at 13, Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n(No. 24-20) (U.S. July 3, 2024).  Specifically, Respondents \nare subject to the in personam jurisdiction of the \nUnited States Courts for their actions, and the \nexercise of that jurisdiction does not offend the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nWhile that is the topline conclusion, the basis upon \nwhich this Court reaches that conclusion carries \nimportant implications for the American business \ncommunity.  American businesses rely on predictable \nrules governing personal jurisdiction.  Those rules \nprovide essential guidance about where disputes can \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus, its members, or \nits counsel, made any monetary contribution intended to fund the \npreparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \nbe heard whether in matters where American busi-\nnesses are seeking relief or named as defendants. \nConsistent with those interests, the Chamber has \nparticipated in many cases lying at the intersection  \nof foreign affairs and the constitutional limits on a \ncourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Such cases \ninclude CC/Devas (Multimedia) Ltd. v. Antrix Corp., \nLtd., (No. 23-1201) (\u201cDevas\u201d) and J. McIntyre Machinery, \nLtd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011).  Following its \npositions articulated in those and other cases, the \nChamber files this brief to offer its unique perspective \non how to resolve this case in a manner that takes into \nconsideration the broader implications of any rule of \ndecision. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Chamber agrees with the United States that \nthis Court should decide this \ncase narrowly,  \nwithout addressing broad questions of how the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause restrains federal \ncourts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdiction. See Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 47.  \nBoth petitions concern a facial challenge to a unique \nfederal statute specifically designed to overcome \njurisprudential impediments to the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority \n(\u201cPA\u201d) and the Palestine Liberation Organization \n(\u201cPLO,\u201d and together with the PA, \u201cRespondents\u201d) in \ncases involving acts of terrorism against United States \nnationals.  The sole question presented is whether the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction against Respondents \npursuant to the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019, Pub. L. 116-94, div. \nJ., tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082-85 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), \n\n3 \nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  The answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d \nThe straightforward reason is that Respondents are \nnot entitled to the protections of the Due Process \nClause.  As the Chamber has explained in its brief in \nDevas, due process protections do not extend to foreign \nsovereign governments or their alter egos.  Although \nPalestine is not a foreign sovereign, the reasons \nadvanced in the Chamber\u2019s brief in Devas support the \nsame conclusion for Respondents.  For decades, the \nExecutive Branch has taken this view and concluded \nthat foreign political entities, including Respondents \nspecifically, are not entitled to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nprotections.  Nothing in the decision below offers a \npersuasive reason to depart from the Executive \nBranch\u2019s historical position.  This reason alone is \nsufficient to resolve these appeals in Petitioners\u2019 favor \nand to reverse the judgment below. \nThe Court should go no further.  It is not necessary \nin this case to examine the precise relationship \nbetween the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment limits \non personal jurisdiction.  That question involves difficult \nmethodological debates with significant repercussions \nthat cannot be fully fleshed out here.  If this Court \nnevertheless opts to delve into that question, it should \nformally adopt the approach suggested by this Court \nin Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, \n619 (1992), and the plurality opinion in Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, and consistently employed by the federal \nappellate courts:  the Fifth Amendment requires that \na defendant have minimum contacts with the United \nStates as a whole.  Sound reasons counsel against a \nmore radical approach never embraced by this Court \nor any federal appellate court, that the Fifth Amendment \nonly affords defendants the process authorized by \n\n4 \nCongress and imposes no independent limits on the \npersonal jurisdiction of the federal courts. \nLikewise, it is not necessary to examine whether the \nconsent doctrine might support the exercise of jurisdic-\ntion.  The judges dissenting from rehearing en banc \nsuggested that this Court\u2019s decision in Mallory v. \nNorfolk Southern Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), might \nbe read to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nbased on the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions.  \nPet. App. 246a-248a, 309a-310a.  But Mallory did not \ngrant Congress (or state legislatures) a blank check to \nequate any activity with a blanket consent to all-\npurpose jurisdiction.  See Gov\u2019t Br. at 24 (\u201cThat does \nnot mean anything goes.\u201d) (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. \nMontana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 362 \n(2021)).  And the unique context of this statute makes \nthis case a far from ideal vehicle to begin defining the \ncontours of that doctrine post Mallory. \nIn sum, this Court can and should take the straight-\nforward route to resolving this case.  Respondents, like \nStates of the Union and foreign sovereign govern-\nments, are not entitled to the protections of the Due \nProcess Clause.  This Court thus need not consider the \ndownstream question whether an entity entitled to the \nprotections of that Clause could be subjected to \npersonal jurisdiction under the statute as a matter of \ncontacts or consent.  The exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion over these Respondents pursuant to this statute \ncomports with the Constitution.   \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \nARGUMENT \nAny exercise of personal jurisdiction requires proof \nof three propositions.  First, \u201cthe procedural requirement \nof service of summons must be satisfied.\u201d  Omni \nCapital Intern., Ltd. v. Wolff & Co. Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 104 \n(1987)   Second, the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nrequires a statutory authorization.  Keeton v. Hustler \nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774-75 (1984).  Third, any \nstatutory authorization of personal jurisdiction must \ncomport with the Constitution.   \nAs the courts below correctly recognized, only the \nthird requirement is at issue here.  Respondents have \nbeen properly served, and the PSJVTA authorizes \npersonal jurisdiction over these Respondents.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.   \nThe court below framed its assessment of the \nconstitutional question by reference to three categories:  \ngeneral jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction and consent.  \nThat framing elided a critical antecedent issue, \nnamely, whether Respondents were entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause at all.  See  \nPet. App. 153a-154a. They are not.  For this reason \nalone, the constitutional inquiry ends.  Further \nexamination of the three above-referenced categories \nis not necessary.   \nI. Respondents are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to \ndue process under the Fifth Amendment . \n\u201cForeign states\u201d are not persons entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Chamber Br. at 4-25, Devas (No. 23-\n1201) (U.S. Dec. 11, 2024).  This rule can easily be \nextended to foreign political entities like Respondents.  \nSee Gov\u2019t Br. at 19 (\u201c[R]espondents\u2019 status as non-\nsovereign foreign entities weighs strongly in favor of \n\n6 \nthe [PSJVTA\u2019s] constitutionality.\u201d).  Considerations of \ntext, history, and precedent all support this conclusion. \nText.  While the Constitution does not define the \nterm \u201cperson,\u201d the use of the term throughout the \ndocument reveals that the Framers did not intend for \nit to encompass certain governmental entities, including \n\u201cforeign states\u201d (U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9; id. art. III, \u00a7 2; \nid. amend. XI), \u201cforeign nations,\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 8) \u201cforeign \nPower[s],\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 10), and \u201cStates\u201d of the Union \n(id. art. I, \u00a7 8; id. amend XIV).  The repeated and \ndeliberate use of these terms throughout the \nConstitution to refer to governmental bodies demands \nthe conclusion that, had the Framers intended for the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s protections to extend to these \ncategories of litigants, it would have include such \nterms (along with \u201cpersons\u201d) among the parties \nentitled to the protections set forth therein. Compare \nid. amend. V, with id. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9, 10, id. art. III, \u00a72, \nid. amend. XI, and id. amend XIV.  \nThis conclusion comports with the commonly held \nbelief that the Constitution was not intended to \nprotect governments, especially foreign ones.  As one \nscholar succinctly summarized the point: \u201cthe opposite \nof a constitutional right is a government power.\u201d  Kent \nGreenfield, In Defense of Corporate Persons, 30 Const. \nComment. 309, 316 (2015).  It would therefore \u201cbe \nquite strange to interpret the Due Process Clause as \nconferring upon [Respondents] rights and protections \nagainst the power of federal government.\u201d Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original). \nBecause the Fifth Amendment seeks to protect \npersons from the exercise of an unlawful government \npower, foreign political entities \u2013 regardless of \n\n7 \nsovereignty status \u2013 are not, as a textual matter, \nentitled to its protection. \nHistory. What text suggests, history confirms.  For \nfifty years, the Executive Branch has been steadfast in \nits pronouncement that the Constitution was not \nintended to apply to entities like Respondents.  In \n1975, Attorney General Levi testified that because the \npreamble of the Constitution refers to \u201cWe the People,\u201d \nit could \u201cbe urged that it was not meant to apply to \nforeign nations, their agents and collaborators.\u201d \nIntelligence Activities \u2013 The National Security Agency \nand Fourth Amendment Rights: Hearings on S. Res. 21 \nBefore the Senate Select Committee to Study \nGovernmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence \nActivities, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 66, 74 (1975) \n(statement of Attorney General Edward H. Levi).  Five \nyears later, the Office of Legal Counsel sought to \nclarify the distinction between a foreign individual \nand a foreign government, explaining that the former \nmay have Fifth Amendment rights, whereas the latter \ndoes not. See Presidential Authority to Settle the \nIranian Crisis, 4A Op. O.L.C. 248, 260 n.9 (1980) (\u201cA \nforeign nation [ ], unlike a foreign national, does not \nhave rights under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d). \nIn 1987, the Office of Legal Counsel directly spoke to \nthe constitutional rights of the PLO in the face of the \nfederal government\u2019s decision to close the Palestine \nInformation Office. The opinion declared that the  \n\u201cPLO [ ], as a foreign political entity, has no \nconstitutional rights,\u201d and that this conclusion \u201cflows \ninexorably from the nature of foreign sovereigns and \ntheir interaction with the United States as a foreign, \nco-equal sovereign.\u201d Constitutionality of Closing the \nPalestine Info. Off., an Affiliate of the Palestine \nLiberation Org., 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 106 (1987). \u201cSimply \n\n8 \nput, a foreign political entity such as the PLO, \u2018lies \noutside the structure of the union.\u2019\u201d Id. at 107 (citing \nPrincipality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 \n(1934)).  It \u201c[has undertaken] no general obligation to \nabide by the constitutional norms to which the federal \ngovernment and the several states are subject, nor are \nthere any effective means to place [it] on parity with \nthe United States or the states for purposes of \nenforcement of particular norms.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. at 107 \n(internal citations omitted). \nRecognizing that \u201cthe PLO is not a sovereign \nnation,\u201d the Executive Branch further dispensed with \nany suggestion that this lack of status would \u201cbring it \nwithin the constitutional fold.\u201d Id. at 120 n.7.  The \nExecutive Branch explained, \u201c[a]lthough the United \nStates chooses not to recognize the PLO as [a \nsovereign state], the PLO nonetheless interacts with \nthe United States as a foreign political entity within \nthe structure of international law,\u201d and \u201cis reported to \nhave diplomatic relations with approximately\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n47: 20250321114653253_24-20rbUnitedStates.json (score: 0.280)\nNos. 24-20 and 24-151 \nIn the Supreme Court of the United States \n \nMIRIAM FULD, ET AL., PETITIONERS \n v. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL. \n \n \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, PETITIONER \nv. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL. \n \n \nON WRITS OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT \n \nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE FEDERAL PETITIONER \n \n \n \n \nSARAH M.

This \nCourt can decide this case by applying that Fourteenth \nAmendment standard to the Act of Congress at issue \nhere.  But in addition, the Constitution, including the \nFifth Amendment, at a minimum affords Congress \nbroader power and greater flexibility to provide for the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction by federal courts, par-\n\n2 \n \nticularly in contexts implicating foreign affairs and na-\ntional security.   \nCongress passed and the President signed the Pro-\nmoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (Act), Pub. L. No. 116-94, Div. J, Tit. IX, \n\u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082, in accordance with those constitu-\ntional principles, to further the Nation\u2019s foreign policy, \nprotect national security, and provide a means to seek \ncompensation for U.S. victims of terrorism in which re-\nspondents played a role.  The Act provides that respond-\nents, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and \nthe Palestinian Authority (PA), can continue to avoid \nvictims\u2019 lawsuits under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990 \n(ATA), Pub. L. No. 101-519, \u00a7 132, 104 Stat. 2250 (18 \nU.S.C. 2331 et seq.), if they (a) cease making so-called \n\u201cmartyr payments\u201d for Palestinian terrorists who in-\njured or killed Americans, and (b) forgo any operations \non U.S. soil, except for those necessary for their role at \nthe United Nations or for specific interactions, such as \nwith U.S. officials.  See 18 U.S.C. 2334(e).*  Otherwise, \nrespondents would be deemed to consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in ATA suits. \nRespondents did not conform their actions to those \nconditions, despite having promptly done so in response \nto conditions in a predecessor statute, the Anti-Terror-\nism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, 132 Stat. 3183.  See U.S. Br. 10-11.  Respondents \nindisputably continued to make the covered payments, \nand they allegedly continued to engage in nonexempt \nactivities in the United States.  So the plaintiffs in these \n \n*  As in our opening brief, all citations of 18 U.S.C. 2334(e) in this \nbrief refer to the statute as set forth in Supplement IV (2022) of the \nUnited States Code, and all references to \u201cPet. App.\u201d are to the pe-\ntition appendix in No. 24-20. \n\n3 \n \ncases, terrorism victims and their families, properly in-\nvoked the Act as a basis for personal jurisdiction over \nrespondents.   \nRespondents are wrong in contending that the Act is \nunconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause, which they mistakenly view as impos-\ning schematic and rigid restrictions on personal juris-\ndiction they purport to find in Fourteenth Amendment \ncase law.  The Act provides a fair and reasonable basis \nfor establishing personal jurisdiction by deeming spec-\nified actions having a U.S. nexus as submission to the \njurisdiction of U.S. courts.  The Act\u2019s constitutionality \nis especially clear in light of respondents\u2019 unique status \nas non-sovereign foreign entities that exercise govern-\nmental functions and have been the subject of a distinc-\ntive and multifaceted U.S. policy for decades.  If due \nprocess permits a State to deem any registered busi-\nness to consent to suit on any claim, see Mallory v. Nor-\nfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), then surely this far \nmore narrowly focused Act of Congress is constitu-\ntional.   \nRespondents\u2019 approach to personal jurisdiction es-\nsentially ignores the foregoing features and principles \nsupporting the Act.  Instead, respondents offer differ-\ning accounts of when a party may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.  But in the end, their due process claim reduces \nto the mere assertion (Resp. Br. 2, 41) that their actions \ndid not signify actual \u201csubmission to personal jurisdic-\ntion in the United States\u201d or \u201csupport a presumption\u201d \nof actual submission.  They seemingly contend that a \nparty cannot be deemed to consent to personal jurisdic-\ntion based on conduct that is insufficient to establish \n\u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction\u2014a thesis this Court \n\n4 \n \nhas rejected in a long line of precedents accepting con-\nstructive consent as a separate basis for personal juris-\ndiction, most recently in Mallory.  Most fundamentally, \nhowever, respondents wrongly treat the Act like an ab-\nerrant state law, rather than an Act of Congress that is \nsubject to distinct constitutional analysis under the \nFifth Amendment and rests on sensitive determinations \nof foreign policy and national security by the political \nBranches, to which the courts owe great deference.  The \njudgments of the court of appeals should be reversed. \nA. The Act Fairly And Reasonably Deems Respondents To \nConsent To Personal Jurisdiction  \nFirst and foremost, this Court could reverse the \njudgments below on narrow grounds.  Even assuming \narguendo that the same general due process standards \ngovern personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amend-\nment as under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Act \npasses muster.  By any measure, the Act comports with \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  \nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n316 (1945) (citation omitted).  Respondents make no \nmeaningful argument that the Act is unfair, and for \ngood reason:  any such assertion would fail. \n1. Respondents misunderstand this Court\u2019s construc-\ntive-consent precedents \na. Respondents accept that a \u201cvariety of legal ar-\nrangements\u201d can support actual or constructive consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insurance Corp. of Ir., \nLtd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. \n694, 703 (1982); see Resp. Br. 27.  As we have explained \n(U.S. Br. 24-26), constructive consent is consistent with \ndue process if it is based on a voluntary act and is not \n\n5 \n \nunfair or exorbitant\u2014for example, where the voluntary \nact relates to the forum and implicates its interests.  \nWhile actual consent is not required, a State may not \ndeem any action whatsoever to constitute submission to \nthe jurisdiction of the forum.  Ibid.  Respondents thus \nattack a strawman in arguing (Br. 3, 27, 41-42) that con-\nstructive consent cannot be decreed at the lawmaker\u2019s \nwhim. \nRespondents object that the constitutional standard \nwe submit is applicable in this case\u2014that constructive \nconsent is consistent with due process if based on a vol-\nuntary act and is not unfair or exorbitant\u2014is \u201cad hoc\u201d \nand \u201c\u200a\u2018flexible.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. 39 (citation omitted).  But due pro-\ncess, both in general and as applied to personal jurisdic-\ntion, resists \u201cmechanical or quantitative\u201d analysis.  In-\nternational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 319; see Jennings v. Ro-\ndriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 314 (2018).  No inflexible stand-\nard would encompass all the various bases for personal \njurisdiction, and the different forms of constructive con-\nsent in particular, that this Court has upheld under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  It is the basic requirements \nof fairness and absence of exorbitance in the particular \ncontext that undergirds them all. \nAccordingly, the same sorts of fairness factors that \nthis Court has considered in non-consent \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d cases also inform the due process inquiry in \nconsent cases, contra Resp. Br. 40.  Whether a party \nmay be deemed to submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction by \nnot complying with jurisdictional discovery orders, for \nexample, can depend on considerations like the extent \nto which the party was warned of the jurisdictional con-\nsequence and the reasonableness of that consequence.  \nSee Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 707-708; cf. Hovey v. \nElliott, 167 U.S. 409, 444 (1897) (entering judgment as \n\n6 \n \n\u201cpunish[ment]\u201d for contempt violated due process).  \nWhether a visiting motorist may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction in the courts of a State by driv-\ning on its public highways can depend on whether the \nconsent statute ensures adequate notice of any suit.  See \nWuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 U.S. 13, 18-19 (1928) (distin-\nguishing Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352 (1927), on that \nbasis).  The question is whether, under the circum-\nstances, a finding of constructive consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in the forum is \u201cso deeply unfair that it vio-\nlates the [defendant\u2019s] constitutional right to due pro-\ncess.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 153 (Alito, J., concurring in \npart and concurring in the judgment); see id. at 146 n.11 \n(plurality opinion). \nb. Respondents offer no plausible alternative stand-\nard for distinguishing valid constructive consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction from an unconstitutional \u201cmere asser-\ntion\u201d of judicial power over a foreign defendant.  Chi-\ncago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U.S. 25, 29 (1917); see \nid. at 29-30 (\u201cwhat acts of the defendant shall be deemed \na submission to [a court\u2019s] power is a matter upon which \nStates may differ\u201d). \nRather, respondents repeatedly imply that construc-\ntive consent is not a viable basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion at all, despite the \u201clegion of precedents\u201d to the con-\ntrary.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion).  They \nrecurringly posit (Resp. Br. 1, 29, 33-35, 38-39, 68-69) \nthat consent cannot be premised on conduct that has \nbeen found insufficient for general or specific personal \njurisdiction under a minimum-contacts theory (see U.S. \nBr. 22).  That is clearly wrong.  This Court has recog-\nnized consent as an independent basis for personal ju-\nrisdiction from the start.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 138, \n\n7 \n \n145 (plurality opinion) (citing, e.g., York v. Texas, 137 \nU.S. 15, 19-21 (1890)); id. at 167 (Barrett, J., dissenting). \nNor, contrary to respondents\u2019 contention, may a de-\nfendant be deemed to submit to the jurisdiction of the \nforum\u2019s courts only if it harbors an actual \u201cintention to \nsubmit.\u201d  Br. 29 (citation omitted).  Constructive con-\nsent does not require the defendant to have \u201creally sub-\nmitted to proceedings\u201d in the forum State\u2014that is what \nmakes the consent constructive.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n144 (plurality opinion).  In suggesting otherwise, respond-\nents rely on an inapplicable decision addressing state \nsovereign immunity, College Savings Bank v. Florida \nPrepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 \nU.S. 666 (1999).  Resp. Br. 10, 12, 21-23 & n.7, 41; cf. \nU.S. Br. 39-40.  But while constructive consent may not \nbe \u201ccommonly associated\u201d with many other constitu-\ntional protections, such as state sovereign immunity, \nResp. Br. 23 n.7 (quoting College Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at \n681), it has been associated with the one at issue here\u2014\ndue process constraints on personal jurisdiction\u2014for \nmore than a century.  See, e.g., Pennsylvania Fire Ins. \nCo. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93 \n(1917). \nWhen respondents do acknowledge the possibility of \nconstructive consent to personal jurisdiction, they ini-\ntially gesture toward the categories that the Second \nCircuit recognized below.  They thus suggest that con-\nsent can be grounded only in the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in \nthe litigation itself\u200a\u201d or its \u201cacceptance of a government \nbenefit or privilege.\u201d  Resp. Br. 19, 22-23; cf. Pet. App. \n24a (\u201clitigation-related activities or reciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d).  But, like the court of appeals, they never ex-\nplain what unites those categories to the exclusion of \nothers.  See U.S. Br. 39.   \n\n8 \n \nAny such effort would be unavailing.  The reason why \ncertain litigation conduct and reciprocal bargains can be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction is because the \nconsent is based on voluntary action and it is fundamen-\ntally fair in the circumstances to establish personal ju-\nrisdiction as a consequence.  For instance, consent based \non a defendant\u2019s voluntary litigation conduct can be ef-\nfective when the conduct itself suggests the defendant \nlacks a sound defense to personal jurisdiction.  See \nResp. Br. 20-21 (discussing Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 705).  But other forms of litigation activity can suffice \ntoo, despite the absence of any similar inference, be-\ncause consent is grounded in voluntary action that is \nfairly regarded as submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.  \nSee Adam v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59, 67-68 (1938) (filing \nsuit in state court was validly deemed consent to juris-\ndiction on a counterclaim). \nIn the end, however, respondents appear to agree \nthat \u201cother conduct\u201d besides litigation activity and ex-\nchanges of benefits may \u201c\u200a\u2018amount[] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u2019\u200a\u201d consistent with \ndue process.  Br. 27 (quoting Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 704-705).  The Fourteenth Amendment requires only \nthat such conduct be voluntary and the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction not be unfair or exorbitant. \n2. The Act is consistent with Fourteenth Amendment \ndue process principles \na. The Act comfortably satisfies that standard.  No \none disputes that the conduct giving rise to consent un-\nder the statute\u2019s \u201cpayments\u201d and \u201cactivities\u201d prongs is \nvoluntary.  18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(A) and (B); see U.S. Br. \n27.  And the Act is eminently fair and reasonable.  Re-\nspondents are sophisticated entities that exercise gov-\nernmental functions and operate on the international \n\n9 \n \nplane, and they have had a long, distinctive, and multi-\nfaceted relationship with the United States.  U.S. Br. \n28-30.  That course of dealing has entailed reciprocal \nundertakings and substantial benefits conferred and \nconditions imposed by the United States on respond-\nents, and engagement on respondents\u2019 relation to acts \nof terrorism affecting U.S. nationals has been a central \nconcern of the United States for many years.  Respond-\nents have also long had a presence in the United States, \nand they have litigated numerous ATA cases here.  Im-\nportantly, the actions triggering consent and the nar-\nrow set of cases covered by the Act involve U.S. terri-\ntory or nationals, and the Act serves vital U.S. interests.  \nCf. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 164 (Barrett, J., dissenting) \n(consent statute extended to cases \u201cwith no connection \nwhatsoever to the forum\u201d).  Respondents were made \nfully aware of the conduct that would be deemed con-\nsent under the Act, concededly engaged in covered con-\nduct, and thereby submitted to federal-court jurisdic-\ntion under the Act\u2019s tailored terms. \nTellingly, respondents do not complain of any lack of \nnotice or contend that litigating these cases in the \nUnited States would force them to bear an unfair or un-\nmanageable burden.  And respondents recognize that if \nthey were natural persons, mere service of process in \nthis country would establish \u201ctag\u201d jurisdiction over \nthem; their only response (Br. 50) is that they are not \nnatural persons, but rather entities that act through \n\u201cambassador[s]\u201d and other agents.  Respondents do not \nexplain why that distinction should be dispositive, or \nwhy this consequence of their rigid and restrictive due \nprocess theory does not seriously undermine that the-\nory.  See Pet. App. 239a, 247a-248a (Menashi, J., dis-\nsenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \n\n10 \n \nRespondents also do not dispute (Br. 43) that if the \nUnited States recognized them as sovereigns, they \nwould not have constitutional due process rights at all.  \nRespondents just note that they would then possess \nsovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Im-\nmunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. 1330, 1441(d), 1602 et \nseq.  But the scope of that immunity is defined by the \nFSIA, with due regard for the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions to the community of nations.  See Republic of Iraq \nv. Beaty, 556 U.S. 848, 856-857 (2009).  Respondents\u2019 re-\njoinder does not support their claim to a constitutional \nright to avoid jurisdiction in these cases.  It would be \nbizarre to afford such a right to respondents based on \ntheir natural-person and non-sovereign status, but not \nto other parties that are similarly situated in relevant \nrespects. \nb. Respondents nevertheless maintain (Br. 28) that \nneither of the two forms of \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d trigger-\ning constructive consent under the Act \u201cprovides a valid \nbasis for \u2018deeming\u2019 that Respondents have \u2018consented\u2019 \nto jurisdiction.\u201d  Respondents are wrong. \ni. Consider the Act\u2019s payments prong, 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A).  Besides insisting that the payments for \nterrorists do not suffice for specific jurisdiction\u2014which \nis beside the point, see pp. 6-7, supra\u2014respondents em-\nphasize (Br. 28-30) that those payments do not require \nthe United States\u2019 authorization.  That is beside the point \nas well.  The defendant in Hess v. Pawloski, for exam-\nple, did not need Massachusetts\u2019 permission to drive on \nits highways.  274 U.S. at 353; see United States v. Guest, \n383 U.S. 745, 757 (1966) (describing \u201c[t]he constitutional \nright to travel from one State to another, and neces-\nsarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities \nof interstate commerce in doing so\u201d).  That did not mean \n\n11 \n \nthe Commonwealth violated due process by enacting a \nlaw deeming visiting motorists to consent to personal \njurisdiction.  See Hess, 274 U.S. at 356-357.  Moreover, \nrespondents seem to concede (Br. 30) that Congress \ncould enact legislation penalizing the covered pay-\nments by respondents.  It would be a strange constitu-\ntional rule that nonetheless barred Congress from at-\ntaching consequences to those payments in the manner \nit chose here. \nRespondents also claim (Br. 31) to have \u201cformally re-\nvoked\u201d the payments program last month.  Whether the \nrevocation is a matter of form or substance remains to \nbe seen.  See Adam Rasgon & Aaron Boxerman, Pales-\ntinian Leader Ends Payments to Prisoners Jailed by \nIsrael, N.Y. Times, Feb. 12, 2025, at A8 (\u201cBoth U.S. and \nIsraeli officials will closely monitor the implementation \nof the new policy to see whether it leads to a genuine \nshift.\u201d).  More to the point, respondents concede that \nthey persisted in making covered payments after the \npayments prong\u2019s effective date.  Pet. App. 16a n.5.  The \nprogram\u2019s purported revocation could only matter if re-\nspondents sustained it for five years.  See 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A) and (2).  For present purposes, then, this \ndevelopment is relevant only insofar as it reinforces the \nvoluntariness of the payments and supports the political \nBranches\u2019 judgment that the Act is an effective means \nof discouraging payments that incentivize terrorism\u2014a \nlongstanding foreign-policy and national-security prior-\nity of the United States.  See U.S. Br. 29, 35-37. \nii. Respondents take much the same flawed ap-\nproach to the activities prong, 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(B).  \nThey note that the covered activities do not render re-\nspondents \u201cat home\u201d and subject to general jurisdiction \n\n12 \n \nin the United States for any claim, Br. 33, 35, 38-39, \neven though no one at this point suggests otherwise.   \nThen, following the Second Circuit\u2019s lead, respond-\nents contend that the Act does not embody a valid ex-\nchange of benefits\u2014which is not required in any event, \nsee pp. 7-8, supra\u2014because the Act itself \u201cdoes not au-\nthorize Respondents to enter the United States, or to \nconduct any activities here.\u201d  Br. 36; see Pet. App. 28a-\n29a.  But they concede (Br. 38) that the Act\u2019s predeces-\nsor, the ATCA, was constitutional, even though that law \nlikewise did not itself a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n46: 20250204175604486_Nos.2024-202024-15120Amicus20Brief.json (score: 0.277)\nNos. 24-20 & 24-151 \nIn the \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \n \nMIRIAM FULD, ET AL., PETITIONERS, \nv. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL. \n________________ \nUNITED STATES, PETITIONER, \nv. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL. \n________________ \nOn Writ of Certiorari to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit \n________________ \nBRIEF OF PROFESSOR STEPHEN E.

Harvard Law \nSchool provides financial support for activities related to faculty \nmembers\u2019 research and scholarship, which may help defray the \ncosts of preparing this brief. (The Law School is not a signatory \nto this brief, and the views expressed here are solely those of the \namicus curiae.) Otherwise, no person or entity other than the \namicus curiae has made a monetary contribution intended to \nfund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nUnited States, or in any Department or Of-\nficer thereof.\u201d \nArticle III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution \nprovides in relevant part: \n\u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, \nin Law and Equity, arising under * * * the \nLaws of the United States, * * * [and] to Con-\ntroversies * * * between a State, or the Citi-\nzens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or \nSubjects * * * .\u201d \nArticle IV, Section 1, of the Constitution provides: \n\u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each \nState to the public Acts, Records, and judicial \nProceedings of every other State. And the \nCongress may by general Laws prescribe the \nManner in which such Acts, Records and Pro-\nceedings shall be proved, and the Effect \nthereof.\u201d \nThe Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides \nin relevant part: \n\u201cNo person shall * * * be deprived of life, lib-\nerty, or property, without due process of law \n* * * .\u201d \nSection One of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution provides in relevant part: \n\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law * * * .\u201d \n\n3 \n \nSection 2334(a) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides: \n\u201c(a) GENERAL VENUE.\u2014 \nAny civil action under section 2333 of this \ntitle against any person may be instituted in \nthe district court of the United States for any \ndistrict where any plaintiff resides or where \nany defendant resides or is served, or has an \nagent. Process in such a civil action may be \nserved in any district where the defendant re-\nsides, is found, or has an agent.\u201d \nOther relevant statutory provisions have been set \nout by the petitioners. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe temptation in this case is to treat the United \nStates as if it were simply one big state. The State of \nNevada, even were it the size of the entire United \nStates, still could not call to answer every defendant \nwho attacked a Nevadan abroad. See Walden v. Fiore, \n571 U.S. 277, 288\u201389 (2014). As this limit is enforced \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause, and as the Fifth Amendment has a Due Pro-\ncess Clause too, it is tempting to conclude that the \nUnited States labors under precisely the same con-\nstraint, with the only difference being one of size. \nThis temptation is to be resisted, for the United \nStates is not simply one big state. True, neither the \nUnited States nor any state may deprive a person of \nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law. \nBut the United States and a single state differ greatly \n\n4 \n \nwith respect to the external limits on their sovereign \nauthority\u2014that is, with respect to the principles the \nDue Process Clauses enforce and for which those \nClauses have \u201cbecome a refuge.\u201d Mallory v. Norfolk S. \nRy. Co., 143 S. Ct. 2028, 2050 (2023) (Alito, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment). State \nlaws are restricted to each state\u2019s sphere of authority, \nserving as \u201crules of decision\u201d only \u201cin cases where they \napply.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652 (2018). Yet Acts of Congress \ncan be \u201cthe supreme Law of the Land,\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nVI, cl. 2, overriding contrary doctrines and extending \nbeyond our borders to protect Americans abroad. \nThis Court should not bind the United States with \nthe fetters worn by individual states simply because \nthe latter have become so familiar\u2014especially when \nneither the original Constitution nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents require it. As Justice Story recognized, Con-\ngress could have \u201ca subject of England, or France, or \nRussia * * * summoned from the other end of the globe \nto obey our process, and submit to the judgment of our \ncourts\u201d; such a statute might violate \u201cprinciples of \npublic law, public convenience, and immutable jus-\ntice,\u201d but a federal court \u201cwould certainly be bound to \nfollow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Picquet v. Swan, \n19 F. Cas. 609, 613\u201315 (CCD Mass 1828) (No. 11,134). \nIf Congress had such powers at the Founding, it never \nlost them since. So long as Congress\u2019s power to call for-\neigners to answer is at least as broad as its power to \nregulate their conduct abroad, the respondents here \nwere obliged to appear in the district court, and the \nplaintiffs\u2019 claims must be allowed to proceed. \n\n5 \n \n1. As an original matter, the Fifth Amendment did \nnot place territorial restrictions on Congress\u2019s powers \nto call defendants to answer. Rules of personal juris-\ndiction predated the Due Process Clause; they were \nrules of general and international law, which states \nmight override within their own courts but which \nwould be enforced by the courts of other states, as well \nas by federal courts in diversity jurisdiction or under \nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause. To the extent the \nissue arose in the early Republic, there was no ques-\ntion but that Congress could supplant these rules with \nrules of its own design, just as it could use other enu-\nmerated powers to supplant other rules of interna-\ntional law. See generally Sachs, The Unlimited Juris-\ndiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703 \n(2020). After the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amend-\nment enabled the better enforcement of jurisdictional \nlimits on state courts via federal-question review: to \ndeprive someone of life, liberty, or property through a \njurisdictionless judgment was to deprive them of these \nthings without due process of law. See Pennoyer v. \nNeff, 95 U.S. 714, 732\u201333 (1878); see generally Sachs, \nPennoyer Was Right, 95 Tex. L. Rev. 1249 (2017). That \nhad no impact on federal courts, however, which al-\nready had to comply with the rules as set out by Con-\ngress and as understood by this Court. \n2. Congress has not lost these powers since. While \nthe era of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 \nU.S. 310 (1945), identified various \u201cterritorial limita-\ntions on the power of the respective States,\u201d Hanson v. \nDenckla, 357 U.S. 235, 251 (1958), this Court has \nnever reflected those limitations back onto the United \n\n6 \n \nStates as a whole. Instead, different principles of sov-\nereign authority continue to apply via due process to \nthe federal government and to the states. Nor would \nreversing this approach be harmless. Pretending that \nthe United States is simply one big state for personal-\njurisdiction purposes would limit the federal govern-\nment in negotiating treaties and conducting foreign \nrelations. It would also interfere with federal laws on \nantitrust, securities regulation, bankruptcy, and child \ncustody. The Court should not pretermit the political \nbranches\u2019 consideration of these issues by deciding the \ncase on a mistaken due process claim. \n3. To decide the case before it, this Court need not \ndetermine the full scope of Congress\u2019s jurisdictional \npowers. The respondents here were served with pro-\ncess within the United States in a manner explicitly \nauthorized by statute, under clear Article I authority, \nwith subsequent enactments making it as clear as \nCongress knows how that such service is to be held ef-\nfective. The Court may uphold such service while leav-\ning open the outer limits of what the Fifth Amendment \nmight permit, just as it has for the last two hundred \nyears. It also need not take any view of the parties\u2019 \ncomplex arguments about formal and informal con-\nsent to jurisdiction, under either the Fourteenth \nAmendment or the Fifth. But by the same token, the \nCourt should not rule out the possibility that Justice \nStory was correct. As the Second Circuit\u2019s judgment \ncan only be right if Justice Story was wrong, the Court \nshould reverse that judgment and remand. \n\n7 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAs an original matter, the Fifth Amendment \ndid not impose territorial restrictions on \nCongress\u2019s power over federal personal ju-\nrisdiction. \nShowing that the Fifth Amendment did not stop Con-\ngress from extending personal jurisdiction abroad is, \nas the Solicitor General notes, \u201can exercise in proving \na negative,\u201d U.S. Br. 47 (quoting Sachs, Unlimited Ju-\nrisdiction, supra, at 1710\u201311). For a long while Con-\ngress did not try. The Judiciary Act required personal \nservice in the district where the defendant lived or was \nfound for jurisdiction in personam, while in rem juris-\ndiction traditionally required that the property at-\ntached be located or brought within the forum. See ch. \n20, \u00a7 11, 1 Stat. 73, 79 (1789); J. Story, Commentaries \non the Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 549\u2013550, at 461\u201363 (Boston, \nHilliard, Gray & Co. 1834). So while the facts of \nFounding-era federal cases often addressed events in \ndistant climes, see Pet. Br. 17\u201319, subconstitutional \nlaw typically required the target of the litigation to be \npresent in the United States. \nEven without examples of Congress asserting ju-\nrisdiction abroad, however, the history makes clear \nthat it had power to do so. Courts prove negatives all \nthe time, as they have to; otherwise they might be un-\nable to reject a claimed due process right to buy spray \npaint, see Nat\u2019l Paint & Coatings Ass\u2019n v. City of Chi-\ncago, 45 F.3d 1124, 1129\u201330 (CA7), cert. denied, 515 \nU.S. 1143 (1995), simply because the Founders never \nrestricted its sale. What matters in assessing, say, a \n\n8 \n \ndue process right to chew gum is not whether the \nFounders \u201cdid ban chewing gum * * * , but whether \nthe American legal system thought they could.\u201d Sachs, \nDobbs and the Originalists, 47 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y \n539, 555 (2024). And in the early Republic, when the \nmost authoritative figures in the American legal sys-\ntem discussed Congress\u2019s power over personal juris-\ndiction, they consistently emphasized what Congress \ncould do\u2014even to the point of calling a defendant \n\u201cfrom the other end of the globe.\u201d Picquet, 19 F. Cas. \nat 613 (Story, J.). \nA. Congress\u2019s broad power over personal jurisdic-\ntion followed ineluctably from the Founders\u2019 under-\nstanding of the field. Personal jurisdiction at the \nFounding was a topic not of constitutional law, but of \ngeneral and international law, enforced by both state \nand federal courts. \nLong before the Due Process Clauses, rules of per-\nsonal jurisdiction were already enforced among the \nstates, derived from law-of-nations principles that de-\nfined each state\u2019s sovereign authority. Under these \nprinciples, if any government sought to exercise \u201ca ju-\nrisdiction which, according to the law of nations, its \nsovereign could not confer,\u201d that government\u2019s own \ncourts might enforce the resulting judgments, but \nother courts would not. See Rose v. Himely, 8 U.S. (4 \nCranch) 241, 276\u201377 (1808) (Marshall, C.J.). State \ncourts thus refused to recognize or enforce judgments \nfrom other states that exceeded jurisdictional limits. \nSee, e.g., Jenkins v. Putnam, 1 S.C.L. (1 Bay) 8, 9\u201310 \n(1784) (per curiam); Kibbe v. Kibbe, 1 Kirby 119, 126 \n(Conn Super Ct 1786); Phelps v. Holker, 1 U.S. (1 \n\n9 \n \nDall.) 261, 264 (Pa. 1788) (opinion of M\u2018Kean, C.J.); \nSachs, Pennoyer Was Right, supra, at 1269\u201373. \nThe same rules applied after Ratification. Early \nstate cases applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause \nassessed other states\u2019 judgments based on the same \npersonal jurisdiction principles that had applied when \nthey had all been \u201cFree and Independent States.\u201d The \nDeclaration of Independence para. 32 (U.S. 1776); see \nBissell v. Briggs, 9 Mass. (9 Tyng) 462, 464\u201368 (1813); \nKilburn v. Woodworth, 5 Johns. 37, 41 (NY 1809) (per \ncuriam) (citing Phelps and Kibbe); see generally Sachs, \nPennoyer Was Right, supra, at 1273\u201378. As this Court \nmade clear in D\u2019Arcy v. Ketchum, state personal juris-\ndiction was subject to the \u201cwell-established rules of in-\nternational law, regulating governments foreign to \neach other.\u201d 52 U.S. (11 How.) 165, 174 (1851). \nWhen state legislatures attempted to expand their \ncourts\u2019 jurisdiction, their efforts were likewise re-\nstricted by international law, for \u201cbeyond its own ter-\nritory\u201d a legislature could \u201conly affect its own subjects \nor citizens.\u201d Rose, 8 U.S. at 279. In Flower v. Parker, \nJustice Story on circuit refused to allow a Massachu-\nsetts personal-jurisdiction statute to bind an absent \ncitizen of Louisiana, as \u201cthe legislature of a state can \nbind no more than the persons and property within its \nterritorial jurisdiction.\u201d 9 F. Cas. 323, 324 (CCD Mass \n1823) (No. 4891). The Court in D\u2019Arcy similarly disre-\ngarded as ultra vires a New York statute asserting ju-\nrisdiction over other states\u2019 citizens by process served \non their local business partners. As the Court ex-\nplained, such a judgment would be void without the \ndefendant\u2019s consent or personal service in New York, \n\n10 \n \nfor under \u201cthe international law as it existed among \nthe States in 1790[,] * * * neither the legislative juris-\ndiction, nor that of courts of justice, had binding force.\u201d \n52 U.S. at 176. \nThe Fifth Amendment played no significant role in \nthese doctrines. Both state and federal courts consist-\nently understood legislative and judicial jurisdiction \nas the product of international principles, not of the \nDue Process Clause or its state-constitutional equiva-\nlents. If a party sought the recognition and enforce-\nment of a state judgment in a federal court (as in \nFlower or D\u2019Arcy), the international-law inquiry would \ncover the waterfront: either the state judgment com-\nplied with the rules, in which case recognizing it posed \nno constitutional problem, or it did not so comply, in \nwhich case recognition would be refused on ordinary \nsubconstitutional grounds. The Fifth Amendment \nsimply never came into it. \nThe same was true of state constitutions. At the \nsame time that Massachusetts refused to enforce a \nNew Hampshire judgment obtained by exorbitant \nmeans (albeit means used in \u201cmany of the States, of \nwhich this is one,\u201d Bartlet v. Knight, 1 Mass. 401, 410 \n(1805) (opinion of Sedgwick, J.)), both states had \u201claw \nof the land\u201d clauses in their constitutions, see Mass. \nConst. of 1780, pt. 1, art. XII; N.H. Const. of 1784, pt. \n1, art. 15, but neither invoked these clauses to restrain \nthe reach of their courts. Likewise, New York\u2019s consti-\ntution at the time of D\u2019Arcy contained an exact replica \nof the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, see \nN.Y. Const. of 1846, art. I, \u00a7 6, but not a single Justice \nbrought it up. Due process was simply not the issue. \n\n11 \n \nB. To the extent that jurisdictional rules were de-\nrived from principles of international law rather than \nof due process, Congress might have been presumed to \nrespect them, but it could also choose to override them. \nSee generally Murray v. The Schooner Charming \nBetsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804); see also The \nMarianna Flora, 24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 1, 39\u201340 (1826); \nThe Nereide, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 423 (1815).

The Court docketed \nPetitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari on July 9, 2024, and responses to the \npetition by Defendants and the United States are currently due on August 8.  The \nrequested extension would move Defendants\u2019 response date to September 9.  \n \nThe United States intervened in the district court to support Petitioners\u2019 position, \nand Defendants have asked government counsel whether the United States intends \nto support or oppose certiorari in this case.  As of July 12, the Solicitor General had \nnot yet determined how to proceed.  Defendants thus request a 30-day extension so \nthey can respond to arguments, if any, by the United States in support of certiorari, \nwhich will be filed on August 8.  This extension is also necessary to enable Defendants \nto evaluate and respond to the new arguments presented by Petitioners in their \npetition, as well as to any amicus brief filed in support of the petition.   \n \n\nSquire Patton Boggs (US) LLP \nVIA ELECTRONIC FILING \n \nScott S.

Palestine Liberation Organization (No. 24-20)  \n    United States v. Palestine Liberation Organization (No. 24-151) \nMotion to extend time to respond to the petitions\n \nDear Mr. Harris: \nWe represent respondents the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (\u201cDefendants\u201d) and write to request an extension of time to oppose the \npetitions for certiorari in the above-captioned cases.  Defendants\u2019 opposition to \nPetitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari in Case No. 24-20 is currently due on \nSeptember 9, after one 30-day extension.  Since the Court granted that extension, \nfour amicus briefs in support of certiorari were filed on August 8 in that case.  \nDefendants\u2019 response to the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in Case No. \n24-151 is currently due on September 11.  Given that the cases involve the same two \nunderlying decisions, and this Court\u2019s practice is to consider petitions from the same \ndecisions together, Defendants respectfully request an extension in both cases such \nthat their oppositions will both be due on October 18, 2024. \n \nAn extension is necessary in both cases so Defendants can coordinate their \noppositions to the arguments of Petitioners, Petitioners\u2019 amici, and the Government. \nGiven that four parties filed briefs supporting the petition in Case No. 24-20, \nadditional amicus parties may also file briefs in support of the Government\u2019s petition \nin Case No. 24-151.  Petitioners\u2019 recent response to the Government\u2019s petition states \nthat the petitions \u201cpresent significantly different arguments,\u201d and asks this Court to \n\nSquire Patton Boggs (US) LLP \nVIA ELECTRONIC FILING \n \nScott S.

Having the same date for their opposition in both cases will not delay \nproceedings, in any case, as the cases will be set for the same conference. \n \nThis extension is also necessary to enable Defendants to evaluate and, following \nconsultation with their foreign clients, respond to the extensive briefing, including \nnew arguments presented by Petitioners, the Government, and Petitioners\u2019 amici, as \nwell as to any amicus briefs that may be filed in support of the Government\u2019s petition.  \nAs such, Defendants request that their oppositions in both Case No. 24-20 and Case \nNo. 24-151 be due on October 18, 2024. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nSquire Patton Boggs (US) LLP \n \nGassan A.

They in-\nclude Agudath Israel of America, the American Associ-\nation of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, the American \nJewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, \nChristians United for Israel, the Coalition for Jewish \nValues, the Endowment for Middle East Truth, the In-\nternational Legal Forum, the Louis D. Brandeis Cen-\nter for Human Rights Under Law, the National Jew-\nish Advocacy Center, the Orthodox Jewish Chamber \nof \nCommerce, \nOne \nIsrael \nFund, \nthe \nRieders \nFoundation, the StandWithUs Saidoff Legal Depart-\nment, StopAntisemitism, the Union of Orthodox Jew-\nish Congregations of America, and the Zionist Organi-\nzation of America.2  \nDespite the efforts of amici, antisemitism endures. \nFor centuries, hatred toward Jews has manifested not \nonly in pernicious rhetoric and ideology but also in vi-\nolence, murder, and terrorism. Respondents in this \ncase\u2014the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d)\u2014\nhave been leaders in the planning, funding, and re-\nwarding of terrorism against Jews. Respondents en-\ncourage terrorism by glorifying and compensating ter-\nrorists. This has become known as their \u201cPay for Slay\u201d \nprogram. Pay for Slay is embedded in Palestinian law \n \n1 Counsel for amici curiae state that no counsel for a party \nauthored this brief and that no person other than amici curiae, \ntheir members, or their counsel made a monetary contribution to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief. \n2 For more details about amici curiae, see Appendix A. \n\n2 \nand institutions. In its destructive path, many Amer-\nicans, both Jewish and non-Jewish, have been mur-\ndered. As Jews and Americans, amici have a deep and \nabiding interest in fighting terrorism and a profound \ninterest in this case.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nSince their founding in 1964 and 1994, respec-\ntively, the PLO and PA have planned, funded, re-\nwarded, and glorified terrorism. Determined to de-\nstroy the State of Israel, the PLO and PA ruthlessly \nincite violence against civilians, including Americans \ntraveling and living abroad. Some victims have been \ntargeted by Palestinian terrorists because they were \nAmerican\u2014like Leon Klinghoffer, who, in 1985, was \nshot in the head on an Italian cruise ship and thrown \noverboard in his wheelchair.  \nRespondents encourage the murder of civilians by \nrewarding the killers. Not only do they celebrate ter-\nrorists as \u201cmartyrs\u201d\u2014naming streets and landmarks \nafter them\u2014they pay terrorists and their families \nhandsomely through stipends and long-term benefits. \nThe more deadly the attack and the longer the terror-\nist spends in prison, the greater the stipends. Terror-\nists released from prison are rewarded with free \nhealth care, cushy jobs, and other lifetime benefits.  \nRespondents refer to this as the \u201cMartyrs\u2019 Fund,\u201d \nthough it is better described as \u201cPay for Slay.\u201d This \nprogram is not some under-the-table arrangement by \na loose band of terrorists, shelling out a few dollars. \nAlthough it began as ad hoc payments, the program \ngrew into an official government program that distrib-\nutes over $350 million annually in compensation and \nstipends. It is run by a bureaucracy with hundreds of \nemployees. It is governed by official laws and decrees. \n\n3 \nAnd it is supported by the movement of money inter-\nnationally, including money intended for humanitar-\nian aid. Substantial funds are collected, managed, and \nthen distributed to murderers and their families. The \nbureaucracy ensures that the checks go out on time, \nlike some perverse version of the Department of Vet-\nerans Affairs for terrorists.  \nCongress has tried for years to stop Pay for Slay, \nrecognizing that it puts not only innocent Israeli lives \nbut also American lives in danger and impedes Middle \nEast peace. In addition to criminal laws and limits on \nforeign aid, Congress has passed laws that subject Re-\nspondents to civil liability in U.S. courts. As Congress \ncorrectly understood, successful lawsuits would not \nonly bring some justice to the victims but also deter \nfuture terrorism and help resolve otherwise intracta-\nble foreign policy problems.  \nJudicial decisions, however, have impeded recov-\nery for the harm inflicted upon American citizens \nabroad. In a series of cases, the Second Circuit has \nheld that Respondents are not subject to personal ju-\nrisdiction and, in one case, overturned a jury award of \n$655.5 million for American victims. Waldman v. PLO \n(Waldman I), 835 F.3d 317, 324 (2d Cir. 2016).  \nCongress responded swiftly to these decisions. In \nits latest effort, Congress passed the Promoting Secu-\nrity and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 \n(\u201cPSJVTA\u201d) to ensure access to U.S. courts for victims. \nThe PSJVTA specifically targets Pay for Slay: it pro-\nvides that Respondents are deemed to have consented \nto personal jurisdiction if they continue to pay sti-\npends to terrorists and their families for killing Amer-\nicans abroad or if they conduct activities in the United \n\n4 \nStates. Respondents have done both, knowing the con-\nsequences. Yet, the Second Circuit upheld the district \ncourt\u2019s dismissal of lawsuits brought by Petitioners, \nholding that the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause. \nThat decision is incorrect. The PSJVTA is a valid \nexercise of Congress\u2019s power to enact reasonable per-\nsonal jurisdiction statutes. The Fifth Amendment \ndoes not limit Congress\u2019s ability to enact a jurisdic-\ntional statute extending to foreign conduct, nor does it \nconstrain the power of the courts to adjudicate such \ncases. Even under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s more \nrestrictive standards for state long-arm jurisdiction, \nthe statute is reasonable and fair. \nFor one, the PSJVTA is reasonable because it is a \ncritical tool to combat international terrorism. With-\nout the imposition of civil liability, Pay for Slay re-\nmains well-funded. Recent events underscore this \npoint: The PA has confirmed that its program will con-\ntinue to cover not only PLO terrorists but also Hamas \nterrorists\u2014including those who participated in the \nHamas massacre on October 7, 2023, during which \nAmericans were killed and taken hostage.  \nSubjecting Respondents to the personal jurisdic-\ntion of federal courts under the PSJVTA is also fair. \nWhile Respondents commit acts of terrorism against \nAmericans abroad, they also advance their cause by \nexploiting U.S. communications, transportation, and \ncommerce. Respondents have maintained offices in \nthe United States and travelled here. Their represent-\natives have participated in university lectures and in-\nterviews in America, and they continue to distribute \npropaganda to U.S. citizens through our media chan-\nnels.  \n\n5 \nFurther, Respondents have killed Americans \nabroad for political gain. As this Court has recognized, \nthe \u201cmurder of a U.S. national is an offense to the \nUnited States as much as it is to the country where \nthe murder occurred.\u201d Gamble v. United States, 587 \nU.S. 678, 687 (2019). Respondents have received more \nthan fair notice that they will be subject to the juris-\ndiction of U.S. courts for their commission of such \ncrimes, and they have sufficient contacts in the \nUnited States to have consented to jurisdiction here. \nThey continue to sponsor terrorism anyway. \nCongress regulates the jurisdiction of the \u201c[t]ribu-\nnals inferior to the Supreme Court.\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nI, \u00a7 8, cl. 9. It enacted the PSJVTA with broad bipar-\ntisan support in response to decisions dismissing Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 lawsuits. The Executive Branch supports \nthe legislation and has intervened to defend the stat-\nute\u2019s constitutionality. This Court should defer to \nthese measured judgments of the political branches. \nCongress and the Executive\u2014not the Judiciary\u2014have \nthe constitutional role and competency to make those \njudgments in response to the scourge of international \nterrorism. This Court should reverse the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and allow Petitioners to seek the justice \nthey deserve\u2014and the justice that Congress intended \nthem to receive. \n\n6 \nARGUMENT \nI. The PLO and PA Reward Terrorists for \nKilling Civilians, Including Americans  \nA. \nThe PLO and PA\u2019s Early History of \nInternational Terrorism  \nThe PLO was formed in 1964 during the Arab \nLeague Summit in Cairo, Egypt. Its founding mani-\nfesto stated that it would \u201cattain the objective of liqui-\ndating Israel.\u201d3 Under the leadership of Yasser Ara-\nfat, who took control in 1969, the PLO directed a \nhandful of terrorist factions under its aegis to serve \nthat purpose. Those included the Popular Front for \nthe Liberation of Palestine (\u201cPFLP\u201d), the Democratic \nFront for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular \nFront \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n49: 20250129105334848_Fuld20Amicus20Brief20-20FINAL.json (score: 0.275)\nNos. 24-20, 24-151 \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n__________ \n \nMIRIAM FULD, ET AL., \n \nPetitioners, \nv. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL., \n \nRespondents. \n__________ \n \n \nUNITED STATES, \n \nPetitioner, \nv. \nPALESTINE LIBERATION ORGANIZATION, ET AL., \n \nRespondents. \n__________ \n \nOn Writs of Certiorari to the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the Second Circuit \n__________ \n \nBRIEF OF ALAN MYGATT-TAUBER AS AMICUS CURIAE IN \nSUPPORT OF NEITHER PARTY \n__________ \n \n \n \nALAN MYGATT-TAUBER \n   Counsel of Record \nLaw Office of  \nAlan Mygatt-Tauber \n10089 Ashley Circle, NW \nSilverdale, WA 98383 \n(202) 236-9734 \nalan@amtappeals.com \n \n \n \n\ni \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS  ........................................... i \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026. ii \nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE ................. 1 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT ................................... 1 \nARGUMENT ............................................................. 3 \nI. \nThe Court Should Clarify Why the \nRespondents May Invoke the Fifth \nAmendment ................................................... 3 \nII.

The interest of amicus is in the sound \ndevelopment of law on the extraterritorial application \nof the Constitution. He submits this brief to ask the \nCourt to clarify the basis on which noncitizens can \nclaim the protections of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments\u2019 Due Process Clauses. \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nCourts have struggled to identify when the Consti-\ntution applies to foreign actors. The application of the \nDue Process Clause to foreign defendants challenging \nthe personal jurisdiction of domestic courts illustrates \nwhy the location of the alleged constitutional violation \nis key. The Court has long recognized that foreign cor-\nporations are entitled to the protections of the Due \nProcess Clause when they are haled into domestic \ncourts against their will. Under the Due Process \nClauses of the 5th or 14th Amendments, this right will \nprevent a court from exercising jurisdiction over a for-\neign corporation unless that corporation has \u201cmini-\nmum contacts\u201d with the forum. This stands in stark \ncontrast to other constitutional rights, such as the \n                                            \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part, \nand no person or entity other than amicus or his counsel funded \nits preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nFourth Amendment, where a non-citizen must \ndemonstrate \u201csubstantial connections\u201d to the United \nStates before claiming any protection. The reason for \nthis difference is the location of the alleged constitu-\ntional violation. \nThe Court applies constitutional protections when \nthe purported violation occurs within the United \nStates. And when it comes to the assertion of judicial \npower by a domestic court over a non-consenting for-\neign defendant without \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the \nforum, the due process violation occurs where the \ncourt sits\u2014within the United States. The Due Process \nClause seeks to protect a defendant from having to \ndefend itself away from its home, because doing so, \nabsent some action by the defendant to subject itself \nto suit in the forum, offends traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice. Thus, any harms are oc-\ncasioned by the defendant having to appear and de-\nfend itself in U.S. courts. \nFinally, the Court has long recognized that the \nDue Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments apply to noncitizens within the United \nStates. Because the location of the violation is a key \nconsideration and because any violation occurs in the \nUnited States, the Court should use this case as an \nopportunity to clarify why the Due Process Clause \nprotects foreign corporations and other noncitizens \nwhen they challenge a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. \nTHE COURT SHOULD CLARIFY WHY \nTHE RESPONDENTS MAY INVOKE THE \nFIFTH AMENDMENT \n \nFor over seven decades, the Court has recognized \nthe right of noncitizens, including foreign corpora-\ntions, to claim the protections of the due process \nclause, typically under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nSee, e.g., Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., \net. al., 342 U.S. 437 (1952), Insurance Corp. of Ireland, \nLtd., et. al v. Compagnie Des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 \nU.S. 694 (1982), Helicopteros Nacionales de Colum-\nbia, S.A. v. Hall et. al, 466 U.S. 408 (1984), Asahi \nMetal Industry Co. Ltd. v. Superior Court of Califor-\nnia, Solerno County, 480 U.S. 102 (1987), J. McIntyre \nMachinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), \nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, \n564 U.S. 915 (2011), and Daimler, AG v. Bauman, 571 \nU.S. 117 (2014). But it has never explained the basis \nfor such noncitizens to claim this right. It has merely \nheld that corporations chartered outside the United \nStates may not be haled into American courts unless \nthey have \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the forum. \nAt the same time, for over thirty years, the Court \nhas held that before a foreign citizen outside the \nUnited States may claim certain constitutional rights, \nthat individual must have \u201csubstantial connections\u201d \nto the United States. See, e.g., United States v. Ver-\ndugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990). This has created \nsomething of a paradox for lower courts and practi-\ntioners, which scholars have commented on: that to \n\n4 \n \n \n \nclaim a constitutional right, a noncitizen outside \nAmerica must have substantial connections to the \nUnited States, but that due process is only offended \nby a lack of minimum contacts. See, e.g., Robin J. Ef-\nfron, Solving the Nonresident Alien Due Process Par-\nadox in Personal Jurisdiction, 166 U. Mich. L. Rev. \nOnline 123 (2018); Alan Mygatt-Tauber, Determining \nConstitutional Extraterritoriality, 84 Louisiana L. \nRev. 532, 557-559 (2024). \nThis case offers the Court an opportunity  to re-\nsolve this paradox, by clearly stating that any viola-\ntion of due process\u2014which arises from subjecting \nnoncitizens (including corporations) to suit in U.S. \ncourts\u2014occurs in the United States, where the court \nresides. \nAll parties here agree that the Respondents are \nentitled to some measure of protection under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment\u2014they merely \ndisagree about what powers Congress has, consistent \nwith that Amendment, to subject the Respondents to \npersonal jurisdiction.2 Likewise, the amici in support \n                                            \n2 Plaintiffs in 24-20 disputed the proposition that the PLO and \nPA have due process rights in the trial court, but they made the \nargument only for appellate consideration, recognizing it was \nforeclosed by circuit precedent. Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Or-\nganization, 578 F. Supp. 3d 577, 585, n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). How-\never, they did not press this issue in the Court of Appeals and \nthe lower court did not address it. Additionally, they make ref-\nerence to an Office of Legal Counsel opinion indicating that the \nPLO lacks rights due to its status as an \u201cindependent sovereign \nentity.\u201d  Petition for Certiorari, Fuld, et al. v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Organization, et al, No. 24-20, at 23. This is based on the \nargument that sovereign governments are not \u201cpersons\u201d for pur-\nposes of the Fifth Amendment. Neither Petitioners nor the Office \n \n\n5 \n \n \n \nof Petitioners acknowledge that noncitizens are enti-\ntled to due process rights.3 \nThere is thus no question that Respondents have \nrights in this case. The Court should use this as an \nopportunity to explain precisely why foreign corpora-\ntions (and noncitizens more broadly) are entitled to \nthe protections of the Due Process Clause before being \nforced to litigate in forums far from home.  \n \nII. \nTHE KEY QUESTION FOR ASSESSING \nTHE APPLICABILITY OF THE CONSTI-\nTUTION IS WHERE THE ALLEGED VIO-\nLATION OCCURS \nIn determining the applicability of the Constitu-\ntion, courts have long held that one of the key ques-\ntions is the location of the violation. As early as 1922, \nwhen discussing the applicability of the Sixth Amend-\nment, the Court stated that \u201c[i]t is locality that is de-\nterminative of the application of the Constitution, in \n                                            \nof Legal Counsel argued that the PLO lacks due process rights \non the basis of being a foreign corporation. 11 Op. O.L.C. 104 \n(1987). Indeed, the Office of Legal Counsel acknowledges that \n\u201c[r]eal or juridical \u2018persons\u2019 not United States citizens possess \nsome constitutional rights while on American soil.\u201d  Id. at 105. \n3 Amicus U.S. House of Representatives argues that Respond-\nents are not entitled to due process protections, but it hinges its \nargument on Respondents\u2019 role as governing entities for the Pal-\nestinian territories and people, thus making them not \u201cpersons\u201d \nwithin the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Brief for the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives as Amicus Curiae in Support of Peti-\ntioners, Fuld et al v. Palestinian Liberation Organization, et al, \nNo. 24-20, pgs. 12-15. Amicus does not base its argument on Re-\nspondents\u2019 status as noncitizens or foreign corporations. \n \n\n6 \n \n \n \nsuch matters as judicial procedure, and not the status \nof the people who live in it.\u201d  Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 \nU.S. 298, 309 (1922).4 The Ninth Circuit similarly has \nrecognized that the location of a violation is key in its \ndecision in Brulay v. United States, 383 F.2d 345 (9th \nCir. 1967). In Brulay, the court was faced with chal-\nlenges under both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments \ndealing with a search that occurred in Mexico and sev-\neral statements made to Mexican police. Id. at 347-48. \nThe court found that the Fourth Amendment did not \napply to Mexican officials, but conducted an analysis \nunder the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 347-49. It ex-\nplained this differing treatment in a footnote. Id. at \n349, n. 5. The court, relying on Bram v. United States, \n168 U.S. 532 (1897), explained that the Fourth \nAmendment is violated when the search takes place, \nbut for the Fifth Amendment, any violation of the self-\nincrimination clause is not complete until the state-\nments are received in evidence. Id. See also, Alan \nMygatt-Tauber, Determining Constitutional Extrater-\nritoriality, 84 Louisiana L. Rev. 532, 540-544 (collect-\ning cases). \nThis Court made the same distinction between the \nFourth and Fifth Amendments in United States v. \nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990). Citing to Kas-\ntigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453 (1972), the \nCourt \nheld \nthat \n\u201c[a]lthough \nconduct \nby \nlaw \n                                            \n4 Amicus recognizes that Balzac is one of the much maligned In-\nsular Cases, and does not favor the extension of their \u201cterritorial \nincorporation doctrine.\u201d  However, the Court correctly recog-\nnized that being in the United States is one key to the applica-\ntion of the Constitution, even while wrongfully determining that \nPuerto Rico was not within the United States. \n\n7 \n \n \n \nenforcement officials prior to trial may ultimately im-\npair [the right against self-incrimination], a constitu-\ntional violation occurs only at trial.\u201d  Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez, 494 U.S. at 264. By contrast, \u201ca violation of \nthe [Fourth] Amendment is \u2018fully accomplished\u2019 at the \ntime of an unreasonable government intrusion.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted). Thus, the Court concluded, \u201cif \nthere were a Fourth Amendment violation, it occurred \nsolely in Mexico.\u201d Id. \nJustice Kennedy, in his concurrence in Verdugo-\nUrquidez, also recognized the importance of place to \ndetermining whether the defendant had constitu-\ntional rights. \u201cThe United States is prosecuting a for-\neign national in a court established under Article III, \nand all of the trial proceedings are governed by the \nConstitution. All would agree, for instance, that the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects \nthe defendant.\u201d  Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 278 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring). \n Lower courts have likewise focused on the loca-\ntion of the alleged violation to determine whether the \nConstitution applied. The Second Circuit, in examin-\ning an Establishment Clause challenge to the funding \nof sectarian schools in foreign countries, contrasted \nthe First Amendment with the Fourth Amendment. \nLamont v. Woods, 948 F.2d 825, 834 (2nd Cir. 1991). \n\u201cUnlike the Fourth Amendment violation in Verdugo, \nwe hold that any alleged Establishment Clause viola-\ntions in this case, if established, would have occurred \nin the United States \u2013 i.e., at the time appellants \ngranted money to United States entities for the bene-\nfit of foreign sectarian institutions \u2013 and not abroad \u2013 \ni.e., at the time the money was received or expended.\u201d \n\n8 \n \n \n \nId. \nFinally, Judge Sand of the Southern District of \nNew York recognized the importance of locating the \nsitus of any alleged constitutional violation in United \nStates v. Bin Laden. 132 F. Supp. 2d 168 (S.D.N.Y. \n2001). Like this Court in Bram and Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez, he recognized that \u201cany violation of the privi-\nlege against self-incrimination occurs, not at the mo-\nment law enforcement officials coerce statements \nthrough custodial interrogation, but when a defend-\nant\u2019s involuntary statements are actually used \nagainst him in an American criminal proceeding.\u201d Id. \nat 181-82. \nThus, courts at all levels of the federal system \nhave consistently held that the key question for deter-\nmining the applicability of a constitutional right is not \nthe citizenship of the person claiming the right, but \nrather the location of the alleged constitutional viola-\ntion. When it comes to the application of the Due Pro-\ncess Clause to the question of personal jurisdiction, \nthe violation occurs within the United States. \n \nIII. \nANY VIOLATION OCCURS WITHIN THE \nUNITED STATES \nThe history of personal jurisdiction law within the \nUnited States has always been tied to place. From the \nearliest examinations of the reach of personal juris-\ndiction, location has played an outsized role. As the \nCourt itself recognized in International Shoe v. Wash-\nington, \u201c[h]istorically the jurisdiction of courts to ren-\nder judgment in personam is grounded on their de \nfacto power over the defendant\u2019s person. Hence his \npresence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court \n\n9 \n \n \n \nwas prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment per-\nsonally binding him.\u201d  326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (citing \nPennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877)). \nBut even after moving away from the strictly ter-\nritorial notions of Pennoyer, place still matters. Gen-\neral jurisdiction is allowable where the corporation is \nfound at home. Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations \nS.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011) (\u201cA court may \nassert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or \nforeign-country) corporations to hear any and all \nclaims against them when their affiliations with the \nState are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render \nthem essentially at home in the foreign state.\u201d). Spe-\ncific jurisdiction arises where the injury occurred. Id. \n(\u201cIn contrast to general, all-purpose jurisdiction, spe-\ncific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of \u2018issues \nderiving from, or connected with, the very controversy \nthat establishes jurisdiction\u2019\u201d (citations omitted)). Tag \njurisdiction lies where the defendant can be found. \nMallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122, 128-29 \n(2023) (plurality opinion). And personal jurisdiction \nbased on litigation behavior results because the de-\nfendant appears and submits to the jurisdiction of the \ncourt. Insurance Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des Baux-\nites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703-705 (1982) (recogniz-\ning that the due process right can be waived). \nThis Court has consistently recognized that a \ncourt violates a defendant\u2019s due process right when it \ninappropriately exercises jurisdiction. See, e.g., Inter-\nnational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 317 (holding that the vio-\nlation of due process arises from requiring the corpo-\nration \u201cto defend the suit away from its home\u201d); J. \nMcIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, \n877 (2011) (\u201cDue process protects the defendants\u2019 \n\n10 \n \n \n \nright not to be coerced except by lawful judicial \npower.\u201d);  Id. at 884 (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction, of course, \nrestricts \u2018judicial power not as a matter of sover-\neignty, but as a matter of individual liberty,\u2019 for due \nprocess protects the individual\u2019s right to be subject \nonly to lawful power.\u201d (citing Insurance Corp. of Ir., \n456 U.S. at 702)); Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 918 (\u201cA state \ncourt\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defendants to \nthe State\u2019s coercive power, and is therefore subject to \nreview for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d). \nIn every case, this Court has held that it was the \nact of being haled into a court where the defendant is \nnot at home or lacks minimum contacts that offends \n\u201c\u2019traditional notions of fair play and substantial jus-\ntice\u2019\u201d and thus violates the Due Process Clause. Inter-\nnational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting Milliken v \nMeyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)). \nThe D.C. Circuit provided the best explanation, \nshowing that any violation of the Due Process Clause \noccurs in the United States, in GSS Group Ltd. v. Na-\ntional Port Authority, 680 F.3d 805 (D.C. Cir. 2012). \nAs the court explained: \n \nWhen a foreign corporation is summoned into \ncourt, it is being forced to defend itself. To do so, \nthe corporation must appoint a representative to \nact for it \u2013 that is, an attorney. In opposing per-\nsonal jurisdiction on due process grounds the cor-\nporation, through its attorney, makes itself pre-\nsent. And since it has been forced to appear in the \nUnited States, at least for that limited purpose, it \nis entitled to protection of the due process clause \nas interpreted in International Shoe and later \n\n11 \n \n \n \ndecisions involving foreign corporate defendants. \nAn alternative reconciliation might lie in the idea \nthat when a United States court exercises jurisdic-\ntion over a foreign corporate defendant it inflicts \ndamage on that defendant (at a minimum in the \nform of legal costs, but possibly in the form of a \njudgment) in the United States. \n \nId. at 816 (internal citations and footnotes omitted, \nemphasis in original). As the court so cogently ex-\nplained, the foreign corporate defendant is entitled to \nconstitutional protections because the violation hap-\npens in the United States. This is because, like a vio-\nlation of the Self-Incrimination Clause, a violation of \nthe Due Process Clause in these cases is complete only \nwhen the U.S. court exercises in personam jurisdic-\ntion over the corporation. See Lea Brilmayer, The Ex-\ntraterritorial Application of American Law: A Meth-\nodological and Constitutional Appraisal, 50 L. & Con-\ntemp. Probs. 11, 33 (1987) (\u201cIt is local litigation that \ntriggers the constitutional protection.\u201d). \n \nIV. \nTHE COURT HAS LONG RECOGNIZED \nTHE \nDUE \nPROCESS \nRIGHTS \nOF \nNONCITIZENS WITHIN THE UNITED \nSTATES \nThe Court has never denied that noncitizens, \nwhether individuals or corporations, are entitled to \ndue process rights within the United States. Indeed, \nthe very confusion that amicus is requesting the \nCourt to clear up arises because of its consistent \nrecognition that the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, which is identical in wording to \n\n12 \n \n \n \nthe Fifth, applies to foreign corporations. See Perkins \nv. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., et. al., 342 U.S. \n437 (1952), Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd., et. al v. \nCompagnie Des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694 \n(1982), Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia, S.A. v. \nHall et. al, 466 U.S. 408 (1984), Asahi Metal Industry \nCo. Ltd. v. Superior Court of California, Solerno \nCounty, 480 U.S. 102 (1987), J. McIntyre Machinery, \nLtd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), Goodyear Dun-\nlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915 \n(2011), and Daimler, AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 \n(2014). In each of these cases, when a lower court at-\ntempted to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign corpo-\nrate defendant, this Court held that the Due Process \nClause applied to limit how far the lower court could \nreach. \nEven in cases applying the Fifth Amendment, as \nopposed to the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court \nhas recognized that Due Process would require Con-\ngress to enact some positive law that allowed the \nlower courts to exercise jurisdiction. See, e.g., Toland \nv. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300, 330 (1838); Picquet \nv. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. 1828) (Story, Cir-\ncuit Judge) (\u201cSuch an intention [to submit nonresi-\ndent noncitizens to personal jurisdiction in the US], \nso repugnant to the general rights and sovereignty of \nother nations, ought not to be presumed, unless it is \nestablished by irresistible proof.\u201d); Arbitron Austria \nGmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 (2023) \n(\u201cIf Congress has provided an unmistakable instruc-\ntion that the provision is extraterritorial, then claims \nalleging exclusively foreign conduct may proceed.\u201d). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThus, even under a Fifth Amendment standard, \nRespondents would still be entitled to raise a Due Pro-\ncess Clause claim if a court attempted to exercise ju-\nrisdiction over them in the absence of congressional \nlegislation creating such jurisdiction. See, e.g., Omni \nCap. Int\u2019l v. Rudolph Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 101 \n(1987) (holding that because no federal law author-\nized the federal court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion, the court was bound by the state long-arm stat-\nute).

Currently, America First \nLegal is serving as counsel to U.S. Representative \nRonny Jackson (R-Tx), Stuart and Robbie Force, and \nSari Singer in a case captioned Jackson et al. v. Biden \net al., Case No. 2:22-CV-241-Z (N.D. Tx). Jackson \nalleges that the former administration violated the \nTaylor Force Act, Pub. L. No. 115-141, div. S, title X, \n132 Stat. 1143 (2018), prohibiting the United States \nGovernment from obligating economic support funds \nfor the West Bank and Gaza that directly benefit the \nPalestinian Authority.  \nTaylor Force, the child of plaintiffs Mr. and Mrs. \nForce and the Act\u2019s namesake, was a West Point \ngraduate. Taylor was murdered by a Palestinian \nterrorist. The Palestinian Authority celebrated this \n \n1 No counsel for any party has authored this brief in whole or in \npart, and no entity or person, aside from Amicus\u2019s counsel, made \nany monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \n \n \ncrime and is paying the terrorist\u2019s family a monthly \nbounty in reward for his death.  \nAs this Court quite correctly acknowledged, money \nis terrorism\u2019s life blood. \u201cThe State Department \ninforms us that \u2018[t]he experience and analysis of the \nU.S. government agencies charged with combating \nterrorism strongly suppor[t]\u2019 Congress's finding that \nall contributions to foreign terrorist organizations \nfurther their terrorism.\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian L. \nProject, 561 U.S. 1, 33 (2010). Congress passed the \nTaylor Force Act to prevent U.S. tax dollars from \nsubsidizing the Palestinian Authority and thus \nincentivizing Palestinian terrorism; as America First \nLegal has argued in that case, Congress has \nrecognized that all funds in the hands of the \nPalestinian Authority and the related Palestine \nLiberation Organization \u201cultimately inure[s] to the \nbenefit of their criminal, terrorist functions\u2014\nregardless of whether such support was ostensibly \nintended \nto \nsupport \nnon-violent, \nnon-terrorist \nactivities.\u201d Id.; see 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378c-1.  \nAccordingly, America First Legal submits this \nbrief to inform the Court about the errors in the \ndecision below and the serious consequences for the \nNation\u2019s security if the decision is not reversed. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nIn its decision below, the Second Circuit \ninvalidated the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082, Congress\u2019s \nthird attempt to allow victims of Respondents\u2019 \nterrorism to seek justice in federal courts. This Court \nshould reverse for several reasons. \nFirst, the Second Circuit misconstrued and \nmisapplied this Court\u2019s recent decision in Mallory v. \nNorfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023). \nContrary to the opinion below, Mallory does not \nrequire a defendant to receive a benefit from a forum \nin exchange for impliedly consenting to personal \njurisdiction there. See Part I.A, infra. In any event, \nRespondents did receive a benefit from the United \nStates in the form of conducting activities and \nmaintaining premises in America. See Part I.B, infra. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s response that these benefits \nwere unlawfully received is both false and irrelevant. \nSee Part I.B, infra. \nSecond, extending broad personal jurisdiction \nprotections to Respondents is especially unsound \nbecause the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, \nas originally understood, did not concern personal \njurisdiction at all, see Part II.A, infra, and certainly \nnot for foreign entities, see Part II.B, infra. \nThird, if affirmed, the decision below will have \ndevastating foreign-policy consequences and preclude \n\n4 \n \n \n \nAmerican victims of Palestinian terrorism from \nseeking justice. See Part III, infra. \nThe Court should reverse. \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit Misapplied Mallory. \nThe Second Circuit made two dispositive errors \nwhen applying this Court\u2019s recent Mallory decision. \nThe court held that (1) Respondents were required to \nreceive a benefit from the forum in exchange for \nconsenting to personal jurisdiction; and (2) any such \nbenefits received here were unlawful and thus do not \nqualify. Both holdings are erroneous. \nA. \nMallory Does Not Require Receipt of \na \nBenefit \nfrom \nthe \nForum \nin \nExchange \nfor \nConsenting \nto \nPersonal Jurisdiction. \nMallory held that personal jurisdiction can be \nestablished through implied consent, but the Second \nCircuit erroneously held that Respondents could \nimpliedly consent to personal jurisdiction only in two \nnarrow circumstances: (1) via \u201clitigation-related \nconduct,\u201d or (2) \u201cwhere [they] accept[] a benefit from \nthe forum in exchange for [their] amenability to suit \nin the forum\u2019s courts,\u201d meaning \u201creciprocal bargains.\u201d \nPet.App.20a, 22\u201324a.2 \nThat was wrong. Mallory did not turn on whether \nthe defendant (Norfolk Southern) had \u201caccept[ed] a \n \n2 \u201cPet.App.\u201d refers to the certiorari-stage appendix filed by \nPetitioners Miriam Fuld et al. on July 3, 2024 (No. 24-20). \n\n5 \n \n \n \nbenefit from\u201d the venue (Pennsylvania), but rather \nwhether the defendant had \u201ctake[n] a \u2018voluntary act\u2019 \nthat the law treats as consent.\u201d Pet.App.243a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing \nen banc). Thus, \u201c[t]he defendant need not specifically \nintend to consent to jurisdiction.\u201d Id. Mallory itself \nindicated as much. Far from being limited, \u201ca variety \nof legal arrangements have been taken to represent \u2026 \nimplied consent to personal jurisdiction consistent \nwith due process,\u201d and this Court has \u201c[n]ever \nimposed some sort of \u2018magic words\u2019 requirement\u201d for \nsuch implied consent. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 n.5 \n(cleaned up). \nTherefore, \u201c[t]he consent of the foreign entity \nmust only be knowing and voluntary and involve some \nnexus to the forum such that requiring consent would \nnot be \u2018unfair.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.243\u201344a (citing Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 141 (plurality opinion); id. at 153\u201354 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). \nThere is hardly anything \u201cunfair,\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. \nat 141, in subjecting sophisticated entities to \njurisdiction for conduct that they surely recognized \nwould qualify under the relevant statutes. \nB. \nEven \nIf \nMallory \nRequires \nRespondents \nto \nHave \nAccepted \nBenefits, They Did So. \nThe Second Circuit also misapplied its own test. \nEven if Mallory did require Respondents to have \naccepted benefits from the forum, they did so\u2014and \nthus consented to personal jurisdiction. \n\n6 \n \n \n \nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint \u201calleges that the [Palestine \nLiberation Organization (\u2018PLO\u2019)] and the [Palestinian \nAuthority (\u2018PA\u2019)] maintained premises and engaged in \nofficial activities in the United States\u201d after passage \nof the PSVJTA. Pet.App.248a (Menashi, J., dissenting \nfrom the denial of rehearing). Not only is that a \nbenefit received, but the PSJVTA expressly warned \nRespondents that it would be. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B) (recognizing that after a fifteen-day \ngrace \nperiod, \nRespondents\u2019 \n\u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d \nor \n\u201cestablish[ing] or procur[ing] any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments in the \nUnited States\u201d or \u201cconduct[ing] any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe [PLO] or the [PA]\u201d would be a benefit resulting in \npersonal jurisdiction). \nThat makes this an even easier case than Mallory \nitself, where the registration statute itself did not say \nit entailed consent to jurisdiction\u2014rather, that was in \na separate statute. 600 U.S. at 134. \nThe Second Circuit declined to count these \nbenefits, however, because the PA and PLO allegedly \nprocured them by engaging in unlawful conduct. The \ncourt claimed that \u201cfederal law has long prohibited \n[Respondents] from engaging in any activities or \nmaintaining any offices in the United States, absent \nspecific executive or statutory waivers.\u201d Pet.App.28a. \nThe court acknowledged that the U.S. government has \nlong permitted Respondents to engage in that conduct \nanyway, despite its illegality, but found that fact \nirrelevant. Pet.App.29a n.10. \n\n7 \n \n \n \nBut the court misread parts of the relevant \nprovisions. To be sure, the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism \nAct of 2006 makes it \u201cunlawful\u201d for the PA \u201cto \nestablish or maintain an office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments within \nthe jurisdiction of the United States\u201d absent certain \ncertifications. Pub. L. No. 109-446, \u00a7 7(a), 120 Stat. \n3318, 3324 (codified at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378b note). But \nthe PA does not appear to be barred under that law \nfrom \u201cconduct[ing] any activity while physically \npresent in the United States\u201d on the PA\u2019s behalf, \nwhich the PSJVTA establishes as an independent \nbenefit that will confer personal jurisdiction. 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B)(iii). Thus, there is not complete \noverlap between what the PA is barred from doing and \nwhat acts will be considered a benefit conferring \npersonal jurisdiction over the PA. \nAs Judge Menashi explained in dissent below, \nPet.App.251a n.21, Plaintiffs triggered the PSJVTA\u2019s \n\u201cconducting-and-activity\u201d provision by alleging: (1) \n\u201cwhile physically in the United States, [Respondents] \nhave conducted press conferences and created and \ndistributed informational materials,\u201d JA.4093 (Fuld \nAm. Compl. \u00b6 75); (2) made \u201ccommunications,\u201d id. \n(\u00b6 76); and (3) \u201cupdated their website and/or their \nUnited States-based social-media accounts while \nphysically inside the United States,\u201d JA.410, 414 \n(\u00b6\u00b6 85, 88); and (3) social media updates, JA.414 \n(\u00b6 88). \n \n3 \u201cJA\u201d refers to the Joint Appendix filed on January 28, 2025 (No. \n24-20). \n\n8 \n \n \n \nMore fundamentally, however, the Second \nCircuit\u2019s premise was wrong. Even if Respondents\u2019 \nconduct were all unlawful, that is no reason to \ndisregard it for purposes of personal jurisdiction. \n\u201cCongress often creates civil liability to penalize \nunlawful conduct. The whole premise of specific \npersonal jurisdiction is that wrongful conduct in the \nforum gives the forum an interest in subjecting the \nbad actor to the jurisdiction of its courts. And tag \njurisdiction, the analogue of deemed-consent statutes, \nhas never been limited only to those lawfully present \nin the forum.\u201d Pet.App.252a (Menashi, J., dissenting \nfrom the denial of rehearing) (emphases in original) \n(collecting authorities). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rule that implied consent \ncannot consider unlawful conduct leads to absurd \nresults. An \u201coutlaw who refused to obey the laws of \nthe state would be in better position than a \ncorporation which chooses to conform.\u201d Smolik v. \nPhila. & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 222 F. 148, 150 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1915) (Hand, J.). Imagine a statute \nanalogous to Pennsylvania\u2019s in Mallory, except the \nstatute instituted deemed consent for any business \nthat knowingly opened a retail store in the state. In \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s view, a lawful supermarket chain \nwith a branch in Pennsylvania would have consented \nto personal jurisdiction, but not the owner of an illicit \ndrug dispensary. \nThis Court has long recognized that unlawful \nconduct does not exempt a defendant from personal \njurisdiction. For example, in Old Wayne Mutual Life \nAss\u2019n v. McDonough, the Court noted that \u201cif an \n\n9 \n \n \n \ninsurance corporation of another state transacts \nbusiness in Pennsylvania without complying with its \nprovisions, it will be deemed to have assented to any \nvalid terms prescribed by that commonwealth as a \ncondition of its right to do business there,\u201d and would \neven \u201cbe estopped to say that it had not done what it \nshould have done in order that it might lawfully enter \nthat commonwealth and there exert its corporate \npowers.\u201d 204 U.S. 8, 21\u201322 (1907). \n* * * \nThe decision below misinterpreted Mallory, but \neven if it didn\u2019t, this Court should still reverse because \nRespondents accepted benefits from the forum\u2014and \nthus consented to personal jurisdiction. \nII. \nForeign Organizations Like Respondents \nDo Not Possess Constitutional Personal \nJurisdiction Rights in Federal Courts. \nExtending broad personal jurisdiction protections \nto Respondents was especially unsound because the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process protection was not \ntraditionally understood to limit federal courts\u2019 \njurisdiction, and especially not for foreign entities. \nA. \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause \nWas \nNot \nOriginally \nUnderstood to Limit Federal Courts\u2019 \nJurisdiction. \nThe Court has previously left \u201copen the question \nwhether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same \nrestrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by \na federal court\u201d as the Fourteenth Amendment does \nfor state courts. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. Ct. \n\n10 \n \n \n \nof Cal., S.F. Cnty., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); see also \nDouglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 254 (5th Cir. 2022) (Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf the \n\u2026 Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, as \noriginally understood, imposes the same set of \njurisdictional rules that the Supreme Court has \ndecreed pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, \nthen it [must be] prov[en] \u2026 with reference to the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s text, history, and structure.\u201d). \nThere are strong originalist arguments for why the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does not \nimpose personal jurisdiction limits at all, making it all \nthe more clear that the Second Circuit erred by \ngranting extensive protections to Respondents. \nFirst, scholarship has shown that the Fifth \nAmendment was not originally understood to limit \npersonal jurisdiction; it merely required service of \nprocess in the narrow sense. See Max Crema & \nLawrence B. Solum, The Original Meaning of \u201cDue \nProcess of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amendment, 108 Va. L. \nRev. 447 (2022); Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited \nJurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. \n1703, 1743 (2020) (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment bars the \nexecution of a federal judgment only if the federal \ncourt lacked jurisdiction. And Congress gets to answer \nth[e jurisdiction] question.\u201d); see also Pet.App.254\u2013\n55a (Menashi, J., dissenting from the denial of \nrehearing) (discussing this scholarship). \nCongress was limited only by its enumerated \npowers, because all personal jurisdiction limits were \nderived from general, international law principles, \nwhich could always be overridden by federal statutes. \nSachs, supra, at 1708\u201317; Pet.App.256\u201358a (Menashi, \n\n11 \n \n \n \nJ., dissenting from the denial of rehearing); see also, \ne.g., The Nereide, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 423 (1815) \n(\u201cTill [a contrary] act be passed, the Court is bound by \nthe law of nations which is a part of the law of the \nland.\u201d). \u201c[W]hen it comes to personal jurisdiction, due \nprocess limitations may be largely coextensive with \nthe process that Congress chooses to provide.\u201d Ingrid \nWuerth, The Due Process and Other Constitutional \nRights of Foreign Nations, 88 Fordham L. Rev. 633, \n679\u201386 (2019). \nSecond, early caselaw strengthens that view. In \nPicquet v. Swan, Justice Story, riding circuit, held \nthat \u201cindependent of some positive provision to the \ncontrary, no judgment could be rendered in the circuit \ncourt against any person, upon whom process could \nnot be personally served within the district.\u201d 19 F. \nCas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828). Even aliens \nwithout property in the United States would be \nconstitutionally \u201camenable to the jurisdiction of any \ncircuit court.\u201d Id. If Congress passed a statute \nauthorizing jurisdiction, \u201ca subject of England, or \nFrance, or Russia, having a controversy with one of \nour own citizens, may be summoned from the other \nend of the globe to obey our process, and submit to the \njudgment of our courts.\u201d Id. \u201cIf Congress had \nprescribed such a rule, the court would certainly be \nbound to follow it, and proceed upon the law,\u201d id. at \n615, even though such a rule would be \u201crepugnant to \nthe general rights and sovereignty of other nations,\u201d \nid. at 613. \nThis Court later adopted Story\u2019s logic in Toland v. \nSprague, which held that an American plaintiff \nattaching the American property of a foreign \n\n12 \n \n \n \ndefendant was \u201cunjust\u201d and unauthorized by statute. \n37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300, 328\u201329 (1838). Accepting the \n\u201cgreat force\u201d of the reasoning in Picquet, this Court \nexplained that it reached this conclusion only \n\u201cindependent[] \nof \npositive \nlegislation\u201d \nbecause \n\u201cCongress might have authorized civil process from \nany circuit court, to have run into any state of the \nUnion,\u201d even for \u201cpersons in a foreign jurisdiction.\u201d Id. \nat 328, 330. \nThis early caselaw tracks the contemporary \nunderstanding that \u201cdue process\u201d meant adherence to \nthe \u201claw of the land\u201d as decided by the legislature. \nWriting just five years after Picquet, Justice Story \nnoted that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \nderived from \u201cthe language of magna charta, \u2018nec \nsuper eum ibimus, nec super eum mittimus, nisi per \nlegale juciium parium suorum, vel per legem terrae,\u2019 \nneither will we pass upon him, or condemn him, but \nby the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of \nthe land.\u201d 3 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the \nConstitution of the United States \u00a7 1783 (Hillard, Gray \n& Co. 1833) (emphasis added).4 And \u201claw of the land\u201d \nmeant the rules crafted by the legislature: \u201cthe law of \nthe land \u2026 depends not upon the arbitrary will of any \njudge; but is permanent, fixed, and unchangeable, \nunless by authority of parliament.\u201d 1 William \n \n4 See also Alexander Hamilton, A Letter from Phocion to the \nConsiderate Citizens of New York (Jan. 1784), reprinted in 3 The \nPapers of Alexander Hamilton 485, 485\u201386 (Harold C. Syrett & \nJacob E. Cooke eds., 1962) (noting that \u201cif we enquire what is \nmeant by the law of the land, the best commentators will tell us \nthat it means due process of law\u201d) (citing 2 Edward Coke, \nInstitutes of the Lawes of England 50 (1642)). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England \n*141\u201342 (1753) (emphasis added). \nAlso telling is the absence of early rulings applying \nthe Fifth Amendment to personal jurisdiction \ndisputes. It was \u201cnot until the Civil War [that] a single \ncourt, state or federal, [would] hold a personal-\njurisdiction statute invalid on due process grounds.\u201d \nSachs, supra, at 1712. \nThere is also a solid logical reason why the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause would not impose \nthe same limits on federal court as the International \nShoe line of cases does on state courts via the \nFourteenth Amendment. Congress, unlike States, can \nlegislate beyond its borders. If Congress can regulate \nconduct beyond the United States, why can\u2019t it also \ntake the lesser step of subjecting foreign entities to \npersonal jurisdiction? Congress already routinely does \nso. Several securities statutes give the federal courts \njurisdiction over claims related to \u201cconduct occurring \noutside the United States that has a foreseeable \nsubstantial effect within the United States,\u201d while \nsimultaneously authorizing nationwide service and \npersonal jurisdiction. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77v(c), 78aa(b); \n80a-43. Other statutes even allow for worldwide \nservice. See id. \u00a7 22. \nCiting this record, judges across the country have \nreasoned that the Fifth Amendment simply does not \ncontain the same sort of personal jurisdiction \nprotections as the Fourteenth Amendment. See \nPet.App.254\u201355a (Menashi, J., dissenting from the \ndenial of rehearing); Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, \n598 (D.C.

In \nthe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992 (ATA), Congress \nprovided a civil remedy to any U.S. national injured by \nan act of international terrorism.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  \nAnd in the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \ndiv. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082-85 (codified at \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)), Congress responded to an earlier \nSecond Circuit decision by expressly providing federal \ncourts with personal jurisdiction over defendants in \nATA cases under specific circumstances.  Petitioners\u2014\nvictims of terrorist attacks committed, directed, or incited \nby the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine \nLiberation Organization (PLO)\u2014are precisely whom \nCongress intended the ATA and PSJVTA to benefit. \n \n1 Consistent with Supreme Court Rule 37.6, the House states \nthat no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part \nand that no person or entity other than the House or its counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief.  Consistent with Supreme Court Rule \n37.2, the House states that counsel for the parties received timely \nnotice of intent to file this brief. \n2 The House\u2019s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) \nunanimously authorized the filing of this amicus brief.  BLAG \ncomprises the Honorable Mike Johnson, Speaker of the House, \nthe Honorable Steve Scalise, Majority Leader, the Honorable Tom \nEmmer, Majority Whip, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, Minority \nLeader, and the Honorable Katherine Clark, Minority Whip, and \nit \u201cspeaks for, and articulates the institutional position of, the \nHouse in all litigation matters.\u201d  Rule II.8(b), Rules of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, 118th Cong. (2023), https://perma.cc/ \nDK3P-55K6. \n\n2 \nThe Second Circuit, however, held below that the \nPSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause.  Pet. App. 6a.  That decision is the latest in a \nseries of Second Circuit decisions that, by depriving \nfederal courts of personal jurisdiction over interna-\ntional terrorists in most circumstances, frustrates \nCongress\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism.  The decision \nbelow also improperly cabins Congress\u2019s broad consti-\ntutional authority to legislate extraterritorially to protect \nU.S. interests, threatening to undermine numerous \nother federal statutes. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari to review the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s highly consequential and deeply \nproblematic decision.  \nThis Court\u2019s intervention is necessary: the decision \nbelow held that a federal statute (the PSJVTA) is \nfacially unconstitutional and is the third time that the \nSecond Circuit has hollowed out the ATA by concluding \nthat federal courts may exercise personal jurisdiction \nover foreign terrorists only in rare circumstances.  \nCongress has already enacted two laws to address \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s damaging decisions to no avail.  \nSee Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. 3183, 1384-85; \nPSJVTA, \u00a7 903.  If this latest ruling is allowed to stand, \nAmerican victims of international terrorism will be \nunlikely to get their day in court, and foreign terrorists \nwill not need to worry about civil judgments draining \ntheir resources.  Yet these are the exact policy objec-\ntives that Congress has consistently attempted to \nadvance in the ATA, ATCA, and PSJVTA.  Given the \nimportant interests at stake, this Court should end \nthe back-and-forth between Congress and the Second \nCircuit and definitively resolve whether the Fifth \n\n3 \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause precludes Congress \nfrom providing an effective civil remedy to American \nvictims of foreign terrorist attacks. \nOn the merits, the decision below made errors that \ncreate uncertainty and call other federal statutes into \nquestion.  By incorrectly treating Respondents as \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Fifth Amendment, it gives these \nde facto governments more constitutional rights than \nboth state governments and foreign governments \nrecognized by the Executive Branch, which are not \nprotected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause.  It then compounds that error by importing \npersonal jurisdiction restrictions from the Fourteenth \nAmendment into the Fifth Amendment.  But that \nmove is inconsistent with the original meaning of the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which does \nnot constrain Congress\u2019s ability to subject foreign \ndefendants to the jurisdiction of federal courts.  This \nmakes sense because the Fourteenth Amendment \nrestricts state courts, and states generally have little \npower to legislate beyond their borders.  Congress, by \ncontrast, has sweeping constitutional authority to do \nso.  The Court should grant the petition and correct \nthese errors. \nARGUMENT \nI. The decision below invalidated a federal \nstatute and warrants review \nThis Court should grant review because the decision \nbelow facially invalidated a federal statute and is the \nlatest in a line of Second Circuit decisions that sub-\nstantially undermines Congress\u2019s efforts to combat \ninternational terrorism.  Congress has twice attempted \nunsuccessfully to address the Second Circuit\u2019s concerns, \nand it is now time for this Court to step in and provide \n\n4 \nguidance.  After all, the decision below impairs Congress\u2019s \nability to legislate extraterritorially to deter terrorism \nand to advance many other important objectives.     \nA. The Second Circuit held that a federal \nstatute that furthers important national \nsecurity and foreign policy interests is \nfacially unconstitutional \nWhen a lower court invalidates a federal statute, \nthis Court typically grants certiorari because of the \ngravity of the case.  See Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, \n392 (2019).  This is true even absent a circuit split.  See, \ne.g., Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 498 (1999) (\u201cAlthough \nthe decision of the Court of Appeals is consistent with \nthe views of other federal courts that have addressed \nthe issue, we granted certiorari because of the importance \nof the case.\u201d  (footnote and citation omitted)).  Indeed, \ndeclaring a statute unconstitutional is the \u201cgravest \nand most delicate duty that this Court is called on to \nperform.\u201d  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927).  \nConsequently, the Court has a heightened obligation \n\u201cto review the exercise of the grave power of annulling \nan Act of Congress.\u201d  United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. \n63, 65 (1965) (citation omitted). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s facial invalidation of a federal \nstatute alone justifies this Court\u2019s review.  But the \nimportant interests at stake\u2014compensating American \nvictims of international terrorism and deterring \nterrorists\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s repeated attempts \nto stymie a series of Congressional efforts to advance \nthese vital interests heighten the need for review here.  \nSee, e.g., Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 412 \n(2002) (granting certiorari \u201cbecause of the importance \nof th[e] issue to the Government in its conduct of the \nNation\u2019s foreign affairs\u201d).  \n\n5 \nAs part of its broad authority over foreign affairs, see \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cls. 3, 10, Congress has decided \nit is in the national security and foreign policy interests \nof the United States to permit American victims of \ninternational terrorism to seek compensation from \nterrorists in federal courts.   \nOver thirty years ago, Congress overwhelmingly \npassed the ATA, which has been called \u201can important \ninstrument in the fight against terrorism\u201d and in \nthe effort to provide relief to American victims of \ninternational terrorism.  See Antiterrorism Act of 1991: \nHearing on H.R. 2222 Before the Subcomm. on Intell. \nProp. & Jud. Admin. of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, \n102d Cong. 10 (1992) (letter from Sen. Grassley).  \nThrough the ATA\u2019s provisions for damages and broad \nliability \u201cat any point along the causal chain of terror-\nism,\u201d Congress intended to \u201cinterrupt, or at least imperil, \nthe flow of money\u201d to international terrorists.  S. Rep. \nNo. 102-342, at 22 (1992).  In other words, Congress \nenacted the ATA to strike at \u201cthe resource that keeps \n[terrorists] in business\u2014their money.\u201d  138 Cong. Rec. \n33629 (Oct. 7, 1992) (statement of Sen. Grassley). \nFor nearly a quarter century, courts exercised \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents in ATA cases.  \nHowever, in 2016, the Second Circuit held that the due \nprocess analysis for personal jurisdiction is \u201cbasically \nthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.\u201d  Pet. App. 156a.  Thus, federal courts \ncould not exercise personal jurisdiction over interna-\ntional terrorists, unless those terrorists were \u201cat home\u201d \nin the United States, \u201cexpressly aimed\u201d their attacks \nat the United States, or had sufficient \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d within the United States.  Id. at 157a-182a \n(alteration and citation omitted).  This decision \ndramatically limited the ATA\u2019s extraterritorial reach.   \n\n6 \nIn direct response to that \u201cflawed\u201d decision, H. Rep. \nNo. 115-858, at 6-8 (2018), Congress overwhelmingly \npassed the ATCA.  Congress, through the ATCA, \nintended to improve the ATA, including by addressing \n\u201clower court decisions that have allowed entities that \nsponsor terrorist activity against U.S. nationals overseas \nto avoid\u201d federal court jurisdiction.  Id. at 3.  It \nprovided that a defendant \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in ATA cases if, \nmore than 120 days after enactment, it accepted certain \n\u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d or maintained an office within \nthe United States while \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or \nsuspension of\u201d a federal law that forbids the PLO and \nits constituent groups from operating such an office.  \nPub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4.  By enacting the ATCA, \nCongress sought \u201cto halt, deter, and disrupt interna-\ntional terrorism and to compensate U.S. victims of \ninternational terrorism.\u201d  H. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7-8.   \nHowever, the ATCA did not have its intended effect \nbecause the Second Circuit held that neither of the \nATCA\u2019s factual predicates were satisfied here.  Pet. \nApp. 132a.  Thus, the legislation had no impact on \nfederal courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction over Respondents.   \nCongress then enacted the PSJVTA in another \nattempt to give American victims of international \nterrorism their day in federal court.  165 Cong. Rec. \nS7182 (daily ed. Dec. 19, 2019) (statements of Sens. \nLankford and Grassley).  The PSJVTA provided \nRespondents a choice.  They would be deemed to \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they \ncontinued their \u201cpay to slay\u201d policies, see 18 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A), where they \u201cpay terrorists or families \nof terrorists who injured or killed Americans,\u201d which \nare \u201cnothing short of an incitement for further acts of \nterrorism,\u201d 165 Cong. Rec. S7183 (daily ed. Dec. 19, \n\n7 \n2019) (statement of Sen. Grassley).  Likewise, Re-\nspondents would be deemed to consent to personal \njurisdiction in such cases if they conducted certain \nactivities in the United States, such as maintaining an \noffice, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B), unless a statutory \nexception applied, see id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3).  Congress thus \ncarefully crafted the PSJVTA to balance a host of \nforeign policy and national security interests. \nThe Second Circuit, however, has once again frus-\ntrated Congressional efforts to combat terrorism.  In \nthis latest decision, it held that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provision violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause.  Pet. App. 45a.  It explained that \nconsent may be implied through litigation-related \nconduct or another arrangement that shows a reciprocal \nbargain.  See id. at 20a.  The PSJVTA, according to the \nSecond Circuit, was not one such arrangement because, \nin its view, Respondents received no government benefit \nfrom the statute.  Id. at 21a, 25a-28a.   \nThe time has arrived for this Court to weigh in on \nthis matter.  The interests at stake are momentous.  \nSee Holder v. Humanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28, \n35 (2010) (noting \u201ccombatting terrorism is an urgent \nobjective of the highest order\u201d); Gamble v. United \nStates, 587 U.S. 678, 687 (2019) (holding that the \n\u201cmurder of a U.S. national is an offense to the United \nStates as much as it is to the country where the \nmurder occurred\u201d).  And Congress has done what it can \nto address this problem.  Congress has now enacted \ntwo statutes (the ATCA and PSJVTA) on a widely \nbipartisan basis to address Second Circuit decisions \ndramatically curtailing the reach and effectiveness \nof the ATA.  But due to subsequent Second Circuit \ndecisions, neither statute has fixed the problem. \n\n8 \nThe ping-pong between Congress and the Second \nCircuit has gone on long enough.  If the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause precludes Congress from \nproviding American victims of international terrorism \nan effective civil remedy in most circumstances, \nthis Court should be the one to say so.  Conversely, if \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does not \nrestrict Congress\u2019s ability to subject Respondents to \nthe jurisdiction of the federal courts in ATA cases, as \nthe House believes, this Court should grant review and \nreverse the Second Circuit\u2019s judgment.   \nB. The \ndecision \nbelow \nundermines \nCongress\u2019s \nbroad \npower \nto \nlegislate \nextraterritorially and injects uncertainty \ninto the legislative process \nCongress\u2019s extraterritorial legislative efforts extend \nwell beyond its interests in combatting terrorism and \ncompensating terrorist victims.  Congress has enacted \nstatutes that apply extraterritorially in numerous areas: \nantitrust, copyright, securities regulation, trademark, \ncorporate law and governance, bankruptcy and tax, \ncriminal, environmental, civil rights, and labor laws.  \nSee Austen L. Parrish, Evading Legislative Jurisdiction, \n87 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1673, 1707 n.6 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  The decision below thus interferes with \nCongress\u2019s constitutional authority to legislate extra-\nterritorially not only to combat terrorism but to \nadvance American interests in many other contexts. \n1.  The decision below effectively shrinks Congress\u2019s \npower to legislate extraterritorially to that of a state \nlegislature, which has little to no power to do so.  The \nSecond Circuit held that Congress\u2019s ability to authorize \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014which courts need to decide \ncases brought under an extraterritorial law\u2014is restricted \nin \u201cbasically the same\u201d way as that of a state legislature.  \n\n9 \nSee Pet. App. 17a, 47a-49a (citation omitted).  Those \nrestrictions on states \u201care a consequence of territorial \nlimitations on the[ir] power.\u201d  See Bristol-Myers Squibb \nCo. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 263 (2017) \n(citation omitted).  By imposing a corresponding terri-\ntorial limit on Congress, the decision below severely \nrestricts federal courts from exercising jurisdiction \nover disputes that stem from any acts committed \noutside the United States.  But the whole purpose of \nextraterritorial legislation is to reach conduct outside \nthe United States.  This cabining of jurisdiction thus \nblunts Congress\u2019s power to legislate extraterritorially.  \nCf. Personal Jurisdiction\u2014General Jurisdiction\u2014\nConsent-by-Registration Statutes\u2014International Shoe \nand Its Progeny\u2014Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway \nCo., 137 Harv. L. Rev. 360, 368 (2023) (\u201cThe courts of \nappeals have tended to gut the applicability of \u2026 \nfederal statutes [that create extraterritorial causes of \naction and authorize personal jurisdiction without \ntying it to state long-arm statutes, as the ATA does,] \nby limiting the territorial reach of federal courts \u2026.\u201d). \nHere is why.  The court below held that courts must \nhave (a) general personal jurisdiction, meaning the \ndefendant is at home in the United States, (b) specific \npersonal jurisdiction, meaning the defendant engages \nin conduct in the United States that is related to the \nunderlying lawsuit, or (c) the defendant\u2019s voluntary \nagreement to proceed in the forum, meaning the \ndefendant\u2019s consent.  See Pet. App. 17a-19a.  These \nwill usually not supply jurisdiction when the injury-\ncausing conduct\u2014presumably caused by a foreign \nactor\u2014takes place outside the United States. \nGeneral personal jurisdiction\u2014which requires a \ndefendant to have certain contacts with the United \nStates\u2014will almost never allow a court to exercise \n\n10 \npersonal jurisdiction over a foreign actor who harms \nan American abroad.  See Douglass v. Nippon Yusen \nKabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 276 (5th Cir. 2022) \n(Elrod, J., dissenting) (explaining that foreign defendants \nwill \u201c[r]arely\u201d be at home in the United States, so a \ncourt exercising general personal jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant is \u201can \u2018exceptional case\u2019 very seldom \nencountered in real life\u201d (citation omitted)), cert. denied \nsub nom. Douglass v. Kaisha, 143 S. Ct. 1021 (2023).  \nLikewise, it is hard to imagine specific personal juris-\ndiction faring much better when dealing with foreign \nactors who injure Americans abroad.  This is because \nthose foreign actors would need to have litigation-\nrelevant contacts with the United States.  See Pet. App. \n8a-9a (noting no specific personal jurisdiction when \nterrorist attacks took place outside the country). \nAs one academic put it, the requirements of general \nand specific personal jurisdiction (as set out in this \nCourt\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment precedent and applied \nby some lower courts in the Fifth Amendment context) \n\u201chave had the effect of neutering numerous federal \nstatutory causes of action, including the federal \nstatutory cause of action created by Congress under \nthe ATA.\u201d  See Aaron D. Simowitz, Federal Personal \nJurisdiction and Constitutional Authority, 56 N.Y.U.

The decision did so by adopting a \ndefinition of Due Process, and a conception of the territo-\nrial boundaries on Congress\u2019s power to legislate against \nextraterritorial threats, which will severely hamper Con-\ngress\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism. Amici therefore sub-\nmit this brief to urge this Court to reverse this erroneous \nand troubling decision. \nINTRODUCTION AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nFor decades, starving terror networks of funding has \nbeen a central focus of Congress\u2019s national security ef-\nforts, one that has been singularly effective in bringing \nterror sponsors to justice, reducing terrorists\u2019 destructive \ncapabilities, and saving American lives. Private civil ac-\ntions have proven to be an integral component of that \nstrategy. Such suits provide a measure of justice to terror \n\n3 \n \n \nvictims and their families and impose uniquely effective fi-\nnancial pressures on the perpetrators, directors, and \nsponsors of terror.  \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the ATA unlocked private \ncivil lawsuits\u2019 terror-fighting potential, removing many of \nthe jurisdictional barriers that once made it difficult to \nreach terror sponsors like the PLO and PA. And after new \njurisdictional barriers emerged to prevent American \nplaintiffs from haling the PLO and PA into U.S. courts, \nCongress, with input from the Executive Branch, re-\nsponded with new legislation, most recently the Promot-\ning Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of \n2019 (PSJVTA), Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903. \nThat act restored the ATA\u2019s full effectiveness against the \nPLO and PA, by declaring their post-enactment presence \nin the United States, and their post-enactment support of \nterrorism, to constitute consent to ATA suits in U.S. \ncourts. But the court of appeals in this case held the \nPSJVTA unconstitutional through a novel and erroneous \ninterpretation of the Due Process clause that disregards \nthe understanding of Congress\u2019s virtually unfettered \npower to legislate against extraterritorial threats that has \npersisted since the founding, and instead subjects Con-\ngress\u2019s powers to even greater territorial restraints than \nthose imposed on the States. \nThis decision effectively eviscerates the ATA\u2014con-\ntravening the considered judgment of Congress, sapping \nstrength from a key component of the Nation\u2019s anti-ter-\nrorism strategy, and dangerously constricting Congress\u2019s \npowers to meet an ever-wider variety of extraterritorial \nthreats. The decision will leave the Political Branches with \nsharply limited options to staunch the continued, admit-\n\n4 \n \n \nted, and unapologetic support of terrorism against Amer-\nican citizens by Respondents, even as those organizations \ncontinue to operate freely on U.S. soil. It will also allow \nRespondents to evade responsibility for past acts of terror \nthat have left scores of Americans dead and scores of fam-\nilies to grieve with no chance at justice. \nThis case therefore raises constitutional questions of \nthe highest order about Congress\u2019s authority to combat \nterrorism, and about whether Due Process Clause protec-\ntions designed to limit the States\u2019 power to encroach on \nthe sovereignty of sister States ought to be applied to shel-\nter foreign terrorists and their sponsors, including those \nwhich maintain a presence in the U.S.  \nThis Court should take this case to reverse the decision \nbelow, remove the barriers preventing the PSJVTA\u2019s con-\nstitutional operation, and confirm Congress\u2019s authority to \ncombat terror occurring outside the borders of the United \nStates where the Political Branches have determined that \nfederal interests require the exercise of such authority. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe lower court has nullified an Act of Congress \nand eviscerated a critical component of \nCongress\u2019s comprehensive anti-terror scheme. \nIn the proceedings below in this case, Judge Menashi, \njoined by Chief Judge Livingston and Judges Sullivan and \nPark, identified this case as having \u201cexceptional im-\nportance.\u201d Pet. App. 232a. That description is entirely ac-\ncurate. The decision below facially invalidates an Act of \nCongress as unconstitutional, which, \u201con its own,\u201d makes \nthis case worthy of immediate review. Id. 233a. This \nCourt\u2019s \u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant certiorari any time \u201ca \nlower court has invalidated a federal statute.\u201d Iancu v. \n\n5 \n \n \nBrunetti, 139 S. Ct. 2294, 2298 (2019). And for that reason \nalone, it would be appropriate for this Court to grant cer-\ntiorari in this case.  \nBut this Court\u2019s review is especially critical because \nthe PSJVTA is not just any federal statute. It is a key com-\nponent of Congress\u2019s comprehensive scheme to protect \nAmericans from being harmed by international terror-\nism\u2014and a key for unlocking the terror-fighting potential \nof another federal statute that had been hobbled by im-\nproper constitutional interpretation: the ATA, Pub. L. \n102\u2013572, tit. X, \u00a7 1003, 106 Stat. 4522-4524  (Oct. 29, 1992) \n(codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2331 et seq.). Con-\ngress enacted the ATA to \u201cremove the jurisdictional hur-\ndles in the courts confronting victims [of international ter-\nrorism]\u201d\u2014and to ensure that Respondents (and others \nlike them) can be held accountable for harms they have \ninflicted on innocent Americans abroad. The Antiterror-\nism Act of 1991: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Intel-\nlectual Property & Judicial Admin. of the H. Comm. on \nthe Judiciary, 102d Cong. 10 (1992) (1992 Hearing) (letter \nfrom Sen. Grassley); 137 Cong. Rec. S4511-04 (1991) \n(statement of Sen. Grassley) (same); 137 Cong. Rec. \nS1771-01 (1991) (statement of Sen. Grassley) (same).  \nYet the decision under review has imposed new juris-\ndictional barriers that undermine the ATA, even after \nCongress amended the law to remove such barriers, effec-\ntively placing the PLO and PA beyond the reach of Con-\ngress and American courts, notwithstanding the PLO\u2019s \nand PA\u2019s continued enjoyment of the benefits of operating \nin the United States and their continuing payments to ter-\nrorists for murdering and maiming U.S. citizens. That re-\nsult is not required by the Due Process Clause and should \nnot be left standing. \n\n6 \n \n \nA. Congress enacted the ATA to overcome \njurisdictional obstacles to holding terrorists \naccountable in U.S. courts. \nCongress\u2019s impetus for enacting the ATA dates back to \nthe 1970s and 1980s, when the Nation was stunned by a \nseries of brazen terror attacks against Americans abroad. \n136 Cong. Rec. S4592, S4594 (1990) (statement of Sen. He-\nflin). These included the PLO\u2019s kidnapping and murder of \nU.S. Ambassador Cleo Noel in Sudan in 1973; Hezbollah\u2019s \nsuicide truck-bomb attack that killed 220 U.S. Marines in \nBeirut in 1983; Hezbollah terrorists\u2019 murder of U.S. Navy \nDiver Robert Stethem during the hijacking of TWA Flight \n847 in 1985; and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which \nended the lives of more than 250 people above Lockerbie, \nScotland in 1988. \n1. These horrendous attacks of the 70s and 80s brought \nattention to a significant \u201cgap\u201d in the Nation\u2019s legal strat-\negy for combatting oversees terrorism, 136 Cong. Rec. \nS14283 (1990) (statement of Sen. Grassley).

A list of amici and \ntheir academic positions is set forth in the Appendix.1 \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThis Court reaffirmed in Mallory v. Norfolk \nSouthern Railway Co. that \u201cexpress or implied \nconsent\u201d remains a constitutionally sound basis for \nestablishing personal jurisdiction over a defendant, \nand that consent may be given \u201cby word or deed.\u201d \n600 U.S. 122, 138 (2023) (plurality) (emphasis added); \nsee also id. at 153 (Alito, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment); see generally Robin J. \nEffron & Aaron D. Simowitz, The Long Arm of \nConsent, 80 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am. L. 179 (2024).  In \nthe decision below, the Second Circuit nonetheless \nheld that the conduct deemed to constitute consent \nunder the PSJVTA \u201ccannot support a fair and \nreasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 voluntary \nagreement to proceed in a federal forum,\u201d and \u201clack[s] \nany of the indicia of valid consent previously \nrecognized in the case law.\u201d Pet. App. 26a. \nIn so holding, the Second Circuit effectively \nconcluded that, although a party may validly consent \nto personal jurisdiction in a given forum by \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart, and no person or entity other than amicus or his counsel \nfunded its preparation or submission. Sup. Ct. R. 37.6. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n \npurchasing a cruise ship ticket with a forum-selection \nclause tucked into three pages of fine print on the \nticket\u2019s back, Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, \n499 U.S. 585 (1991), engaging in discovery abuses, \nIns. Corp. of Ireland Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites \nde Guinee, 456 U.S. 694 (1982), or mistakenly \nentering a general appearance, York v. Texas, 137 \nU.S. 15 (1890), the same result does not obtain for \nsophisticated, well-counseled entities fully apprised of \nthe consequences of their actions. As a result, the \ndecision below gives more protection to defendants \nthat the elected branches concluded should be suable \nunder the Anti-Terrorism Act than it does to users of \nGoogle products who are required to adjudicate their \ndisputes in California, regardless of where their \ndisputes arose.2 Such a result cannot be reconciled \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents.  \nTo that end, the Court does not need to analyze \nhow the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\u2019 Due \nProcess Clauses might impose different limitations on \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction; instead, Mallory \nand basic, already settled propositions about the Fifth \nAmendment control the outcome of this case. Mallory \nsets the standard for personal jurisdiction under the \nFourteenth Amendment, and all agree that the Fifth \nAmendment is at least as generous to plaintiffs as the \n \n2 See Google Terms of Service, https://policies.google.com/ \nterms?hl=en-US (last accessed February 3, 2025) (\u201c[A]ll disputes \narising out of or relating to these terms . . . will be resolved \nexclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, \nCalifornia, USA, and you and Google consent to personal \njurisdiction in those courts.\u201d); see also TradeComet.com LLC v. \nGoogle, Inc., 647 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 2011). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n \nFourteenth Amendment in that context. Therefore, \nbecause the PSJVTA satisfies Mallory, assertions of \npersonal jurisdiction under the Act must satisfy the \nFifth Amendment. The Court need go no further in \nreversing the decision below. \nSeparately, the Court has every reason to defer to \nthe decision of the elected branches in matters \nimplicating foreign affairs and the regulation of \nterrorism, in which judicial deference is at its zenith, \nespecially where the action of the elected branches \ncame in direct response to prior judicial decisions in \nthis case. The Second Circuit\u2019s jurisdictional decision \nundercut Congress\u2019s authority in this area and, in \ndoing so, ignored law that already polices Congress\u2019s \npower to regulate international terrorism. In this \ncase, separation of powers principles warrant \nheightened deference to the elected branches, not the \nheightened skepticism with which the Second Circuit \nviewed the PSJVTA.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe \nDecision \nBelow \nMisconstrues \nThis Court\u2019s \u201cConsent\u201d Precedents \nAs the Mallory plurality explained, under this \nCourt\u2019s precedents \u201ca variety of \u2018actions of the \ndefendant\u2019 \nthat \nmay \nseem \nlike \ntechnicalities \nnonetheless can \u2018amount to a legal submission to the \njurisdiction of the court.\u2019\u201d 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality) \n(quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704\u201305) (offering as \nexamples \u201c[f]ailing to comply with certain pre-trial \norders, signing a contract with a forum selection \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \nclause, [and] accepting an in-state benefit with \njurisdictional strings attached\u201d). The PSJVTA fits \ncomfortably within these parameters of consent-based \njurisdiction. \nA. The Court\u2019s consent-based personal-jurisdiction \nprecedents have not always been decided on \nconstitutional grounds.  For instance, in Shute, which \nanalyzed the enforceability of a forum selection \nclause, the Court invoked the canon of constitutional \navoidance and concluded that, because the forum-\nselection clause was \u201cdispositive . . . , we need not \nconsider petitioner\u2019s constitutional argument as to \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d 499 U.S. at 589\u201390; see also \nM/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 10\u2013\n11 (1972) (forum selection clauses \u201cshould be enforced \nunless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to \nbe \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the circumstances\u201d). \nFollowing \nShute, \nconsent-based \npersonal-\njurisdiction has been viewed through a maximalist \nlens, with courts commonly upholding forum-selection \nclauses against parties \u201cwho have \u2018consented\u2019 to the \nforum via a boilerplate agreement that they may \nneither read nor comprehend.\u201d John F. Coyle & Robin \nJ. Effron, Forum Selection Clauses, Non-Signatories, \nand Personal Jurisdiction, 97 Notre Dame L. Rev. \n187, 230 (2021). Shrinkwrap, clickwrap, and end user \nlicense \nagreements \ncontaining \nforum-selection \nclauses have multiplied exponentially, yet their \n\u201creasonableness\u201d is almost always upheld. John F. \nCoyle, \u201cContractually Valid\u201d Forum Selection Clauses, \n108 Iowa L. Rev. 127, 155\u201356 (2022).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nThe decision below dismissed Shute as a case \n\u201cenforc[ing] \nthe \nexpress \njurisdiction-conferring \nlanguage \nof \na \ncontract \nafter \naccounting \nfor \nconsiderations of notice and fundamental fairness,\u201d \nrather than one involving the \u201cinference\u201d of consent. \nPet. App. 25a. But many post-Shute lower-court \ndecisions simply dispense with the need to conduct \nany constitutional due process analysis when \npresented with an enforceable forum selection clause. \nSee Coyle & Effron, supra, at 232\u201334 (collecting \ncases). Either way, treating forum-selection clauses as \nthe Second Circuit did\u2014as merely another contract \nprovision to be enforced\u2014fails to recognize the \nsignificant constitutional assumptions embedded in \ntheir enforceability. \nIn that regard, the Second Circuit wrongly rejected \nthe \nFuld \nPetitioners\u2019 \nargument \nthat \nthe \nconstitutionality of the PSJVTA follows a fortiori from \nShute. Millions of Americans \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction \nevery day by dint of continuing to use products and \nservices whose terms and conditions contain forum-\nselection clauses. A consumer\u2019s continued use of such \nproducts or services is a continued manifestation of \nconsent to personal jurisdiction by deed; and it is her \nintentional conduct of continued use that gives rise to \nconsent rather than any affirmative act with respect \nto the forum-selection clause generally. If such \nboilerplate provisions satisfy constitutional due \nprocess, then a federal statute giving notice to \nsophisticated, well-counseled defendants that their \nengagement in specified conduct will be deemed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \nconsent to personal jurisdiction must be constitutional \nas well. \nB. The decision below went equally astray in \ndrawing an artificial distinction between \u201cdeemed \nconsent,\u201d which it determined required \u201csome \nexchange of benefits,\u201d and \u201ccertain litigation-related \nconduct,\u201d which it described vaguely as \u201c[an]other \nmeans of demonstrating consent.\u201d Pet. App. 36a n.13. \nIn so doing, it ignored the central principle that \u201c[t]he \nactions of the defendant may amount to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court, whether \nvoluntary or not.\u201d Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704\u201305 \n(emphasis added). In Bauxites, the Court held that \ndue process under the Fourteenth Amendment is not \nviolated when courts equate the failure to comply with \njurisdictional discovery orders with a \u201can admission of \nthe want of merit in the asserted defense\u201d of personal \njurisdiction. 456 U.S. at 705. In that sense, adverse \ninferences \narising \nfrom \nlitigation \nconduct \nfit \ncomfortably within the consent regime approved by \nthe Court in Mallory, and it is unsurprising that \nMallory drew so extensively on Bauxites to drive home \nthe point that \u201c\u2018actions of the defendant\u2019 that may \nseem like technicalities nonetheless can \u2018amount to a \nlegal submission to the jurisdiction of a court.\u2019\u201d \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 146 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. \nat 704\u201305)); id. at 148 (Jackson, J., concurring) \n(discussing Bauxites).3  \n \n3 The distinction drawn by the Second Circuit between \nconduct within litigation and conduct without (Pet. App. 32a\u2013\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \nII. \nThe Reasoning of Mallory Answers \nThis Case \nDespite the Second Circuit\u2019s disavowal of Mallory, \nsee Pet. App. 32a\u201335a, the Court can decide the \ninstant case on the authority of Mallory and basic, \nundisputed assumptions about the Fifth Amendment.  \nA. As Mallory instructs, \u201c\u2018express or implied \nconsent\u2019 \ncan \ncontinue \nto \nground \npersonal \njurisdiction\u2014and consent may be manifested in \nvarious ways by word or deed.\u201d 600 U.S. at 138 (2023) \n(plurality) (emphasis added); see id. at 153 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment). \nThis case differs from Mallory in the sense that it \naddresses consent by deed, not word, and that the law \nis an act of Congress, not a state legislature; \notherwise, there is not much daylight between the two \nstatutes.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s attempt to wave away \nMallory makes no sense: \u201cThe Pennsylvania law at \nissue in Mallory did not involve an actual bargain or \na \u2018voluntary agreement,\u2019 . . . between the state and \neach company,\u201d because Norfolk Southern was \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction; its \n \n36a) is difficult to understand except as an attempt to mitigate \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s difficulty with reconciling its top-line \nconclusion with Bauxites. See infra at 8. Consent deemed \nex ante\u2014especially as to sophisticated parties closely tracking \nthe enactment of the PSJVTA\u2014provides clear and unambiguous \nnotice, whereas consent deemed by litigation conduct may well \nrest with the broad discretion of a trial court. See, e.g., Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 707. The former approach is far more consistent with \nthe ordinary meaning of \u201cconsent.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \nregistration to do business in Pennsylvania pursuant \nto one statute brought it within the ambit of a \nseparate statute deeming registration as a foreign \ncorporation a \u201csufficient basis\u201d for the exercise of \ngeneral \npersonal \njurisdiction. \nPet. \nApp. \n244a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing  \nen banc).  \nTo that end, the \u201creciprocal benefit\u201d rationale set \nforth in the decision below cannot be reconciled with \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Bauxites (among others), \nrequiring the Second Circuit to invent the separate \ncategory of \u201clitigation-related conduct.\u201d See supra \nat 6. But nothing in Mallory suggests that courts \nshould awkwardly parse different categories of \nconsent. Indeed, the disagreement among the Second \nCircuit is evidence enough that this Court should not \ninsert itself into determining whether consent is the \nproduct of a sufficiently \u201creciprocal\u201d \u201cbargain\u201d or \nwhether a particular statute, forum-selection clause, \nor discovery abuse manifests \u201ca reasonable inference \nof consent.\u201d  \nB. The PSJVTA satisfies the Mallory standard.  \nIndeed, the Act presents an easier constitutional \nquestion, because it does not implicate concerns \npresent in cases in which personal jurisdiction is \nbeing exercised pursuant to state (rather than federal) \nlaw. In this case, there are no dormant commerce \nclause or other federalism concerns. Cf. Mallory, \n600 U.S. at 157 (Alito, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment). Likewise, unlike the \nPennsylvania statute at issue in Mallory, the PSJTVA \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \ndoes not provide for general, \u201call purpose\u201d jurisdiction \nover defendants. Cf. Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. \n117 (2014). On the contrary, the PSJTVA restricts its \napplication to claims (i) brought under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (ii) by U.S. nationals (iii) against \nspecifically named defendants who (iv) continue to \nengage in conduct specified by the statute.4 It does not \nresurrect a \u201cblanket claim of authority over \ncontroversies with no connection to the [United \nStates].\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 170 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting). \nNor does the PSJTVA prompt international comity \nconcerns that have commanded attention in other \nsituations. See, e.g., Daimler, 571 U.S. at 140\u201342. \nInternational \nlaw \nclearly \nrecognizes \na \nstate\u2019s \nprerogative to prescribe law governing terrorism, \n\u201ceven if no specific connection exists between the state \nand the persons or conduct being regulated.\u201d \nRestatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 413. \nIII. \nDeference To The Elected Branches \nAnd Constitutional Departmentalism \nRequire Reversal \nShould the Court consider it necessary to analyze \ndifferences between the Due Process Clauses of the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the proper frame \nof reference is constitutional deference to the elected \nbranches. \nThe \ndecision \nbelow \nerred \nin \nthis \nfundamental respect, showing disdain for the \n \n4 The constitutionality of \u201cspecial\u201d legislation in the context \nof federal statutes giving relief to victims of terrorism is settled. \nBank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212 (2016). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \njudgment of the elected branches in a case implicating \nforeign affairs, an area in which deference to the \nelected branches is ordinarily at its zenith. E.g., \nZiglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 142 (2017); Holder v. \nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 33\u201334 (2010). \nA. \u201c[T]he Second Circuit\u2019s decision does not merely \nignore that the elected branches interpret the \nConstitution. The Court\u2019s decision rejects the notion \nthat the elected branches\u2019 judgment is even relevant.\u201d \nLong Arm of Consent at 247. In holding that \u201c[a] \nprospective defendant\u2019s activities do not signify \nconsent to personal jurisdiction simply because \nCongress has labeled them as such,\u201d Pet. App. 21a, the \nSecond Circuit treated the PSJVTA as a sort of \nlegislative aggrandizement of what it saw as the \njudicial branch\u2019s exclusive authority to define the \nlimits of personal jurisdiction. This was error.   \nBoth the Mallory plurality and dissent treated \nJustice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Burnham v. Super. Ct. of \nCal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990)\u2014the plurality opinion as \nwell as Parts II.D and III\u2014as the appropriate frame \nfor analyzing consent and other traditional bases of \njurisdiction. See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 139\u201341 \n(plurality); id. at 171\u201376 (Barrett, J., dissenting). In \nBurnham, \nJustice \nScalia \nsuggested \nthat \nthe \n\u201cdesirability or fairness of the prevailing in-state \nservice rule\u201d should be left to the \u201cjudgment [of] the \nlegislatures that are free to amend it,\u201d characterizing \ndue process as \u201cthat process which American society . \n. . , which expresses its judgments in the laws of \nself-interested States\u2014has traditionally considered \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n \n\u2018due.\u2019\u201d 495 U.S. at 621, 627 n.5. (opinion of Scalia, J.). \nThat deference to legislative judgment was carried \nforward by the Mallory plurality and dissent alike. \nSee Long Arm of Consent at 214. \nA fortiori, \u201c[t]he federal legislature has an even \nstronger claim to interpret the U.S. Constitution \nwhen \nit \nenacts \nfederal \nconsent-to-jurisdiction \nstatutes.\u201d Id. at 185. Congress\u2019s \u201cinterpretations are \nentitled to independent weight under theories of \nconstitutional departmentalism,\u201d which, however \nthey may differ in their details, contend that \u201cthe \nconstitutional interpretive authority of the federal \nelected branches is at its height when (i) the federal \nelected branches have engaged in actual, explicit \nconstitutional reasoning and (ii) where the nature of \nthe underlying right is unsettled.\u201d Id. at 248\u201349. With \nthe Court having explicitly reserved the question \nwhether the constraints on personal jurisdiction are \ncoterminous \nunder \nthe \nFifth \nand \nFourteenth \nAmendments in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. \nCt. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 268\u201369 (2017), the detailed \nfindings of Congress in enacting the PSJVTA are \nentitled to substantial deference.  \nB. Similar weight should be accorded the judgment \nof Congress in passing the PSJVTA in explicit \nresponse to decisions dismissing the Fuld and \nSokolow cases for want of personal jurisdiction, just \nas an earlier Congress passed the Antiterrorism \nClarification Act (ATCA) in response to Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317 (2d Cir. 2016), \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n \ncert denied sub nom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 584 U.S. 915 (2018).  \nThis Court has often looked to the judgment of the \nelected branches when considering traditional bases \nof jurisdiction. For instance, two great pre-Mallory \nprecedents, Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977), \nand Burnham took different approaches, but plainly \nagreed that the judgment of the elected branches \nmatters. See Long Arm of Consent at 217\u201320. Shaffer \nwas careful to note that its result might have differed \nif Delaware had \u201cenacted a statute that treats \nacceptance of a directorship as consent to jurisdiction \nin the State.\u201d 433 U.S. at 216. And the Delaware \nGeneral Assembly enacted just such a statute within \ntwo weeks of the Shaffer decision, see 10 Del. C. \n\u00a7 3114(a), \nwhich \nhas \nconsistently \nsurvived \nconstitutional scrutiny. See Aaron D. Simowitz, \nJurisdiction as Dialogue, 52 N.Y.U. J. Int\u2019l L. & Pol. \n485, 511\u201313 (2020). Though Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality \nin Burnham turned away from some aspects of \nShaffer, it also placed great weight on the unanimous \njudgment of state legislatures not to remove \n\u201ctag jurisdiction\u201d from their long-arm statutes. 495 \nU.S. at 627. \nCongress\u2019s \nresponse \nto \ngenerally \napplicable \njudicially created limitations on personal jurisdiction, \nin the form of statutes like the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA, may be best characterized as a prime \nexample of the elected branches engaged in an \nongoing dialogue with the judicial branch as to \nlegislative priorities that require courts to engage \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \n \nwith the elected branches\u2019 own claims to interpreting \nthe Constitution. See Jurisdiction as Dialogue at 527\u2013\n31; id. at 528 (\u201c[T]here is good reason to think that \n[the regulatory priorities of the elected branches] \nshould \ninform \nthe \nunderlying \nstructure \nof \njurisdiction.\u201d).  \nYet the decision below refused to engage with \nthese considerations at all\u2014a point not lost on the \nelected branches. See No. 24-20, Brief Amici Curiae of \nSen. Charles Grassley, et al. in Support of Certiorari, \nat 23 (\u201cIn the end, the lower court\u2019s constitutional \nanalysis amounts to little else beyond a disagreement \nbetween one circuit court and Congress itself on \ncomplex questions of foreign policy\u2014including the \nproper way to conduct an anti-terror campaign[.]\u201d); \nNo. 24-20, Brief Amicus Curiae of Secretary Mike \nPompeo in Support of Certiorari, at 3 (\u201cThe decision \nbelow\u2014invalidating [an antiterrorism policy] created \nin coordination with the State Department and \nenacted with bipartisan support\u2014frustrates the \npolitical branches\u2019 considered attempt to minimize the \nterror risk overseas.\u201d); cf. No. 24-20, Brief Amicus \nCuriae of the U.S. House of Representatives in \nSupport of Certiorari, at 8 (\u201cIf the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause precludes Congress from \nproviding American victims of international terrorism \nan effective civil remedy in most circumstances, this \nCourt should be the one to say so.\u201d). \nGiven these considerations, one need not take a \nmaximalist view of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause to appreciate that the Second Circuit \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \n \nwent astray in holding it coterminous with that of the \nFourteenth Amendment. Cf. Stephen E. Sachs, The \nUnlimited Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. \nL. Rev. 1703, 1710 (2020) (\u201c[A]s to the scope of the \ncourts\u2019 \nterritorial \njurisdiction, \nthe \n[Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process] Clause has nothing to \nsay.\u201d). Although the judicial branch has long served as \nan arbiter of interstate federalism and state \nassertions of jurisdiction, it is not the \u201carbiter of \nforeign relations.\u201d Aaron D. Simowitz, Federal \nPersonal Jurisdiction and Constitutional Authority, \n56 N.Y.U. J. Int\u2019l L. & Pol. 345, 362 (2024).  \nTaken together, the institutional competence of \nthe elected branches to make decisions in the field of \nforeign relations, the deference owed those decisions, \nand appreciation for the elected branches\u2019 exercise of \nconstitutional interpretation require that the elected \nbranches of the federal government should generally \nbe competent to authorize personal jurisdiction \nwithout the need for judicial scrutiny under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See id. at \n363. To the extent the Court does not consider the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s misapplication of Mallory and this \nCourt\u2019s other consent-based personal jurisdiction \ncaselaw co\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Plaintiffs\u2019 opening brief revolves around the original understanding of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.  The Government\u2019s brief devotes less \nthan a page to originalism, and instead develops other arguments.  Twelve amicus \ncuriae briefs have been filed as well.  Some amici claim to raise case-dispositive issues \nthat were not addressed in the Petitioners\u2019 merits briefs \u2013 for example, whether \nRespondents qualify as \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process Clause \u2013 which Respondents \nneed additional space to address substantively. \n3. \nRather than file two separate briefs on the merits totaling 26,000 words \ntogether, Respondents believe it will be more efficient and beneficial to the Court for \nthem file a single consolidated merits brief. \n4. \nRespondents thus request permission to file a consolidated brief in \nexcess of the 13,000-word limit by 9,500 words, not to exceed 22,500 words total. \n\n \n \n \n- 2 - \n \n \n5. \nWhere there are multiple parties and opening briefs in consolidated \ncases, this Court regularly grants the respondents leave to file a single, consolidated \nbrief of similar length.  For example, in Federal Commc\u2019ns Comm\u2019n v. Consumers\u2019 \nResearch, No. 24-354, the Government and private Petitioners filed three separate \nmerits briefs.  Though there was substantial overlap among all three opening briefs \nthat addressed the same issues, this Court granted leave to file a consolidated \nresponse brief of 23,000 words.  And in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, No. 21-1496, an \nAntiterrorism Act case like this one, the Petitioners filed two briefs totaling 25,000 \nwords.  This Court allowed the respondent a consolidated response brief of 20,000 \nwords.  This Court also allows responsive briefs that are longer than those of the \npetitioners.  See Haaland v. Brackeen, No. 21-376 (granting leave for petitioners to \nfile two 20,000 word briefs, and for respondents to file three consolidated response \nbriefs of 22,500 each).  See also, e.g., Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha Ltd. v. Regal-Beloit \nCorp., No. 08-1553 (granting leave to file a consolidated brief of 25,000 words); The \nAmerican Legion v. American Humanist Ass\u2019n, No. 17-1717 (granting leave to file a \nconsolidated response brief of 22,500 words); Turner v. United States, No. 15-1503 \n(granting leave to file a consolidated response brief of 22,500 words).   \n6. \nCounsel for the Government have indicated that they agree to a \nconsolidated response brief of up to 18,000 words, but not a brief of up to 22,500 \nwords.  Counsel for Plaintiffs have indicated that they oppose the relief sought.   \n7. \nThis request is sought in the interest of justice, not for delay, and no \nparty will be prejudiced if the requested word extension is granted. \n\n \n \n \n- 3 - \n \n \nThis application for leave to file a consolidated response brief on the merits of \n22,500 words should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted, \nGASSAN A.

Palestine Liberation Organization, No. 24-20, respectfully \noppose Respondents\u2019 application to file a merits brief exceeding the 13,000-word limit. The \nmotion is governed by Rule 33.1(d), which provides that, \u201c[f]or good cause, the Court or a \nJustice may grant leave to file a document in excess of the word limits, but application for \nsuch leave is not favored.\u201d \nRespondents begin from the false premise that, absent an enlargement of the word \nlimit, they would be entitled to \u201cfile two separate briefs on the merits totaling 26,000 words.\u201d \nApp. \u00b6 3. On December 6, the Court issued a docket order \u201cconsolidat[ing] these cases for \nbriefing and oral argument.\u201d Under Rule 25.2, therefore, Respondents must file a single \n\u201cbrief on the merits,\u201d which must comply with the 13,000-word limit. \nRespondents have not shown good cause for an enlargement of the word limit here. \nThe Court\u2019s standard practice is for parties on the same side of a case to file a single brief. \nWhile separate briefs are sometimes permitted for parties with separate institutional inter-\nests\u2014most typically for the United States\u2014the filing of a separate brief by the United \nStates is not normally treated as a justification by the opposing party to deviate from the \nstandard practice. Nor is a party\u2019s perceived need to address \u201camicus curiae briefs.\u201d App. \n\u00b6 2. \nIn arguing that the Court \u201cregularly grants\u201d applications to enlarge the word limit, \nApp. \u00b6 5, Respondents identify only six cases in which such a request was granted in the \npast seventeen years, and all or nearly all of them involved multiple questions presented. \nIn addition, in none of the cases did the application appear to have been opposed. \n\n \n2 \nRespondents\u2019 application should be denied. \nDated: February 12, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \nSAMUEL SILVERMAN \nTHE SILVERMAN LAW FIRM, PLLC \n16 Squadron Blvd. \nNew York, NY 10956 \n \nJEFFREY FLEISCHMANN \nTHE LAW OFFICE OF  \n   JEFFREY FLEISCHMAN, P.C. \n150 Broadway, Ste. 900 \nNew York, NY 10038 \n \nBRIAN M.

now shift to say a few words in English. \nI know that a significant portion of your community are young. I wrote a book in the late 70s about \nthe Palestinian American community and how it organizes itself. I can say now that we have hun-\ndreds of thousands of Palestinian Americans in the United States of America. And I can say further \nthat more than 90 [percent] of them have been born in the United States. \nThere is a significant number from within our community who are teenagers or younger, who are \nattending high school or attending colleges and universities. \nCase 1:04-cv-00397-GBD-RLE   Document 1066-9   Filed 05/25/22   Page 2 of 5\n910\nBEIT SAHOUR U~ \nEn.2020 \nWelcome To Beit Sahour USA Convention 2020 \nPresentation Will Begin At 4:00 PM EST \n\n2\nI know that in American universities there are a very active group of organizations and there is a \nstrong trend on campuses for movements and organizations and solidarity committees working for \nsupporting justice for the Palestinian people. \nI think that the young Palestinian Americans are exactly like anyone else. Like the Italian Ameri-\ncans, like the Latino Americans, like the Afro Americans, like all the other minority groups of \nAmericans. \nThey are very active in so many important issues to the youth and to their communities. Among \nthese issues is supporting justice for the Palestinian people and lobbying the government, lobbying \nCongress, in order really to take more of a balanced and just position, to acknowledge and recog-\nnize that the Palestinian people should be granted the right to self determination and independence \nin their own state and the right to [unintelligible]. \nSo then I call upon the young men and women of your community, especially those who are at-\ntending university, to be given all the support that they should be given and to recognize their \nactivism and their role in supporting the just cause of the Palestinians. And we urge them to be-\ncome even more active, especially in light of the arrival of a new administration in Washington, \nD.C., of President-elect Biden. I think that, we hope, that this new administration will move in the\ndirection of fairness and justice for the Palestinian people and not to be like the previous admin-\nistration, the administration of President Trump, that was siding with the Israeli side, having\nadopted their position fully.\nI believe that you have opportunities in this very important country to play a bigger role in sup-\nporting your families in Beit Sahour, Palestine, who are steadfastly [unintelligible] in the occupied \nland of the State of Palestine. They are defending our towns and cities in the occupied land of the \nState of Palestine. They are defending our holy places for Christians and Muslims whether in \nBethlehem or Jerusalem. And you have a big responsibility being put on your shoulders to play an \nactive role in this endeavor. \nThe first step you have taken by organizing yourselves. The second step is empowering your youth \nand those who are active among you with the system that you live in as Palestinian Americans. \nYou are not foreigners in this country since you are citizens of the United States of America. And \ndon\u2019t act like foreigners. You should act like everyone in this society because everyone in America \ncame from somewhere. Your neighbors they might be Italian Americans, Greek Americans, Irish \nAmericans. In your case you are Palestinian Americans.  \nAnd in order to be effective in this society, you are not a foreigner, you are exactly like everybody \nelse. And you are so proud of the fact that your parents, or your grandparents, came from Palestine. \nYou remember them with affection. And you are committed for helping your people for justice for \nthe Palestinian people and for the State of Palestine. This is normal in the United States, and I am \nsure that you know that, and I advise you to act on such basis because if you act this way you will \nbe extremely effective and therefore very helpful in advancing the cause of the Palestinian people, \nfor justice, independence, and self-determination. \nCase 1:04-cv-00397-GBD-RLE   Document 1066-9   Filed 05/25/22   Page 3 of 5\n911\n\n3\nAgain, I want to congratulate you for forming your own organization. I congratulate you for con-\nvening the first national convention. And I want to congratulate the executive committee that will \nbe elected, or the board, at the end of your convention. And I will be delighted to always com-\nmunicate with your organization if there is anything that I can do, or our mission to the United \nNations can do, representing the State of Palestine at the United Nations, and we are in New York, \nwe will be more than happy to do so. We are all together brothers and sisters, sons and daughters \nof the great nation of Palestine.  \nThank you very much. I wish you the best, and Mabrouk [congratulations] for your very wonder-\nful convention that you are convening in this manner through zoom and I hope in the future you \nwill convene it in a place where hundreds of us will be together, where our women will be wear-\ning our wonderful robes and dresses, and we can all of us sing and do the Dabke and do the \nthings that we learned to how do over hundreds of years as proud Palestinians and as proud peo-\nple from Beit Sahour.

Sachs, The Unlimited Juris-\ndiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. \nRev. 1703 (2020) ........................................ \n22 \n\nINTEREST OF THE AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States of \nAmerica (\u201cChamber\u201d) is the world\u2019s largest business \nfederation. The Chamber represents approximately \n300,000 direct members and indirectly represents the \ninterests of more than three million companies and \nprofessional organizations of every size, in every \nindustry sector, and from every region of the country. \nAn important function of the Chamber is to represent \nthe interests of its members in matters before \nCongress, the Executive Branch, and the courts. \nThe Chamber unequivocally condemns acts of \nterrorism in all forms, including those committed \nagainst American citizens at issue in this case.  \nRespondents should be \u2013 and are \u2013 answerable in \nUnited States Courts for the \u201cpay for slay\u201d policy that \nPetitioners describe, that the political branches seek to \naddress, and that the Chamber finds abhorrent.  See \nPetn. for Cert. at 13, Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., \n(No. 24-20) (U.S. July 3, 2024).  Specifically, Respondents \nare subject to the in personam jurisdiction of the \nUnited States Courts for their actions, and the \nexercise of that jurisdiction does not offend the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment. \nWhile that is the topline conclusion, the basis upon \nwhich this Court reaches that conclusion carries \nimportant implications for the American business \ncommunity.  American businesses rely on predictable \nrules governing personal jurisdiction.  Those rules \nprovide essential guidance about where disputes can \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart and no entity or person, aside from amicus, its members, or \nits counsel, made any monetary contribution intended to fund the \npreparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \nbe heard whether in matters where American busi-\nnesses are seeking relief or named as defendants. \nConsistent with those interests, the Chamber has \nparticipated in many cases lying at the intersection  \nof foreign affairs and the constitutional limits on a \ncourt\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdiction.  Such cases \ninclude CC/Devas (Multimedia) Ltd. v. Antrix Corp., \nLtd., (No. 23-1201) (\u201cDevas\u201d) and J. McIntyre Machinery, \nLtd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011).  Following its \npositions articulated in those and other cases, the \nChamber files this brief to offer its unique perspective \non how to resolve this case in a manner that takes into \nconsideration the broader implications of any rule of \ndecision. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Chamber agrees with the United States that \nthis Court should decide this \ncase narrowly,  \nwithout addressing broad questions of how the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause restrains federal \ncourts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdiction. See Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 47.  \nBoth petitions concern a facial challenge to a unique \nfederal statute specifically designed to overcome \njurisprudential impediments to the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction over the Palestinian Authority \n(\u201cPA\u201d) and the Palestine Liberation Organization \n(\u201cPLO,\u201d and together with the PA, \u201cRespondents\u201d) in \ncases involving acts of terrorism against United States \nnationals.  The sole question presented is whether the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction against Respondents \npursuant to the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019, Pub. L. 116-94, div. \nJ., tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082-85 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), \n\n3 \nviolates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  The answer to that question is \u201cno.\u201d \nThe straightforward reason is that Respondents are \nnot entitled to the protections of the Due Process \nClause.  As the Chamber has explained in its brief in \nDevas, due process protections do not extend to foreign \nsovereign governments or their alter egos.  Although \nPalestine is not a foreign sovereign, the reasons \nadvanced in the Chamber\u2019s brief in Devas support the \nsame conclusion for Respondents.  For decades, the \nExecutive Branch has taken this view and concluded \nthat foreign political entities, including Respondents \nspecifically, are not entitled to the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nprotections.  Nothing in the decision below offers a \npersuasive reason to depart from the Executive \nBranch\u2019s historical position.  This reason alone is \nsufficient to resolve these appeals in Petitioners\u2019 favor \nand to reverse the judgment below. \nThe Court should go no further.  It is not necessary \nin this case to examine the precise relationship \nbetween the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment limits \non personal jurisdiction.  That question involves difficult \nmethodological debates with significant repercussions \nthat cannot be fully fleshed out here.  If this Court \nnevertheless opts to delve into that question, it should \nformally adopt the approach suggested by this Court \nin Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, \n619 (1992), and the plurality opinion in Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, and consistently employed by the federal \nappellate courts:  the Fifth Amendment requires that \na defendant have minimum contacts with the United \nStates as a whole.  Sound reasons counsel against a \nmore radical approach never embraced by this Court \nor any federal appellate court, that the Fifth Amendment \nonly affords defendants the process authorized by \n\n4 \nCongress and imposes no independent limits on the \npersonal jurisdiction of the federal courts. \nLikewise, it is not necessary to examine whether the \nconsent doctrine might support the exercise of jurisdic-\ntion.  The judges dissenting from rehearing en banc \nsuggested that this Court\u2019s decision in Mallory v. \nNorfolk Southern Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), might \nbe read to support the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nbased on the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed consent\u201d provisions.  \nPet. App. 246a-248a, 309a-310a.  But Mallory did not \ngrant Congress (or state legislatures) a blank check to \nequate any activity with a blanket consent to all-\npurpose jurisdiction.  See Gov\u2019t Br. at 24 (\u201cThat does \nnot mean anything goes.\u201d) (quoting Ford Motor Co. v. \nMontana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 362 \n(2021)).  And the unique context of this statute makes \nthis case a far from ideal vehicle to begin defining the \ncontours of that doctrine post Mallory. \nIn sum, this Court can and should take the straight-\nforward route to resolving this case.  Respondents, like \nStates of the Union and foreign sovereign govern-\nments, are not entitled to the protections of the Due \nProcess Clause.  This Court thus need not consider the \ndownstream question whether an entity entitled to the \nprotections of that Clause could be subjected to \npersonal jurisdiction under the statute as a matter of \ncontacts or consent.  The exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion over these Respondents pursuant to this statute \ncomports with the Constitution.   \n \n \n \n \n\n5 \nARGUMENT \nAny exercise of personal jurisdiction requires proof \nof three propositions.  First, \u201cthe procedural requirement \nof service of summons must be satisfied.\u201d  Omni \nCapital Intern., Ltd. v. Wolff & Co. Ltd., 484 U.S. 97, 104 \n(1987)   Second, the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nrequires a statutory authorization.  Keeton v. Hustler \nMagazine, Inc., 465 U.S. 770, 774-75 (1984).  Third, any \nstatutory authorization of personal jurisdiction must \ncomport with the Constitution.   \nAs the courts below correctly recognized, only the \nthird requirement is at issue here.  Respondents have \nbeen properly served, and the PSJVTA authorizes \npersonal jurisdiction over these Respondents.  Pet. \nApp. 16a.   \nThe court below framed its assessment of the \nconstitutional question by reference to three categories:  \ngeneral jurisdiction, specific jurisdiction and consent.  \nThat framing elided a critical antecedent issue, \nnamely, whether Respondents were entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause at all.  See  \nPet. App. 153a-154a. They are not.  For this reason \nalone, the constitutional inquiry ends.  Further \nexamination of the three above-referenced categories \nis not necessary.   \nI. Respondents are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to \ndue process under the Fifth Amendment . \n\u201cForeign states\u201d are not persons entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth \nAmendment.  See Chamber Br. at 4-25, Devas (No. 23-\n1201) (U.S. Dec. 11, 2024).  This rule can easily be \nextended to foreign political entities like Respondents.  \nSee Gov\u2019t Br. at 19 (\u201c[R]espondents\u2019 status as non-\nsovereign foreign entities weighs strongly in favor of \n\n6 \nthe [PSJVTA\u2019s] constitutionality.\u201d).  Considerations of \ntext, history, and precedent all support this conclusion. \nText.  While the Constitution does not define the \nterm \u201cperson,\u201d the use of the term throughout the \ndocument reveals that the Framers did not intend for \nit to encompass certain governmental entities, including \n\u201cforeign states\u201d (U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 9; id. art. III, \u00a7 2; \nid. amend. XI), \u201cforeign nations,\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 8) \u201cforeign \nPower[s],\u201d (id. art. I, \u00a7 10), and \u201cStates\u201d of the Union \n(id. art. I, \u00a7 8; id. amend XIV).  The repeated and \ndeliberate use of these terms throughout the \nConstitution to refer to governmental bodies demands \nthe conclusion that, had the Framers intended for the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s protections to extend to these \ncategories of litigants, it would have include such \nterms (along with \u201cpersons\u201d) among the parties \nentitled to the protections set forth therein. Compare \nid. amend. V, with id. art. I, \u00a7\u00a7 8, 9, 10, id. art. III, \u00a72, \nid. amend. XI, and id. amend XIV.  \nThis conclusion comports with the commonly held \nbelief that the Constitution was not intended to \nprotect governments, especially foreign ones.  As one \nscholar succinctly summarized the point: \u201cthe opposite \nof a constitutional right is a government power.\u201d  Kent \nGreenfield, In Defense of Corporate Persons, 30 Const. \nComment. 309, 316 (2015).  It would therefore \u201cbe \nquite strange to interpret the Due Process Clause as \nconferring upon [Respondents] rights and protections \nagainst the power of federal government.\u201d Price v. \nSocialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 97 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (emphasis in original). \nBecause the Fifth Amendment seeks to protect \npersons from the exercise of an unlawful government \npower, foreign political entities \u2013 regardless of \n\n7 \nsovereignty status \u2013 are not, as a textual matter, \nentitled to its protection. \nHistory. What text suggests, history confirms.  For \nfifty years, the Executive Branch has been steadfast in \nits pronouncement that the Constitution was not \nintended to apply to entities like Respondents.  In \n1975, Attorney General Levi testified that because the \npreamble of the Constitution refers to \u201cWe the People,\u201d \nit could \u201cbe urged that it was not meant to apply to \nforeign nations, their agents and collaborators.\u201d \nIntelligence Activities \u2013 The National Security Agency \nand Fourth Amendment Rights: Hearings on S. Res. 21 \nBefore the Senate Select Committee to Study \nGovernmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence \nActivities, 94th Cong., 1st Sess. 66, 74 (1975) \n(statement of Attorney General Edward H. Levi).  Five \nyears later, the Office of Legal Counsel sought to \nclarify the distinction between a foreign individual \nand a foreign government, explaining that the former \nmay have Fifth Amendment rights, whereas the latter \ndoes not. See Presidential Authority to Settle the \nIranian Crisis, 4A Op. O.L.C. 248, 260 n.9 (1980) (\u201cA \nforeign nation [ ], unlike a foreign national, does not \nhave rights under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d). \nIn 1987, the Office of Legal Counsel directly spoke to \nthe constitutional rights of the PLO in the face of the \nfederal government\u2019s decision to close the Palestine \nInformation Office. The opinion declared that the  \n\u201cPLO [ ], as a foreign political entity, has no \nconstitutional rights,\u201d and that this conclusion \u201cflows \ninexorably from the nature of foreign sovereigns and \ntheir interaction with the United States as a foreign, \nco-equal sovereign.\u201d Constitutionality of Closing the \nPalestine Info. Off., an Affiliate of the Palestine \nLiberation Org., 11 Op. O.L.C. 104, 106 (1987). \u201cSimply \n\n8 \nput, a foreign political entity such as the PLO, \u2018lies \noutside the structure of the union.\u2019\u201d Id. at 107 (citing \nPrincipality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 \n(1934)).  It \u201c[has undertaken] no general obligation to \nabide by the constitutional norms to which the federal \ngovernment and the several states are subject, nor are \nthere any effective means to place [it] on parity with \nthe United States or the states for purposes of \nenforcement of particular norms.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. at 107 \n(internal citations omitted). \nRecognizing that \u201cthe PLO is not a sovereign \nnation,\u201d the Executive Branch further dispensed with \nany suggestion that this lack of status would \u201cbring it \nwithin the constitutional fold.\u201d Id. at 120 n.7.  The \nExecutive Branch explained, \u201c[a]lthough the United \nStates chooses not to recognize the PLO as [a \nsovereign state], the PLO nonetheless interacts with \nthe United States as a foreign political entity within \nthe structure of international law,\u201d and \u201cis reported to \nhave diplomatic relations with approximately one \nhundred countries throughout the world.\u201d Id. at 119-\n20 (citing G.A. Res. 3237, 29 U.N. GAOR, 29th Sess., \nSupp. No. 31, at 4, U.N. Doc. A/9631 (1974)). The same \nis true for the PA, which was created by treaty under \nthe Gaza-Jericho Agreement and Oslo Accords to act \nas the interim civil government of defined territory.  \nPet. App. 6a, 61a;  Declaration of Principles on Interim \nSelf\u2013Government Arrangements (\u201cOslo I\u201d) art III, Sept. \n19, 1993, Isr.-P.L.O., 32 I.L.M. 1525, 1529-30 (1993); \nAgreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area \n(\u201cGaza-Jericho Agreement\u201d), May 4, 1994, Isr.-P.L.O., \n33 I.L.M. 622, 626 (1994); Interim Agreement on the \nWest Bank & the Gaza Strip (\u201cOslo II\u201d) art I, Sept. 28, \n1995, Isr.-P.L.O., 36 I.L.M. 551, 559 (acknowledging \n\u201cPalestinian Authority [as] established in accordance \nwith the Gaza-Jericho Agreement\u201d). Because the Oslo \n\n9 \nAccords constrain the PA\u2019s authority within the \nidentified territory, the PLO conducts foreign affairs \non behalf of the Palestinian People and is a Permanent \nObserver to the United Nations. Pet. App. 6a, 61a; Oslo \nII art IX, 36 I.L.M. at 561.  Respondents may therefore \nbe subjected to the exercise of the federal government\u2019s \n\u201cnecessary and inherent power to preclude foreign \nencroachment.\u201d 11 Op. O.L.C. at 120. As a result, the \nExecutive Branch concluded that \u201c[t]he PLO qua PLO, \n[a]s a foreign political entity, does not itself enjoy \nconstitutional protection.\u201d Id. \nConsistent with Attorney General Levi\u2019s testimony \nand the Office of Legal Counsel\u2019s opinions, the United \nStates has appeared in numerous federal cases to \ndefend its view that entities like Respondents are not \nentitled to constitutional due process. See, e.g., U.S. Br. \n44, Palestine Information Office v. Shultz, 853 F.2d 932 \n(D.C. Cir. 1988) (No. 87-5398) (\u201cForeign entities such \nas the PLO obviously do not have due process rights \nsince they are not part of our constitutional scheme.\u201d \n(citing South Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, \n323-24 (1966))); U.S. Br., People\u2019s Mojahedin Organization \nof Iran v. Department of State, 182 F.3d 17 (D.C.

See Mut. Consent Provisions \nin the Guam Commonwealth Legis., 1994 WL 16193765, \nat *5 (O.L.C. July 28, 1994) (\u201c[T]he rationale of \n[Katzenbach]\u201d is fully applicable to other \u201cgovernmental \nbodies,\u201d even when they are not \u201cstates or instru-\nmentalities of states\u201d); accord Letter from Robert \nRaben, Dep\u2019t of Justice, to Frank H. Murkowski, \nChairman, Committee on Energy and Natural Resources, \nUnited States Senate 9 n.11 (Jan. 18, 2001) (\u201cWhile \nKatzenbach was concerned with a State, its rationale \nsuggests that a governmental body . . . could not assert \nrights under the Due Process Clause.\u201d).  It would be \nodd to suggest that foreign non-sovereign governing \nbodies, like Respondents, would have greater due process \nrights than domestic bodies with comparable authority.  \nAnd Congress has legislated consistent with these \npronouncements, providing express statutory authority \nfor courts to establish personal jurisdiction over \nRespondents. See Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act \n(\u201cATCA\u201d), Pub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. 3183, 3184 \n(adding 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)), and PSJVTA. Pub. L.  \n116-94, div. J, tit.

Mar. 18, 2022) \n\n11 \n(discussing chronology of legislative response to courts\u2019 \nrefusal to exercise jurisdiction over Respondents).  The \ncollective judgment of the political branches over time \nsupports the conclusion that Respondents are not \nentitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause. \nPrecedent/Purpose. This Court\u2019s precedents buttress \nthat conclusion. In Katzenbach, this Court held that \n\u201cthe word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any \nreasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded to \nencompass the States of the Union.\u201d 383 U.S. at 323.  \nThe underlying rationale was that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause \u201crecognizes and protects an \nindividual liberty interest,\u201d Ins. Corp. of Ireland v. \nCompagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694,  \n702 (1982), not a sovereign government\u2019s interest.  \nSubsequently in Weltover, this Court cited Katzenbach \nto suggest that a \u201cforeign state\u201d is likely not a \u201cperson\u201d \nentitled to due process. 504 U.S. at 619.  Following \nWeltover\u2019s lead, the D.C. Circuit and Second Circuit \nhave since affirmatively held that \u201cforeign states\u201d are \nnot persons entitled to due process protection. Price, 294 \nF.3d at 96; Frontera Res. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil \nCo. of Azerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 399 (2d Cir. \n2009); \nGater \nAssets \nLtd. \nv. \nAO \nMoldovagaz,  \n2 F.4th 42, 49 (2d Cir. 2021). \nThis development had an unusual effect.  Before \nWeltover, courts in these Circuits did not hesitate to \nconclude that if States of the Union are not \u201cpersons\u201d \nthen neither are foreign political entities like Respond-\nents. See Mendelsohn v. Meese, 695 F. Supp. 1474, 1481 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1988) (\u201c[T]he PLO, an organization whose \nstatus, while uncertain, lies outside the constitutional \nsystem. It has never undertaken to abide by United \nStates law or to accept the constitutional plan. . . . No \n\n12 \nforeign entity of its nature could be expected to do so.\u201d \n(internal quotations omitted)); Palestine Information \nOffice v. Shultz, 674 F. Supp. 910 (D.D.C.1987) (\u201cIf the \nStates of the Union have no due process rights, then \n[the Palestine Information Office as] a \u2018foreign mission\u2019 \nqua \u2018foreign mission\u2019 surely can have none.\u201d).  After \nWeltover and its progeny (e.g., Price, Frontera), some \ncourts drew too fine a line and concluded that any \nforeign entity apart from a sovereign government \nenjoyed due process rights. See Pet. App. 153a-154a; \nLivnat v. Palestinian Authority, 851 F.3d 45, 48-53 \n(D.C. Cir. 2017).   \nThis jurisprudential shift was a mistake.  Underlying \nthis shift is a distorted notion of sovereignty and its \nsignificance in the due process inquiry.  Specifically,  \nthe Second and D.C. Circuits appear to believe that if \na foreign political entity is not recognized as sovereign, \nthen it must be a \u201cperson\u201d possessing due process \nrights.  See Pet. App. 153a; Livnat, 851 F.3d at 49. \nThis false dichotomy lacks any jurisprudential or \nconceptual rationale.  For instance, political subdivisions, \nmunicipalities, and U.S. territories are not sovereigns, \nyet also cannot claim due process rights.  See, e.g., City \nof E. St. Louis v. Cir. Ct. for the Twentieth Jud. Cir., St. \nClair Cnty., Ill., 986 F.2d 1142, 1144 (7th Cir. 1993) \n(\u201cMunicipalities . . . are not \u2018persons\u2019 within the \nmeaning of the Due Process Clause.\u201d); City of Sault Ste. \nMarie, Mich. v. Andrus, 532 F. Supp. 157, 167-68 \n(D.D.C. 1980) (concluding municipality could not \nassert due process rights under the Fifth Amendment \nbecause \u201ca state cannot confer a constitutional status \n. . . which the state does not itself enjoy\u201d); Puerto Rico \nPub.

App. 142a, possessing only those limited powers \nafforded it under the Oslo Accords. See Oslo I art III, \n32 I.L.M. at 1529-30 (\u201cIsrael shall transfer authority  \n. . . from the Israeli military government and its Civil \nAdministration to the [PA] . . . on the following \nspheres: education and culture, health, social welfare, \ndirect taxation, and tourism.\u201d); Gaza-Jericho Agreement \nart III, 33 I.L.M. at 627; Oslo II art I, 36 I.L.M. at 559.  \nAnd the PLO is recognized, domestically and inter-\nnationally, as the sole non-sovereign representative  \nof the Palestinian people. Oslo I, 32 I.L.M. at 1527; \nOslo II, 36 I.L.M. at 558 (identifying PLO as \u201cthe \nrepresentative of the Palestinian people\u201d); Pet. App. 6a, \n61a (acknowledging PLO holds Permanent Observer \nstatus to the United Nations on behalf of the \nPalestinian people).  It would be illogical to conclude \nthat foreign non-sovereign governments are somehow \ndifferently situated with respect to personhood under \nour \nConstitution \nthan \ndomestic \nnon-sovereign \ngovernments.  See Flatow v. Islamic Republic of Iran, \n999 F. Supp. 1, 20-21 (D.D.C. 1998). \nMoreover, the dichotomy does not comport with the \nreasoning of the very courts making it.  As those courts \nhave observed, it would be \u201chighly incongruous to \nafford greater Fifth Amendment rights to foreign \nnations, who are entirely alien to our constitutional \nsystem, than are afforded to the states, who help make \nup the very fabric of that system.\u201d Price, 294 F.3d at \n96-97; Frontera, 582 F.3d at 399.  It would be even more \n\n14 \n\u201cincongruous\u201d to place entities like Respondents\u2014who \nthe Executive Branch and Congress agree are not \nentitled to constitutional protections of any kind\u2014\u201cin \na more favored position with respect to the safeguards \nof due process than both U.S. states and foreign \nsovereigns with whom the political branches have \nestablished friendly relations.\u201d Shatsky, 2022 WL \n826409 at *6; 11 Op.

As the dissent from \n\n15 \nrehearing en banc observed, \u201c[f]undamental constitutional \nrights are not typically so contingent.\u201d Pet. App. 238a. \nThe counterargument by the D.C. Circuit was that \nnon-sovereign governments cannot be analogized to \nsovereigns for purposes of the Due Process analysis \nbecause they are not the \u201cjuridical equals\u201d of the \nUnited States government and do not possess the \nsame quantum of governmental rights and privileges \notherwise held by recognized states in the domestic \nand international spheres.  Livnat, 851 F.3d at 51 \n(concluding that as a non-sovereign, the PA lacks the \nability to claim sovereign immunity or the \u201cpower to \nsecure its territory against external threats,\u201d Oslo II \nart. X, 36 I.L.M. at 561, and because the PA only \npossesses a \u201climited\u201d number of rights in international \narena, it \u201ccannot rely on comity and international-law \nprotections to the exclusion of domestic law\u201d).  This \nline of reasoning quickly unravels.   \nAn argument rooted in the \u201cquantum of rights\u201d \nRespondents possess on the international stage says \nnothing about whether they are \u201cpersons\u201d within the \nmeaning of the Constitution\u2019s Due Process Clause.  \nIndeed, similar distinctions could be drawn between \nexclusively sovereign governments whom this Court \nhas recognized are not persons within the meaning of \nthat Clause.  The federal government, for example, has \ncertain rights that are greater relative to the States of \nthe Union, which have greater rights relative to \nforeign nations.  U.S. Const. art. VI, cl. 2; see also \nCommonwealth of Massachusetts v. Mellon, 262 U.S. \n447, 485 (1923) (delineating when States of the Union \nversus the United States has standing to represent \nAmerican citizens as parens patriae); Price, 294 F.3d at \n96 (concluding foreign states have an even weaker \nclaim to personhood status than States of the Union).  \n\n16 \nFinally, even if foreign political entities might \npossess fewer rights and special privileges than \nrecognized sovereigns, see Livnat 851 F.3d at 51, they \nare not powerless to defend their interests. Respondents \nare perfect examples. The PA has a president and \nministers and is the self-proclaimed \u201cgovernment of a \nState[.]\u201d See PA Mtn. to Dismiss Br. at 17, Livnat v. \nPalestinian Authority, (No. 13-498) (E.D. Va. June 5, \n2013), ECF No. 6.  The PLO conducts foreign affairs \nand maintains dozens of \u2018embassies, missions, and \ndelegations around the world,\u2019 including a UN mission \noffice located in New York City.\u201d See Pet. App. 142a.  In \nshort, Respondents \u201care sophisticated international \norganizations with billion-dollar budgets . . . that \ngovern a territory recognized as a sovereign state by \nmany other countries.\u201d Id. 238a; Jim Zanotti, Cong. \nResearch Serv., U.S. Foreign Aid to the Palestinians 1 \n(Dec. 12, 2018), available at https://sgp.fas.org/crs/ \nmideast/RS22967.pdf (\u201cBilateral assistance to the \nPalestinians since 1994 has totaled more than $5 \nbillion, and has been a key part of U.S. policy to . . . \nstrengthen the West Bank-based PA vis-\u00e0-vis Hamas \nin Gaza.\u201d). One can hardly argue that these entities \nwould be rendered defenseless without the protections \nof the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. \nPut simply, while the Executive Branch has not \nrecognized Palestine as a nation-state, Respondents \nremain, as the United States acknowledges here, \u201cnon-\nsovereign foreign entities exercising governmental \nfunctions.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. at 34.  As a consequence, text, \nhistory and precedent continue to support the Executive \nBranch\u2019s historically held view that such entities lack \ndue process rights. \n \n\n17 \nII. It is not necessary for this Court to \nexamine \nother \naspects \nof \nthe \nFifth \nAmendment limits on the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction.  Even if it did so, it \nshould still reverse and remand. \nThis Court could easily dispose of these petitions  \nby holding that Respondents are not \u201cpersons\u201d within \nthe meaning of the Due Process Clause, a conclusion \nthat is logically antecedent to any of the downstream \narguments about how that Clause might otherwise \napply.  The Court thus need not and should not go \nfurther.  Specifically, it need not definitively decide the \nrelationship between the Fifth Amendment and the \nFourteenth Amendment limits on the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction or demarcate the outer boundaries of \nthe \u201cconsent\u201d doctrine. But if the Court is inclined to \naddress these issues, it should adopt the nationwide \ncontacts test universally employed by the federal \nappellate courts in Fifth Amendment analysis and \nreject a boundless construction of the consent doctrine \nsuggested by the lower court judges dissenting from \nthe denial of en banc rehearing.  If it chooses to explore \nthese issues, it should still reverse and remand. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n18 \nA. The Fifth Amendment imposes different \nlimits on the exercise of personal \njurisdiction than does the Fourteenth \nAmendment. \nThe Fifth and the Fourteenth Amendments impose \nlimits on the exercise of personal jurisdiction.  The \nprovisions have \u201cmaterially identical\u201d language.  \nHerederos de Roberto Gomez Cabrera, LLC v. Teck \nResources Ltd., 43 F.4th 1303,1308 (11th Cir. 2022) \n(Newsom, J.); see also Douglass v. Nippon Yusen \nKabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 243 (5th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc) (Ho, J., concurring) (\u201cThere\u2019s no denying the \ntextual parallel between the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendment.\u201d).  And this Court has long recognized \nthat the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \nrequires minimum contacts with the sovereign State \nexercising personal jurisdiction.  If the Court decides \nto reach the question, it should hold that the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does too.  The only \nmaterial difference is that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nanalysis focuses on minimum contacts with the United \nStates as the relevant sovereign.  Virtually every \nfederal appellate court has adopted this approach.    \nJustice Scalia\u2019s opinion for a unanimous Court in \nWeltover supplies the starting point for any analysis.  \n504 U.S. 607. Weltover represents one of the first cases \nto reach this Court in the post-International Shoe era \nwhere the exercise of personal jurisdiction involved a \ncase arising under federal law.  Weltover assumed, \nwithout deciding, that the foreign state (Argentina) \nwas entitled to due process.  Id. at 619.  After making \nthat assumption, Weltover went on to explain that \nArgentina possessed \u201cminimum contacts\u201d that would \nsatisfy the relevant constitutional standard. By \nissuing negotiable debt instruments denominated in \n\n19 \nUnited States dollars and payable in New York and by \nappointing a financial agent in that city, Argentina \n\u201cpurposefully avail[ed] itself of the privilege of \nconducting activities within the [United States].\u201d  Id. \nat 619-20 (emphasis added).  Weltover\u2019s bracketed \nreference to the \u201cUnited States\u201d necessarily implied \ntwo propositions \u2013 (1) that the minimum contacts \nframework governs the constitutional inquiry under \nthe Fifth Amendment and (2) that the relevant \u201cforum\u201d \nfor contacts analysis purposes is the United States (as \nopposed to a State of the Union). \nSince Weltover, this Court in several subsequent \ndecisions has characterized the contours of the Fifth \nAmendment test as an \u201copen\u201d question.  Virtually all \nof those cases arose out of state court or involved \nfederal courts borrowing state long-arm statutes and, \nthus unlike Weltover, did not confront the Fifth \nAmendment question.  See Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. of Calif., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); \nNicastro, 564 U.S. at 885 (plurality opinion) Omni \nCapital Int\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, \n102 n.5, (1987); Asahi Metal Indus. Co. v. Superior  \nCt. of Cal., 480 U.S. 102, 113 n.* (1987).  None \nquestioned Weltover\u2019s analytic framework under the \nFifth Amendment.  Moreover, the \u201copen\u201d question \nabout that framework identified in several of those \nopinions was whether the Fifth Amendment requires \nminimum \u201cnationwide\u201d contacts, not whether the Fifth \nAmendment requires any \u201cminimum contacts\u201d to the \nUnited States at all.  See, e.g., Asahi, 480 U.S. at 113 \nn.*; see also Douglass, 46 F. 4th at 240 n.26. \nTo the extent Weltover did not supply a definitive \nholding on the matter, other opinions of this Court \ntrack its essential framework.  This Court\u2019s plurality \nopinion in Nicastro offers the fullest explication.   \n\n20 \n564 U.S. 873.  The Nicastro plurality identified two \ninterrelated principles from a survey of its personal \njurisdiction jurisprudence.  The first principle is that \n\u201cpersonal jurisdiction requires a forum-by-forum, or \nsovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d  Id. at 884.  See also \nFuld Petrs. Br. at 42-43.  The second principle is that \n\u201c[b]ecause the United States is a distinct sovereign, a \ndefendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the courts of the United States but not of any \nparticular State.\u201d  Id. \nBoth before and after Nicastro, decisions of the \nfederal appellate courts have consistently tracked \nthese twin principles.  Specifically, consistent with \nNicastro\u2019s sovereign-specific analysis, virtually every \nfederal appellate court has held that, as a constitu-\ntional matter, a defendant must have sufficient \ncontacts with the United States a whole.  See Gary B. \nBorn & Peter B. Rutledge, International Civil Litigation in \nUnited States Courts 224-29 (7th ed. 2023) (collecting \ncases).2  This is \u201cthe law as it has been unanimously \n \n2 With one possible exception, every federal appellate court has \na reported opinion applying the nationwide contacts test to the \nFifth Amendment inquiry.  See Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, \n592 n.2 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (reaffirming nationwide contacts test and \nciting decisions from the First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, Seventh, Ninth, Eleventh and Federal Circuits); Douglass, \n46 F.4th at 239 & n. 24 (adopting nationwide contacts test and \nciting cases from the Second, Sixth, Seventh, Eleventh, Federal \nand D.C. Circuits).  Jurisprudence in the Eighth Circuit is scant, \nbut its most authoritative opinion, In re Federal Fountain, 165 \nF.3d 600 (8th Cir. 1999) (en banc), has been interpreted to apply \na nationwide contacts test.  See, e.g., FTC v. BINT Ops. LLC, 595 \nF.Supp.3d 740, 746-47 (E.D. Ark. 2022). \nThe lone exception might be the Tenth Circuit.  Peay v. \nBellSouth Med. Assistance Plan, 205 F.3d 1206 (10th Cir. 2000), \ncould be read to require \u201cconstitutionally significant inconvenience.\u201d  \nKlein v. Cornelius, 786 F.3d 1310 (10th Cir. 2015).  But see \n\n21 \naccepted among the circuit courts.\u201d  Douglass, 46 F.4th \nat 232 n.8.  This \u201cnationwide contacts\u201d test operates in \ncases arising under federal law either where the \nfederal statute supplying the basis for federal question \njurisdiction authorizes nationwide (or worldwide) \nservice of process or, in cases of certain federal claims \nlacking a service of process provision and involving \nforeign defendants, under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 4(k)(2).  See BNSF Ry. Co. v. Tyrrell, 581 U.S. \n402, 409 (2017); Omni Capital, 484 U.S. at 106\u2013107. \nSee also Gov\u2019t Br. at 33. \nOther aspects of federal practice reflect this \ncommonsense view.  Specifically, Rule 4(k)(2), adopted \nby this Court pursuant to the Rules Enabling Act, \nauthorizes personal jurisdiction in certain cases that \n(a) arise under federal law and (b) where no state court \nwould have jurisdiction.  See United States v. Swiss \nAm. Bank, 191 F.3d 30, 38-40 (1st Cir. 1999) \n(describing operation of Rule 4(k)(2)).  In such cases, \nRule 4(k)(2) still requires the exercise of jurisdiction to \nbe \u201cconsistent with the [United States] Constitution.\u201d  \nId. at 38.  This formulation necessarily implies that \nsome exercises of personal jurisdiction by the United \nStates can be inconsistent with the Constitution.   \nWhat the rule implies, the Advisory Committee \nNotes confirm.  Those Advisory Committee Notes have \npreviously guided this Court\u2019s interpretation of the \n \nCompa\u00f1\u00eda de Inversiones Mercantiles, S.A. v. Grupo Cementos de \nChihuahua S.A.B. De C.V., 970 F.3d 1269, 1281 n.1 (10th Cir. \n2020) (reserving the question whether there is a \u201cmeaningful \ndistinction\u201d between the Fifth Amendment and Fourteenth \nAmendment frameworks).  Despite the difference in phraseology, \nthe Tenth Circuit has not explicitly rejected a nationwide \ncontacts test, nor would the results have clearly differed under \nexpress application of a nationwide contacts test. \n\n22 \nconstitutional boundaries of personal jurisdiction.  See, \ne.g., Insurance Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 705 n.11.  \nHere, they explain that the underlying reason for Rule \n4(k)(2)\u2019s \u201cconsistency\u201d test was to ensure that federal \ncourts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdiction under 4(k)(2) \ncomported with the Fifth Amendment.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4 advisory committee\u2019s note (1993).  Specifically, \naccording to the Advisory Committee Notes, \u201c[t]he \nFifth Amendment requires that any defendant have \naffiliating contacts with the United States sufficient to \njustify the exercise of personal jurisdiction over that \nparty.\u201d  Id.  \nDespite this practically uniform view among the \nlower federal courts, a few federal judges have pointed \nto scholarly literature suggesting a radically different \nview of the Fifth Amendment.  See Lewis v. Mutond, 62 \nF.4th 587, 597-98 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (Rao, J., concurring); \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 249-82 (Elrod, J., dissenting); see \ngenerally Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdiction  \nof the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703 (2020).  \nUnder that view, personal jurisdiction can be exercised \nconsistent with the Fifth Amendment so long as it is \nconsistent with whatever process Congress has \nauthorized.  That conclusion follows, according to the \njudges relying on this literature, from the propositions \nthat \u201cdue process of law\u201d does not directly incorporate \nthe traditional limits on personal jurisdiction; the \nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s limits on such jurisdiction \nrest primarily on narrow concerns about interstate \nfederalism; and the corollary proposition that federalism \ninterests drop out for the Fifth Amendment.  These \nsupporting propositions are all flawed and would lead \nto a dramatic and disruptive sea change in the law if \nendorsed by this Court. \n\n23 \nFor starters, \u201c[i]t is manifest that it was not left to \nthe legislative power to enact any process which might \nbe devised.\u201d  Murray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land  \n& Imp. Co., 59 U.S. 272, 276 (1855).  The Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, like the Fourteenth\u2019s, \nis \u201ca restraint on the legislative as well as on the \nexecutive and judicial powers of the government, and \ncannot be so construed as to leave congress free to \nmake any process \u2018due process of law,\u2019 by its mere will.\u201d  \nId.  The Fifth Amendment instead guarantees \u201cthose \nusages and modes of proceeding existing in the \ncommon and statute law of England, before the \nemigration of our ancestors, and which are shown not \nto have been unsuited to their civil and political \ncondition by having been acted on by them after the \nsettlement of this country.\u201d  Id. at 277. \nDuring the Founding era, the territorial reach of a \ncourt\u2019s process (that is, the extent of its personal \njurisdiction) was governed by the unwritten law of \nnations.  See, e.g., Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 611-\n13 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (Story, J., riding circuit); Toland \nv. Sprague, 37 U.S. 300, 328 (1838) (describing Picquet\u2019s \nreasoning as having \u201cgreat force\u201d); see generally Austen \nParrish, Foreign Nations, Constitutional Rights and \nInternational Law, 88 Fordham L. Rev. Online 88, 99 \n(2019) (\u201cIn the Founding era personal jurisdiction was \nlimited by the territorial limits of international law.\u201d).  \nThe law of nations was \u201cadopted in its full extent by \nthe common law, and [was] held to be a part of the law \nof the land.\u201d  4 Blackstone\u2019s Commentaries on the \nLaws of England 67 (Chicago 1979); see also, e.g., The \nNereide, 13 U.S. 388, 423 (1815) (Marshall, C.J.) (\u201c[T]he \nlaw of nations . . . is a part of the law of the land.\u201d).  \nAnd because due process requires a valid judgment \nissued by a court with jurisdiction, this Court has \n\u201clong\u201d considered \u201cthe principles traditionally followed \n\n24 \nby American courts in marking out the territorial \nlimits of\u201d judicial process to be among those usages \nand modes of proceedings required for due process of \nlaw.  Burnham v. Superior Court, 495 U.S. 604, 609 \n(1990) (citing Pennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714, 722-23 \n(1877)).  So, while those procedural principles apply \nsomewhat differently to state and federal courts, they \nare constitutionalized by the Due Process Clauses  \nof the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.  The \ntraditional rules governing personal jurisdiction apply \ndirectly by those Amendments\u2019 own force. \nThe Founding- and Reconstruction-era history shows, \nmoreover, that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s limits on \nstate-court personal jurisdiction do not merely derive \nfrom narrow concerns about interstate federalism.  See \nLivnat, 851 F.3d at 55 (\u201c[P]ersonal jurisdiction is not \njust about federalism[.]\u201d) (citations and internal \nquotations omitted)).  Those limits are instead state-\nlevel applications of the broader, \u201cwell-established \nprinciples of public law\u201d under the law of nations \ngoverning the territorial reach of all sovereigns\u2019 \ncourts.  Pennoyer, 95 U.S. at 722; see generally Born & \nRutledge at 106-07.  And those limits are \u201cultimately a \nfunction of the individual liberty interest preserved by \nthe Due Process Clause.\u201d  Insurance Corp. of Ireland, \n456 U.S. at 702 n.10; see Douglass, 46 F.4th at 236 \n(\u201c\u2018[F]ederalism\u2019 is a proxy for the abstract burden of a \ndefendant submitting to the coercive power of a forum \nwith little interest in the dispute[.]\u201d).  Cf. Bond v. \nUnited States, 564 U.S. 211, 222 (2011) (\u201c[F]ederalism \nprotects the liberty of the individual.\u201d).  While the \nprotection of that liberty interest may give rise to \nadditional federalism concerns when state courts are \ninvolved, the liberty interest is still implicated in \nfederal courts.  Both the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments protect defendants from the \u201cburden of \n\n25 \nlitigating in a distant or inconvenient forum\u201d in \nviolation of the traditional territorial limits on judicial \nprocess governing all sovereigns.  World\u2013Wide \nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 291\u201392 \n(1980); see also Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Shutts, 472 \nU.S. 797, 807 (1985). \nTaken to its logical extreme, the contrary academic \nargument admits few, if any, limits.  The traditional \nlimits on personal jurisdiction, for both state and \nfederal courts, would remain vulnerable to judicial \nerosion and total abrogation by Congress.  Such abro-\ngation would harm the American business community, \nespecially the small businesses that comprise a majority \nof that community.  See Stephanie Ferguson Melhorn \net al., Small Business Data Center, U.S. Chamber of \nCommerce (May 20, 2024), https://www.uschamber.com/ \nsmall-business/small-business-data-center (reporting \nthat 99.9% of businesses in the U.S. are small busi-\nnesses).  On this point, several opinions in Nicastro \nexplained how capacious views of personal jurisdiction \n(like Justice Brennan\u2019s \u201cforeseeability\u201d test from \nAsahi) carry \u201cundesirable consequences . . . no less \nsignificant for domestic producers. The owner of a \nsmall Florida farm might sell crops to a large nearby \ndistributor, for example, who might then distribute \nthem to grocers across the country.\u201d  564 U.S. at 885 \n(plurality opinion); see also id. at 891-92 (Breyer, J., \nconcurring in the judgment, joined by Alito, J.) (discussing \nadverse implications of sweeping personal jurisdiction \nrules for domestic small businesses).  The \u201cundesirable \nconsequences\u201d of the academic argument are far more \nsubstantial than Justice Brennan\u2019s foreseeability test.  \nThat same Florida farmer is not simply subject to \npersonal jurisdiction in \u201cforeseeable\u201d federal forums \nbut, rather, in any federal forum provided that the \ndefendant has been served with process. \n\n26 \nAs the Government acknowledges, \u201cstrong policy \nreasons\u201d counsel against the academic argument.  See \nGov\u2019t Br. at 47-48.  As this Court elsewhere has \nacknowledged, apart from the effect on domestic \ncommerce, expansive assertions of jurisdiction (whether \nprescriptive or judicial) elevate the risk of foreign \nnations engaging in retaliatory assertions of jurisdiction \nover United States citizens and companies.  See Kiobel \nv. Royal Dutch Petroleum, 569 U.S. 108, 124 (2013).  \nSuch risks are more than hypothetical and have ample \nhistorical precedents.  See Born & Rutledge at 776-79.  \nBy contrast, a constitutional test examining nationwide \ncontacts reduces the friction between the United States \nand foreign nations, thereby accommodating the \u201cstrong \npolicy reasons\u201d noted in the Government\u2019s brief. \nIn sum, the implications of adopting the broad \nposition in this case are not limited to foreign entities \nbut have profound implications for American citizens \nand American business, especially small businesses, \nwhere the costs and burdens of having to defend in \nunfamiliar federal forums are substantial.  Ultimately, \nthese petitions do not require this Court to examine \nthose implications.  As already explained, the values \nunderpinning the Fifth Amendment are not at stake \nin this case: Respondents are not entitled to the \nprotections of the Due Process Clause.   \n \n \n \n \n \n\n27 \nB. The consent doctrine is a narrow \nexception to those Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendment \nlimits \non \npersonal \njurisdiction. \nIt has long been recognized that a defendant can, \nunder some circumstances, consent to personal juris-\ndiction.  Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 703.  This \nflows from the uncontested proposition that the \nconstitutional constraints on personal jurisdiction partly \nprotect a nonresident defendant\u2019s \u201cliberty interest.\u201d  \nId. at 702.  But consent is not a wholly malleable \nconcept.  Neither Congress (nor a state government) \ncan \u201csimply declare anything it wants to be consent,\u201d \nsee Pet. App. 123a, lest it trample upon that very \nliberty interest.   \nConsent in this context is not always easy to define.  \nThe easiest cases are typically when consent is \nexplicit, such as in a pre-dispute agreement (like in a \nforum selection or arbitration clause) or after a dispute \nhas arisen (like in a stipulation).  Carnival Cruise \nLines, Inc. v. Shute, 499 U.S. 585, 595 (1991); M/S \nBremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 15 (1972); \nNational Equipment Rental, Ltd. v. Szukhent, 375 U.S. \n311, 316 (1964); Petrowski v. Hawkeye-Security Co., \n350 U.S. 495, 496 (1956).  Implied consent is more \ndifficult.  This Court has approved it in only a handful \nof cases as a result of certain litigation-related \nconduct, see Ins. Corp. of Ireland, 456 U.S. at 704, or \nselect activity that is \u201cdeemed\u201d consent by operation of \nlaw, see, e.g., Mallory, 600 U.S. at 134-35; Pennsylvania \nFire Ins. Co. of Philadelphia v. Gold Issue Mining & \nMilling Co., 243 U.S. 93, 94-95 (1917).   \nThe Second Circuit judges divided on how the \nconsent doctrine might be applied to the PSJVTA.  The \npanel found that the consent doctrine did not support \n\n28 \njurisdiction because the PSJVTA did not rely on \nlitigation-related conduct or on \u201creciprocal benefits\u201d \nthat a defendant derived from the United States.  Pet. \nApp. 25a-47a.  By contrast, the judges dissenting from \nthe denial of en banc rehearing found that the consent \ndoctrine supported jurisdiction because that doctrine \ndid not require a \u201creciprocal benefit;\u201d it simply \nrequired \u201cknowing and voluntary\u201d conduct \u201cwith a \nnexus to the forum.\u201d  Id. 231a. \nThe division is not surprising; Mallory left many \nopen questions about the concept of implied consent.  \nIndeed, to the list of factors the Second Circuit \ndiscussed as potentially relevant to the issue of consent, \none could add others.  For example, how \u201cvoluntary\u201d \ndoes the conduct have to be to constitute consent?  Cf. \nCollege Savings Bank v. Florida Prepaid Postsecondary \nEducation Expense Bd., 527 U.S. 666, 682 (1999).  \nWhat relevance, if any, does the power authorizing the \n\u201cdeemed consent\u201d legislation have to the analysis?   \nCf. Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 36 \n(2010) (recognizing that, with the exercise of the foreign \naffairs power, the views of the political branches are \n\u201centitled to significant weight\u201d); see also Bank Markazi \nv. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 215 (2016); Gov\u2019t Br. at 37.  \nHow does the scope of the consent\u2014general or \nspecific\u2014factor into assessment of voluntariness?  Cf. \nHess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 355-56 (1927); Gov\u2019t Br. \nat 29.  And should the particular characteristics of \ndefendants\u2014here, foreign political entities\u2014be taken \ninto account? \nTo the extent this Court seeks to engage on this \nissue, it would be helpful to reject a boundless reading \nof Mallory and impose clear guardrails.  \u201cA prospective \ndefendant\u2019s activities do not signify consent to personal \njurisdiction simply because Congress has labeled them \n\n29 \nas such.\u201d  Pet. App. 21a.  Much like a boundless \ninterpretation of the Fifth Amendment, supra Part \nII.A., a boundless \u201cconsent doctrine\u201d would undermine \nthe individual liberty interests of all persons protected \nby the Due Process Clauses, including United States \ncitizens.  A boundless construction of the consent \ndoctrine \u201cwould effectively mean that there are no due \nprocess limitations on the exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion.  Congress or a state legislature could provide for \njurisdiction over any defendant for any conduct so long \nas the conduct postdated enactment of the law at issue.\u201d  \nId. 115a.  For example, Congress could enact a statute \nsubjecting United States citizens to all-purpose general \njurisdiction in any federal court in the country based \nupon their implied \u201cconsent\u201d through engagement in \ncertain ordinary, even constitutionally protected, acts \nlike purchasing goods from another state or interstate \ntravel.  Such an approach would be inconsistent with \nsettled doctrine.  See College Savings Bank, 527 U.S. at \n682.   \nAnd a boundless theory of consent is simply unnec-\nessary.  This Court\u2019s general jurisdiction jurisprudence \nalready \u201cafford[s] plaintiffs recourse to at least one \nclear and certain forum\u201d in the case of domestic \ndefendants, Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 137 \n(2014): the defendant\u2019s domicile in case of an individual \ndefendant and, in the case of a corporate entity, its \nstate of incorporation and, possibly, a separate \nprincipal place of business.  Foreign defendants may \nalso be subject to jurisdiction in the United States if \nthey meet an appropriate contacts analysis.  See supra \nPart II.A. Here, of course, Respondents are not even \nentitled to the protections of the Due Process Clause.   \n \n\n30 \nThis final point returns full circle to the Chamber\u2019s \nopening argument:  Respondents are not entitled to \nthe protections of the Due Process Clause.  This Court \nshould reverse on that basis.   \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the lower court\u2019s judgment \nshould be reversed, and the case should be remanded. \nRespectfully submitted, \nJENNIFER B.

This \nCourt can decide this case by applying that Fourteenth \nAmendment standard to the Act of Congress at issue \nhere.  But in addition, the Constitution, including the \nFifth Amendment, at a minimum affords Congress \nbroader power and greater flexibility to provide for the \nexercise of personal jurisdiction by federal courts, par-\n\n2 \n \nticularly in contexts implicating foreign affairs and na-\ntional security.   \nCongress passed and the President signed the Pro-\nmoting Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism \nAct of 2019 (Act), Pub. L. No. 116-94, Div. J, Tit. IX, \n\u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 3082, in accordance with those constitu-\ntional principles, to further the Nation\u2019s foreign policy, \nprotect national security, and provide a means to seek \ncompensation for U.S. victims of terrorism in which re-\nspondents played a role.  The Act provides that respond-\nents, the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and \nthe Palestinian Authority (PA), can continue to avoid \nvictims\u2019 lawsuits under the Antiterrorism Act of 1990 \n(ATA), Pub. L. No. 101-519, \u00a7 132, 104 Stat. 2250 (18 \nU.S.C. 2331 et seq.), if they (a) cease making so-called \n\u201cmartyr payments\u201d for Palestinian terrorists who in-\njured or killed Americans, and (b) forgo any operations \non U.S. soil, except for those necessary for their role at \nthe United Nations or for specific interactions, such as \nwith U.S. officials.  See 18 U.S.C. 2334(e).*  Otherwise, \nrespondents would be deemed to consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in ATA suits. \nRespondents did not conform their actions to those \nconditions, despite having promptly done so in response \nto conditions in a predecessor statute, the Anti-Terror-\nism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), Pub. L. No. 115-\n253, 132 Stat. 3183.  See U.S. Br. 10-11.  Respondents \nindisputably continued to make the covered payments, \nand they allegedly continued to engage in nonexempt \nactivities in the United States.  So the plaintiffs in these \n \n*  As in our opening brief, all citations of 18 U.S.C. 2334(e) in this \nbrief refer to the statute as set forth in Supplement IV (2022) of the \nUnited States Code, and all references to \u201cPet. App.\u201d are to the pe-\ntition appendix in No. 24-20. \n\n3 \n \ncases, terrorism victims and their families, properly in-\nvoked the Act as a basis for personal jurisdiction over \nrespondents.   \nRespondents are wrong in contending that the Act is \nunconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause, which they mistakenly view as impos-\ning schematic and rigid restrictions on personal juris-\ndiction they purport to find in Fourteenth Amendment \ncase law.  The Act provides a fair and reasonable basis \nfor establishing personal jurisdiction by deeming spec-\nified actions having a U.S. nexus as submission to the \njurisdiction of U.S. courts.  The Act\u2019s constitutionality \nis especially clear in light of respondents\u2019 unique status \nas non-sovereign foreign entities that exercise govern-\nmental functions and have been the subject of a distinc-\ntive and multifaceted U.S. policy for decades.  If due \nprocess permits a State to deem any registered busi-\nness to consent to suit on any claim, see Mallory v. Nor-\nfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023), then surely this far \nmore narrowly focused Act of Congress is constitu-\ntional.   \nRespondents\u2019 approach to personal jurisdiction es-\nsentially ignores the foregoing features and principles \nsupporting the Act.  Instead, respondents offer differ-\ning accounts of when a party may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.  But in the end, their due process claim reduces \nto the mere assertion (Resp. Br. 2, 41) that their actions \ndid not signify actual \u201csubmission to personal jurisdic-\ntion in the United States\u201d or \u201csupport a presumption\u201d \nof actual submission.  They seemingly contend that a \nparty cannot be deemed to consent to personal jurisdic-\ntion based on conduct that is insufficient to establish \n\u201cgeneral\u201d or \u201cspecific\u201d jurisdiction\u2014a thesis this Court \n\n4 \n \nhas rejected in a long line of precedents accepting con-\nstructive consent as a separate basis for personal juris-\ndiction, most recently in Mallory.  Most fundamentally, \nhowever, respondents wrongly treat the Act like an ab-\nerrant state law, rather than an Act of Congress that is \nsubject to distinct constitutional analysis under the \nFifth Amendment and rests on sensitive determinations \nof foreign policy and national security by the political \nBranches, to which the courts owe great deference.  The \njudgments of the court of appeals should be reversed. \nA. The Act Fairly And Reasonably Deems Respondents To \nConsent To Personal Jurisdiction  \nFirst and foremost, this Court could reverse the \njudgments below on narrow grounds.  Even assuming \narguendo that the same general due process standards \ngovern personal jurisdiction under the Fifth Amend-\nment as under the Fourteenth Amendment, the Act \npasses muster.  By any measure, the Act comports with \n\u201ctraditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u201d  \nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310, \n316 (1945) (citation omitted).  Respondents make no \nmeaningful argument that the Act is unfair, and for \ngood reason:  any such assertion would fail. \n1. Respondents misunderstand this Court\u2019s construc-\ntive-consent precedents \na. Respondents accept that a \u201cvariety of legal ar-\nrangements\u201d can support actual or constructive consent \nto personal jurisdiction under the Due Process Clause \nof the Fourteenth Amendment.  Insurance Corp. of Ir., \nLtd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. \n694, 703 (1982); see Resp. Br. 27.  As we have explained \n(U.S. Br. 24-26), constructive consent is consistent with \ndue process if it is based on a voluntary act and is not \n\n5 \n \nunfair or exorbitant\u2014for example, where the voluntary \nact relates to the forum and implicates its interests.  \nWhile actual consent is not required, a State may not \ndeem any action whatsoever to constitute submission to \nthe jurisdiction of the forum.  Ibid.  Respondents thus \nattack a strawman in arguing (Br. 3, 27, 41-42) that con-\nstructive consent cannot be decreed at the lawmaker\u2019s \nwhim. \nRespondents object that the constitutional standard \nwe submit is applicable in this case\u2014that constructive \nconsent is consistent with due process if based on a vol-\nuntary act and is not unfair or exorbitant\u2014is \u201cad hoc\u201d \nand \u201c\u200a\u2018flexible.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. 39 (citation omitted).  But due pro-\ncess, both in general and as applied to personal jurisdic-\ntion, resists \u201cmechanical or quantitative\u201d analysis.  In-\nternational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 319; see Jennings v. Ro-\ndriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 314 (2018).  No inflexible stand-\nard would encompass all the various bases for personal \njurisdiction, and the different forms of constructive con-\nsent in particular, that this Court has upheld under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  It is the basic requirements \nof fairness and absence of exorbitance in the particular \ncontext that undergirds them all. \nAccordingly, the same sorts of fairness factors that \nthis Court has considered in non-consent \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d cases also inform the due process inquiry in \nconsent cases, contra Resp. Br. 40.  Whether a party \nmay be deemed to submit to the court\u2019s jurisdiction by \nnot complying with jurisdictional discovery orders, for \nexample, can depend on considerations like the extent \nto which the party was warned of the jurisdictional con-\nsequence and the reasonableness of that consequence.  \nSee Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 707-708; cf. Hovey v. \nElliott, 167 U.S. 409, 444 (1897) (entering judgment as \n\n6 \n \n\u201cpunish[ment]\u201d for contempt violated due process).  \nWhether a visiting motorist may be deemed to consent \nto personal jurisdiction in the courts of a State by driv-\ning on its public highways can depend on whether the \nconsent statute ensures adequate notice of any suit.  See \nWuchter v. Pizzutti, 276 U.S. 13, 18-19 (1928) (distin-\nguishing Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352 (1927), on that \nbasis).  The question is whether, under the circum-\nstances, a finding of constructive consent to personal ju-\nrisdiction in the forum is \u201cso deeply unfair that it vio-\nlates the [defendant\u2019s] constitutional right to due pro-\ncess.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 153 (Alito, J., concurring in \npart and concurring in the judgment); see id. at 146 n.11 \n(plurality opinion). \nb. Respondents offer no plausible alternative stand-\nard for distinguishing valid constructive consent to per-\nsonal jurisdiction from an unconstitutional \u201cmere asser-\ntion\u201d of judicial power over a foreign defendant.  Chi-\ncago Life Ins. Co. v. Cherry, 244 U.S. 25, 29 (1917); see \nid. at 29-30 (\u201cwhat acts of the defendant shall be deemed \na submission to [a court\u2019s] power is a matter upon which \nStates may differ\u201d). \nRather, respondents repeatedly imply that construc-\ntive consent is not a viable basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion at all, despite the \u201clegion of precedents\u201d to the con-\ntrary.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality opinion).  They \nrecurringly posit (Resp. Br. 1, 29, 33-35, 38-39, 68-69) \nthat consent cannot be premised on conduct that has \nbeen found insufficient for general or specific personal \njurisdiction under a minimum-contacts theory (see U.S. \nBr. 22).  That is clearly wrong.  This Court has recog-\nnized consent as an independent basis for personal ju-\nrisdiction from the start.  See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 138, \n\n7 \n \n145 (plurality opinion) (citing, e.g., York v. Texas, 137 \nU.S. 15, 19-21 (1890)); id. at 167 (Barrett, J., dissenting). \nNor, contrary to respondents\u2019 contention, may a de-\nfendant be deemed to submit to the jurisdiction of the \nforum\u2019s courts only if it harbors an actual \u201cintention to \nsubmit.\u201d  Br. 29 (citation omitted).  Constructive con-\nsent does not require the defendant to have \u201creally sub-\nmitted to proceedings\u201d in the forum State\u2014that is what \nmakes the consent constructive.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n144 (plurality opinion).  In suggesting otherwise, respond-\nents rely on an inapplicable decision addressing state \nsovereign immunity, College Savings Bank v. Florida \nPrepaid Postsecondary Education Expense Board, 527 \nU.S. 666 (1999).  Resp. Br. 10, 12, 21-23 & n.7, 41; cf. \nU.S. Br. 39-40.  But while constructive consent may not \nbe \u201ccommonly associated\u201d with many other constitu-\ntional protections, such as state sovereign immunity, \nResp. Br. 23 n.7 (quoting College Sav. Bank, 527 U.S. at \n681), it has been associated with the one at issue here\u2014\ndue process constraints on personal jurisdiction\u2014for \nmore than a century.  See, e.g., Pennsylvania Fire Ins. \nCo. v. Gold Issue Mining & Milling Co., 243 U.S. 93 \n(1917). \nWhen respondents do acknowledge the possibility of \nconstructive consent to personal jurisdiction, they ini-\ntially gesture toward the categories that the Second \nCircuit recognized below.  They thus suggest that con-\nsent can be grounded only in the defendant\u2019s \u201cactions in \nthe litigation itself\u200a\u201d or its \u201cacceptance of a government \nbenefit or privilege.\u201d  Resp. Br. 19, 22-23; cf. Pet. App. \n24a (\u201clitigation-related activities or reciprocal bar-\ngains\u201d).  But, like the court of appeals, they never ex-\nplain what unites those categories to the exclusion of \nothers.  See U.S. Br. 39.   \n\n8 \n \nAny such effort would be unavailing.  The reason why \ncertain litigation conduct and reciprocal bargains can be \ndeemed consent to personal jurisdiction is because the \nconsent is based on voluntary action and it is fundamen-\ntally fair in the circumstances to establish personal ju-\nrisdiction as a consequence.  For instance, consent based \non a defendant\u2019s voluntary litigation conduct can be ef-\nfective when the conduct itself suggests the defendant \nlacks a sound defense to personal jurisdiction.  See \nResp. Br. 20-21 (discussing Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 705).  But other forms of litigation activity can suffice \ntoo, despite the absence of any similar inference, be-\ncause consent is grounded in voluntary action that is \nfairly regarded as submission to the court\u2019s jurisdiction.  \nSee Adam v. Saenger, 303 U.S. 59, 67-68 (1938) (filing \nsuit in state court was validly deemed consent to juris-\ndiction on a counterclaim). \nIn the end, however, respondents appear to agree \nthat \u201cother conduct\u201d besides litigation activity and ex-\nchanges of benefits may \u201c\u200a\u2018amount[] to a legal submis-\nsion to the jurisdiction of the court,\u2019\u200a\u201d consistent with \ndue process.  Br. 27 (quoting Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. \nat 704-705).  The Fourteenth Amendment requires only \nthat such conduct be voluntary and the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction not be unfair or exorbitant. \n2. The Act is consistent with Fourteenth Amendment \ndue process principles \na. The Act comfortably satisfies that standard.  No \none disputes that the conduct giving rise to consent un-\nder the statute\u2019s \u201cpayments\u201d and \u201cactivities\u201d prongs is \nvoluntary.  18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(A) and (B); see U.S. Br. \n27.  And the Act is eminently fair and reasonable.  Re-\nspondents are sophisticated entities that exercise gov-\nernmental functions and operate on the international \n\n9 \n \nplane, and they have had a long, distinctive, and multi-\nfaceted relationship with the United States.  U.S. Br. \n28-30.  That course of dealing has entailed reciprocal \nundertakings and substantial benefits conferred and \nconditions imposed by the United States on respond-\nents, and engagement on respondents\u2019 relation to acts \nof terrorism affecting U.S. nationals has been a central \nconcern of the United States for many years.  Respond-\nents have also long had a presence in the United States, \nand they have litigated numerous ATA cases here.  Im-\nportantly, the actions triggering consent and the nar-\nrow set of cases covered by the Act involve U.S. terri-\ntory or nationals, and the Act serves vital U.S. interests.  \nCf. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 164 (Barrett, J., dissenting) \n(consent statute extended to cases \u201cwith no connection \nwhatsoever to the forum\u201d).  Respondents were made \nfully aware of the conduct that would be deemed con-\nsent under the Act, concededly engaged in covered con-\nduct, and thereby submitted to federal-court jurisdic-\ntion under the Act\u2019s tailored terms. \nTellingly, respondents do not complain of any lack of \nnotice or contend that litigating these cases in the \nUnited States would force them to bear an unfair or un-\nmanageable burden.  And respondents recognize that if \nthey were natural persons, mere service of process in \nthis country would establish \u201ctag\u201d jurisdiction over \nthem; their only response (Br. 50) is that they are not \nnatural persons, but rather entities that act through \n\u201cambassador[s]\u201d and other agents.  Respondents do not \nexplain why that distinction should be dispositive, or \nwhy this consequence of their rigid and restrictive due \nprocess theory does not seriously undermine that the-\nory.  See Pet. App. 239a, 247a-248a (Menashi, J., dis-\nsenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \n\n10 \n \nRespondents also do not dispute (Br. 43) that if the \nUnited States recognized them as sovereigns, they \nwould not have constitutional due process rights at all.  \nRespondents just note that they would then possess \nsovereign immunity under the Foreign Sovereign Im-\nmunities Act (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. 1330, 1441(d), 1602 et \nseq.  But the scope of that immunity is defined by the \nFSIA, with due regard for the United States\u2019 obliga-\ntions to the community of nations.  See Republic of Iraq \nv. Beaty, 556 U.S. 848, 856-857 (2009).  Respondents\u2019 re-\njoinder does not support their claim to a constitutional \nright to avoid jurisdiction in these cases.  It would be \nbizarre to afford such a right to respondents based on \ntheir natural-person and non-sovereign status, but not \nto other parties that are similarly situated in relevant \nrespects. \nb. Respondents nevertheless maintain (Br. 28) that \nneither of the two forms of \u201cpredicate conduct\u201d trigger-\ning constructive consent under the Act \u201cprovides a valid \nbasis for \u2018deeming\u2019 that Respondents have \u2018consented\u2019 \nto jurisdiction.\u201d  Respondents are wrong. \ni. Consider the Act\u2019s payments prong, 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A).  Besides insisting that the payments for \nterrorists do not suffice for specific jurisdiction\u2014which \nis beside the point, see pp. 6-7, supra\u2014respondents em-\nphasize (Br. 28-30) that those payments do not require \nthe United States\u2019 authorization.  That is beside the point \nas well.  The defendant in Hess v. Pawloski, for exam-\nple, did not need Massachusetts\u2019 permission to drive on \nits highways.  274 U.S. at 353; see United States v. Guest, \n383 U.S. 745, 757 (1966) (describing \u201c[t]he constitutional \nright to travel from one State to another, and neces-\nsarily to use the highways and other instrumentalities \nof interstate commerce in doing so\u201d).  That did not mean \n\n11 \n \nthe Commonwealth violated due process by enacting a \nlaw deeming visiting motorists to consent to personal \njurisdiction.  See Hess, 274 U.S. at 356-357.  Moreover, \nrespondents seem to concede (Br. 30) that Congress \ncould enact legislation penalizing the covered pay-\nments by respondents.  It would be a strange constitu-\ntional rule that nonetheless barred Congress from at-\ntaching consequences to those payments in the manner \nit chose here. \nRespondents also claim (Br. 31) to have \u201cformally re-\nvoked\u201d the payments program last month.  Whether the \nrevocation is a matter of form or substance remains to \nbe seen.  See Adam Rasgon & Aaron Boxerman, Pales-\ntinian Leader Ends Payments to Prisoners Jailed by \nIsrael, N.Y. Times, Feb. 12, 2025, at A8 (\u201cBoth U.S. and \nIsraeli officials will closely monitor the implementation \nof the new policy to see whether it leads to a genuine \nshift.\u201d).  More to the point, respondents concede that \nthey persisted in making covered payments after the \npayments prong\u2019s effective date.  Pet. App. 16a n.5.  The \nprogram\u2019s purported revocation could only matter if re-\nspondents sustained it for five years.  See 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(1)(A) and (2).  For present purposes, then, this \ndevelopment is relevant only insofar as it reinforces the \nvoluntariness of the payments and supports the political \nBranches\u2019 judgment that the Act is an effective means \nof discouraging payments that incentivize terrorism\u2014a \nlongstanding foreign-policy and national-security prior-\nity of the United States.  See U.S. Br. 29, 35-37. \nii. Respondents take much the same flawed ap-\nproach to the activities prong, 18 U.S.C. 2334(e)(1)(B).  \nThey note that the covered activities do not render re-\nspondents \u201cat home\u201d and subject to general jurisdiction \n\n12 \n \nin the United States for any claim, Br. 33, 35, 38-39, \neven though no one at this point suggests otherwise.   \nThen, following the Second Circuit\u2019s lead, respond-\nents contend that the Act does not embody a valid ex-\nchange of benefits\u2014which is not required in any event, \nsee pp. 7-8, supra\u2014because the Act itself \u201cdoes not au-\nthorize Respondents to enter the United States, or to \nconduct any activities here.\u201d  Br. 36; see Pet. App. 28a-\n29a.  But they concede (Br. 38) that the Act\u2019s predeces-\nsor, the ATCA, was constitutional, even though that law \nlikewise did not itself authorize any activities in the \nUnited States.  The ATCA referred to possible authori-\nzation through other legal means:  it deemed respond-\nents to consent to personal jurisdiction if they engaged \nin certain U.S. activities while \u201cbenefiting from a waiver \nor suspension of section 1003 of the Anti-Terrorism Act \nof 1987,\u201d \u00a7 4(a), 132 Stat. 3184, which largely prohibits \nthe PLO from operating in the United States.  Respond-\nents do not explain why it matters under the Due Pro-\ncess Clause whether the covered activities are permit-\nted in the United States via a formal \u201cwaiver or suspen-\nsion,\u201d ibid.; lawful by virtue of limits on statutory re-\nstrictions governing respondents\u2019 U.S. activities, see \nU.S. Br. 42 (discussing the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism \nAct of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-446, \u00a7 7, 120 Stat. 3324 (22 \nU.S.C. 2378b note)); allowed as a matter of enforcement \ndiscretion, id. at 42-43; or are not authorized at all, Pet. \nApp. 249a-250a (Menashi, J., dissenting from denial of \nrehearing en banc).  Even if an exchange were required \nin this context, the Act contemplates one. \nRespondents dispute at length (Br. 34, 70-77) the \nplaintiffs\u2019 allegations that respondents triggered the ac-\ntivities prong.  That issue is not properly before this \nCourt because the court of appeals held the Act facially \n\n13 \n \nunconstitutional, without determining whether the ac-\ntivities prong was satisfied.  U.S. Br. 14-15; see Cutter \nv. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. 709, 718 n.7 (2005) (this Court is \none \u201cof review, not of first view\u201d).  But respondents\u2019 ef-\nfort to minimize the extent of their U.S. activities does \nhighlight a basic flaw in the court of appeals\u2019 reasoning.  \nUnder the court\u2019s logic, respondents would be constitu-\ntionally entitled to avoid ATA suits\u2014and potential ac-\ncountability for involvement in acts of terror that in-\njured or killed Americans\u2014even if respondents en-\ngaged in extensive activities on U.S. soil.  Due process \ndoes not demand such a bizarre and inequitable result. \nB. Congress In Any Event Has Broader Authority Than A \nState To Provide For Personal Jurisdiction  \nThe Act would be constitutional even if it did not sat-\nisfy due process limits on personal jurisdiction as artic-\nulated under the Fourteenth Amendment in cases in-\nvolving state courts\u2019 exercises of personal jurisdiction.  \nThis case arises in a starkly different context:  It in-\nvolves an Act of Congress providing for personal juris-\ndiction over sui generis foreign entities in federal cases \naffecting U.S. nationals and involving vital interests of \nthe Nation as a whole.  The political Branches have \nbroad constitutional power in the realms of foreign re-\nlations and national security, and their judgment con-\ncerning appropriate measures to be taken in those \nrealms and the interests of foreign parties affected are \nentitled to great weight.  Hernandez v. Mesa, 589 U.S. \n93, 103-104 (2020).  Congress also has unquestioned au-\nthority to regulate the jurisdiction of the federal courts, \nincluding personal jurisdiction.  See, e.g., In re Sealed \nCase, 932 F.3d 915, 925 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (collecting fed-\neral statutes authorizing nationwide service of process).  \nParticularly in the context presented here, but more \n\n14 \n \ngenerally too, the Fifth Amendment affords Congress \ngreater flexibility to provide for personal jurisdiction \nthan the Fourteenth Amendment affords the States.  \nThe court of appeals erred in holding otherwise. \n1. The Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments do not  \nrestrict personal jurisdiction in parallel \na. As we have noted (U.S. Br. 21-22), this Court has \nrepeatedly reserved the question whether the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments impose the same limits on \nfederal and state courts\u2019 exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion.  But it is hard to see how they could.  A central \npurpose of Fourteenth Amendment \u201cjurisdictional due \nprocess\u201d is safeguarding federalism, by ensuring that \nStates do not exceed territorial limits on their sover-\neignty and adjudicate disputes that, in our federal sys-\ntem, are not properly their business.  See Ford Motor \nCo. v. Montana Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 360 \n(2021); Bristol-Meyers Squibb Co. v. Superior Ct., 582 \nU.S. 255, 263 (2017).  The personal rights of litigants as \nagainst a particular State\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction \nmust be understood in light of our constitutional struc-\nture of separate States functioning under reciprocal \nterritorial limitations.  Thus, like the court of appeals, \nsee Pet. App. 48a, respondents overread (Br. 15) state-\nments in Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 702 & n.10, that \ndownplay\u2014contrary to many other precedents, like \nFord Motor and Bristol-Myers Squibb\u2014the role that \nfederalism plays in the due process inquiry under the \nFourteenth Amendment.  See 4 Charles Alan Wright et \nal., Federal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1067.1, at 381 (4th \ned. 2015) (Wright) (noting that \u201cit does not seem plausi-\nble\u201d to read federalism out of the analysis). \nFederalism concerns, of course, are inapplicable \nwhen Congress provides for the exercise of personal ju-\n\n15 \n \nrisdiction over foreign defendants in federal court.  See \nU.S. Br. 31-34.  The Second Circuit nevertheless held \nthat \u201cthe due process analyses under the Fifth and \nFourteenth Amendments parallel one another in civil \ncases.\u201d  Pet. App. 47a.   \nRespondents\u2019 defense of that holding is unpersua-\nsive.  Indeed, they initially defend it (Br. 47-48) only for \n\u201cconsent statute[s],\u201d principally citing Justice Alito\u2019s \nopinion in Mallory for the notion that federalism con-\ncerns \u201cplay no role\u201d in the consent context.  But Justice \nAlito\u2019s opinion did not endorse that proposition.  He \nmerely concluded that \u201cthe most appropriate home\u201d for \nfederalism concerns in consent cases is the \u201cdormant \nCommerce Clause.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 150 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment); see \nid. at 154-163.   \nNor is respondents\u2019 proposition tenable.  To be sure, \nan individual defendant\u2019s actual consent to suit may \npose little threat to the integrity of the Union\u2019s federal \nstructure, just as an individual defendant\u2019s waiver of his \nright to counsel does not threaten the vitality of the \nSixth Amendment.  But some state laws deeming par-\nties to constructively consent to personal jurisdiction \ncould pose an obvious risk of \u201csubvert[ing] interstate \nfederalism.\u201d  U.S. Amicus Br. at 4, Mallory, supra (No. \n21-1168).  Federal statutes like the Act in this case pre-\nsent no such danger, and Congress thus enjoys broader \nauthority than a State to provide for constructive con-\nsent to personal jurisdiction by foreign defendants.  \nWhich \u201cparticular constitutional provision\u201d embodies \nthese principles is not of paramount importance, Attor-\nney Gen. v. Soto-Lopez, 476 U.S. 898, 902-903 (1986) \n(plurality opinion), as respondents elsewhere agree, Br. \n63. \n\n16 \n \nIn the alternative, respondents endorse (Br. 48-50) \nthe more categorical view, held by the Second Circuit in \nthis case and several of its sister circuits, that the Fifth \nand Fourteenth Amendment rules for personal jurisdic-\ntion are the same across the board.  But neither the tex-\ntual parallels between the Due Process Clauses nor in-\ndividual-liberty interests support that simplistic under-\nstanding.  See U.S. Br. 31-32, 45-46.  This Court\u2019s re-\npeated indications that Fifth and Fourteenth Amend-\nment due process may differ foreshadowed cases like \nthis.  As the Court noted in French v. Barber Asphalt \nPaving Co., 181 U.S. 324 (1901), the two Due Process \nClauses \u201cwere ingrafted upon the Constitution at differ-\nent times and in widely different circumstances of our \nnational life,\u201d so \u201cit may be that questions may arise in \nwhich different constructions and applications of their \nprovisions may be proper.\u201d  Id. at 328. \nb. Respondents\u2019 concerns (Br. 42-43) about poten-\ntially limitless congressional power to provide for per-\nsonal jurisdiction over foreign defendants are un-\nfounded.  Congress has always enjoyed broad authority \n\u201cto impose jurisdiction over domestic defendants\u201d in \n\u201cfederal question case[s]\u201d because, as the courts of ap-\npeals agree, the Fifth Amendment at most requires the \ndefendant to have minimum contacts with the United \nStates as a whole, which domestic defendants have by \ndefinition.  Resp. Br. 42 (emphasis added); see 4 Wright \n\u00a7 1068.1, at 691-692, 734-737 & n.92.   \nRespondents\u2019 concerns are overstated as to foreign de-\nfendants too.  Because the Act here is narrowly drawn, \nthis case can be decided without any need to identify the \nouter limits of the Fifth Amendment regarding other \nclasses of foreign defendants.  U.S. Br. 34, 47; contra \nResp. Br. 42.  At the same time and for similar reasons, \n\n17 \n \nthe Court also need not address the plaintiffs\u2019 contrary \nassertion (24-20 Pet. Br. 16-29) that the Fifth Amend-\nment, as a matter of original meaning, has nothing to \nsay on the subject of personal jurisdiction.  The main \nacademic proponent of that theory agrees.  See Sachs \nAmicus Br. 6 (\u201cThe Court may uphold [the Act] while \nleaving open the outer limits of what the Fifth Amend-\nment might permit, just as it has for the last two hun-\ndred years.\u201d). \nThis Court should certainly not accept respondents\u2019 \nhistorical arguments, which theorize (Br. 58-64, 66-68) \nthat due process originally confined courts to exercising \npersonal jurisdiction over parties within their territo-\nrial jurisdiction and barred personal-jurisdiction stat-\nutes that were not generally applicable.  As the plain-\ntiffs explain (24-20 Pet. Br. 20-23), however, there is \nscant Founding-era evidence regarding due process \nlimits on personal jurisdiction.  And respondents\u2019 con-\ntention would perversely subject the federal government \nto greater constitutional constraints than the States, \nwhich\u2014as shown by Mallory and other precedents\u2014may \nprovide for personal jurisdiction over defendants lo-\ncated beyond their borders in some circumstances.  See \nBurnham v. Superior Ct., 495 U.S. 604, 618 (1990) (plu-\nrality opinion) (\u201cDue process does not necessarily re-\nquire the States to adhere to the unbending territorial \nlimits on jurisdiction set forth in Pennoyer [v. Neff, 95 \nU.S. 714 (1878)].\u201d).  No authority supports respondents\u2019 \nrestrictive theory of due process under the Fifth \nAmendment, and this Court should reject it. \n2. The political Branches\u2019 foreign-policy and national-\nsecurity judgments carry great weight  \na. Respondents\u2019 contention would also deprive the \npolitical Branches of an important means of exercising \n\n18 \n \ntheir constitutional authorities in the realms of foreign \naffairs and national security.  U.S. Br. 36-37.  Respond-\nents are sui generis foreign non-sovereign entities that \nexercise governmental functions and engage officially \nwith countries around the world.  Resp. Br. 46.  The Act \nis an important component of a decades-long, multifac-\neted effort by the United States, through numerous leg-\nislative and executive actions, to induce respondents to \ncease supporting terrorism\u2014\u201can urgent objective of \nthe highest order,\u201d Holder v. Humanitarian Law Pro-\nject, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010).  See U.S. Br. 34-38; see also \nid. at 6-13 (canvassing history of U.S. relations with re-\nspondents).  Under the Act, respondents must either \nstop making payments for terrorists who harm Ameri-\ncans and refrain from U.S.-based activities, or else be \ndeemed to submit to federal-court jurisdiction in ATA \nsuits.  Both routes offer important benefits to U.S. na-\ntional security and foreign policy, and due process does \nnot place either one off-limits. \nThe Act\u2019s importance is unaffected by the Solicitor \nGeneral\u2019s observation at an earlier stage of the Sokolow \nlitigation that the United States also has other means of \npursuing its antiterrorism objectives, such as bringing \ncriminal prosecutions for acts of terrorism.  See Resp. \nBr. 6.  ATA suits are an important complement to those \ntools, as Congress recognized in enacting and strength-\nening the ATA.  See, e.g., Justice Against Sponsors of \nTerrorism Act, Pub. L. No. 114-222, \u00a7 4, 130 Stat. 854 \n(2016).  The United States thus has always maintained \nthat \u201c[p]rivate actions under the Anti-Terrorism Act \nare an important means of fighting terrorism and \nproviding redress for victims of terrorist attacks and \ntheir families.\u201d  U.S. Amicus Br. at 7, Sokolow v. Pales-\ntine Liberation Org., No. 16-1071 (Feb. 22, 2018).   \n\n19 \n \nSince 2018, Congress, with the President\u2019s approval, \nhas strongly reinforced that position by enacting the \nATCA and then replacing it with the law at issue here.  \nAnd in statutes like the Taylor Force Act, Pub. L. No. \n115-141, Div. S, Tit. X, 132 Stat. 1143 (22 U.S.C. 2378c-\n1 note), the political Branches have likewise reaffirmed \nthe United States\u2019 strong interest in using all appropri-\nate means to address respondents\u2019 support for terror-\nism.  U.S. Br. 8. \nBy contrast, given the territorial limits on state au-\nthority, a State could not enact an extraterritorial stat-\nute like the ATA.  U.S. Br. 33.  And by virtue of the fed-\neral government\u2019s \u201cbroad authority over foreign af-\nfairs,\u201d Toll v. Moreno, 458 U.S. 1, 10 (1982), no State \ncould engage with foreign actors like respondents in the \nway that the United States has done.  Those critical dif-\nferences necessitate a different due process analysis of \nthis Act of Congress as compared to a state personal-\njurisdiction law.   \nb. Respondents essentially concede (Br. 45-46, 51) \nthat they have a unique status and relationship with the \nUnited States involving a long-running exchange of un-\ndertakings, restrictions, concessions, and other commit-\nments.  But they deny the significance of that context.  \nAt the threshold, respondents claim (Br. 52) that the \ngovernment \u201cwaived\u201d this point, even though it plainly \nmade the argument below.  See, e.g., Fuld Gov\u2019t C.A. \nBr. 24 (emphasizing that \u201c[t]he PA and PLO are sui \ngeneris foreign entities that exercise governmental \npower but have not been recognized as a sovereign gov-\nernment by the Executive Branch, and that have a \nunique relationship with the United States\u201d); Sokolow \nGov\u2019t C.A. Br. 22 (same). \n\n20 \n \nOn the merits, respondents contend (Br. 43-44, 69-\n70) that the Act\u2019s careful tailoring to cover only re-\nspondents and their successors and affiliates, 18 U.S.C. \n2334(e)(5), is not a virtue, but a due process flaw.  That \ncontention is without merit.  \u201cWhile legislatures usually \nact through laws of general applicability, that is by no \nmeans their only legitimate mode of action.\u201d  Plaut v. \nSpendthrift Farm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 239 n.9 (1995).  \nThis Court has regularly \u201cupheld as a valid exercise of \nCongress\u2019 legislative power diverse laws that governed \none or a very small number of specific subjects.\u201d  Bank \nMarkazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 234 (2016); see ibid. \n(collecting cases); see also, e.g., TikTok Inc. v. Garland, \n145 S. Ct. 57 (2025).  Respondents\u2019 position is also im-\npossible to square with their acceptance (Br. 37-38) of \nthe constitutionality of the ATCA, which was also nar-\nrowly scoped. \nAlthough narrow laws may raise constitutional con-\ncerns \u201cif arbitrary or inadequately justified,\u201d Bank \nMarkazi, 578 U.S. at 234 n.27, respondents do not at-\ntempt such a showing with respect to this Act.  Nor \ncould they.  Respondents\u2019 history of relations with and \nactivities in the United States, their frequent litigation \nunder the ATA (the enactment of which was prompted \nby PLO terrorist activities, see U.S. Br. 8), their pres-\nence at the United Nations and prominence in the inter-\nnational arena, and other distinctive factors made it rea-\nsonable for Congress to limit the Act\u2019s scope to respond-\nents.  Other foreign entities involved in terrorism\u2014such \nas Hamas, Hezbollah, and the Islamic State\u2014are not \nvalid comparators in these respects, contra Resp. Br. \n46.  That Congress has chosen different methods to ad-\ndress their threats to U.S. interests, see, e.g., 22 U.S.C. \n9402(b)(5) (requiring an Executive Branch assessment \n\n21 \n \nof Iran\u2019s support for Hezbollah, Hamas, et al.), does not \npose any constitutional issue, much less one fit for judi-\ncial resolution. \nc. The Second Circuit nevertheless engaged in the \nsame kind of second-guessing of the political Branches \nurged by respondents, ignoring that \u201c[t]he political \nbranches, not the Judiciary, have the responsibility and \ninstitutional capacity to weigh foreign-policy concerns.\u201d  \nHernandez, 589 U.S. at 103-104.  The court of appeals \ndeprecated the Act\u2019s payments prong, for instance, by \nnoting that \u201cCongress has a variety of other tools at its \ndisposal for discouraging the payments in question.\u201d  \nPet. App. 27a.  And it backhandedly acknowledged the \nsensitive questions of foreign and national-security pol-\nicy that underlie the Act only after already deeming the \nstatute invalid\u2014having assessed its constitutionality \nunder precedents predominantly involving state courts\u2019 \nassertion of personal jurisdiction over garden-variety \ndomestic entities (or cases not involving personal juris-\ndiction at all, like College Savings Bank).  Id. at 45a-\n46a; see id. at 16a-24a.   \nAs \u201can exercise of congressional authority regarding \nforeign affairs, a domain in which the controlling role of \nthe political branches is both necessary and proper,\u201d the \nAct \u201cwarrants respectful review by courts.\u201d  Bank \nMarkazi, 578 U.S. at 215, 234; accord TikTok, 145 S. Ct. \nat 70 (affording \u201csubstantial respect\u201d to \u201cthe Govern-\nment\u2019s \u2018informed judgment\u2019\u200a\u201d in matters of national se-\ncurity and foreign policy) (citation omitted).  That does \nnot mean \u201cabdication of the judicial role.\u201d  See Human-\nitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. at 34.  But it does mean \nthe Second Circuit erred by treating the Act as equiva-\nlent to a state personal-jurisdiction law and by assign-\ning no discernible weight to the political Branches\u2019 \n\n22 \n \njudgments in their proper constitutional domain.  The \nAct satisfies the Fifth Amendment. \nC. Separation-of-Powers Principles Support Reversal \nRespondents also contend (Br. 68-70), principally re-\nlying on Bank Markazi, supra, that the Act offends the \nseparation of powers by directing courts to find consent \nbased on actions that do not independently establish \npersonal jurisdiction.  As we have noted, however, see \npp. 6-7, supra, constructive consent is a long-recognized \nand independent basis for personal jurisdiction.  Any \nconstructive-consent statute will provide for courts to \ndeem certain conduct, if they find it occurred, as sub-\nmission to the jurisdiction of the courts. \nThe Act comports with the separation of powers for \nmuch the same reason as did the statute the Court up-\nheld in Bank Markazi (which likewise involved civil ter-\nrorism suits against foreign actors):  it creates \u201ca new \nlegal standard\u201d for courts to apply, rather than usurp-\ning the judicial function by simply directing a result un-\nder existing law.  578 U.S. at 230.  Indeed, the law in \nBank Markazi rendered specific assets available to sat-\nisfy judgments in specific proceedings identified by dis-\ntrict-court docket number.  Id. at 215; see 22 U.S.C. 8772.  \nBy contrast, the Act here covers ATA suits against re-\nspondents as a class; sets a prospective legal standard \nthat would or would not be triggered; and provides a \nbasis for exercising jurisdiction with full notice to re-\nspondents of the actions that would trigger it.  18 U.S.C. \n2334(e).  That is a quintessentially legislative provision, \nnot an adjudicative measure falling outside of Con-\ngress\u2019s constitutional remit. \nIt is respondents\u2019 and the court of appeals\u2019 position \nthat raises separation-of-powers concerns.  The Consti-\ntution vests Congress with authority to establish infe-\n\n23 \n \nrior federal courts and to regulate their jurisdiction.  \nSee U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 9; Art. III, \u00a7 1; Lockerty \nv. Phillips, 319 U.S. 182, 187-188 (1943).  Congress\u2019s ex-\nercises of that authority, like its other enactments, are \nentitled to a presumption of constitutionality.  United \nStates v. Morrison, 529 U.S. 598, 607 (2000).  And that \npresumption carries particular weight when the politi-\ncal Branches act, as here, in the realm of foreign affairs, \nwhere their \u201ccontrolling role  * * *  is both necessary \nand proper\u201d under our constitutional structure.  Bank \nMarkazi, 578 U.S. at 234.  In holding the Act unconsti-\ntutional, the court of appeals disregarded those funda-\nmental principles. \n* * * * * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in our \nopening brief, the judgments of the court of appeals \nshould be reversed. \nRespectfully submitted.   \n \n \nSARAH M.

Harvard Law \nSchool provides financial support for activities related to faculty \nmembers\u2019 research and scholarship, which may help defray the \ncosts of preparing this brief. (The Law School is not a signatory \nto this brief, and the views expressed here are solely those of the \namicus curiae.) Otherwise, no person or entity other than the \namicus curiae has made a monetary contribution intended to \nfund the preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n2 \n \nUnited States, or in any Department or Of-\nficer thereof.\u201d \nArticle III, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution \nprovides in relevant part: \n\u201cThe judicial Power shall extend to all Cases, \nin Law and Equity, arising under * * * the \nLaws of the United States, * * * [and] to Con-\ntroversies * * * between a State, or the Citi-\nzens thereof, and foreign States, Citizens or \nSubjects * * * .\u201d \nArticle IV, Section 1, of the Constitution provides: \n\u201cFull Faith and Credit shall be given in each \nState to the public Acts, Records, and judicial \nProceedings of every other State. And the \nCongress may by general Laws prescribe the \nManner in which such Acts, Records and Pro-\nceedings shall be proved, and the Effect \nthereof.\u201d \nThe Fifth Amendment to the Constitution provides \nin relevant part: \n\u201cNo person shall * * * be deprived of life, lib-\nerty, or property, without due process of law \n* * * .\u201d \nSection One of the Fourteenth Amendment to the \nConstitution provides in relevant part: \n\u201c[N]or shall any State deprive any person of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process \nof law * * * .\u201d \n\n3 \n \nSection 2334(a) of Title 18, United States Code, \nprovides: \n\u201c(a) GENERAL VENUE.\u2014 \nAny civil action under section 2333 of this \ntitle against any person may be instituted in \nthe district court of the United States for any \ndistrict where any plaintiff resides or where \nany defendant resides or is served, or has an \nagent. Process in such a civil action may be \nserved in any district where the defendant re-\nsides, is found, or has an agent.\u201d \nOther relevant statutory provisions have been set \nout by the petitioners. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe temptation in this case is to treat the United \nStates as if it were simply one big state. The State of \nNevada, even were it the size of the entire United \nStates, still could not call to answer every defendant \nwho attacked a Nevadan abroad. See Walden v. Fiore, \n571 U.S. 277, 288\u201389 (2014). As this limit is enforced \nunder the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause, and as the Fifth Amendment has a Due Pro-\ncess Clause too, it is tempting to conclude that the \nUnited States labors under precisely the same con-\nstraint, with the only difference being one of size. \nThis temptation is to be resisted, for the United \nStates is not simply one big state. True, neither the \nUnited States nor any state may deprive a person of \nlife, liberty, or property without due process of law. \nBut the United States and a single state differ greatly \n\n4 \n \nwith respect to the external limits on their sovereign \nauthority\u2014that is, with respect to the principles the \nDue Process Clauses enforce and for which those \nClauses have \u201cbecome a refuge.\u201d Mallory v. Norfolk S. \nRy. Co., 143 S. Ct. 2028, 2050 (2023) (Alito, J., concur-\nring in part and concurring in the judgment). State \nlaws are restricted to each state\u2019s sphere of authority, \nserving as \u201crules of decision\u201d only \u201cin cases where they \napply.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1652 (2018). Yet Acts of Congress \ncan be \u201cthe supreme Law of the Land,\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nVI, cl. 2, overriding contrary doctrines and extending \nbeyond our borders to protect Americans abroad. \nThis Court should not bind the United States with \nthe fetters worn by individual states simply because \nthe latter have become so familiar\u2014especially when \nneither the original Constitution nor this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents require it. As Justice Story recognized, Con-\ngress could have \u201ca subject of England, or France, or \nRussia * * * summoned from the other end of the globe \nto obey our process, and submit to the judgment of our \ncourts\u201d; such a statute might violate \u201cprinciples of \npublic law, public convenience, and immutable jus-\ntice,\u201d but a federal court \u201cwould certainly be bound to \nfollow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Picquet v. Swan, \n19 F. Cas. 609, 613\u201315 (CCD Mass 1828) (No. 11,134). \nIf Congress had such powers at the Founding, it never \nlost them since. So long as Congress\u2019s power to call for-\neigners to answer is at least as broad as its power to \nregulate their conduct abroad, the respondents here \nwere obliged to appear in the district court, and the \nplaintiffs\u2019 claims must be allowed to proceed. \n\n5 \n \n1. As an original matter, the Fifth Amendment did \nnot place territorial restrictions on Congress\u2019s powers \nto call defendants to answer. Rules of personal juris-\ndiction predated the Due Process Clause; they were \nrules of general and international law, which states \nmight override within their own courts but which \nwould be enforced by the courts of other states, as well \nas by federal courts in diversity jurisdiction or under \nthe Full Faith and Credit Clause. To the extent the \nissue arose in the early Republic, there was no ques-\ntion but that Congress could supplant these rules with \nrules of its own design, just as it could use other enu-\nmerated powers to supplant other rules of interna-\ntional law. See generally Sachs, The Unlimited Juris-\ndiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703 \n(2020). After the Civil War, the Fourteenth Amend-\nment enabled the better enforcement of jurisdictional \nlimits on state courts via federal-question review: to \ndeprive someone of life, liberty, or property through a \njurisdictionless judgment was to deprive them of these \nthings without due process of law. See Pennoyer v. \nNeff, 95 U.S. 714, 732\u201333 (1878); see generally Sachs, \nPennoyer Was Right, 95 Tex. L. Rev. 1249 (2017). That \nhad no impact on federal courts, however, which al-\nready had to comply with the rules as set out by Con-\ngress and as understood by this Court. \n2. Congress has not lost these powers since. While \nthe era of International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 \nU.S. 310 (1945), identified various \u201cterritorial limita-\ntions on the power of the respective States,\u201d Hanson v. \nDenckla, 357 U.S. 235, 251 (1958), this Court has \nnever reflected those limitations back onto the United \n\n6 \n \nStates as a whole. Instead, different principles of sov-\nereign authority continue to apply via due process to \nthe federal government and to the states. Nor would \nreversing this approach be harmless. Pretending that \nthe United States is simply one big state for personal-\njurisdiction purposes would limit the federal govern-\nment in negotiating treaties and conducting foreign \nrelations. It would also interfere with federal laws on \nantitrust, securities regulation, bankruptcy, and child \ncustody. The Court should not pretermit the political \nbranches\u2019 consideration of these issues by deciding the \ncase on a mistaken due process claim. \n3. To decide the case before it, this Court need not \ndetermine the full scope of Congress\u2019s jurisdictional \npowers. The respondents here were served with pro-\ncess within the United States in a manner explicitly \nauthorized by statute, under clear Article I authority, \nwith subsequent enactments making it as clear as \nCongress knows how that such service is to be held ef-\nfective. The Court may uphold such service while leav-\ning open the outer limits of what the Fifth Amendment \nmight permit, just as it has for the last two hundred \nyears. It also need not take any view of the parties\u2019 \ncomplex arguments about formal and informal con-\nsent to jurisdiction, under either the Fourteenth \nAmendment or the Fifth. But by the same token, the \nCourt should not rule out the possibility that Justice \nStory was correct. As the Second Circuit\u2019s judgment \ncan only be right if Justice Story was wrong, the Court \nshould reverse that judgment and remand. \n\n7 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAs an original matter, the Fifth Amendment \ndid not impose territorial restrictions on \nCongress\u2019s power over federal personal ju-\nrisdiction. \nShowing that the Fifth Amendment did not stop Con-\ngress from extending personal jurisdiction abroad is, \nas the Solicitor General notes, \u201can exercise in proving \na negative,\u201d U.S. Br. 47 (quoting Sachs, Unlimited Ju-\nrisdiction, supra, at 1710\u201311). For a long while Con-\ngress did not try. The Judiciary Act required personal \nservice in the district where the defendant lived or was \nfound for jurisdiction in personam, while in rem juris-\ndiction traditionally required that the property at-\ntached be located or brought within the forum. See ch. \n20, \u00a7 11, 1 Stat. 73, 79 (1789); J. Story, Commentaries \non the Conflict of Laws \u00a7\u00a7 549\u2013550, at 461\u201363 (Boston, \nHilliard, Gray & Co. 1834). So while the facts of \nFounding-era federal cases often addressed events in \ndistant climes, see Pet. Br. 17\u201319, subconstitutional \nlaw typically required the target of the litigation to be \npresent in the United States. \nEven without examples of Congress asserting ju-\nrisdiction abroad, however, the history makes clear \nthat it had power to do so. Courts prove negatives all \nthe time, as they have to; otherwise they might be un-\nable to reject a claimed due process right to buy spray \npaint, see Nat\u2019l Paint & Coatings Ass\u2019n v. City of Chi-\ncago, 45 F.3d 1124, 1129\u201330 (CA7), cert. denied, 515 \nU.S. 1143 (1995), simply because the Founders never \nrestricted its sale. What matters in assessing, say, a \n\n8 \n \ndue process right to chew gum is not whether the \nFounders \u201cdid ban chewing gum * * * , but whether \nthe American legal system thought they could.\u201d Sachs, \nDobbs and the Originalists, 47 Harv. J.L. & Pub. Pol\u2019y \n539, 555 (2024). And in the early Republic, when the \nmost authoritative figures in the American legal sys-\ntem discussed Congress\u2019s power over personal juris-\ndiction, they consistently emphasized what Congress \ncould do\u2014even to the point of calling a defendant \n\u201cfrom the other end of the globe.\u201d Picquet, 19 F. Cas. \nat 613 (Story, J.). \nA. Congress\u2019s broad power over personal jurisdic-\ntion followed ineluctably from the Founders\u2019 under-\nstanding of the field. Personal jurisdiction at the \nFounding was a topic not of constitutional law, but of \ngeneral and international law, enforced by both state \nand federal courts. \nLong before the Due Process Clauses, rules of per-\nsonal jurisdiction were already enforced among the \nstates, derived from law-of-nations principles that de-\nfined each state\u2019s sovereign authority. Under these \nprinciples, if any government sought to exercise \u201ca ju-\nrisdiction which, according to the law of nations, its \nsovereign could not confer,\u201d that government\u2019s own \ncourts might enforce the resulting judgments, but \nother courts would not. See Rose v. Himely, 8 U.S. (4 \nCranch) 241, 276\u201377 (1808) (Marshall, C.J.). State \ncourts thus refused to recognize or enforce judgments \nfrom other states that exceeded jurisdictional limits. \nSee, e.g., Jenkins v. Putnam, 1 S.C.L. (1 Bay) 8, 9\u201310 \n(1784) (per curiam); Kibbe v. Kibbe, 1 Kirby 119, 126 \n(Conn Super Ct 1786); Phelps v. Holker, 1 U.S. (1 \n\n9 \n \nDall.) 261, 264 (Pa. 1788) (opinion of M\u2018Kean, C.J.); \nSachs, Pennoyer Was Right, supra, at 1269\u201373. \nThe same rules applied after Ratification. Early \nstate cases applying the Full Faith and Credit Clause \nassessed other states\u2019 judgments based on the same \npersonal jurisdiction principles that had applied when \nthey had all been \u201cFree and Independent States.\u201d The \nDeclaration of Independence para. 32 (U.S. 1776); see \nBissell v. Briggs, 9 Mass. (9 Tyng) 462, 464\u201368 (1813); \nKilburn v. Woodworth, 5 Johns. 37, 41 (NY 1809) (per \ncuriam) (citing Phelps and Kibbe); see generally Sachs, \nPennoyer Was Right, supra, at 1273\u201378. As this Court \nmade clear in D\u2019Arcy v. Ketchum, state personal juris-\ndiction was subject to the \u201cwell-established rules of in-\nternational law, regulating governments foreign to \neach other.\u201d 52 U.S. (11 How.) 165, 174 (1851). \nWhen state legislatures attempted to expand their \ncourts\u2019 jurisdiction, their efforts were likewise re-\nstricted by international law, for \u201cbeyond its own ter-\nritory\u201d a legislature could \u201conly affect its own subjects \nor citizens.\u201d Rose, 8 U.S. at 279. In Flower v. Parker, \nJustice Story on circuit refused to allow a Massachu-\nsetts personal-jurisdiction statute to bind an absent \ncitizen of Louisiana, as \u201cthe legislature of a state can \nbind no more than the persons and property within its \nterritorial jurisdiction.\u201d 9 F. Cas. 323, 324 (CCD Mass \n1823) (No. 4891). The Court in D\u2019Arcy similarly disre-\ngarded as ultra vires a New York statute asserting ju-\nrisdiction over other states\u2019 citizens by process served \non their local business partners. As the Court ex-\nplained, such a judgment would be void without the \ndefendant\u2019s consent or personal service in New York, \n\n10 \n \nfor under \u201cthe international law as it existed among \nthe States in 1790[,] * * * neither the legislative juris-\ndiction, nor that of courts of justice, had binding force.\u201d \n52 U.S. at 176. \nThe Fifth Amendment played no significant role in \nthese doctrines. Both state and federal courts consist-\nently understood legislative and judicial jurisdiction \nas the product of international principles, not of the \nDue Process Clause or its state-constitutional equiva-\nlents. If a party sought the recognition and enforce-\nment of a state judgment in a federal court (as in \nFlower or D\u2019Arcy), the international-law inquiry would \ncover the waterfront: either the state judgment com-\nplied with the rules, in which case recognizing it posed \nno constitutional problem, or it did not so comply, in \nwhich case recognition would be refused on ordinary \nsubconstitutional grounds. The Fifth Amendment \nsimply never came into it. \nThe same was true of state constitutions. At the \nsame time that Massachusetts refused to enforce a \nNew Hampshire judgment obtained by exorbitant \nmeans (albeit means used in \u201cmany of the States, of \nwhich this is one,\u201d Bartlet v. Knight, 1 Mass. 401, 410 \n(1805) (opinion of Sedgwick, J.)), both states had \u201claw \nof the land\u201d clauses in their constitutions, see Mass. \nConst. of 1780, pt. 1, art. XII; N.H. Const. of 1784, pt. \n1, art. 15, but neither invoked these clauses to restrain \nthe reach of their courts. Likewise, New York\u2019s consti-\ntution at the time of D\u2019Arcy contained an exact replica \nof the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, see \nN.Y. Const. of 1846, art. I, \u00a7 6, but not a single Justice \nbrought it up. Due process was simply not the issue. \n\n11 \n \nB. To the extent that jurisdictional rules were de-\nrived from principles of international law rather than \nof due process, Congress might have been presumed to \nrespect them, but it could also choose to override them. \nSee generally Murray v. The Schooner Charming \nBetsy, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 64, 118 (1804); see also The \nMarianna Flora, 24 U.S. (11 Wheat.) 1, 39\u201340 (1826); \nThe Nereide, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 423 (1815). And \nin the rare cases in which jurists directly discussed the \nissue, they consistently described Congress\u2019s power \nover federal personal jurisdiction in expansive terms. \nIn Mills v. Duryee, for example, Justice Johnson \nworried that a federal statute, if misconstrued, might \nenforce state judgments obtained through jurisdic-\ntionally dubious means. 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 481, 486 \n(1813) (Johnson, J., dissenting). He described as an \n\u201ceternal principle[] of justice\u201d the rule that states may \nnot call to answer \u201cpersons not owing them allegiance \nor * * * found within their limits,\u201d a rule \u201cCourts of \njustice never can dispense with but when compelled by \npositive statute.\u201d Id. (emphasis added). And he made \nclear that \u201c[i]f a different decision were necessary to \ngive effect to [the Full Faith and Credit Clause], and \nthe act of 26th May, 1790, I should not hesitate to yield \nto that necessity.\u201d Id. \nJustice Story took the same approach in Picquet. \nThere Congress had incorporated certain state proce-\ndures by reference\u2014including, according to the plain-\ntiff, state laws playing jurisdictional tricks that inter-\nnational law would otherwise forbid, such as basing in \npersonam jurisdiction on an attachment of minor \nproperty. See 19 F. Cas. at 609\u201310, 614. Justice Story \n\n12 \n \nacknowledged that these state laws, though in tension \nwith \u201cthe law of nations,\u201d id. at 611, might be valid \nwithin the state\u2019s own tribunals: \u201cit is not for us to say, \nthat such legislation may not be rightful, and bind the \nstate courts.\u201d Id. at 614. But even as he denounced the \nnotion that \u201can alien, who has never been within the \nUnited States,\u201d might \u201cbe bound thereby to appear,\u201d \nJustice Story made one thing clear: \u201cIf congress had \nprescribed such a rule, the court would certainly be \nbound to follow it, and proceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at \n615 (emphasis added). \nDespite the breadth of the plaintiff\u2019s theory, that \u201ca \nsubject of England, or France, or Russia, having a con-\ntroversy with one of our citizens, may be summoned \nfrom the other end of the globe to obey our process, and \nsubmit to the judgment of our courts,\u201d id. at 613\u2014and \ndespite finding it inconsistent with \u201cpublic law, public \nconvenience, and immutable justice,\u201d id. at 614\u2014Jus-\ntice Story did not suggest that it was in any tension \nwith the Fifth Amendment, though \u201cnow was the time \nto say so.\u201d Sachs, Unlimited Jurisdiction, supra, at \n1716. Rather, he argued only that \u201c[s]uch an intention \n* * * ought not to be presumed\u201d by federal courts with-\nout \u201cirresistible proof\u201d that \u201ccongress have, in an un-\nambiguous manner, made it imperative upon them,\u201d \nid. at 613\u201314. The sole question, as Justice Story saw \nit, was \u201cwhether such a rule ought to be inferred from \nso general a legislation as congress has adopted\u201d\u2014for \nif so, he would \u201cproceed upon the law.\u201d Id. at 615; see \nSachs, Unlimited Jurisdiction, supra, at 1714\u201316. \nThis Court soon endorsed Justice Story\u2019s reasoning \n\u201cas having great force.\u201d Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 \n\n13 \n \nPet.) 300, 328 (1838). Here a plaintiff again tried to \nincorporate state jurisdictional shenanigans by refer-\nence, id. at 327; again the Court concluded that the \nfederal statute forbade that, id. at 328; and again it \nreasoned that Congress might have, but under the cir-\ncumstances had not, \u201cacted under the idea that the \nprocess of the circuit courts could reach persons in a \nforeign jurisdiction,\u201d id. at 330. Indeed, three Justices \ndissented on this very point, invoking the support of a \nnumber of circuit courts which read the statute to en-\nable jurisdiction over a defendant \u201cnot an inhabitant \nof the United States.\u201d See id. at 336\u201337 (Taney, C.J., \ndissenting); id. at 337 (Baldwin, J., dissenting) (stat-\ning that he \u201cwould go further as to the authority of the \ncourts of the United States\u201d); id. at 337\u201338 (Wayne, J., \ndissenting); cf. id. at 338 (opinion of Catron, J.) (ex-\npressing uncertainty on the point). \nAs an international matter, of course, as Justice \nStory had written in Flower, \u201c[n]o legislature can com-\npel any persons, beyond its own territory, to become \nparties to any suits instituted in its domestic tribu-\nnals.\u201d 9 F. Cas. at 324\u201325. But \u201c[i]f congress had pre-\nscribed such a rule,\u201d Picquet, 19 F. Cas. at 615, it could \noverride any international law to the contrary. A fed-\neral jurisdictional statute would be binding in both \nfederal and state courts, for Acts of Congress were the \n\u201csupreme Law of the Land,\u201d with \u201cthe Judges in every \nState * * * bound thereby.\u201d U.S. Const. art. VI, cl 2. \nAdditionally, Congress had enumerated power to \n\u201cmake all Laws which shall be necessary and proper \nfor carrying into Execution\u201d not only its own legisla-\ntive powers, but also \u201call other Powers vested by this \n\n14 \n \nConstitution in the Government of the United States, \nor in any Department or Officer thereof.\u201d Id. art. I, \u00a7 8, \ncl. 18. That included carrying into execution the Arti-\ncle III heads of jurisdiction, which were among of the \n\u201cPowers vested\u201d in the judicial department. And one \nway to carry into execution the power to hear contro-\nversies between citizens and aliens might be for \u201ca \nsubject of England, or France, or Russia, having a con-\ntroversy with one of our citizens, [to] be summoned \nfrom the other end of the globe to obey our process, and \nsubmit to the judgment of our courts.\u201d Picquet, 19 \nF. Cas. at 613. As Justice Story later put it, \u201cin all \ncases, where the judicial power of the United States is \nto be exercised, it is for congress alone to furnish the \nrules of proceeding, to direct the process, [and] to de-\nclare [its] nature and effect.\u201d 3 Joseph Story, Commen-\ntaries on the Constitution of the United States \u00a7 1752, \nat 625\u201326 (Boston, Hilliard, Gray & Co. 1833) (empha-\nsis added). \nC. The Fourteenth Amendment did nothing to di-\nminish Congress\u2019s power over personal jurisdiction. \nRather than altering the jurisdictional rules or reas-\nsigning the authority to change them, the Amendment \nprovided a new means for federal courts to enforce the \npreexisting limits on state sovereign authority. \nWhen the Fourteenth Amendment was written, \nthere would have been no reason to assume that the \nphrase \u201cdue process of law\u201d imposed any new rules of \npersonal jurisdiction. Only a few state courts had held \njurisdictional rules to have any state-constitutional \nforce; only one had phrased this holding in terms of \ndue process, see Beard v. Beard, 21 Ind. 321, 324 \n\n15 \n \n(1863), while the majority had adhered to the tradi-\ntional approach described above. See Sachs, Unlimited \nJurisdiction, supra, at 1723 & nn.123\u2013125. \nBut while personal jurisdiction had never been a \nsubfield of due process, there was still an important \nconnection between them. A judgment without juris-\ndiction was a \u201cnullity,\u201d Kempe\u2019s Lessee v. Kennedy, 9 \nU.S. (5 Cranch) 173, 184 (1809) (Marshall, C.J.) (sum-\nmarizing argument of counsel), or a piece of \u201cwaste pa-\nper,\u201d Voorhees v. Jackson, 35 U.S. (10 Pet.) 449, 475 \n(1836); and a deprivation of life, liberty, or property \nbuilt on no better foundation than a piece of \u201cwaste \npaper\u201d was a deprivation without due process of law. \nIf a state court lacked personal jurisdiction over the \ndefendant, then executing its judgment against him \nwould violate the new Amendment\u2019s guarantee. \nSo while the Fourteenth Amendment did not alter \nthe rules of personal jurisdiction, it did create a new \nroute to appellate review of a state\u2019s compliance with \nthose rules. Prior to the Amendment, an exorbitant \nstate-court judgment could not be appealed to this \nCourt, as violations of general or international law did \nnot raise any federal question. N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. \nHendren, 92 U.S. 286, 286\u201387 (1876). As Pennoyer put \nit, \u201cthere was no mode of directly reviewing such judg-\nment or impeaching its validity within the State \nwhere rendered; and * * * it could be called in question \nonly when its enforcement was elsewhere attempted.\u201d \n95 U.S. at 732. But with the Amendment in place, such \njudgments could be \u201cdirectly questioned, and their en-\nforcement in the State resisted, on the ground that \n\n16 \n \nproceedings in a court of justice to determine the per-\nsonal rights and obligations of parties over whom that \ncourt has no jurisdiction do not constitute due process \nof law.\u201d Id. at 733 (emphasis added). In other words, \nthe Fourteenth Amendment made every state per-\nsonal-jurisdiction ruling a ground for immediate fed-\neral-question review, measuring the state\u2019s action \nagainst the limits of its sovereign authority just as be-\nfore. See Belcher v. Chambers, 53 Cal. 635, 643 (1879); \nElasser v. Haines, 18 A. 1095, 1097 (NJ 1889); Sachs, \nPennoyer Was Right, supra, at 1287\u20131313. \nAs this Court has explained in the context of juris-\ndiction to tax, the phrase \u201cdue process\u201d in the Four-\nteenth Amendment does not encode some secret list of \njurisdictional rules, to be applied to the states and the \nfederal government both. Rather, it simply \u201crequires \nthat the limits of jurisdiction,\u201d whatever they are, \nshall not be transgressed. That requirement \nleaves the limits of jurisdiction to be ascer-\ntained in each case with appropriate regard \nto the distinct spheres of activity of state and \nnation. The limits of state power are defined \nin view of the relation of the states to each \nother in the Federal Union. The bond of the \nConstitution qualifies their jurisdiction. \nBrunet v. Brooks, 288 U.S. 378, 401 (1933). \nThe Fourteenth Amendment thus did nothing to \ndiminish Congress\u2019s power over the personal jurisdic-\ntion of the federal courts. The Amendment acts as a \nrestraint on the states, not on the federal government. \nAnd it imposes no particular design on the sovereign \n\n17 \n \nauthority of either the states or the federal govern-\nment, but merely enforces the limits on the states\u2019 sov-\nereign authority, taking those limits as it finds them. \nSo the Fifth Amendment likewise plays no signifi-\ncant role in federal jurisdictional doctrine. If a federal \ncourt renders a judgment under a personal-jurisdic-\ntion statute within Congress\u2019s enumerated powers, \nthen it is acting within the scope of the sovereign au-\nthority conferred on the United States, and there is no \nFifth Amendment personal-jurisdiction problem to be \nfound. And if a federal court renders a judgment that \ngoes beyond its statutory authority, or if it acts under \na personal-jurisdiction statute that Congress lacked \nenumerated power to pass, then the judgment would \nbe reversed on statutory or substantive constitutional \ngrounds, and again there is no role for Fifth Amend-\nment personal-jurisdiction doctrines to play. To the \nextent that Congress can act within the scope of its \nsovereign authority to expand the jurisdiction of the \nfederal courts, neither the Fifth Amendment nor the \nFourteenth would interfere. \nII. Congress has not lost its power to call for-\neign defendants to answer. \nNothing that has happened since the adoption of the \nFourteenth Amendment has deprived Congress of its \nFounding-era power to direct judicial process abroad \nor to call foreign defendants to answer. In particular, \nthis power has not been constrained by the develop-\nments in Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence un-\nder International Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. \n\n18 \n \n310 (1945), and its progeny. Such cases explicitly ex-\ncepted the federal government from their scope, and \nthis Court\u2019s due process precedents continue to treat \nthe federal government differently from the states. By \ncontrast, reversing that approach today and treating \nthe United States simply as one big state would \nstarkly alter the powers of the political branches, dis-\nrupting multiple statutory regimes. \nA. In its post-International Shoe cases, this Court \nrepeatedly left open the question of Fifth Amendment \nlimits on the federal government\u2014most recently in \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior Court, 582 U.S. \n255, 269 (2017). That was entirely appropriate, be-\ncause the reasoning of International Shoe and its prog-\neny applies differently to the federal courts than to \nthose of the states. \nThe International Shoe Court reframed the preex-\nisting due process inquiry to require that an in perso-\nnam defendant who was \u201cnot present within the terri-\ntory of the forum\u201d must \u201chave certain minimum con-\ntacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does \nnot offend traditional notions of fair play and substan-\ntial justice.\u201d 326 U.S. at 316 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Yet what counts as fair play, according to \nthose traditional notions, itself depends on the scope \nof a state\u2019s sovereign authority. That is why Interna-\ntional Shoe required \u201csuch contacts * * * with the state \nof the forum as make it reasonable, in the context of our \nfederal system of government, to require the [defend-\nant] to defend the particular suit which is brought \nthere.\u201d 326 U.S. at 317 (emphasis added); cf. J. McIn-\ntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 880 (2011) \n\n19 \n \n(opinion of Kennedy, J.) (describing how a defendant \nmight \u201cfall within the State's authority\u201d). \nWhat is reasonable, in the context of our federal \nsystem of government, may be very different for an in-\ndividual state of that system than for the federal gov-\nernment itself. This distinction is recognized through-\nout the Court\u2019s due process jurisprudence. For exam-\nple, this Court has more than once held that states \nlack power to apply certain prohibitions or penalties \nto lawful conduct outside their borders, a disability the \nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause will en-\nforce. See, e.g., State Farm Mut. Auto Ins. Co. v. Camp-\nbell, 538 U.S. 408, 421 (2003); BMW of N. Am., Inc. v. \nGore, 517 U.S. 559, 572 (1996); N.Y. Life Ins. Co. v. \nHead, 234 U.S. 149, 161 (1914); Huntington v. Attrill, \n146 U.S. 657, 669 (1892). No matter how broad a \npower Nevada\u2019s constitution might confer, for exam-\nple, its legislature still cannot decide the speed limits \nin New Jersey\u2014not because anything in the Constitu-\ntion says so, but because \u201c[t]he general rules of inter-\nnational comity\u201d continue to govern the several states. \nAttrill, 146 U.S. at 669. \nThe treatment of the federal government is very \ndifferent. The United States can and does prohibit con-\nduct outside its borders, so long as it falls within some \nenumerated power in the Constitution. See, e.g., \nEEOC v. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 \n(1991); Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U.S. 571, 578 (1953). \nIn exercising those powers, moreover, the United \nStates is not always bound to remain within the limits \nof international law. It might be presumed that Con-\ngress adheres to those limits, see Charming Betsy, 6 \n\n20 \n \nU.S. at 118; but when Congress is explicit, and when \nit acts within its constitutional powers, those instruc-\ntions must be adhered to. See McCulloch v. Sociedad \nNacional de Marineros de Honduras, 372 U.S. 10, 21\u2013\n22 (1963). To the extent that courts of appeals have \nconsidered due process challenges to extraterritorial \nfederal statutes, they have regarded the scope of fed-\neral regulatory authority as far broader than that of \nany individual state. See, e.g., United States v. Yousef, \n327 F.3d 56, 86, 109 (CA2 2003); United States v. \nYunis, 924 F.2d 1086, 1091 (CADC 1991). \nIndeed, both the courts of appeals and the respond-\nents in this case seem to recognize the necessity of dis-\ntinguishing the scope of federal authority from that of \nthe states. Consider whether the district court would \nhave had jurisdiction in this case if the terrorists \nwhom these defendants rewarded had been targeting \nAmericans in particular\u2014even had they acted out of \nsimple anti-American animus, with no aspiration to \ninfluence our government\u2019s deliberations or foreign \npolicy. If such attacks aimed at Americans abroad \nwould be treated differently\u2014as both respondents and \nthe courts of appeals seem to envision2\u2014then the fed-\neral courts are being treated differently as well, for \nsuch jurisdiction is unavailable to the states. \n \n2 See Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, 594 (CADC 2023) (accepting, \nbut finding insufficiently pled, a theory that defendants had \u201cspe-\ncifically targeted the United States\u201d by \u201csingl[ing] out\u201d victims \n\u201cbecause they are Americans\u201d (internal quotation marks omit-\nted)); Waldman v. Palestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317, 338 \n(CA2 2016) (distinguishing these facts from \u201cterrorist attacks \n \n\n21 \n \nFor example: had Anthony Walden acted out of \nsimple anti-Nevada animus in detaining the cash of \nNevada resident Gina Fiore (perhaps because he con-\nsidered Las Vegas tawdry), still \u201cno part of [his] course \nof conduct\u201d would have \u201coccurred in Nevada\u201d; he would \nstill never have \u201ctraveled to, conducted activities \nwithin, contacted anyone in, or sent anything or any-\none to Nevada\u201d; and \u201cdirect[ing] his conduct at plain-\ntiffs whom he knew had Nevada connections\u201d would \nstill \u201cnot create sufficient contacts\" with the State of \nNevada, as opposed to residents thereof. Walden, 571 \nU.S. at 288\u201389. Indeed, Walden specifically rejected as \ntoo expansive a test permitting state-court jurisdiction \nwhen a defendant \u201c(1) intentionally targets (2) a \nknown resident of the forum (3) for imposition of an \ninjury (4) to be suffered by the plaintiff while she is \nresiding in the forum state\u201d\u2014let alone while she trav-\nels abroad. Id. at 289 n.8; cf. id. at 288 (distinguishing \nCalder v. Jones, 465 U.S. 783 (1984), on the ground \nthat there the \u201cdefendants\u2019 intentional tort actually \noccurred in California\u201d); id. at 290 n.9 (emphasizing \nthe physical, as opposed to virtual, contacts \u201cwhere the \nconduct giving rise to this litigation took place\u201d). \nIn other words, if the United States were really to \nbe treated as one big state, to be subjected to the In-\n \n* * * specifically targeted against United States citizens\u201d); cf. Br. \nin Opp. 25 (insisting that \u201cthe attacks at issue were random at-\ntacks, not aimed at Americans\u201d); Corrected Brief & Special Ap-\npendix for Defendants-Appellants in No. 15-3151 (CA2), at 46 (ar-\nguing that the record lacked evidence that \u201cthe attacks at issue \ntargeted the United States\u201d). \n\n22 \n \nternational Shoe test unmodified, someone who mur-\nders Americans abroad specifically because they are \nAmericans (and with no other desire to influence poli-\ncies in America) is immune from the jurisdiction of \nAmerican courts. The instinctive reaction to this posi-\ntion by both respondents and the court of appeals is \ngood evidence that it is untenable. Individual states \nmay have only limited powers to punish conduct out-\nside their borders that is lawful where it occurs; but a \ngovernment authorized to regulate foreign commerce, \nas well as to \u201cdefine and punish * * * Offences against \nthe Law of Nations,\u201d U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 10, also \nhas the \u201cincidental or implied powers\u201d to call those \nwho violate those regulations and commit those of-\nfenses before its courts. M\u2018Culloch v. Maryland, 17 \nU.S. (4 Wheat.) 316, 406 (1819).  \nB. Ignoring the difference in sovereign authority \nbetween the United States and each individual state \nwould unduly limit the powers of the political \nbranches. \n1. Consider the treaty power. If the United States \nwere to ratify the Lugano Convention, it would be com-\nmitting to have tort suits heard \u201cin the courts for the \nplace where the harmful event occurred\u201d\u2014something \ncurrently forbidden when the defendant lacks contacts \nthere. Compare Convention on Jurisdiction and the \nRecognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil \nand Commercial Matters (Lugano Convention), art. \n5(3), 2007 O.J. (L 339) 5, with McIntyre, 564 U.S. 873. \nOr if the United States were to ratify the Hague \nJudgments Convention, which it has already signed, \n\n23 \n \nsee HCCH, Status Table, Convention of 2 July 2019 on \nthe Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Judg-\nments in Civil or Commercial Matters (updated Sept. \n19, 2024), https://www.hcch.net/en/instruments/con-\nventions/status-table/?cid=137, it would be obliged to \nenforce certain foreign judgments \u201cunless the activi-\nties of the defendant in relation to the transaction \nclearly did not constitute a purposeful and substantial \nconnection to that State.\u201d Convention on the Recogni-\ntion and Enforcement of Foreign Judgments in Civil \nor Commercial Matters art. 5.1(g), July 2, 2019, \nU.N.T.S. No. 58036 (emphasis added). But if a trans-\naction actually (albeit unclearly) failed to make the \nnecessary connection to the forum state, the treaty\u2019s \nobligations and those of International Shoe might con-\nflict. Holding the United States bound by the Interna-\ntional Shoe standard could render it unable to negoti-\nate, ratify, or comply with such treaties, undermining \nits efforts to secure reciprocal recognition for Ameri-\ncan judgments abroad. But if, instead, Fifth Amend-\nment due process simply takes the rules for federal ju-\nrisdiction as it finds them, then the political branches \nretain the power to adjust those rules by treaty. \n2. Imposing one-big-state restrictions on federal ju-\nrisdictional powers would hamper our foreign rela-\ntions in other ways as well. In particular cases, for ex-\nample, Congress might have very good reasons to im-\nplement an otherwise objectionable jurisdictional re-\ngime. Following the examples of Austria, Belgium, It-\naly, and Portugal, Congress might choose to employ \n\u201cretaliatory\u201d personal jurisdiction, subjecting foreign-\n\n24 \n \ners to our courts whenever Americans in similar cir-\ncumstances would be subjected to theirs. See Born, Re-\nflections on Judicial Jurisdiction in International \nCases, 17 Ga. J. Int\u2019l & Compar. L. 1, 15 (1987). This \napproach might involve the exercise of truly exorbi-\ntant jurisdiction, but only when foreign countries were \ndoing the same (and in an effort to get them to stop). \nBut if Congress is bound by a Fifth-Amendment copy \nof International Shoe, then this tool for pursuing for-\neign relations and protecting Americans from aggres-\nsive courts would be lost. The Court should therefore \nleave any worries about potential foreign retaliation \nto the judgment of Congress, contra U.S. Br. 47\u201348, \nrather than preemptively (and blindly) disable the po-\nlitical branches\u2019 future conduct of foreign relations. \n3. A number of existing federal statutes also as-\nsume that the federal government has broader per-\nsonal-jurisdiction powers than it would have as one \nbig state under International Shoe. Federal antitrust \nlaw, for example, applies to certain foreign commercial \nactivities with \u201ca direct, substantial, and reasonably \nforeseeable effect\u201d on American imports, 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 6a(1), (1)(A) (2018)\u2014even though \u201c\u2018foreseeability\u2019 \nalone has never been a sufficient benchmark for per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d in state courts under the Four-\nteenth Amendment. World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. \nWoodson, 444 U.S. 286, 295 (1980). Yet Congress has \nprovided that process in such a suit may be served on \na foreign defendant \u201cwherever it may be found\u201d (that \nis, worldwide), and that venue may be laid \u201cin any dis-\ntrict wherein it may be found or transacts business,\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 22 (2018), whether or not those business \n\n25 \n \nactivities relate to the suit under the standard mini-\nmum-contacts test. \nSimilar language, both as to service and foreseea-\nbility, is found in the Securities Exchange Act. See 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 78aa(a)\u2013(b) (2018). And federal bankruptcy \nlaw enables the bankruptcy court to take jurisdiction \nof the debtor\u2019s property \u201cwherever located\u201d throughout \nthe world, 11 U.S.C. \u00a7 541(a) (2018), with worldwide \nservice of process and broad personal jurisdiction, see \nFed. R. Bankr. P. 7004(a)(1) (incorporating Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 4(f), (h)); id. 7004(f)\u2014though appellate courts \nin the thrall of International Shoe have restricted the \nbankruptcy courts\u2019 ability to protect that property \nfrom foreign interference, see, e.g., In re Sheehan, 48 \nF.4th 513, 520\u201322 (CA7 2022). Treating the Fifth \nAmendment as imposing state-level constraints on the \nUnited States would interfere with each of these stat-\nutory regimes. \nAdopting the respondents\u2019 theories would also pose \ndifficulties to Congress in regulating child custody \ncases within the United States. The Parental Kidnap-\ning Prevention Act uses Congress\u2019s full-faith-and-\ncredit power to \u201cprescribe * * * the Effect\u201d of state \u201cju-\ndicial Proceedings,\u201d assigning exclusive jurisdiction in \nchild custody cases to the courts of a single state. 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1738A (2018); U.S. Const. art. IV, \u00a7 1. But the \nstate that Congress chose in its statute might not al-\nways be the same state that this Court\u2019s state-court \ndue process jurisprudence would otherwise choose. \nSee Br. of Professor Stephen E. Sachs as Amicus Cu-\nriae in No. 16-405, at 20. If the International Shoe test \nis written directly into the Fifth and Fourteenth \n\n26 \n \nAmendments\u2019 Due Process Clauses, as if in invisible \nink, see Br. in Opp. 2 (arguing that Congress lacks \n\u201cpower to authorize violations of the Due Process \nClause\u201d (quoting Quill Corp. v. North Dakota, 504 U.S. \n298, 305 (1992))), then Congress cannot override the \nFourteenth Amendment to consolidate child-custody \nlitigation in a single forum. But if the International \nShoe standard derives instead from more general prin-\nciples defining the \u201cterritorial limitations on the power \nof the respective States,\u201d Hanson, 357 U.S. at 251, \nthen Congress might have the power to adjust those \nlimitations in particular cases (such as under the Full \nFaith and Credit Clause), and its statute would be en-\ntirely valid. \nIn other words, accepting respondents\u2019 theories \nwould drag this Court into deeper waters than re-\nspondents may realize. There is no reason to bring \nthese various federal powers into doubt. \nIII. The Court may uphold personal jurisdiction \nhere without determining the full scope of \nCongress\u2019s powers. \nFor the last two centuries this Court has left open the \nquestion of exactly how far Congress may extend the \nfederal courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction abroad. It should \ncontinue to do so. Because this case may be decided \ncorrectly without exploring the outer limits of the \nFifth Amendment, the Court should merely hold that \nthe service here was authorized by statute and was \nconstitutionally sufficient for the district court\u2019s per-\nsonal jurisdiction. \n\n27 \n \nA. Section 2334(a) of Title 18 is a nationwide-ser-\nvice provision, enabling jurisdiction-creating \u201c[p]ro-\ncess in such a civil action\u201d to \u201cbe served in any district \nwhere the defendant * * * is found.\u201d This language is \ncommon to many statutory regimes, see, e.g., 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 15(a) (antitrust laws); id. \u00a7 78aa(a) (securities \nregulation); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1965(a) (RICO), and it has \nbeen construed to apply to any place where the defend-\nant is \u201cpresent in the district by its officers and agents \ncarrying on the business of the corporation.\u201d People\u2019s \nTobacco Co. v. Am. Tobacco Co., 246 U.S. 79, 84 (1918). \nThus, in Fuld, service was made at the defendants\u2019 of-\nfice on the Upper East Side; in Sokolow, service was \nmade personally to their chief representative in the \nUnited States at his home. See Fuld, D. Ct. Docs. 8, 9; \nSokolow, D. Ct. Doc. 2; Pet. App. 239a; Pet. Br. 22. In \nboth cases, the defendants were present in such dis-\ntricts by officers or agents carrying on their business \nthere. They were not \u201conly casually\u201d present, St. Clair \nv. Cox, 106 U.S. 350, 357 (1882), nor do they here con-\ntest the sufficiency of this service under Civil Rule 4. \nIn other words, as far as this Court is concerned, \ndefendants were served with process within the terri-\ntory of the United States, where they were conducting \nofficial business, and under a federal law making such \nservice effective. Just as the Fourteenth Amendment \nrecognizes in-state service as a permissible ground for \njurisdiction over the individuals served, see Burnham \nv. Super. Ct., 495 U.S. 604 (1990), the Fifth Amend-\nment does not forbid in-United-States service, as ex-\nplicitly permitted by a federal statute, as a basis for \n\n28 \n \njurisdiction over the entities these individuals repre-\nsent. The two subsequent statutes that Congress en-\nacted to fend off contrary court decisions are icing on \nthe cake, making it as clear as humanly possible that \nthe statutory prerequisites to federal personal juris-\ndiction have been satisfied. \nThe initial federal statute providing for such ser-\nvice is squarely within Congress\u2019s enumerated pow-\ners, moreover, and also within any \u201cterritorial limita-\ntions on the power of\u201d the United States that the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause might enforce. Han-\nson, 357 U.S. at 251. Again, jurisdiction over foreign \nterrorists who injure Americans\u2014as well as over their \npatrons\u2014is a necessary and proper means of execut-\ning Congress\u2019s powers to regulate foreign commerce \nand to define and punish offenses against the law of \nnations. Congress\u2019s intraterritorial power over foreign \ncommerce likewise enables it to declare that when for-\neign entities like the defendants are \u201cfound\u201d in the \nUnited States, having established offices or sent rep-\nresentatives here, those representatives and the em-\nployees in those offices are legally capable of receiving \nprocess on behalf of the organization. \nB. This Court can say as much while reserving the \nquestion whether extraterritorial exercises of jurisdic-\ntion are always within the territorial limitations on \nCongress\u2019s power, even when Congress might lack au-\nthority to supply the rule of decision. For example, \nwhile Congress might lack enumerated power to re-\nwrite French traffic laws, the Article III courts have \njudicial power to hear a diversity suit by an American \nagainst a Frenchman over an ordinary car accident on \n\n29 \n \nthe streets of Paris. Whether sending a summons to \nFrance and calling the Frenchman to appear in a fed-\neral court is necessary and proper to carrying that \ngrant of jurisdiction into execution (or, indeed, within \nthe territorial limitations on the power of the United \nStates) is a question for another day\u2014and one the \nCourt should explicitly reserve. \nThe Court can also avoid addressing any other \nsorts of limits the Fifth Amendment might impose. For \nexample, even a Congress that summons defendants \nfrom the other end of the globe might still have to af-\nford them adequate notice, see Mullane v. Cent. Han-\nover Bank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 314 (1950), and \nperhaps could not deprive them of their day in court \nby siting the litigation in a deliberately inconvenient \nplace (say, Adak, the furthest settlement of the Aleu-\ntian islands, see Bd. of Trs., Sheet Metal Workers\u2019 Nat\u2019l \nPension Fund v. Elite Erectors, Inc., 212 F.3d 1031, \n1036 (CA7 2000)). But there is no question that the \nrespondents here received adequate notice under Mul-\nlane, and the Manhattan courthouses of the Southern \nDistrict of New York are only a convenient subway \nride away from their permanent office on East 65th \nStreet. Whatever the outer limits of Fifth Amendment \ndue process might be, they are not implicated here. \nNor need the Court reach any fraught issues of im-\nplied consent. Because Congress framed its more re-\ncent enactments in such terms, the parties have de-\nbated at length whether the United States (or, indeed, \nan individual state) may declare that a defendant\u2019s en-\ngaging in certain activities within its borders, or re-\n\n30 \n \nwarding attacks on its residents abroad, will consti-\ntute consent to its personal jurisdiction. See Pet. Br. \n33\u201346; U.S. Br. 22\u201330; Br. in Opp. 8\u201321. Such declara-\ntions raise the question whether any constitutional \ndifference exists between a defendant\u2019s formal and in-\nformal consent, if both are equally knowing and volun-\ntary. As there are a \u201cvariety\u201d of means of obtaining a \ndefendant\u2019s consent, Mallory, 143 S. Ct. at 2044 (opin-\nion of Gorsuch, J.); see Ins. Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie \ndes Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703 (1982); com-\npare Hess v. Pawloski, 274 U.S. 352, 356\u201357 (1927), \nwith Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 216 (1977), and \nDaimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 135 n.13, 138 \nn.18 (2014), some of which are more permissible than \nothers for the states to employ, see Sachs, Dormant \nCommerce and Corporate Jurisdiction, 2023 Sup. Ct. \nRev. 213, exploring these questions may open up more \ncomplex issues better left for other cases. \nInstead, the simpler path is to recognize that the \nDue Process Clauses indirectly enforce more general \nlimitations on sovereign authority, that the spheres of \nsovereign authority of the United States and of the \nseveral states are not the same, and that the Fifth \nAmendment entails different limits on Congress and \nthe federal courts than the Fourteenth Amendment \nimposes on state legislatures and courts. As this case \nfalls squarely within the extraterritorial powers of \nCongress to regulate, and thus within the \u201cterritorial \nlimitations on [its] power,\u201d Hanson, 357 U.S. at 251, it \nalso falls within its incidental and extraterritorial \npowers to call defendants to answer for violating those \nvery regulations. The Court need say no more. \n\n31 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the United States Court of Ap-\npeals for the Second Circuit should be reversed and \nthe case remanded.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSTEPHEN E.

The Court docketed \nPetitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari on July 9, 2024, and responses to the \npetition by Defendants and the United States are currently due on August 8.  The \nrequested extension would move Defendants\u2019 response date to September 9.  \n \nThe United States intervened in the district court to support Petitioners\u2019 position, \nand Defendants have asked government counsel whether the United States intends \nto support or oppose certiorari in this case.  As of July 12, the Solicitor General had \nnot yet determined how to proceed.  Defendants thus request a 30-day extension so \nthey can respond to arguments, if any, by the United States in support of certiorari, \nwhich will be filed on August 8.  This extension is also necessary to enable Defendants \nto evaluate and respond to the new arguments presented by Petitioners in their \npetition, as well as to any amicus brief filed in support of the petition.   \n \n\nSquire Patton Boggs (US) LLP \nVIA ELECTRONIC FILING \n \nScott S.

Palestine Liberation Organization (No. 24-20)  \n    United States v. Palestine Liberation Organization (No. 24-151) \nMotion to extend time to respond to the petitions\n \nDear Mr. Harris: \nWe represent respondents the Palestinian Authority and Palestine Liberation \nOrganization (\u201cDefendants\u201d) and write to request an extension of time to oppose the \npetitions for certiorari in the above-captioned cases.  Defendants\u2019 opposition to \nPetitioners\u2019 petition for a writ of certiorari in Case No. 24-20 is currently due on \nSeptember 9, after one 30-day extension.  Since the Court granted that extension, \nfour amicus briefs in support of certiorari were filed on August 8 in that case.  \nDefendants\u2019 response to the Government\u2019s petition for a writ of certiorari in Case No. \n24-151 is currently due on September 11.  Given that the cases involve the same two \nunderlying decisions, and this Court\u2019s practice is to consider petitions from the same \ndecisions together, Defendants respectfully request an extension in both cases such \nthat their oppositions will both be due on October 18, 2024. \n \nAn extension is necessary in both cases so Defendants can coordinate their \noppositions to the arguments of Petitioners, Petitioners\u2019 amici, and the Government. \nGiven that four parties filed briefs supporting the petition in Case No. 24-20, \nadditional amicus parties may also file briefs in support of the Government\u2019s petition \nin Case No. 24-151.  Petitioners\u2019 recent response to the Government\u2019s petition states \nthat the petitions \u201cpresent significantly different arguments,\u201d and asks this Court to \n\nSquire Patton Boggs (US) LLP \nVIA ELECTRONIC FILING \n \nScott S. Harris \nClerk of the Court \nSupreme Court of the United States \nAugust 27, 2024 \n \n2 \nde-consolidate the cases and \u201cset them for argument in tandem.\u201d  Defendants will \nneed to respond to these arguments as well, which they may do in separate briefs in \nopposition.  Having the same date for their opposition in both cases will not delay \nproceedings, in any case, as the cases will be set for the same conference. \n \nThis extension is also necessary to enable Defendants to evaluate and, following \nconsultation with their foreign clients, respond to the extensive briefing, including \nnew arguments presented by Petitioners, the Government, and Petitioners\u2019 amici, as \nwell as to any amicus briefs that may be filed in support of the Government\u2019s petition.  \nAs such, Defendants request that their oppositions in both Case No. 24-20 and Case \nNo. 24-151 be due on October 18, 2024. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nSquire Patton Boggs (US) LLP \n \nGassan A.

They in-\nclude Agudath Israel of America, the American Associ-\nation of Jewish Lawyers and Jurists, the American \nJewish Committee, the Anti-Defamation League, \nChristians United for Israel, the Coalition for Jewish \nValues, the Endowment for Middle East Truth, the In-\nternational Legal Forum, the Louis D. Brandeis Cen-\nter for Human Rights Under Law, the National Jew-\nish Advocacy Center, the Orthodox Jewish Chamber \nof \nCommerce, \nOne \nIsrael \nFund, \nthe \nRieders \nFoundation, the StandWithUs Saidoff Legal Depart-\nment, StopAntisemitism, the Union of Orthodox Jew-\nish Congregations of America, and the Zionist Organi-\nzation of America.2  \nDespite the efforts of amici, antisemitism endures. \nFor centuries, hatred toward Jews has manifested not \nonly in pernicious rhetoric and ideology but also in vi-\nolence, murder, and terrorism. Respondents in this \ncase\u2014the Palestine Liberation Organization (\u201cPLO\u201d) \nand its affiliate, the Palestinian Authority (\u201cPA\u201d)\u2014\nhave been leaders in the planning, funding, and re-\nwarding of terrorism against Jews. Respondents en-\ncourage terrorism by glorifying and compensating ter-\nrorists. This has become known as their \u201cPay for Slay\u201d \nprogram. Pay for Slay is embedded in Palestinian law \n \n1 Counsel for amici curiae state that no counsel for a party \nauthored this brief and that no person other than amici curiae, \ntheir members, or their counsel made a monetary contribution to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief. \n2 For more details about amici curiae, see Appendix A. \n\n2 \nand institutions. In its destructive path, many Amer-\nicans, both Jewish and non-Jewish, have been mur-\ndered. As Jews and Americans, amici have a deep and \nabiding interest in fighting terrorism and a profound \ninterest in this case.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nSince their founding in 1964 and 1994, respec-\ntively, the PLO and PA have planned, funded, re-\nwarded, and glorified terrorism. Determined to de-\nstroy the State of Israel, the PLO and PA ruthlessly \nincite violence against civilians, including Americans \ntraveling and living abroad. Some victims have been \ntargeted by Palestinian terrorists because they were \nAmerican\u2014like Leon Klinghoffer, who, in 1985, was \nshot in the head on an Italian cruise ship and thrown \noverboard in his wheelchair.  \nRespondents encourage the murder of civilians by \nrewarding the killers. Not only do they celebrate ter-\nrorists as \u201cmartyrs\u201d\u2014naming streets and landmarks \nafter them\u2014they pay terrorists and their families \nhandsomely through stipends and long-term benefits. \nThe more deadly the attack and the longer the terror-\nist spends in prison, the greater the stipends. Terror-\nists released from prison are rewarded with free \nhealth care, cushy jobs, and other lifetime benefits.  \nRespondents refer to this as the \u201cMartyrs\u2019 Fund,\u201d \nthough it is better described as \u201cPay for Slay.\u201d This \nprogram is not some under-the-table arrangement by \na loose band of terrorists, shelling out a few dollars. \nAlthough it began as ad hoc payments, the program \ngrew into an official government program that distrib-\nutes over $350 million annually in compensation and \nstipends. It is run by a bureaucracy with hundreds of \nemployees. It is governed by official laws and decrees. \n\n3 \nAnd it is supported by the movement of money inter-\nnationally, including money intended for humanitar-\nian aid. Substantial funds are collected, managed, and \nthen distributed to murderers and their families. The \nbureaucracy ensures that the checks go out on time, \nlike some perverse version of the Department of Vet-\nerans Affairs for terrorists.  \nCongress has tried for years to stop Pay for Slay, \nrecognizing that it puts not only innocent Israeli lives \nbut also American lives in danger and impedes Middle \nEast peace. In addition to criminal laws and limits on \nforeign aid, Congress has passed laws that subject Re-\nspondents to civil liability in U.S. courts. As Congress \ncorrectly understood, successful lawsuits would not \nonly bring some justice to the victims but also deter \nfuture terrorism and help resolve otherwise intracta-\nble foreign policy problems.  \nJudicial decisions, however, have impeded recov-\nery for the harm inflicted upon American citizens \nabroad. In a series of cases, the Second Circuit has \nheld that Respondents are not subject to personal ju-\nrisdiction and, in one case, overturned a jury award of \n$655.5 million for American victims. Waldman v. PLO \n(Waldman I), 835 F.3d 317, 324 (2d Cir. 2016).  \nCongress responded swiftly to these decisions. In \nits latest effort, Congress passed the Promoting Secu-\nrity and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 \n(\u201cPSJVTA\u201d) to ensure access to U.S. courts for victims. \nThe PSJVTA specifically targets Pay for Slay: it pro-\nvides that Respondents are deemed to have consented \nto personal jurisdiction if they continue to pay sti-\npends to terrorists and their families for killing Amer-\nicans abroad or if they conduct activities in the United \n\n4 \nStates. Respondents have done both, knowing the con-\nsequences. Yet, the Second Circuit upheld the district \ncourt\u2019s dismissal of lawsuits brought by Petitioners, \nholding that the PSJVTA violates the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause. \nThat decision is incorrect. The PSJVTA is a valid \nexercise of Congress\u2019s power to enact reasonable per-\nsonal jurisdiction statutes. The Fifth Amendment \ndoes not limit Congress\u2019s ability to enact a jurisdic-\ntional statute extending to foreign conduct, nor does it \nconstrain the power of the courts to adjudicate such \ncases. Even under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s more \nrestrictive standards for state long-arm jurisdiction, \nthe statute is reasonable and fair. \nFor one, the PSJVTA is reasonable because it is a \ncritical tool to combat international terrorism. With-\nout the imposition of civil liability, Pay for Slay re-\nmains well-funded. Recent events underscore this \npoint: The PA has confirmed that its program will con-\ntinue to cover not only PLO terrorists but also Hamas \nterrorists\u2014including those who participated in the \nHamas massacre on October 7, 2023, during which \nAmericans were killed and taken hostage.  \nSubjecting Respondents to the personal jurisdic-\ntion of federal courts under the PSJVTA is also fair. \nWhile Respondents commit acts of terrorism against \nAmericans abroad, they also advance their cause by \nexploiting U.S. communications, transportation, and \ncommerce. Respondents have maintained offices in \nthe United States and travelled here. Their represent-\natives have participated in university lectures and in-\nterviews in America, and they continue to distribute \npropaganda to U.S. citizens through our media chan-\nnels.  \n\n5 \nFurther, Respondents have killed Americans \nabroad for political gain. As this Court has recognized, \nthe \u201cmurder of a U.S. national is an offense to the \nUnited States as much as it is to the country where \nthe murder occurred.\u201d Gamble v. United States, 587 \nU.S. 678, 687 (2019). Respondents have received more \nthan fair notice that they will be subject to the juris-\ndiction of U.S. courts for their commission of such \ncrimes, and they have sufficient contacts in the \nUnited States to have consented to jurisdiction here. \nThey continue to sponsor terrorism anyway. \nCongress regulates the jurisdiction of the \u201c[t]ribu-\nnals inferior to the Supreme Court.\u201d U.S. Const. art. \nI, \u00a7 8, cl. 9. It enacted the PSJVTA with broad bipar-\ntisan support in response to decisions dismissing Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 lawsuits. The Executive Branch supports \nthe legislation and has intervened to defend the stat-\nute\u2019s constitutionality. This Court should defer to \nthese measured judgments of the political branches. \nCongress and the Executive\u2014not the Judiciary\u2014have \nthe constitutional role and competency to make those \njudgments in response to the scourge of international \nterrorism. This Court should reverse the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision and allow Petitioners to seek the justice \nthey deserve\u2014and the justice that Congress intended \nthem to receive. \n\n6 \nARGUMENT \nI. The PLO and PA Reward Terrorists for \nKilling Civilians, Including Americans  \nA. \nThe PLO and PA\u2019s Early History of \nInternational Terrorism  \nThe PLO was formed in 1964 during the Arab \nLeague Summit in Cairo, Egypt. Its founding mani-\nfesto stated that it would \u201cattain the objective of liqui-\ndating Israel.\u201d3 Under the leadership of Yasser Ara-\nfat, who took control in 1969, the PLO directed a \nhandful of terrorist factions under its aegis to serve \nthat purpose. Those included the Popular Front for \nthe Liberation of Palestine (\u201cPFLP\u201d), the Democratic \nFront for the Liberation of Palestine, the Popular \nFront for the Liberation of Palestine - General Com-\nmand, and Fatah, a guerrilla group that Arafat led in \nthe early 1960s.4 \nIn the late 1960s\u2014as part of its effort to \u201cuproot[] \nthe Zionist entity\u201d5\u2014the PLO began terror attacks \nagainst civilians. The PLO not only planned and orga-\nnized these attacks but also encouraged participation \nby compensating terrorists. In its infancy, the PLO \ndid not have any official payment system or benefits \n \n3 MARTIN GILBERT, ISRAEL: A HISTORY 352 (1998). \n4 Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO): History & \nOverview, \nJEWISH \nVIRTUAL \nLIBRARY, \nhttps://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/history-and-overview-plo \n(last visited Feb. 2, 2025). \n5 GILBERT, supra note 3, at 352. \n\n7 \nschedule. It paid terrorists on an ad hoc basis through \nthe funds it had available.6  \nThe PLO\u2019s concerted reign of terror began soon af-\nter its formation. In 1968, a bus carrying Israeli \nschoolchildren ran over a mine laid by terrorists. Two \nchildren died, and twenty-seven were wounded. By \n1971, the PLO had killed 120 civilians and injured \nmany more in a series of brutal attacks. By the mid-\n1970s, that number grew substantially: In 1974, for \nexample, the PLO murdered twenty-two school chil-\ndren in northern Israel in a single attack.7  \nThe PLO carried out terror attacks not only in Is-\nrael but in other countries as well, including several \ninternational hijackings. In 1968, the PLO hijacked \nan El Al flight flying from Rome to Tel Aviv. In 1970, \nPLO terrorists set off a bomb on a Swissair flight, kill-\ning all forty-seven passengers and crew, and hijacked \nthree other airliners from different countries. Two \nyears later, PLO terrorists seized control of a Sabena \nairlines flight from Brussels to Tel Aviv. That same \nyear, members of the group Black September, a mili-\ntant wing of the PLO, murdered eleven Israeli ath-\nletes at the 1972 Munich Olympics in front of a world \naudience\u2014its most infamous attack on foreign soil. \nThe PLO also carried out terrorist attacks in Cyprus, \nSwitzerland, Greece, and Paraguay throughout the \n1970s.  \nThe PLO killed and injured several Americans \nduring this period. In 1973, Black September agents \nkidnapped and murdered U.S. Ambassador Cleo Noel \n \n6 JIM ZANOTTI, CONG. RSCH.

In 1978, PLO terrorists killed an \nAmerican-Jewish photographer named Gail Rubin in \nIsrael before attacking tour buses with foreign travel-\ners during the \u201cCoastal Road Massacre.\u201d In 1985, the \nPLO hijacked a cruise ship off the coast of Egypt, took \npassengers hostage, and murdered a wheelchair-\nbound American passenger named Leon Klinghoffer. \nOne of the hijackers later explained that they wanted \nto kill an American and chose Klinghoffer because he \nwas disabled. His execution would show they \u201chad no \npity for anyone.\u201d8 As discussed below, many more \nAmericans have died at the hands of the PLO since \nthe 1970s and 1980s, including as recently as 2023. \nNotwithstanding its terrorist activities around the \nworld, the PLO began to attain international recogni-\ntion as a legitimate political organization. In 1974, \nArab leaders designated the PLO as the \u201csole legiti-\nmate representative of the Palestinian people,\u201d9 and \nthe United Nations\u2014over the objection of the United \nStates and other countries\u2014granted the PLO \u201cob-\nserver status\u201d that same year.10 To support its politi-\ncal mission, the PLO purchased a townhouse in Man-\nhattan and began substantial propaganda activities \nin the United States, such as giving speeches and in-\nterviews, purchasing and distributing pamphlets, and \nmailing solicitation materials.

Arafat simultaneously sup-\nplied Palestinians with Molotov cocktails, grenades, \nand firearms to attack Israeli civilians and soldiers.11 \nPLO leadership issued pamphlets to Palestinians de-\ntailing when and where to attack Israelis.12 These ac-\ntivities culminated in the \u201cFirst Intifada\u201d\u2014violent \nprotests and attacks that lasted from 1987 to 1993 \nand killed 160 Israelis.  \nIn 1993, following the First Intifada, the PLO and \nIsrael began a peace process known as the Oslo Ac-\ncords. The parties agreed to an initial \u201cDeclaration of \nPrinciples\u201d and, for the first time, recognized one an-\nother officially. The PLO and Israel entered agree-\nments that transferred portions of Gaza and part of \nJudea and Samaria (commonly referred to as the \n\u201cWest Bank\u201d) to Palestinian control. In 1994, the PLO \ncreated the PA to govern those areas.

Palestinian military factions, \nmany under the aegis of the PLO, carried out over 100 \nsuicide bombings, murdering over 1,000 Israelis and \ndozens of foreign nationals.  \nMany of those killed by PLO factions were Ameri-\ncan citizens. Those included Esther Klieman, 23, of \nChicago, Illinois, who was shot and killed near Ofra in \nMarch of 2002.

Congress Has Imposed Civil Liability to \nDeter International Terrorism, Defeat Pay \nfor Slay, and Secure Justice for Victims  \nCongress has repeatedly enacted legislation to de-\nfeat Pay for Slay and impede terrorism against Amer-\nicans abroad. In the 1980s, Congress declared the \nPLO a terrorist organization and sought to cut off its \naccess to both funding and the benefits of operating in \nthe United States. In 1992, Congress created a cause \nof action for victims of foreign terrorism, recognizing \nthat civil liability would help bring justice to victims \nand deter future terrorism.  \nThis case arises against the backdrop of a ten-year \nback-and-forth between Congress and a Second Cir-\ncuit panel regarding Petitioners\u2019 ability to sue the Re-\nspondents in federal courts. In response to the panel\u2019s \ndecisions, Congress has several times amended the \napplicable statute to ensure jurisdiction over Re-\nspondents. Its years-long, bipartisan efforts to em-\npower U.S. terror victims to seek recourse in federal \ncourt culminated in the PSJVTA, the statute at issue \nin this case. \nA. \nCongress Passes and Strengthens the \nAnti-Terrorism Act  \nAfter members of Congress were unable to per-\nsuade the State Department to close the PLO offices \nin the United States in the late 1980s, Congress en-\nacted the Anti-Terrorism Act of 1987.48 It determined \nthat \u201cthe PLO and its affiliates are a terrorist organi-\nzation and a threat to the interests of the United \nStates, its allies, and to international law and should \n \n48 Pub. L. No. 100-204, tit. X, 101 Stat. 1331, 1406 (codified at \n22 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 5201-5203). \n\n23 \nnot benefit from operating in the United States.\u201d 22 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 5201(b). Soon after, the Government sued to \nclose the PLO\u2019s offices in the United States. A court \nheld that it had personal jurisdiction over the PLO but \nthat the statute did not require the closure of the \nPLO\u2019s Permanent Observer Mission to the U.N. See \nUnited States v. Palestine Liberation Org., 695 F. \nSupp. 1456, 1471 (S.D.N.Y. 1988). \nIn the wake of the terror attacks of the 1970s and \n1980s, Congress enacted the Anti-Terrorism Act of \n1992 (\u201cATA\u201d), which provided a private right of action \nfor American nationals and their families killed or in-\njured by international terrorism to sue those respon-\nsible, as well as their supporters, when such terrorism \n\u201coccur[s] primarily outside the territorial jurisdiction \nof the United States.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2331(1)(C).  \nThe death of Leon Klinghoffer and his estate\u2019s suit \nagainst the PLO demonstrated that a civil suit would \nbe difficult without a private right of action: \u201cOnly by \nvirtue of the fact that the attack violated certain Ad-\nmiralty laws and that the [PLO] had assets and car-\nried on activities in New York, was the court able to \nestablish jurisdiction over the case.\u201d49 Accordingly, \nCongress designed the ATA to ensure that civil ac-\ntions could be brought following \u201c[a] similar attack oc-\ncurring on an airplane or in some other [foreign] locale \n[that] might not [otherwise] have been subject to civil \naction in the U.S.\u201d50 The 1992 amendments were in-\ntended to remove jurisdictional hurdles and provide \ntreble damages to the victims.  \n \n49 H.R.

The \nbill also sends a clear signal that Congress \nintends to empower courts to restore juris-\ndiction in cases previously dismissed.70  \nCo-sponsors Senator Grassley and Senator James \nLankford reiterated this view in a letter to the Biden \nAdministration in March 2021, noting that \u201cthe \nPSJVTA was the result of constructive work between \nCongress and the State Department, reflecting a bi-\npartisan agreement to reopen the courthouse doors to \nAmerican victims and their families,\u201d and that \u201cit is \nreasonable for the United States to condition the PLO \nand PA\u2019s establishment of an office in the United \nStates on their consent to personal jurisdiction in \ncases that allege they have engaged in or provided ma-\nterial support for terrorist attacks injuring U.S. na-\ntionals and their families.\u201d71    \nThe PSJVTA imposes two general bases of consent \nto personal jurisdiction. The first provides that per-\nsonal jurisdiction is proper if, 120 days after the \nPSJVTA\u2019s enactment, Respondents pay a terrorist \nwho has been imprisoned for committing any act of \nterrorism that injured or killed an American, and was \npaid because of his imprisonment; or, if such a pay-\n \n70 165 Cong.

See 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A)(i)-(ii).  \nThe second basis provides that Respondents con-\nsent to jurisdiction if, fifteen days after the PSJVTA\u2019s \nenactment, they procure, establish, or maintain \u201cany \noffice, headquarters, premises, or other facilities or es-\ntablishments in the United States,\u201d or otherwise con-\nduct any activities on behalf of the PLO while physi-\ncally \npresent \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nId. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B)(i)-(iii).  \nThese jurisdictional bases were carefully crafted to \nensure that the PLO and PA have fair warning of \nwhen they may be answerable for their actions in a \nU.S. court, consistent with the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause.  \nIII. The PSJVTA Is a Constitutional Exercise of \nCongress\u2019s Authority to Enact Reasonable \nPersonal Jurisdiction Statutes, and a \nCritical Tool for Combating Terrorism  \nAn exercise of personal jurisdiction satisfies due \nprocess if the defendant received \u201cfair warning\u201d that \n\u201ca particular activity may subject [them] to the juris-\ndiction of a foreign sovereign,\u201d and if the exercise of \njurisdiction is \u201creasonable, in the context of our fed-\neral system.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. \nDist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 358-360 (2021) (internal quo-\ntations omitted). The PSJVTA meets both of those re-\nquirements.72 \n \n72 Amici agree with Petitioners that the Fifth Amendment does \nnot limit Congress\u2019s ability to extend jurisdiction here. Still, the \nPSJVTA satisfies traditional notions of fair play and substantial \n \n\n30 \nFirst, Respondents have received adequate notice \nthat their actions may subject them to the jurisdiction \nof American courts. The PLO and PA are sophisti-\ncated international organizations with substantial \nfunding and recognition as the official representatives \nof the Palestinian people. They purposefully avail \nthemselves of the United States to advance their po-\nlitical causes. Their various contacts with the United \nStates and its citizens\u2014including killing Americans \nabroad to attain their goal of eliminating Israel\u2014\nmakes personal jurisdiction fair. As Judge Steven J. \nMenashi explained in his Second Circuit dissent, Re-\nspondents have been \u201cresiding and conducting busi-\nness in the United States\u2014not to mention furthering \ntheir political goals at the expense of American lives.\u201d \nFuld v. Palestine Liberation Org., 101 F.4th 190, 205 \n(2d Cir. 2024) (denying rehearing en banc) (Menashi, \nJ., dissenting). \nThe record shows that the PLO and PA have main-\ntained a presence in the United States for years, not \nonly to attend U.N. sessions in New York but also to \ninfluence American public opinion more broadly. \nAmong other things, the PLO and PA have had offices \nin New York with over a dozen employees, have par-\nticipated in interviews and press conferences, and \nhave exploited American communications to advance \ntheir causes. See Klinghoffer, 795 F. Supp. at 114. The \ngeneral delegation of the PLO registered as foreign \nagents under FARA as late as 2018.73 The PLO also \nhad \u201ca substantial commercial presence in the United \n \njustice applicable under the Fourteenth Amendment for state \nlong-arm jurisdiction.  \n73 See, e.g., JA149-150. \n\n31 \nStates,\u201d with dozens of phone numbers, office sup-\nplies, and living expenses for the U.S.-based repre-\nsentatives. Waldman I, 835 F.3d at 323. \nEven after the PSJVTA was enacted, the PLO and \nPA have directed activities at and in the United \nStates, such that they cannot reasonably contend it is \n\u201cfundamentally unfair\u201d for them to be sued here. On \nFebruary 11, 2020, PA leader Mahmoud Abbas held a \npress conference in New York City in which he criti-\ncized U.S. foreign policy.74 In 2020, the PA received \nlegal and strategic policy advice from a FARA-regis-\ntered, U.S.-based law firm.75 On October 4, 2022, Sec-\nretary General of the PLO Hussein Al-Sheikh met \nwith Assistant to the President for National Security \nAffairs, Jake Sullivan, at the White House.76 Husam \nZomlot, a senior member of Fatah, appeared on the \n \n74 Olmert and Abbas Meet in New York, Urge Direct Talks as \nTrump Plan Rejected, TIMES OF ISRAEL (Feb. 11, 2020), \nhttps://www.timesofisrael.com/netanyahu-livid-as-olmert-\nmeets-abbas-urges-renewed-peace-talks/. \n75 JA147-148. \n76 Statement, Adrienne Watson, Spokesperson, National \nSecurity Council, Statement by NSC Spokesperson Adrienne \nWatson on National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan\u2019s Meeting \nwith Secretary General of the Palestine Liberation Organization \nHussein \nAl-Sheikh \n(Oct. \n4, \n2022), \nhttps://bidenwhitehouse.archives.gov/briefing-room/statements-\nreleases/2022/10/04/statement-by-nsc-spokesperson-adrienne-\nwatson-on-national-security-advisor-jake-sullivans-meeting-\nwith-secretary-general-of-the-palestine-liberation-organization-\nhussein-al-sheikh/. \n\n32 \nCBS news program, Face the Nation, in November \n2023.77 \nThe PLO and PA also use American social media, \nappear at and donate to American universities, and \npublish propaganda in English\u2014all to influence \nAmerican public opinion.78 In 2020, the PA\u2019s top offi-\ncial in the United States, Riyad Mansour, attended a \nseminar hosted by Seton Hall University and a \u201cwebi-\nnar\u201d hosted by a U.S. not-for-profit group.79 In April \n2024, a student group at Columbia University hosted \nKhaled Barakat\u2014reportedly a member of the U.S.-\ndesignated terrorist group PFLP, a faction of the \nPLO\u2014and other anti-Israel speakers on a Zoom pro-\ngram.80 The pro-terror Al Quds University, which is \nadministered by the PA, has a joint program with \nBard College.81 Reportedly, Al Quds University has \n \n77 Transcript: Husam Zomlot, Palestinian Ambassador to the \nUnited Kingdom, on \u201cFace the Nation,\u201d CBS NEWS (Nov. 5, 2023), \nhttps://www.cbsnews.com/news/husam-zomlot-palestinian-\nambassador-to-the-united-kingdom-face-the-nation-transcript-\n11-05-2023/. \n78 JA281-285, 410-412. \n79 Jasmine DeLeon, Palestinian Ambassador to the UN Speaks \non Middle East Peace Plan, SETON HALL UNIV.

As explained, the political \nbranches have concluded that the PSJVTA is an es-\nsential tool for combating global terrorism which re-\nsults in the death and maiming of Americans. This is \nthe most compelling federal interest. See Holder v. \nHumanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28 (2010) (\u201cEve-\nryone agrees that the Government\u2019s interest in com-\nbating terrorism is an urgent objective of the highest \norder.\u201d). Accordingly, the PSJVTA is a constitutional \nexercise of Congress\u2019 authority to enact personal juris-\ndiction statutes that are fair and reasonable. As legis-\nlators concluded, \u201c[i]t is eminently reasonable to con-\ndition\u201d the PA\u2019s and PLO\u2019s \u201ccontinued presence in the \n \n82 US Colleges That Partner with Al Quds University, Take \nHeed, JEWISH LINK (July 8, 2021), https://jewishlink.news/us-\ncolleges-that-partner-with-al-quds-university-take-heed/. \n83 See Section 117 Foreign Gift and Contract Data, FEDERAL \nSTUDENT AID, https://fsapartners.ed.gov/knowledge-\ncenter/topics/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-\nreporting/section-117-foreign-gift-and-contract-data \n(last \nupdated Nov. 7, 2024) (collecting data on \u201cforeign gifts and \ncontracts that institutions of higher education reported to the \nU.S. Department of Education\u201d). \n\n34 \nUnited States on [their] consent to jurisdiction,\u201d as \n\u201cCongress has repeatedly tied their continued receipt \nof these privileges to their adherence to their commit-\nment to renounce terrorism.\u201d84 Yet neither the PA nor \nthe PLO has renounced terrorism. \nCongress constitutes and structures the jurisdic-\ntion of the lower courts. U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 9. \nCongress has tried to use that power to fight interna-\ntional terrorism by providing a statutory basis for civil \nliability when Americans are killed or injured abroad. \nThat is within Congress\u2019s ken: \u201cCongress has the au-\nthority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d E.E.O.C. v. Arabian \nAm. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991).

Co. v. California, 509 U.S. \n764, 813-814 (1993). As Judge Menashi explained, \n\u201cthe Fifth Amendment does not leave Congress pow-\nerless to afford relief to American victims of interna-\ntional terrorism.\u201d Fuld, 101 F.4th at 223 (Menashi, J., \ndissenting). \nIn weighing the federal interests to determine \nwhether the exercise of jurisdiction is reasonable here, \nthis Court should defer to the political branches. The \nCourt has stressed that \u201ccongressional authority re-\ngarding foreign affairs\u201d is \u201ca domain in which the con-\ntrolling role of the political branches is both necessary \nand proper.\u201d Bank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, \n234 (2016); see also Holder, 561 U.S. at 33-34 (Con-\ngress and the Executive are \u201centitled to deference\u201d \n \n84 H.R. Rep.

Given that \nCongress\u2014on a strong, bipartisan basis\u2014has tried \nseveral times to override decisions of the lower courts \nand subject Respondents to jurisdiction, this Court \nshould respect that determination. Doing so will help \nbring justice to American victims of terrorism and de-\nter future activity that puts American lives at risk. \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should reverse the decision of the Sec-\nond Circuit. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nJason Torchinsky \nErielle Davidson \nJared S.

The interest of amicus is in the sound \ndevelopment of law on the extraterritorial application \nof the Constitution. He submits this brief to ask the \nCourt to clarify the basis on which noncitizens can \nclaim the protections of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments\u2019 Due Process Clauses. \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n \nCourts have struggled to identify when the Consti-\ntution applies to foreign actors. The application of the \nDue Process Clause to foreign defendants challenging \nthe personal jurisdiction of domestic courts illustrates \nwhy the location of the alleged constitutional violation \nis key. The Court has long recognized that foreign cor-\nporations are entitled to the protections of the Due \nProcess Clause when they are haled into domestic \ncourts against their will. Under the Due Process \nClauses of the 5th or 14th Amendments, this right will \nprevent a court from exercising jurisdiction over a for-\neign corporation unless that corporation has \u201cmini-\nmum contacts\u201d with the forum. This stands in stark \ncontrast to other constitutional rights, such as the \n                                            \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in part, \nand no person or entity other than amicus or his counsel funded \nits preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nFourth Amendment, where a non-citizen must \ndemonstrate \u201csubstantial connections\u201d to the United \nStates before claiming any protection. The reason for \nthis difference is the location of the alleged constitu-\ntional violation. \nThe Court applies constitutional protections when \nthe purported violation occurs within the United \nStates. And when it comes to the assertion of judicial \npower by a domestic court over a non-consenting for-\neign defendant without \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the \nforum, the due process violation occurs where the \ncourt sits\u2014within the United States. The Due Process \nClause seeks to protect a defendant from having to \ndefend itself away from its home, because doing so, \nabsent some action by the defendant to subject itself \nto suit in the forum, offends traditional notions of fair \nplay and substantial justice. Thus, any harms are oc-\ncasioned by the defendant having to appear and de-\nfend itself in U.S. courts. \nFinally, the Court has long recognized that the \nDue Process Clauses of the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments apply to noncitizens within the United \nStates. Because the location of the violation is a key \nconsideration and because any violation occurs in the \nUnited States, the Court should use this case as an \nopportunity to clarify why the Due Process Clause \nprotects foreign corporations and other noncitizens \nwhen they challenge a court\u2019s personal jurisdiction. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \nARGUMENT \n \nI. \nTHE COURT SHOULD CLARIFY WHY \nTHE RESPONDENTS MAY INVOKE THE \nFIFTH AMENDMENT \n \nFor over seven decades, the Court has recognized \nthe right of noncitizens, including foreign corpora-\ntions, to claim the protections of the due process \nclause, typically under the Fourteenth Amendment. \nSee, e.g., Perkins v. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., \net. al., 342 U.S. 437 (1952), Insurance Corp. of Ireland, \nLtd., et. al v. Compagnie Des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 \nU.S. 694 (1982), Helicopteros Nacionales de Colum-\nbia, S.A. v. Hall et. al, 466 U.S. 408 (1984), Asahi \nMetal Industry Co. Ltd. v. Superior Court of Califor-\nnia, Solerno County, 480 U.S. 102 (1987), J. McIntyre \nMachinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), \nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, \n564 U.S. 915 (2011), and Daimler, AG v. Bauman, 571 \nU.S. 117 (2014). But it has never explained the basis \nfor such noncitizens to claim this right. It has merely \nheld that corporations chartered outside the United \nStates may not be haled into American courts unless \nthey have \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the forum. \nAt the same time, for over thirty years, the Court \nhas held that before a foreign citizen outside the \nUnited States may claim certain constitutional rights, \nthat individual must have \u201csubstantial connections\u201d \nto the United States. See, e.g., United States v. Ver-\ndugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990). This has created \nsomething of a paradox for lower courts and practi-\ntioners, which scholars have commented on: that to \n\n4 \n \n \n \nclaim a constitutional right, a noncitizen outside \nAmerica must have substantial connections to the \nUnited States, but that due process is only offended \nby a lack of minimum contacts. See, e.g., Robin J. Ef-\nfron, Solving the Nonresident Alien Due Process Par-\nadox in Personal Jurisdiction, 166 U. Mich. L. Rev. \nOnline 123 (2018); Alan Mygatt-Tauber, Determining \nConstitutional Extraterritoriality, 84 Louisiana L. \nRev. 532, 557-559 (2024). \nThis case offers the Court an opportunity  to re-\nsolve this paradox, by clearly stating that any viola-\ntion of due process\u2014which arises from subjecting \nnoncitizens (including corporations) to suit in U.S. \ncourts\u2014occurs in the United States, where the court \nresides. \nAll parties here agree that the Respondents are \nentitled to some measure of protection under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment\u2014they merely \ndisagree about what powers Congress has, consistent \nwith that Amendment, to subject the Respondents to \npersonal jurisdiction.2 Likewise, the amici in support \n                                            \n2 Plaintiffs in 24-20 disputed the proposition that the PLO and \nPA have due process rights in the trial court, but they made the \nargument only for appellate consideration, recognizing it was \nforeclosed by circuit precedent. Fuld v. Palestine Liberation Or-\nganization, 578 F. Supp. 3d 577, 585, n.5 (S.D.N.Y. 2022). How-\never, they did not press this issue in the Court of Appeals and \nthe lower court did not address it. Additionally, they make ref-\nerence to an Office of Legal Counsel opinion indicating that the \nPLO lacks rights due to its status as an \u201cindependent sovereign \nentity.\u201d  Petition for Certiorari, Fuld, et al. v. Palestine Libera-\ntion Organization, et al, No. 24-20, at 23. This is based on the \nargument that sovereign governments are not \u201cpersons\u201d for pur-\nposes of the Fifth Amendment. Neither Petitioners nor the Office \n \n\n5 \n \n \n \nof Petitioners acknowledge that noncitizens are enti-\ntled to due process rights.3 \nThere is thus no question that Respondents have \nrights in this case. The Court should use this as an \nopportunity to explain precisely why foreign corpora-\ntions (and noncitizens more broadly) are entitled to \nthe protections of the Due Process Clause before being \nforced to litigate in forums far from home.  \n \nII. \nTHE KEY QUESTION FOR ASSESSING \nTHE APPLICABILITY OF THE CONSTI-\nTUTION IS WHERE THE ALLEGED VIO-\nLATION OCCURS \nIn determining the applicability of the Constitu-\ntion, courts have long held that one of the key ques-\ntions is the location of the violation. As early as 1922, \nwhen discussing the applicability of the Sixth Amend-\nment, the Court stated that \u201c[i]t is locality that is de-\nterminative of the application of the Constitution, in \n                                            \nof Legal Counsel argued that the PLO lacks due process rights \non the basis of being a foreign corporation. 11 Op. O.L.C. 104 \n(1987). Indeed, the Office of Legal Counsel acknowledges that \n\u201c[r]eal or juridical \u2018persons\u2019 not United States citizens possess \nsome constitutional rights while on American soil.\u201d  Id. at 105. \n3 Amicus U.S. House of Representatives argues that Respond-\nents are not entitled to due process protections, but it hinges its \nargument on Respondents\u2019 role as governing entities for the Pal-\nestinian territories and people, thus making them not \u201cpersons\u201d \nwithin the meaning of the Fifth Amendment. Brief for the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives as Amicus Curiae in Support of Peti-\ntioners, Fuld et al v. Palestinian Liberation Organization, et al, \nNo. 24-20, pgs. 12-15. Amicus does not base its argument on Re-\nspondents\u2019 status as noncitizens or foreign corporations. \n \n\n6 \n \n \n \nsuch matters as judicial procedure, and not the status \nof the people who live in it.\u201d  Balzac v. Porto Rico, 258 \nU.S. 298, 309 (1922).4 The Ninth Circuit similarly has \nrecognized that the location of a violation is key in its \ndecision in Brulay v. United States, 383 F.2d 345 (9th \nCir. 1967). In Brulay, the court was faced with chal-\nlenges under both the Fourth and Fifth Amendments \ndealing with a search that occurred in Mexico and sev-\neral statements made to Mexican police. Id. at 347-48. \nThe court found that the Fourth Amendment did not \napply to Mexican officials, but conducted an analysis \nunder the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 347-49. It ex-\nplained this differing treatment in a footnote. Id. at \n349, n. 5. The court, relying on Bram v. United States, \n168 U.S. 532 (1897), explained that the Fourth \nAmendment is violated when the search takes place, \nbut for the Fifth Amendment, any violation of the self-\nincrimination clause is not complete until the state-\nments are received in evidence. Id. See also, Alan \nMygatt-Tauber, Determining Constitutional Extrater-\nritoriality, 84 Louisiana L. Rev. 532, 540-544 (collect-\ning cases). \nThis Court made the same distinction between the \nFourth and Fifth Amendments in United States v. \nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259 (1990). Citing to Kas-\ntigar v. United States, 406 U.S. 441, 453 (1972), the \nCourt \nheld \nthat \n\u201c[a]lthough \nconduct \nby \nlaw \n                                            \n4 Amicus recognizes that Balzac is one of the much maligned In-\nsular Cases, and does not favor the extension of their \u201cterritorial \nincorporation doctrine.\u201d  However, the Court correctly recog-\nnized that being in the United States is one key to the applica-\ntion of the Constitution, even while wrongfully determining that \nPuerto Rico was not within the United States. \n\n7 \n \n \n \nenforcement officials prior to trial may ultimately im-\npair [the right against self-incrimination], a constitu-\ntional violation occurs only at trial.\u201d  Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez, 494 U.S. at 264. By contrast, \u201ca violation of \nthe [Fourth] Amendment is \u2018fully accomplished\u2019 at the \ntime of an unreasonable government intrusion.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted). Thus, the Court concluded, \u201cif \nthere were a Fourth Amendment violation, it occurred \nsolely in Mexico.\u201d Id. \nJustice Kennedy, in his concurrence in Verdugo-\nUrquidez, also recognized the importance of place to \ndetermining whether the defendant had constitu-\ntional rights. \u201cThe United States is prosecuting a for-\neign national in a court established under Article III, \nand all of the trial proceedings are governed by the \nConstitution. All would agree, for instance, that the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment protects \nthe defendant.\u201d  Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 278 \n(Kennedy, J., concurring). \n Lower courts have likewise focused on the loca-\ntion of the alleged violation to determine whether the \nConstitution applied. The Second Circuit, in examin-\ning an Establishment Clause challenge to the funding \nof sectarian schools in foreign countries, contrasted \nthe First Amendment with the Fourth Amendment. \nLamont v. Woods, 948 F.2d 825, 834 (2nd Cir. 1991). \n\u201cUnlike the Fourth Amendment violation in Verdugo, \nwe hold that any alleged Establishment Clause viola-\ntions in this case, if established, would have occurred \nin the United States \u2013 i.e., at the time appellants \ngranted money to United States entities for the bene-\nfit of foreign sectarian institutions \u2013 and not abroad \u2013 \ni.e., at the time the money was received or expended.\u201d \n\n8 \n \n \n \nId. \nFinally, Judge Sand of the Southern District of \nNew York recognized the importance of locating the \nsitus of any alleged constitutional violation in United \nStates v. Bin Laden. 132 F. Supp. 2d 168 (S.D.N.Y. \n2001). Like this Court in Bram and Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez, he recognized that \u201cany violation of the privi-\nlege against self-incrimination occurs, not at the mo-\nment law enforcement officials coerce statements \nthrough custodial interrogation, but when a defend-\nant\u2019s involuntary statements are actually used \nagainst him in an American criminal proceeding.\u201d Id. \nat 181-82. \nThus, courts at all levels of the federal system \nhave consistently held that the key question for deter-\nmining the applicability of a constitutional right is not \nthe citizenship of the person claiming the right, but \nrather the location of the alleged constitutional viola-\ntion. When it comes to the application of the Due Pro-\ncess Clause to the question of personal jurisdiction, \nthe violation occurs within the United States. \n \nIII. \nANY VIOLATION OCCURS WITHIN THE \nUNITED STATES \nThe history of personal jurisdiction law within the \nUnited States has always been tied to place. From the \nearliest examinations of the reach of personal juris-\ndiction, location has played an outsized role. As the \nCourt itself recognized in International Shoe v. Wash-\nington, \u201c[h]istorically the jurisdiction of courts to ren-\nder judgment in personam is grounded on their de \nfacto power over the defendant\u2019s person. Hence his \npresence within the territorial jurisdiction of a court \n\n9 \n \n \n \nwas prerequisite to its rendition of a judgment per-\nsonally binding him.\u201d  326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945) (citing \nPennoyer v. Neff, 95 U.S. 714 (1877)). \nBut even after moving away from the strictly ter-\nritorial notions of Pennoyer, place still matters. Gen-\neral jurisdiction is allowable where the corporation is \nfound at home. Goodyear Dunlop Tires Operations \nS.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 919 (2011) (\u201cA court may \nassert general jurisdiction over foreign (sister-state or \nforeign-country) corporations to hear any and all \nclaims against them when their affiliations with the \nState are so \u2018continuous and systematic\u2019 as to render \nthem essentially at home in the foreign state.\u201d). Spe-\ncific jurisdiction arises where the injury occurred. Id. \n(\u201cIn contrast to general, all-purpose jurisdiction, spe-\ncific jurisdiction is confined to adjudication of \u2018issues \nderiving from, or connected with, the very controversy \nthat establishes jurisdiction\u2019\u201d (citations omitted)). Tag \njurisdiction lies where the defendant can be found. \nMallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122, 128-29 \n(2023) (plurality opinion). And personal jurisdiction \nbased on litigation behavior results because the de-\nfendant appears and submits to the jurisdiction of the \ncourt. Insurance Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des Baux-\nites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 703-705 (1982) (recogniz-\ning that the due process right can be waived). \nThis Court has consistently recognized that a \ncourt violates a defendant\u2019s due process right when it \ninappropriately exercises jurisdiction. See, e.g., Inter-\nnational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 317 (holding that the vio-\nlation of due process arises from requiring the corpo-\nration \u201cto defend the suit away from its home\u201d); J. \nMcIntyre Machinery, Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, \n877 (2011) (\u201cDue process protects the defendants\u2019 \n\n10 \n \n \n \nright not to be coerced except by lawful judicial \npower.\u201d);  Id. at 884 (\u201cPersonal jurisdiction, of course, \nrestricts \u2018judicial power not as a matter of sover-\neignty, but as a matter of individual liberty,\u2019 for due \nprocess protects the individual\u2019s right to be subject \nonly to lawful power.\u201d (citing Insurance Corp. of Ir., \n456 U.S. at 702)); Goodyear, 564 U.S. at 918 (\u201cA state \ncourt\u2019s assertion of jurisdiction exposes defendants to \nthe State\u2019s coercive power, and is therefore subject to \nreview for compatibility with the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause.\u201d). \nIn every case, this Court has held that it was the \nact of being haled into a court where the defendant is \nnot at home or lacks minimum contacts that offends \n\u201c\u2019traditional notions of fair play and substantial jus-\ntice\u2019\u201d and thus violates the Due Process Clause. Inter-\nnational Shoe, 326 U.S. at 316 (quoting Milliken v \nMeyer, 311 U.S. 457, 463 (1940)). \nThe D.C. Circuit provided the best explanation, \nshowing that any violation of the Due Process Clause \noccurs in the United States, in GSS Group Ltd. v. Na-\ntional Port Authority, 680 F.3d 805 (D.C. Cir. 2012). \nAs the court explained: \n \nWhen a foreign corporation is summoned into \ncourt, it is being forced to defend itself. To do so, \nthe corporation must appoint a representative to \nact for it \u2013 that is, an attorney. In opposing per-\nsonal jurisdiction on due process grounds the cor-\nporation, through its attorney, makes itself pre-\nsent. And since it has been forced to appear in the \nUnited States, at least for that limited purpose, it \nis entitled to protection of the due process clause \nas interpreted in International Shoe and later \n\n11 \n \n \n \ndecisions involving foreign corporate defendants. \nAn alternative reconciliation might lie in the idea \nthat when a United States court exercises jurisdic-\ntion over a foreign corporate defendant it inflicts \ndamage on that defendant (at a minimum in the \nform of legal costs, but possibly in the form of a \njudgment) in the United States. \n \nId. at 816 (internal citations and footnotes omitted, \nemphasis in original). As the court so cogently ex-\nplained, the foreign corporate defendant is entitled to \nconstitutional protections because the violation hap-\npens in the United States. This is because, like a vio-\nlation of the Self-Incrimination Clause, a violation of \nthe Due Process Clause in these cases is complete only \nwhen the U.S. court exercises in personam jurisdic-\ntion over the corporation. See Lea Brilmayer, The Ex-\ntraterritorial Application of American Law: A Meth-\nodological and Constitutional Appraisal, 50 L. & Con-\ntemp. Probs. 11, 33 (1987) (\u201cIt is local litigation that \ntriggers the constitutional protection.\u201d). \n \nIV. \nTHE COURT HAS LONG RECOGNIZED \nTHE \nDUE \nPROCESS \nRIGHTS \nOF \nNONCITIZENS WITHIN THE UNITED \nSTATES \nThe Court has never denied that noncitizens, \nwhether individuals or corporations, are entitled to \ndue process rights within the United States. Indeed, \nthe very confusion that amicus is requesting the \nCourt to clear up arises because of its consistent \nrecognition that the Due Process Clause of the Four-\nteenth Amendment, which is identical in wording to \n\n12 \n \n \n \nthe Fifth, applies to foreign corporations. See Perkins \nv. Benguet Consolidated Mining Co., et. al., 342 U.S. \n437 (1952), Insurance Corp. of Ireland, Ltd., et. al v. \nCompagnie Des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694 \n(1982), Helicopteros Nacionales de Columbia, S.A. v. \nHall et. al, 466 U.S. 408 (1984), Asahi Metal Industry \nCo. Ltd. v. Superior Court of California, Solerno \nCounty, 480 U.S. 102 (1987), J. McIntyre Machinery, \nLtd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873 (2011), Goodyear Dun-\nlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915 \n(2011), and Daimler, AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117 \n(2014). In each of these cases, when a lower court at-\ntempted to exercise jurisdiction over a foreign corpo-\nrate defendant, this Court held that the Due Process \nClause applied to limit how far the lower court could \nreach. \nEven in cases applying the Fifth Amendment, as \nopposed to the Fourteenth Amendment, this Court \nhas recognized that Due Process would require Con-\ngress to enact some positive law that allowed the \nlower courts to exercise jurisdiction. See, e.g., Toland \nv. Sprague, 37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300, 330 (1838); Picquet \nv. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. 1828) (Story, Cir-\ncuit Judge) (\u201cSuch an intention [to submit nonresi-\ndent noncitizens to personal jurisdiction in the US], \nso repugnant to the general rights and sovereignty of \nother nations, ought not to be presumed, unless it is \nestablished by irresistible proof.\u201d); Arbitron Austria \nGmbH v. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 418 (2023) \n(\u201cIf Congress has provided an unmistakable instruc-\ntion that the provision is extraterritorial, then claims \nalleging exclusively foreign conduct may proceed.\u201d). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nThus, even under a Fifth Amendment standard, \nRespondents would still be entitled to raise a Due Pro-\ncess Clause claim if a court attempted to exercise ju-\nrisdiction over them in the absence of congressional \nlegislation creating such jurisdiction. See, e.g., Omni \nCap. Int\u2019l v. Rudolph Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 101 \n(1987) (holding that because no federal law author-\nized the federal court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion, the court was bound by the state long-arm stat-\nute). Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdiction of \nthe Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, 1704 (2020) \n(\u201cA federal court\u2019s writ may run as far as Congress, \nwithin its enumerated powers, would have it go.\u201d). \nLikewise, they may claim a due process violation if \nthey do not receive notice. Id. at 1709-10 (\u201cDue pro-\ncess may still require that defendants receive ade-\nquate notice, that the forum not be so burdensome as \nto render the proceedings a sham, and so on.\u201d (inter-\nnal citations omitted)); Mullane v. Cent. Hanover \nBank & Tr. Co., 339 U.S. 306, 320 (1950). \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe Court has long recognized that the Due Pro-\ncess Clause (and other constitutional provisions) pro-\ntects noncitizens when they are in the United States. \nThe Court has also recognized the importance of rec-\nognizing where an alleged constitutional violation oc-\ncurred when determining if a right applies. The Court \nshould use this case to clarify that the reason foreign \ncorporations (and other noncitizens) can claim the \nprotection of the Due Process Clause in personal ju-\nrisdiction cases is because any violation of that clause \n\n14 \n \n \n \noccurs in courts which are located within the United \nStates. \nRespectfully submitted,      \n                                      \nALAN MYGATT-TAUBER \nCounsel of Record  \nLAW OFFICE OF ALAN \nMYGATT-TAUBER \n10089 Ashley Circle NW \nSilverdale, WA 98383 \n(202) 236-9734 \nalan@amtappeals.com \n \n \nJanuary 29, 2025",

Currently, America First \nLegal is serving as counsel to U.S. Representative \nRonny Jackson (R-Tx), Stuart and Robbie Force, and \nSari Singer in a case captioned Jackson et al. v.

Congress passed the \nTaylor Force Act to prevent U.S. tax dollars from \nsubsidizing the Palestinian Authority and thus \nincentivizing Palestinian terrorism; as America First \nLegal has argued in that case, Congress has \nrecognized that all funds in the hands of the \nPalestinian Authority and the related Palestine \nLiberation Organization \u201cultimately inure[s] to the \nbenefit of their criminal, terrorist functions\u2014\nregardless of whether such support was ostensibly \nintended \nto \nsupport \nnon-violent, \nnon-terrorist \nactivities.\u201d Id.; see 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378c-1.  \nAccordingly, America First Legal submits this \nbrief to inform the Court about the errors in the \ndecision below and the serious consequences for the \nNation\u2019s security if the decision is not reversed. \n \n \n \n \n \n\n3 \n \n \n \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nIn its decision below, the Second Circuit \ninvalidated the Promoting Security and Justice for \nVictims of Terrorism Act of 2019 (\u201cPSJVTA\u201d), Pub. L. \nNo. 116-94, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082, Congress\u2019s \nthird attempt to allow victims of Respondents\u2019 \nterrorism to seek justice in federal courts. This Court \nshould reverse for several reasons. \nFirst, the Second Circuit misconstrued and \nmisapplied this Court\u2019s recent decision in Mallory v. \nNorfolk Southern Railway Co., 600 U.S. 122 (2023). \nContrary to the opinion below, Mallory does not \nrequire a defendant to receive a benefit from a forum \nin exchange for impliedly consenting to personal \njurisdiction there. See Part I.A, infra. In any event, \nRespondents did receive a benefit from the United \nStates in the form of conducting activities and \nmaintaining premises in America. See Part I.B, infra. \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s response that these benefits \nwere unlawfully received is both false and irrelevant. \nSee Part I.B, infra. \nSecond, extending broad personal jurisdiction \nprotections to Respondents is especially unsound \nbecause the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, \nas originally understood, did not concern personal \njurisdiction at all, see Part II.A, infra, and certainly \nnot for foreign entities, see Part II.B, infra. \nThird, if affirmed, the decision below will have \ndevastating foreign-policy consequences and preclude \n\n4 \n \n \n \nAmerican victims of Palestinian terrorism from \nseeking justice. See Part III, infra. \nThe Court should reverse. \n ARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Second Circuit Misapplied Mallory. \nThe Second Circuit made two dispositive errors \nwhen applying this Court\u2019s recent Mallory decision. \nThe court held that (1) Respondents were required to \nreceive a benefit from the forum in exchange for \nconsenting to personal jurisdiction; and (2) any such \nbenefits received here were unlawful and thus do not \nqualify. Both holdings are erroneous. \nA. \nMallory Does Not Require Receipt of \na \nBenefit \nfrom \nthe \nForum \nin \nExchange \nfor \nConsenting \nto \nPersonal Jurisdiction. \nMallory held that personal jurisdiction can be \nestablished through implied consent, but the Second \nCircuit erroneously held that Respondents could \nimpliedly consent to personal jurisdiction only in two \nnarrow circumstances: (1) via \u201clitigation-related \nconduct,\u201d or (2) \u201cwhere [they] accept[] a benefit from \nthe forum in exchange for [their] amenability to suit \nin the forum\u2019s courts,\u201d meaning \u201creciprocal bargains.\u201d \nPet.App.20a, 22\u201324a.2 \nThat was wrong. Mallory did not turn on whether \nthe defendant (Norfolk Southern) had \u201caccept[ed] a \n \n2 \u201cPet.App.\u201d refers to the certiorari-stage appendix filed by \nPetitioners Miriam Fuld et al. on July 3, 2024 (No. 24-20). \n\n5 \n \n \n \nbenefit from\u201d the venue (Pennsylvania), but rather \nwhether the defendant had \u201ctake[n] a \u2018voluntary act\u2019 \nthat the law treats as consent.\u201d Pet.App.243a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing \nen banc). Thus, \u201c[t]he defendant need not specifically \nintend to consent to jurisdiction.\u201d Id. Mallory itself \nindicated as much. Far from being limited, \u201ca variety \nof legal arrangements have been taken to represent \u2026 \nimplied consent to personal jurisdiction consistent \nwith due process,\u201d and this Court has \u201c[n]ever \nimposed some sort of \u2018magic words\u2019 requirement\u201d for \nsuch implied consent. Mallory, 600 U.S. at 136 n.5 \n(cleaned up). \nTherefore, \u201c[t]he consent of the foreign entity \nmust only be knowing and voluntary and involve some \nnexus to the forum such that requiring consent would \nnot be \u2018unfair.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.243\u201344a (citing Mallory, 600 \nU.S. at 141 (plurality opinion); id. at 153\u201354 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment)). \nThere is hardly anything \u201cunfair,\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. \nat 141, in subjecting sophisticated entities to \njurisdiction for conduct that they surely recognized \nwould qualify under the relevant statutes. \nB. \nEven \nIf \nMallory \nRequires \nRespondents \nto \nHave \nAccepted \nBenefits, They Did So. \nThe Second Circuit also misapplied its own test. \nEven if Mallory did require Respondents to have \naccepted benefits from the forum, they did so\u2014and \nthus consented to personal jurisdiction. \n\n6 \n \n \n \nPlaintiffs\u2019 complaint \u201calleges that the [Palestine \nLiberation Organization (\u2018PLO\u2019)] and the [Palestinian \nAuthority (\u2018PA\u2019)] maintained premises and engaged in \nofficial activities in the United States\u201d after passage \nof the PSVJTA. Pet.App.248a (Menashi, J., dissenting \nfrom the denial of rehearing). Not only is that a \nbenefit received, but the PSJVTA expressly warned \nRespondents that it would be. See 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B) (recognizing that after a fifteen-day \ngrace \nperiod, \nRespondents\u2019 \n\u201cmaintain[ing]\u201d \nor \n\u201cestablish[ing] or procur[ing] any office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments in the \nUnited States\u201d or \u201cconduct[ing] any activity while \nphysically present in the United States on behalf of \nthe [PLO] or the [PA]\u201d would be a benefit resulting in \npersonal jurisdiction). \nThat makes this an even easier case than Mallory \nitself, where the registration statute itself did not say \nit entailed consent to jurisdiction\u2014rather, that was in \na separate statute. 600 U.S. at 134. \nThe Second Circuit declined to count these \nbenefits, however, because the PA and PLO allegedly \nprocured them by engaging in unlawful conduct. The \ncourt claimed that \u201cfederal law has long prohibited \n[Respondents] from engaging in any activities or \nmaintaining any offices in the United States, absent \nspecific executive or statutory waivers.\u201d Pet.App.28a. \nThe court acknowledged that the U.S. government has \nlong permitted Respondents to engage in that conduct \nanyway, despite its illegality, but found that fact \nirrelevant. Pet.App.29a n.10. \n\n7 \n \n \n \nBut the court misread parts of the relevant \nprovisions. To be sure, the Palestinian Anti-Terrorism \nAct of 2006 makes it \u201cunlawful\u201d for the PA \u201cto \nestablish or maintain an office, headquarters, \npremises, or other facilities or establishments within \nthe jurisdiction of the United States\u201d absent certain \ncertifications. Pub. L. No. 109-446, \u00a7 7(a), 120 Stat. \n3318, 3324 (codified at 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 2378b note). But \nthe PA does not appear to be barred under that law \nfrom \u201cconduct[ing] any activity while physically \npresent in the United States\u201d on the PA\u2019s behalf, \nwhich the PSJVTA establishes as an independent \nbenefit that will confer personal jurisdiction. 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B)(iii). Thus, there is not complete \noverlap between what the PA is barred from doing and \nwhat acts will be considered a benefit conferring \npersonal jurisdiction over the PA. \nAs Judge Menashi explained in dissent below, \nPet.App.251a n.21, Plaintiffs triggered the PSJVTA\u2019s \n\u201cconducting-and-activity\u201d provision by alleging: (1) \n\u201cwhile physically in the United States, [Respondents] \nhave conducted press conferences and created and \ndistributed informational materials,\u201d JA.4093 (Fuld \nAm. Compl. \u00b6 75); (2) made \u201ccommunications,\u201d id. \n(\u00b6 76); and (3) \u201cupdated their website and/or their \nUnited States-based social-media accounts while \nphysically inside the United States,\u201d JA.410, 414 \n(\u00b6\u00b6 85, 88); and (3) social media updates, JA.414 \n(\u00b6 88). \n \n3 \u201cJA\u201d refers to the Joint Appendix filed on January 28, 2025 (No. \n24-20). \n\n8 \n \n \n \nMore fundamentally, however, the Second \nCircuit\u2019s premise was wrong. Even if Respondents\u2019 \nconduct were all unlawful, that is no reason to \ndisregard it for purposes of personal jurisdiction. \n\u201cCongress often creates civil liability to penalize \nunlawful conduct. The whole premise of specific \npersonal jurisdiction is that wrongful conduct in the \nforum gives the forum an interest in subjecting the \nbad actor to the jurisdiction of its courts. And tag \njurisdiction, the analogue of deemed-consent statutes, \nhas never been limited only to those lawfully present \nin the forum.\u201d Pet.App.252a (Menashi, J., dissenting \nfrom the denial of rehearing) (emphases in original) \n(collecting authorities). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s rule that implied consent \ncannot consider unlawful conduct leads to absurd \nresults. An \u201coutlaw who refused to obey the laws of \nthe state would be in better position than a \ncorporation which chooses to conform.\u201d Smolik v. \nPhila. & Reading Coal & Iron Co., 222 F. 148, 150 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1915) (Hand, J.). Imagine a statute \nanalogous to Pennsylvania\u2019s in Mallory, except the \nstatute instituted deemed consent for any business \nthat knowingly opened a retail store in the state. In \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s view, a lawful supermarket chain \nwith a branch in Pennsylvania would have consented \nto personal jurisdiction, but not the owner of an illicit \ndrug dispensary. \nThis Court has long recognized that unlawful \nconduct does not exempt a defendant from personal \njurisdiction. For example, in Old Wayne Mutual Life \nAss\u2019n v. McDonough, the Court noted that \u201cif an \n\n9 \n \n \n \ninsurance corporation of another state transacts \nbusiness in Pennsylvania without complying with its \nprovisions, it will be deemed to have assented to any \nvalid terms prescribed by that commonwealth as a \ncondition of its right to do business there,\u201d and would \neven \u201cbe estopped to say that it had not done what it \nshould have done in order that it might lawfully enter \nthat commonwealth and there exert its corporate \npowers.\u201d 204 U.S. 8, 21\u201322 (1907). \n* * * \nThe decision below misinterpreted Mallory, but \neven if it didn\u2019t, this Court should still reverse because \nRespondents accepted benefits from the forum\u2014and \nthus consented to personal jurisdiction. \nII. \nForeign Organizations Like Respondents \nDo Not Possess Constitutional Personal \nJurisdiction Rights in Federal Courts. \nExtending broad personal jurisdiction protections \nto Respondents was especially unsound because the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process protection was not \ntraditionally understood to limit federal courts\u2019 \njurisdiction, and especially not for foreign entities. \nA. \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause \nWas \nNot \nOriginally \nUnderstood to Limit Federal Courts\u2019 \nJurisdiction. \nThe Court has previously left \u201copen the question \nwhether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same \nrestrictions on the exercise of personal jurisdiction by \na federal court\u201d as the Fourteenth Amendment does \nfor state courts. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. Ct. \n\n10 \n \n \n \nof Cal., S.F. Cnty., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); see also \nDouglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 254 (5th Cir. 2022) (Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf the \n\u2026 Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause, as \noriginally understood, imposes the same set of \njurisdictional rules that the Supreme Court has \ndecreed pursuant to the Fourteenth Amendment, \nthen it [must be] prov[en] \u2026 with reference to the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s text, history, and structure.\u201d). \nThere are strong originalist arguments for why the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does not \nimpose personal jurisdiction limits at all, making it all \nthe more clear that the Second Circuit erred by \ngranting extensive protections to Respondents. \nFirst, scholarship has shown that the Fifth \nAmendment was not originally understood to limit \npersonal jurisdiction; it merely required service of \nprocess in the narrow sense. See Max Crema & \nLawrence B. Solum, The Original Meaning of \u201cDue \nProcess of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amendment, 108 Va. L. \nRev. 447 (2022); Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited \nJurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. \n1703, 1743 (2020) (\u201cThe Fifth Amendment bars the \nexecution of a federal judgment only if the federal \ncourt lacked jurisdiction. And Congress gets to answer \nth[e jurisdiction] question.\u201d); see also Pet.App.254\u2013\n55a (Menashi, J., dissenting from the denial of \nrehearing) (discussing this scholarship). \nCongress was limited only by its enumerated \npowers, because all personal jurisdiction limits were \nderived from general, international law principles, \nwhich could always be overridden by federal statutes. \nSachs, supra, at 1708\u201317; Pet.App.256\u201358a (Menashi, \n\n11 \n \n \n \nJ., dissenting from the denial of rehearing); see also, \ne.g., The Nereide, 13 U.S. (9 Cranch) 388, 423 (1815) \n(\u201cTill [a contrary] act be passed, the Court is bound by \nthe law of nations which is a part of the law of the \nland.\u201d). \u201c[W]hen it comes to personal jurisdiction, due \nprocess limitations may be largely coextensive with \nthe process that Congress chooses to provide.\u201d Ingrid \nWuerth, The Due Process and Other Constitutional \nRights of Foreign Nations, 88 Fordham L. Rev. 633, \n679\u201386 (2019). \nSecond, early caselaw strengthens that view. In \nPicquet v. Swan, Justice Story, riding circuit, held \nthat \u201cindependent of some positive provision to the \ncontrary, no judgment could be rendered in the circuit \ncourt against any person, upon whom process could \nnot be personally served within the district.\u201d 19 F. \nCas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828). Even aliens \nwithout property in the United States would be \nconstitutionally \u201camenable to the jurisdiction of any \ncircuit court.\u201d Id. If Congress passed a statute \nauthorizing jurisdiction, \u201ca subject of England, or \nFrance, or Russia, having a controversy with one of \nour own citizens, may be summoned from the other \nend of the globe to obey our process, and submit to the \njudgment of our courts.\u201d Id. \u201cIf Congress had \nprescribed such a rule, the court would certainly be \nbound to follow it, and proceed upon the law,\u201d id. at \n615, even though such a rule would be \u201crepugnant to \nthe general rights and sovereignty of other nations,\u201d \nid. at 613. \nThis Court later adopted Story\u2019s logic in Toland v. \nSprague, which held that an American plaintiff \nattaching the American property of a foreign \n\n12 \n \n \n \ndefendant was \u201cunjust\u201d and unauthorized by statute. \n37 U.S. (12 Pet.) 300, 328\u201329 (1838). Accepting the \n\u201cgreat force\u201d of the reasoning in Picquet, this Court \nexplained that it reached this conclusion only \n\u201cindependent[] \nof \npositive \nlegislation\u201d \nbecause \n\u201cCongress might have authorized civil process from \nany circuit court, to have run into any state of the \nUnion,\u201d even for \u201cpersons in a foreign jurisdiction.\u201d Id. \nat 328, 330. \nThis early caselaw tracks the contemporary \nunderstanding that \u201cdue process\u201d meant adherence to \nthe \u201claw of the land\u201d as decided by the legislature. \nWriting just five years after Picquet, Justice Story \nnoted that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \nderived from \u201cthe language of magna charta, \u2018nec \nsuper eum ibimus, nec super eum mittimus, nisi per \nlegale juciium parium suorum, vel per legem terrae,\u2019 \nneither will we pass upon him, or condemn him, but \nby the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the law of \nthe land.\u201d 3 Joseph Story, Commentaries on the \nConstitution of the United States \u00a7 1783 (Hillard, Gray \n& Co. 1833) (emphasis added).4 And \u201claw of the land\u201d \nmeant the rules crafted by the legislature: \u201cthe law of \nthe land \u2026 depends not upon the arbitrary will of any \njudge; but is permanent, fixed, and unchangeable, \nunless by authority of parliament.\u201d 1 William \n \n4 See also Alexander Hamilton, A Letter from Phocion to the \nConsiderate Citizens of New York (Jan. 1784), reprinted in 3 The \nPapers of Alexander Hamilton 485, 485\u201386 (Harold C. Syrett & \nJacob E. Cooke eds., 1962) (noting that \u201cif we enquire what is \nmeant by the law of the land, the best commentators will tell us \nthat it means due process of law\u201d) (citing 2 Edward Coke, \nInstitutes of the Lawes of England 50 (1642)). \n\n13 \n \n \n \nBlackstone, Commentaries on the Laws of England \n*141\u201342 (1753) (emphasis added). \nAlso telling is the absence of early rulings applying \nthe Fifth Amendment to personal jurisdiction \ndisputes. It was \u201cnot until the Civil War [that] a single \ncourt, state or federal, [would] hold a personal-\njurisdiction statute invalid on due process grounds.\u201d \nSachs, supra, at 1712. \nThere is also a solid logical reason why the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause would not impose \nthe same limits on federal court as the International \nShoe line of cases does on state courts via the \nFourteenth Amendment. Congress, unlike States, can \nlegislate beyond its borders. If Congress can regulate \nconduct beyond the United States, why can\u2019t it also \ntake the lesser step of subjecting foreign entities to \npersonal jurisdiction? Congress already routinely does \nso. Several securities statutes give the federal courts \njurisdiction over claims related to \u201cconduct occurring \noutside the United States that has a foreseeable \nsubstantial effect within the United States,\u201d while \nsimultaneously authorizing nationwide service and \npersonal jurisdiction. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 77v(c), 78aa(b); \n80a-43. Other statutes even allow for worldwide \nservice. See id. \u00a7 22. \nCiting this record, judges across the country have \nreasoned that the Fifth Amendment simply does not \ncontain the same sort of personal jurisdiction \nprotections as the Fourteenth Amendment. See \nPet.App.254\u201355a (Menashi, J., dissenting from the \ndenial of rehearing); Lewis v. Mutond, 62 F.4th 587, \n598 (D.C. Cir. 2023) (Rao, J., concurring); Douglass, \n\n14 \n \n \n \n46 F.4th at 255 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (Elrod, J., \ndissenting); id. at 282 (Higginson, J., dissenting); id. \nat 284 (Oldham, J., dissenting); Devas Multimedia \nPriv. Ltd. v. Antrix Corp., 91 F.4th 1340, 1352 (9th \nCir. 2024) (Bumatay, J., dissenting from the denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nRegardless of how the Court has construed the \nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause in the \ncontext of challenges to personal jurisdiction, the Fifth \nAmendment \nshould \nnot \nrender \nthe \nPSJVTA \nunconstitutional. \nB. \nForeign Entities in Particular Are \nSubject to Whatever Procedural \nRules the Legislature Imposes. \nForeign entities like Respondents are particularly \nunlikely to possess personal-jurisdiction rights \narising from the Constitution. \nTake foreign nation-states, for example. Despite \nbeing sovereigns, they lack constitutional due process \nrights altogether\u2014and thus personal jurisdiction \nrights\u2014because they are not \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of \nthe Fifth or Fourteenth Amendments. Pet.App.238a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing); \nsee, e.g., Frontera Res. Azerbaijan Corp. v. State Oil \nCo. of Azerbaijan Republic, 582 F.3d 393, 400 (2d Cir. \n2009). \nIt would be nonsensical to say that foreign \nunincorporated entities (like Respondents) receive \ngreater constitutional due process protections than \nforeign sovereigns themselves receive. Such entities, \njust like \u201cforeign State[s]\u201d themselves, \u201clie[] outside \n\n15 \n \n \n \nthe structure of the Union.\u201d Principality of Monaco v. \nMississippi, 292 U.S. 313, 330 (1934). And all the \nmore so when one of Respondents already claims to be \na sovereign government. See Pet.App.238a (Menashi, \nJ., dissenting from the denial of rehearing); see also \nUnited States v. Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. 632, 652 \n(1950).5 \nIn the nineteenth century, courts repeatedly held \nthat foreign corporations were subject to whatever \nprocedural rules had been imposed by the state in \nwhich the corporation operated. See, e.g., Paul v. \nVirginia, 75 U.S. 168, 181 (1868); Lafayette Ins. Co. v. \nFrench, 59 U.S. (18 How.) 404, 404\u201307 (1855). Of \ncourse, \u201cforeign\u201d in that context usually meant \nincorporated in a different state within the United \nStates, see Mallory, 600 U.S. at 129, but the treatment \nis informative. An entity operating in a particular \nstate had to abide by whatever procedural rules it \nimposed, or else it could cease operating there. It \nmakes sense that the same rule would apply here: \nentities formed outside the United States have to \ncomply with whatever procedural rules the federal \ngovernment itself imposes. The alternative\u2014which \nwas spelled out in the PSJVTA\u2014was to cease \noperating here. Respondents declined and thus are \n \n5 According to Justice Jackson, \u201ccorporations can claim no \nequality with individuals in the enjoyment of a right to privacy. \nThey are endowed with public attributes. They have a collective \nimpact upon society, from which they derive the privilege of \nacting as artificial entities. The Federal Government allows \nthem the privilege of engaging in interstate commerce. Favors \nfrom government often carry with them an enhanced measure of \nregulation.\u201d Morton Salt Co., 338 U.S. at 652. \n\n16 \n \n \n \nsubject to personal jurisdiction in the courts of the \nUnited States. \nIII. \nAffirming the Decision Below Would \nCause Serious Harms to National Security \nand Americans\u2019 Safety. \nAs Judge Menashi noted in his dissent below, \n\u201c[i]nvalidating an act of Congress is \u2018the gravest and \nmost delicate duty that [a federal court] is called on to \nperform.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.230a (quoting Blodgett v. Holden, \n275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927)). And even graver and more \ndelicate is invalidating a federal law addressing \u201ca \nmatter of foreign policy,\u201d Bank Markazi v. Peterson, \n578 U.S. 212, 215 (2016), which is \u201cdelicate, complex, \nand involve[s] large elements of prophecy for which \nthe Judiciary has neither aptitude, facilities, nor \nresponsibility,\u201d Hernandez v. Mesa, 589 U.S. 93, 113 \n(2020) (cleaned up). \nHere, in response to a serious national security \nand foreign policy threat, and taking into account the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s rulings on prior statutes seeking to \nhold Respondents accountable, Congress and the \nPresident enacted a law crafting a very specific \nsolution to enable American victims and their families \nto obtain justice and to strengthen deterrence by \nimposing financial consequences on those who \ncommit, support, and facilitate Palestinian terrorism. \nAccord Holder, 561 U.S. at 32\u201333. \nBut if even that narrow provision is unenforceable, \nPlaintiffs will likely be unable ever to seek any \nmeasure of justice for Respondents\u2019 crimes, not only \nletting them off the hook but further emboldening \nthem. \n\n17 \n \n \n \nThe facts in one of the cases below are instructive. \n\u201c[W]ith respect to Hamas\u2019s bombing of the Hebrew \nUniversity in Jerusalem on July 31, 2002, the jury \nfound that the defendants \u2018knowingly provided \nmaterial support or resources that were used in \npreparation for or in carrying out this attack\u2019; that \u2018an \nemployee of the PA, acting within the scope of his \nemployment and in furtherance of the activities of the \nPA, either carried out, or knowingly provided material \nsupport,\u2019 for the attack; that both the PLO and the PA \nknowingly provided material support to Hamas \nfollowing its designation as a foreign terrorist \norganization; and that both defendants \u2018harbored or \nconcealed a person who the [defendants] knew, or had \nreasonable grounds to believe, committed or was \nabout to commit this attack.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.234a n.4 \n(Menashi, J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing) \n(quoting Jury Verdict Form at 5\u20136, Sokolow v. PLO, \nNo. 04-CV-00397 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 25, 2015), ECF No. \n825). \nBut the Second Circuit has never allowed the \nPSJVTA to go into effect, and unsurprisingly \nRespondents have not been deterred. On October 7, \n2023, Hamas committed its most appalling act of \nterrorism yet, slaughtering \u201c1,200 men, women, and \nchildren \u2013 including 46 Americans and citizens of \nmore than 30 countries\u201d and taking \u201c254 people \nhostage \u2013 including 12 Americans.\u201d Matthew Miller, \nDepartment Press Briefing \u2013 October 7, 2024, Dep\u2019t of \nState (Oct. 7, 2024), https://2021-2025.state.gov/\nbriefings/department-press-briefing-october-7-2024/. \nEven after the horror of October 7, Respondents \ncontinue to support terrorism. As part of its \u201cmartyr\u201d \n\n18 \n \n \n \npayments to terrorists killed or imprisoned in their \nefforts to kill Jews, the PA is currently paying salaries \nto at least 661 Hamas terrorists involved in the \nOctober 7 attacks. Editorial Board, Palestinian \u2018Pay \nfor Slay\u2019 Keeps Growing, Wall St. J. (Jan. 15, 2024), \nhttps://www.wsj.com/articles/palestinian-pay-for-\nslay-hamas-oct-7-israel-gaza-antony-blinken-\nramallah-2dce9a22. \nAs noted in the Interest of Amicus section above, \nAmerica First Legal represents the family of Taylor \nForce, who was murdered by a Palestinian terrorist \nwhose family now receives a monthly payout as \nreward. See also Am. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1-9, 18\u201334, 57\u201372, \n98\u2013101, Jackson v. Biden, No. 2:22-cv-241 (N.D. Tex. \nMar. 25, 2024).   \nCongress \nrightfully \nrecognized \nthat \n\u201call \ncontributions to foreign terrorist organizations \nfurther their terrorism,\u201d and thus the only way to \nobtain some measure of deterrence is to go after the \nmoney, which is precisely what the PSJVTA allows. \nHolder, 561 U.S. at 33. \n\u201c[B]ased on Israel Defense Forces estimates of \nenemy casualties and prisoners, the PA has put itself \non the hook for more than $97 million in such \npayments for more than 13,000 Hamas terrorists in \nthe year following Oct. 7.\u201d Andrew Tobin, Palestinian \nAuthority, Key to Biden\u2019s Mideast Peace Plan, \nCommits to Pay $97M a Year to Hamas, Wash. Free \nBeacon \n(Mar. \n4, \n2024), \nhttps://freebeacon.com/\nnational-security/palestinian-authority-key-to-\nbidens-mideast-peace-plan-commits-to-pay-97m-a-\nyear-to-hamas/. \n\n19 \n \n \n \nEven before these latest atrocities, Congress and \nthe President reasonably concluded that enough is \nenough. Judicial deference to that political foreign \npolicy solution is particularly appropriate, yet the \ndecision below risks \u201cupsetting the delicate web of \ninternational relations\u201d on an international policy \nissue of the greatest magnitude. Hernandez, 589 U.S. \nat 113. \nThe unavailability of civil relief could very well \nlead to more dramatic action against the PA and the \nPLO. Congress has previously authorized the use of \nmilitary force against those who have committed acts \nof \nterrorism \nagainst \nAmericans, \nsee, \ne.g., \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force, Pub. L. No. \n107-40, 115 Stat. 224 (2001), and the President has \nalso taken military action against terrorists, see, e.g., \nNotice on the Legal and Policy Frameworks Guiding \nthe United States\u2019 Use of Military Force and Related \nNational \nSecurity \nOperations \n1 \n(2020), \nhttps://www.documentcloud.org/documents/6776446-\nSection-1264-NDAA-Notice/. \nThe Due Process Clause would impose no barrier \nagainst those more drastic actions. Indeed, as Judge \nMenashi noted below in dissent, there is no \nconstitutional question that the federal government \ncould have criminalized certain terrorist offenses and \nsupport for Respondents, sanctioned them, and even \nused unrestricted military force against them. \nPet.App.262\u201365a (Menashi, J., dissenting from the \ndenial of rehearing) (citing constitutional and \nstatutory authorities for these actions). \n\n20 \n \n \n \n\u201cIt does not make sense to conclude that \n[Respondents] \u2026 have an inviolable liberty interest in \navoiding a civil suit in federal court\u201d when they could \nbe criminalized, sanctioned, and bombed for \u201cthe \nsame\u201d underlying conduct.

Rev. \n1703 (2020) ..................................... 16, 17, 19-21 \n\nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe U.S. House of Representatives (House)2 has a \ncompelling institutional interest in preserving its \nconstitutional authority to legislate effectively to \nprotect American citizens while they are abroad.  In \nthe Anti-Terrorism Act of 1992 (ATA), Congress \nprovided a civil remedy to any U.S. national injured by \nan act of international terrorism.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2333(a).  \nAnd in the Promoting Security and Justice for Victims \nof Terrorism Act of 2019 (PSJVTA), Pub. L. No. 116-94, \ndiv. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903, 133 Stat. 2534, 3082-85 (codified at \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)), Congress responded to an earlier \nSecond Circuit decision by expressly providing federal \ncourts with personal jurisdiction over defendants in \nATA cases under specific circumstances.  Petitioners\u2014\nvictims of terrorist attacks committed, directed, or incited \nby the Palestinian Authority (PA) and the Palestine \nLiberation Organization (PLO)\u2014are precisely whom \nCongress intended the ATA and PSJVTA to benefit. \n \n1 Consistent with Supreme Court Rule 37.6, the House states \nthat no counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part \nand that no person or entity other than the House or its counsel \nmade a monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation \nor submission of this brief.  Consistent with Supreme Court Rule \n37.2, the House states that counsel for the parties received timely \nnotice of intent to file this brief. \n2 The House\u2019s Bipartisan Legal Advisory Group (BLAG) \nunanimously authorized the filing of this amicus brief.  BLAG \ncomprises the Honorable Mike Johnson, Speaker of the House, \nthe Honorable Steve Scalise, Majority Leader, the Honorable Tom \nEmmer, Majority Whip, the Honorable Hakeem Jeffries, Minority \nLeader, and the Honorable Katherine Clark, Minority Whip, and \nit \u201cspeaks for, and articulates the institutional position of, the \nHouse in all litigation matters.\u201d  Rule II.8(b), Rules of the U.S. \nHouse of Representatives, 118th Cong. (2023), https://perma.cc/ \nDK3P-55K6. \n\n2 \nThe Second Circuit, however, held below that the \nPSJVTA violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause.  Pet. App. 6a.  That decision is the latest in a \nseries of Second Circuit decisions that, by depriving \nfederal courts of personal jurisdiction over interna-\ntional terrorists in most circumstances, frustrates \nCongress\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism.  The decision \nbelow also improperly cabins Congress\u2019s broad consti-\ntutional authority to legislate extraterritorially to protect \nU.S. interests, threatening to undermine numerous \nother federal statutes. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThe Court should grant certiorari to review the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s highly consequential and deeply \nproblematic decision.  \nThis Court\u2019s intervention is necessary: the decision \nbelow held that a federal statute (the PSJVTA) is \nfacially unconstitutional and is the third time that the \nSecond Circuit has hollowed out the ATA by concluding \nthat federal courts may exercise personal jurisdiction \nover foreign terrorists only in rare circumstances.  \nCongress has already enacted two laws to address \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s damaging decisions to no avail.  \nSee Anti-Terrorism Clarification Act of 2018 (ATCA), \nPub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4, 132 Stat. 3183, 1384-85; \nPSJVTA, \u00a7 903.  If this latest ruling is allowed to stand, \nAmerican victims of international terrorism will be \nunlikely to get their day in court, and foreign terrorists \nwill not need to worry about civil judgments draining \ntheir resources.  Yet these are the exact policy objec-\ntives that Congress has consistently attempted to \nadvance in the ATA, ATCA, and PSJVTA.  Given the \nimportant interests at stake, this Court should end \nthe back-and-forth between Congress and the Second \nCircuit and definitively resolve whether the Fifth \n\n3 \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause precludes Congress \nfrom providing an effective civil remedy to American \nvictims of foreign terrorist attacks. \nOn the merits, the decision below made errors that \ncreate uncertainty and call other federal statutes into \nquestion.  By incorrectly treating Respondents as \n\u201cpersons\u201d under the Fifth Amendment, it gives these \nde facto governments more constitutional rights than \nboth state governments and foreign governments \nrecognized by the Executive Branch, which are not \nprotected by the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause.  It then compounds that error by importing \npersonal jurisdiction restrictions from the Fourteenth \nAmendment into the Fifth Amendment.  But that \nmove is inconsistent with the original meaning of the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which does \nnot constrain Congress\u2019s ability to subject foreign \ndefendants to the jurisdiction of federal courts.  This \nmakes sense because the Fourteenth Amendment \nrestricts state courts, and states generally have little \npower to legislate beyond their borders.  Congress, by \ncontrast, has sweeping constitutional authority to do \nso.  The Court should grant the petition and correct \nthese errors. \nARGUMENT \nI. The decision below invalidated a federal \nstatute and warrants review \nThis Court should grant review because the decision \nbelow facially invalidated a federal statute and is the \nlatest in a line of Second Circuit decisions that sub-\nstantially undermines Congress\u2019s efforts to combat \ninternational terrorism.  Congress has twice attempted \nunsuccessfully to address the Second Circuit\u2019s concerns, \nand it is now time for this Court to step in and provide \n\n4 \nguidance.  After all, the decision below impairs Congress\u2019s \nability to legislate extraterritorially to deter terrorism \nand to advance many other important objectives.     \nA. The Second Circuit held that a federal \nstatute that furthers important national \nsecurity and foreign policy interests is \nfacially unconstitutional \nWhen a lower court invalidates a federal statute, \nthis Court typically grants certiorari because of the \ngravity of the case.  See Iancu v. Brunetti, 588 U.S. 388, \n392 (2019).  This is true even absent a circuit split.  See, \ne.g., Saenz v. Roe, 526 U.S. 489, 498 (1999) (\u201cAlthough \nthe decision of the Court of Appeals is consistent with \nthe views of other federal courts that have addressed \nthe issue, we granted certiorari because of the importance \nof the case.\u201d  (footnote and citation omitted)).  Indeed, \ndeclaring a statute unconstitutional is the \u201cgravest \nand most delicate duty that this Court is called on to \nperform.\u201d  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927).  \nConsequently, the Court has a heightened obligation \n\u201cto review the exercise of the grave power of annulling \nan Act of Congress.\u201d  United States v. Gainey, 380 U.S. \n63, 65 (1965) (citation omitted). \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s facial invalidation of a federal \nstatute alone justifies this Court\u2019s review.  But the \nimportant interests at stake\u2014compensating American \nvictims of international terrorism and deterring \nterrorists\u2014and the Second Circuit\u2019s repeated attempts \nto stymie a series of Congressional efforts to advance \nthese vital interests heighten the need for review here.  \nSee, e.g., Christopher v. Harbury, 536 U.S. 403, 412 \n(2002) (granting certiorari \u201cbecause of the importance \nof th[e] issue to the Government in its conduct of the \nNation\u2019s foreign affairs\u201d).  \n\n5 \nAs part of its broad authority over foreign affairs, see \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cls. 3, 10, Congress has decided \nit is in the national security and foreign policy interests \nof the United States to permit American victims of \ninternational terrorism to seek compensation from \nterrorists in federal courts.   \nOver thirty years ago, Congress overwhelmingly \npassed the ATA, which has been called \u201can important \ninstrument in the fight against terrorism\u201d and in \nthe effort to provide relief to American victims of \ninternational terrorism.  See Antiterrorism Act of 1991: \nHearing on H.R. 2222 Before the Subcomm. on Intell. \nProp. & Jud. Admin. of the H. Comm. on the Judiciary, \n102d Cong. 10 (1992) (letter from Sen. Grassley).  \nThrough the ATA\u2019s provisions for damages and broad \nliability \u201cat any point along the causal chain of terror-\nism,\u201d Congress intended to \u201cinterrupt, or at least imperil, \nthe flow of money\u201d to international terrorists.  S. Rep. \nNo. 102-342, at 22 (1992).  In other words, Congress \nenacted the ATA to strike at \u201cthe resource that keeps \n[terrorists] in business\u2014their money.\u201d  138 Cong. Rec. \n33629 (Oct. 7, 1992) (statement of Sen. Grassley). \nFor nearly a quarter century, courts exercised \npersonal jurisdiction over Respondents in ATA cases.  \nHowever, in 2016, the Second Circuit held that the due \nprocess analysis for personal jurisdiction is \u201cbasically \nthe same under both the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments.\u201d  Pet. App. 156a.  Thus, federal courts \ncould not exercise personal jurisdiction over interna-\ntional terrorists, unless those terrorists were \u201cat home\u201d \nin the United States, \u201cexpressly aimed\u201d their attacks \nat the United States, or had sufficient \u201csuit-related \nconduct\u201d within the United States.  Id. at 157a-182a \n(alteration and citation omitted).  This decision \ndramatically limited the ATA\u2019s extraterritorial reach.   \n\n6 \nIn direct response to that \u201cflawed\u201d decision, H. Rep. \nNo. 115-858, at 6-8 (2018), Congress overwhelmingly \npassed the ATCA.  Congress, through the ATCA, \nintended to improve the ATA, including by addressing \n\u201clower court decisions that have allowed entities that \nsponsor terrorist activity against U.S. nationals overseas \nto avoid\u201d federal court jurisdiction.  Id. at 3.  It \nprovided that a defendant \u201cshall be deemed to have \nconsented to personal jurisdiction\u201d in ATA cases if, \nmore than 120 days after enactment, it accepted certain \n\u201cform[s] of assistance\u201d or maintained an office within \nthe United States while \u201cbenefiting from a waiver or \nsuspension of\u201d a federal law that forbids the PLO and \nits constituent groups from operating such an office.  \nPub. L. No. 115-253, \u00a7 4.  By enacting the ATCA, \nCongress sought \u201cto halt, deter, and disrupt interna-\ntional terrorism and to compensate U.S. victims of \ninternational terrorism.\u201d  H. Rep. No. 115-858, at 7-8.   \nHowever, the ATCA did not have its intended effect \nbecause the Second Circuit held that neither of the \nATCA\u2019s factual predicates were satisfied here.  Pet. \nApp. 132a.  Thus, the legislation had no impact on \nfederal courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction over Respondents.   \nCongress then enacted the PSJVTA in another \nattempt to give American victims of international \nterrorism their day in federal court.  165 Cong. Rec. \nS7182 (daily ed. Dec. 19, 2019) (statements of Sens. \nLankford and Grassley).  The PSJVTA provided \nRespondents a choice.  They would be deemed to \nconsent to personal jurisdiction in ATA cases if they \ncontinued their \u201cpay to slay\u201d policies, see 18 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A), where they \u201cpay terrorists or families \nof terrorists who injured or killed Americans,\u201d which \nare \u201cnothing short of an incitement for further acts of \nterrorism,\u201d 165 Cong. Rec. S7183 (daily ed. Dec. 19, \n\n7 \n2019) (statement of Sen. Grassley).  Likewise, Re-\nspondents would be deemed to consent to personal \njurisdiction in such cases if they conducted certain \nactivities in the United States, such as maintaining an \noffice, see 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B), unless a statutory \nexception applied, see id. \u00a7 2334(e)(3).  Congress thus \ncarefully crafted the PSJVTA to balance a host of \nforeign policy and national security interests. \nThe Second Circuit, however, has once again frus-\ntrated Congressional efforts to combat terrorism.  In \nthis latest decision, it held that the PSJVTA\u2019s \u201cdeemed \nconsent\u201d provision violates the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause.  Pet. App. 45a.  It explained that \nconsent may be implied through litigation-related \nconduct or another arrangement that shows a reciprocal \nbargain.  See id. at 20a.  The PSJVTA, according to the \nSecond Circuit, was not one such arrangement because, \nin its view, Respondents received no government benefit \nfrom the statute.  Id. at 21a, 25a-28a.   \nThe time has arrived for this Court to weigh in on \nthis matter.  The interests at stake are momentous.  \nSee Holder v. Humanitarian L. Project, 561 U.S. 1, 28, \n35 (2010) (noting \u201ccombatting terrorism is an urgent \nobjective of the highest order\u201d); Gamble v. United \nStates, 587 U.S. 678, 687 (2019) (holding that the \n\u201cmurder of a U.S. national is an offense to the United \nStates as much as it is to the country where the \nmurder occurred\u201d).  And Congress has done what it can \nto address this problem.  Congress has now enacted \ntwo statutes (the ATCA and PSJVTA) on a widely \nbipartisan basis to address Second Circuit decisions \ndramatically curtailing the reach and effectiveness \nof the ATA.  But due to subsequent Second Circuit \ndecisions, neither statute has fixed the problem. \n\n8 \nThe ping-pong between Congress and the Second \nCircuit has gone on long enough.  If the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause precludes Congress from \nproviding American victims of international terrorism \nan effective civil remedy in most circumstances, \nthis Court should be the one to say so.  Conversely, if \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does not \nrestrict Congress\u2019s ability to subject Respondents to \nthe jurisdiction of the federal courts in ATA cases, as \nthe House believes, this Court should grant review and \nreverse the Second Circuit\u2019s judgment.   \nB. The \ndecision \nbelow \nundermines \nCongress\u2019s \nbroad \npower \nto \nlegislate \nextraterritorially and injects uncertainty \ninto the legislative process \nCongress\u2019s extraterritorial legislative efforts extend \nwell beyond its interests in combatting terrorism and \ncompensating terrorist victims.  Congress has enacted \nstatutes that apply extraterritorially in numerous areas: \nantitrust, copyright, securities regulation, trademark, \ncorporate law and governance, bankruptcy and tax, \ncriminal, environmental, civil rights, and labor laws.  \nSee Austen L. Parrish, Evading Legislative Jurisdiction, \n87 Notre Dame L. Rev. 1673, 1707 n.6 (2012) (citation \nomitted).  The decision below thus interferes with \nCongress\u2019s constitutional authority to legislate extra-\nterritorially not only to combat terrorism but to \nadvance American interests in many other contexts. \n1.  The decision below effectively shrinks Congress\u2019s \npower to legislate extraterritorially to that of a state \nlegislature, which has little to no power to do so.  The \nSecond Circuit held that Congress\u2019s ability to authorize \npersonal jurisdiction\u2014which courts need to decide \ncases brought under an extraterritorial law\u2014is restricted \nin \u201cbasically the same\u201d way as that of a state legislature.  \n\n9 \nSee Pet. App. 17a, 47a-49a (citation omitted).  Those \nrestrictions on states \u201care a consequence of territorial \nlimitations on the[ir] power.\u201d  See Bristol-Myers Squibb \nCo. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 263 (2017) \n(citation omitted).  By imposing a corresponding terri-\ntorial limit on Congress, the decision below severely \nrestricts federal courts from exercising jurisdiction \nover disputes that stem from any acts committed \noutside the United States.  But the whole purpose of \nextraterritorial legislation is to reach conduct outside \nthe United States.  This cabining of jurisdiction thus \nblunts Congress\u2019s power to legislate extraterritorially.  \nCf. Personal Jurisdiction\u2014General Jurisdiction\u2014\nConsent-by-Registration Statutes\u2014International Shoe \nand Its Progeny\u2014Mallory v. Norfolk Southern Railway \nCo., 137 Harv. L. Rev. 360, 368 (2023) (\u201cThe courts of \nappeals have tended to gut the applicability of \u2026 \nfederal statutes [that create extraterritorial causes of \naction and authorize personal jurisdiction without \ntying it to state long-arm statutes, as the ATA does,] \nby limiting the territorial reach of federal courts \u2026.\u201d). \nHere is why.  The court below held that courts must \nhave (a) general personal jurisdiction, meaning the \ndefendant is at home in the United States, (b) specific \npersonal jurisdiction, meaning the defendant engages \nin conduct in the United States that is related to the \nunderlying lawsuit, or (c) the defendant\u2019s voluntary \nagreement to proceed in the forum, meaning the \ndefendant\u2019s consent.  See Pet. App. 17a-19a.  These \nwill usually not supply jurisdiction when the injury-\ncausing conduct\u2014presumably caused by a foreign \nactor\u2014takes place outside the United States. \nGeneral personal jurisdiction\u2014which requires a \ndefendant to have certain contacts with the United \nStates\u2014will almost never allow a court to exercise \n\n10 \npersonal jurisdiction over a foreign actor who harms \nan American abroad.  See Douglass v. Nippon Yusen \nKabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 276 (5th Cir. 2022) \n(Elrod, J., dissenting) (explaining that foreign defendants \nwill \u201c[r]arely\u201d be at home in the United States, so a \ncourt exercising general personal jurisdiction over a \nforeign defendant is \u201can \u2018exceptional case\u2019 very seldom \nencountered in real life\u201d (citation omitted)), cert. denied \nsub nom. Douglass v. Kaisha, 143 S. Ct. 1021 (2023).  \nLikewise, it is hard to imagine specific personal juris-\ndiction faring much better when dealing with foreign \nactors who injure Americans abroad.  This is because \nthose foreign actors would need to have litigation-\nrelevant contacts with the United States.  See Pet. App. \n8a-9a (noting no specific personal jurisdiction when \nterrorist attacks took place outside the country). \nAs one academic put it, the requirements of general \nand specific personal jurisdiction (as set out in this \nCourt\u2019s Fourteenth Amendment precedent and applied \nby some lower courts in the Fifth Amendment context) \n\u201chave had the effect of neutering numerous federal \nstatutory causes of action, including the federal \nstatutory cause of action created by Congress under \nthe ATA.\u201d  See Aaron D. Simowitz, Federal Personal \nJurisdiction and Constitutional Authority, 56 N.Y.U. J. \nInt\u2019l L. & Pol. 345, 349 (2023); see also Douglass, 46 \nF.4th at 277 (Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201cApplying Bristol-\nMyers\u2019s forum-injury requirement would squelch \nfederal courts\u2019 exercise of specific jurisdiction over \nAmerican injuries sustained abroad, just as Daimler\u2019s \n\u2018at home\u2019 test would squash federal courts\u2019 exercise of \ngeneral jurisdiction over foreign corporate defendants \ndoing substantial, considerable business in the United \nStates.\u201d).  This increases Congress\u2019s need to rely \non consent statutes like the PSJVTA.  Cf. Simowitz, \nsupra, at 349 (arguing the PSJVTA was necessary \n\n11 \nbecause \u201cboth general and specific jurisdiction\u201d had \n\u201crepeatedly [been] narrow[ed]\u201d). \nBut the decision below hamstrings Congress\u2019s \nability to rely on even consent statutes.  Congress \ncannot, according to the court below, treat certain \nactions that affect the United States as a party\u2019s \nconsent to personal jurisdiction, even if the party was \non notice and continued to engage in that conduct.  \nRather, Congress must provide a would-be defendant \nwith a reciprocal benefit or otherwise concoct a \n\u201creciprocal bargain.\u201d  See Pet. App. 23a-24a.3  But Con-\ngress may be (understandably) reluctant to provide \nwould-be foreign defendants, such as groups that \nengage in or support terrorism, with a benefit.  The \ndecision below thus complicates Congress\u2019s ability to \nuse a consent statute. \nIn sum, the decision below hampers Congress\u2019s \nability to combat terrorism and to \u201cright the most \ngrievous wrongs committed against Americans abroad.\u201d  \nSee Douglass, 46 F.4th at 278-79 (Elrod, J., dissenting).  \nIt likewise undermines Congress\u2019s ability to legislate \nextraterritorially in other areas.  It thus warrants this \nCourt\u2019s supervisory review. \n2.  The decision below also injects uncertainty into \nthe legislative process and casts doubt on the extra-\nterritorial reach of statutes that Congress has enacted \nto advance U.S. policy.  It is currently unclear if the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s due process requirements constrain \nCongress\u2019s ability to legislate extraterritorially.  Congress \nthus has a strong interest in obtaining clarification \nfrom this Court to guide its ongoing legislative efforts.  \n \n3 Certain litigation-related conduct may also amount to con-\nsent, id. at 22a-23a, but Congress, of course, has no control over \nthat. \n\n12 \nThe Court should take this opportunity to resolve the \nambiguity the decision below amplifies, thereby \u201cpre-\nserving a stable background against which Congress \ncan legislate with predictable effects.\u201d  Morrison v. \nNat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 261 (2010). \nCongress is not the only one that needs guidance: so \ndo the lower courts.  Indeed, some lower courts, lacking \nclarity from this Court, have applied the Fourteenth \nAmendment\u2019s restrictions on personal jurisdiction to \nthe Fifth Amendment and thus limited the application \nand enforcement of other existing federal laws.  See, \ne.g., United States ex rel. TZAC, Inc. v. Christian Aid, \nNo. 21-1542, 2022 WL 2165751, at *2 (2d Cir. June 16, \n2022) (False Claims Act); Douglass, 46 F.4th at 231, \n241-43 (Death on the High Seas Act); Herederos de \nRoberto Gomez Cabrera, LLC v. Teck Res. Ltd., 43 F.4th \n1303, 1307-8 (11th Cir. 2022) (Helms-Burton Act). \nIf the Fifth Amendment restricts Congress\u2019s ability \nto legislate extraterritorially in an effective manner, \nthis Court should be the one to say so. \nII. The decision below wrongly held that the \nPSJVTA is inconsistent with the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \nThe court below wrongly held that Respondents, \nwhich hold themselves out as governing entities, have \nrights under the Fifth Amendment, even though state \ngovernments and recognized foreign governments \ndo not.  It also held that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \nrestrictions on personal jurisdiction apply in the Fifth \nAmendment context.  That conclusion finds no support \nin the original public meaning of the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  And it treats Congress, \nwhich has sweeping authority to legislate extraterrito-\nrially, like a state legislature, which has almost none. \n\n13 \nA. Respondents are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to \nrights under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause \nAs an initial matter, the PSJVTA is constitutional \nbecause neither the PLO nor the PA is a \u201cperson\u201d for \npurposes of the Fifth Amendment.  This Court has long \nheld that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, \nby any reasonable mode of interpretation, be expanded \nto encompass the States of the Union.\u201d  South Carolina \nv. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323-24 (1966), abrogated \nin part on other grounds by Shelby Cnty. v. Holder, 570 \nU.S. 529 (2013).  This is because the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause \u201crecognizes and protects an indi-\nvidual liberty interest.\u201d  Ins. Corp. of Ir. v. Compagnie \ndes Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, 702 (1982). \nAligned with this Court\u2019s precedent, lower federal \ncourts have consistently held that foreign govern-\nments are also not \u201cpersons\u201d for purposes of the Fifth \nAmendment.  See e.g., Price v. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan \nArab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 96 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  \nNeither are municipal governments.  See e.g., City of \nE. St. Louis v. Cir. Ct. for Twentieth Jud. Cir., 986 F.2d \n1142, 1144 (7th Cir. 1993).  That is because for both \nentities, the core concept of due process \u201cto secure the \nindividual from the arbitrary exercise of the powers \nof government,\u201d Cnty. of Sacramento v. Lewis, 523 U.S. \n833, 845-46 (1998), is simply inapplicable. \nThe same is true here for Respondents, which \npurport to function as governments and are thus \nindistinguishable from de jure governments for Fifth \nAmendment purposes.  The United Nations has \nrecognized the PLO as \u201cthe representative of the \nPalestinian people.\u201d  G.A. Res. 3210 (XXIX), at 3 (Oct. \n14, 1974); see also G.A. Res. 3236 (XXIX), at 4 (Nov. 22, \n\n14 \n1974); G.A. Res. 67/19, at 2 (Nov. 29, 2012).  And the PA \nwas established by a treaty between Israel and the \nPLO.  Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho \nArea art. III, May 4, 1994, 33 I.L.M. 622.  Under its \nterms, \u201cIsrael shall transfer authority \u2026 from the Israeli \nmilitary government and its Civil Administration to \nthe [PA], hereby established,\u201d which \u201chas, within its \nauthority, legislative, executive and judicial powers \nand responsibilities.\u201d  Id. arts. III, V.  This transfer of \ngovernment authority by treaty is another indication \nthat Respondents constitute de facto foreign govern-\nments.  See Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations \nLaw \u00a7 201 (1987) (explaining that for states, the gov-\nernment must have \u201cthe capacity to engage in[] formal \nrelations with other such entities\u201d). \nWhile the United States does not recognize \nRespondents as the government of a state, Fifth \nAmendment personhood cannot turn on diplomatic \nrecognition.  For one, while the Executive has the sole \npower of recognition, this \u201cexclusive power extends no \nfurther than [the President\u2019s] formal recognition \ndetermination.\u201d  Zivotofsky ex rel. Zivotofsky v. Kerry, \n576 U.S. 1, 30 (2015).  This makes sense as interpreting \ndue process rights to hinge on diplomatic recognition \n(or rather a lack thereof) would mean the Executive \nalone would be able to strip, and bestow, important \nconstitutional protections on a whim.  Consider how \nPresident Carter switched recognition of the govern-\nment of \u201cChina\u201d from the Republic of China (Taiwan) \nto the People\u2019s Republic of China in the 1970s.4  It \nmakes little sense for an entity\u2019s due process rights  \nto depend on such a turnabout.  \u201cFundamental \n \n4 Joint Communiqu\u00e9 on the Establishment of Diplomatic \nRelations, China.-U.S., Jan. 1, 1979, https://perma.cc/AL65-HMLS. \n\n15 \nconstitutional rights are not typically so contingent.\u201d  \nPet. App. 238a (Menashi, J., dissenting). \nMoreover, as the D.C. Circuit warned when it comes \nto foreign governments: \npractical problems might arise were we to \nhold that foreign states may cloak themselves \nin the protections of the Due Process Clause.  \nFor example, the power of Congress and the \nPresident to freeze the assets of foreign \nnations, or to impose economic sanctions on \nthem, could be challenged as deprivations of \nproperty without due process of law.  The \ncourts would be called upon to adjudicate \nthese sensitive questions, which in turn could \ntie the hands of the other branches as they \nsought to respond to foreign policy crises. \nPrice, 294 F.3d at 99.   \nThese concerns apply with equal force to de facto \ngovernments, especially those that promote or engage \nin terrorism.  For example, not only Respondents, but \npotentially the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n(ISIL), Hamas, or the Houthis, could challenge sanctions \nor restrictions the United States has imposed against \nthem under the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause if they are considered persons.   \nIn short, affording Respondents and other terrorist \nde facto governments greater due process protections \nthan are afforded to recognized foreign governments \nand to the States and municipalities that comprise our \nNation \u201cwould distort the very notion of \u2018liberty\u2019 that \nunderlies the Due Process Clause,\u201d id., and create \nsubstantial practical difficulties.   \n\n16 \nB. The court below wrongly held that the test \nfor personal jurisdiction is the same under \nthe Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments \nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause \nrestricts the ability of state courts to exercise personal \njurisdiction over a nonresident defendant.  See Bristol-\nMyers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 261-62.  But this Court has \n\u201cle[ft] open the question whether the Fifth Amendment \nimposes the same restrictions on the exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction by a federal court.\u201d  Id. at 269.  \nThe court below held\u2014wrongly\u2014that it does.  Pet. App. \n17a, 47a-52a.  The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause, as originally understood, does not restrict \nCongress\u2019s ability to define the jurisdiction of federal \ncourts.  This means that Congress may, consistent with \nthe Fifth Amendment, subject foreign defendants to \nthe personal jurisdiction of federal courts based on \nconduct that occurs outside the United States.  What \nthe Fifth Amendment does is prevent the deprivation \nof a covered person\u2019s life, liberty, or property without a \nlegally valid process.  The PSJVTA, enacted as part of \nCongress\u2019s broad authority to legislate over foreign \naffairs, empowers federal courts to provide Respondents \nwith the very process that would precede any legal \ndeprivation.  Therefore, it complies with the Fifth \nAmendment even if Respondents are persons for \npurposes of the Due Process Clause. \n1.  The text of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause, as understood by Americans around the time \nof its ratification, did not constrain Congress\u2019s ability \nto subject persons located abroad to the jurisdiction of \nfederal courts.  See Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited \nJurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, \n1710 (2020) (\u201c[A]s to the scope of the courts\u2019 territorial \njurisdiction, the [Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process] \n\n17 \nClause has nothing to say.\u201d).  The Clause provides that \n\u201c[n]o person shall \u2026 be deprived of life, liberty, or \nproperty, without due process of law.\u201d  U.S. Const. \namend. V.  As understood by Americans around the \ntime the Fifth Amendment was ratified, this meant \nthat the federal government could not deprive a person \nof certain rights unless the person was first given a \nlegally valid process.  See Max Crema & Lawrence B. \nSolum, The Original Meaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d \nin the Fifth Amendment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, 526 (2022) \n(explaining that this was the understanding of the \nClause before ratification and that \u201cthe available \nevidence suggests\u201d this meaning \u201cpersisted for decades \nfollowing the enactment of the Bill of Rights\u201d).  The \nFounders, who \u201cconsidered themselves inheritors of \nthe English common law,\u201d understood the phrase to \nhave the same well-established meaning that it had \nunder the English common law.  See id. at 484-85; see \nalso id. at 467 (\u201cFrom its first recorded use in the \n1300s through to the Founding era, \u2018due process of law\u2019 \nwas understood to mean a writ or precept authorizing \nthe deprivation of a right or imposing an obligation.\u201d).  \nBoth the original public meaning of the text, and the \nhistorical context in which it was ratified, show this: \nthe federal government may deprive a person of \ncertain rights only after the person receives process \nfrom a court with lawful authority (jurisdiction) to \nprovide it.  See id. at 466. \n2.  Early Congressional practice and judicial precedent \nconfirm that Congress has the authority to empower \nfederal courts with extraterritorial jurisdiction.  So \nlong as it does that, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause \u201chas nothing to say\u201d about the personal \njurisdiction of the federal courts.  See Sachs, supra, \nat 1710; see also id. (\u201c[I]f Congress expands federal \npersonal jurisdiction by statute, \u2026 th[is] policy decision[] \n\n18 \nwouldn\u2019t\u2014and shouldn\u2019t\u2014be hampered by an ever-\nexpanding vision of the Due Process Clause.\u201d).  In \n1789, the First Congress empowered federal courts to \nexercise jurisdiction over crimes committed on the \nhigh seas and over \u201call civil causes of admiralty and \nmaritime jurisdiction \u2026 upon the high seas.\u201d  See \nJudiciary Act of 1789, ch. 20, \u00a7 9, 1 Stat. 76-77.  A few \nyears later, in Talbot v. Jansen, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 133 \n(1795), this Court affirmed an award of civil damages \nin a dispute over an incident that took place on the \nhigh seas.  See id. at 159-60 (opinion of Iredell, J.) \n(explaining \u201c[t]hat \u2026 all piracies and trespasses \ncommitted against the general law of nations, are \nenquirable, and maybe proceeded against, in any \nnation where no special exemption can be maintained, \neither by the general law of nations, or by some treaty \nwhich forbids or restrains it\u201d). \nAnd in Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609 (C.C.D. Mass. \n1828), Justice Story (riding circuit) left little doubt \nabout Congress\u2019s ability to empower courts to exercise \njurisdiction over foreign persons.  There, he explained \nthat, under the default general-law rule, \u201ca court \ncreated within and for a particular territory is bounded in \nthe exercise of its power by the limits of such territory.\u201d  \nId. at 611.  But he was clear that Congress had the \npower to change that default rule with positive \nlegislation.  See id. at 613 (\u201c[I]ndependent of some \npositive provision to the contrary, no judgment could \nbe rendered in the circuit court against any person, \nupon whom process could not be personally served \nwithin the district.\u201d).  Under that positive legislation, \nforeign persons \u201chaving a controversy with one of our \nown citizens[] may be summoned from the other end of \nthe globe to obey our process, and submit to the \njudgment of our courts.\u201d  Id.  And if Congress passed \nsuch legislation, Justice Story explained that \u201cthe \n\n19 \ncourt would certainly be bound to follow it, and \nproceed upon the law.\u201d  Id. at 615.   \nJustice Story ultimately held in Piquet that the \ndefendant, an American citizen living abroad, had not \nbeen properly served.  Id. at 616.  But that turned \nsolely on his conclusion that Congress had not spoken \nclearly enough to overcome the general-law rule that \na court may exercise its authority only in the territory \nwithin which it was created.  See id. at 613 (\u201cSuch an \nintention \u2026 ought not to be presumed, unless it is \nestablished by irresistible proof.  My opinion is, that \ncongress never had any such intention \u2026.\u201d); see also \nDouglass, 46 F.4th at 259 (Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201cIf \nthere were a moment in the opinion to mention any \nlurking Fifth Amendment due process issue, this \nwould have been it.\u201d); Sachs, supra, at 1716 (\u201cIn \ndiscussing these outlandish exercises of jurisdiction, \nJustice Story neither referenced due process as a barrier \nnor invoked any notion of constitutional avoidance.\u201d).  \nThis is consistent with the original public meaning of \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause: that it \n\u201cmerely required lawful process in keeping with the \ncommon law or duly enacted legislation.\u201d  Douglass, 46 \nF.4th at 260 (Elrod, J., dissenting). \nPicquet neither broke new ground nor went unnoticed \nby this Court.  Justice Story \u201cfollow[ed] with undoubt-\ning confidence the \u2026 reasoning\u201d in Ex parte Graham, \n10 F. Cas. 911 (C.C.E.D. Pa. 1818) (No. 5,657).  Picquet, \n19 F. Cas. at 611-12.  There, the court found that a \nPhiladelphia merchant was improperly arrested in \nPennsylvania under process issued by a federal court \nin Rhode Island.  Ex parte Graham, 10 F. Cas. at 911, \n913.  The problem was, again, that Congress had  \nnot empowered the Rhode Island court to exercise \njurisdiction over a nonresident who was not physically \n\n20 \npresent in the judicial district.  See id. at 913 (explain-\ning that in such a situation \u201cthere are difficulties, \nwhich, in the opinion of the court, nothing but an act of \ncongress can remove\u201d).  It was not a due process problem. \nThis Court in Toland v. Sprague, 37 U.S. 300 (1838), \nagreed that Congress has the authority to empower \ncourts to exercise jurisdiction over persons located \nabroad.  This Court described \u201cthe reasoning in [Picquet], \ngenerally, as having great force\u201d and \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with \nit.  Id. at 328.  Like Justice Story in Picquet, this Court \nin Toland agreed that Congress could empower a court \nto exercise jurisdiction over persons located outside its \nterritory (including abroad) but ultimately concluded \nthat Congress had not exercised that authority in that \ncase.  See id. at 330 (\u201cThat independently of positive \nlegislation, the [judicial] process can only be served \nupon persons within the same districts.\u201d).  There was, \nagain, no question that Congress had this authority; it \nsimply had not, in the Court\u2019s view, exercised it. \nIn sum, early Congressional practice and judicial \nprecedent confirm that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause imposes no Fourteenth-Amendment-\nlike restrictions on federal courts\u2019 ability to exercise \npersonal jurisdiction.  See Douglass, 46 F.4th at 262 \n(Elrod, J., dissenting) (\u201c[E]arly American cases show\u2014\nby what they omit\u2014that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause does not restrict Congress\u2019s ability to \nprescribe, by law, the extent to which federal courts \nmay issue process and thereby acquire personal \njurisdiction over even foreign defendants a world \naway.\u201d).  Rather, \u201c[i]n general, Congress can extend the \nfederal courts\u2019 personal jurisdiction as far as it wants.\u201d  \nSachs, supra, at 1729.  This view persisted over the \ndecades following ratification, and \u201cnot until the Civil \nWar did a single court, state or federal, hold a \n\n21 \npersonal-jurisdiction statute invalid on due process \ngrounds.\u201d  See id. at 1712 (citation omitted). \n3.  This reading finds support in the broader \nstructure of the Constitution.  For example, Congress \nhas sweeping authority to legislate extraterritorially.  \nSee, e.g., U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 8, cl. 3 (power to \u201cregulate \nCommerce with foreign Nations\u201d); id. cl. 10 (power to \n\u201cdefine and punish\u201d crimes on the high seas and \n\u201cOffences against the Law of Nations\u201d); see also EEOC \nv. Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991) (\u201cBoth \nparties concede, as they must, that Congress has the \nauthority to enforce its laws beyond the territorial \nboundaries of the United States.\u201d).  But that power \nwould have little effect if courts could not exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over persons located abroad to \nenforce those laws.  Cf. Pet. App. 261a-62a (Menashi, \nJ., dissenting) (\u201cThe authority of Congress to assert \nlegislative power extraterritorially means that the \nfederal courts must have a corresponding power to \nadjudicate disputes concerning its laws.\u201d).  Separately, \nthe Constitution empowers Congress to create the \nlower courts\u2014and to control their jurisdiction\u2014and \nexpressly extends the judicial power to disputes that \noccur outside the United States and disputes that \ninvolve foreign subjects.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7\u00a7 1-\n2.  This context supports the conclusion that the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause does not restrict \nfederal courts\u2019 ability to exercise personal jurisdiction \nover those located abroad. \nThis broader constitutional structure also shows \nwhy the concerns that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \nrestrictions on personal jurisdiction are meant to \naddress have no place in the Fifth Amendment \ncontext.  For example, this Court has explained that \nthe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s restrictions prevent one \n\n22 \nstate from intruding on the sovereignty of another \nstate.  See Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263 (\u201cThe \nsovereignty of each State \u2026 implie[s] a limitation on \nthe sovereignty of all its sister States.\u201d  (alterations in \noriginal) (citation omitted)).  The federal government, \nby contrast, has the constitutional authority to enforce \nfederal laws abroad; there is no analog to the \n\u201cinterstate federalism\u201d at play in the Fourteenth \nAmendment context, see id.  Thus, the Fourteenth \nAmendment\u2019s \u201creasonableness\u201d test, see World-Wide \nVolkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, 444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980), \nwhich \u201crelie[s] on the principles traditionally followed \nby American courts in marking out the territorial \nlimits of each State\u2019s authority,\u201d Burnham v. Super. Ct. \nof Cal., 495 U.S. 604, 609 (1990), has no bearing on the \npersonal jurisdiction of the federal courts. \n*  *  * \nBy expressly vesting the district court with personal \njurisdiction over Respondents, the PSJVTA allows a \nfederal court to provide the legal process that precedes \nany deprivation of liberty or property.  It is thus \nconstitutional even if Respondents are persons for \npurposes of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n23 \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition for a writ of \ncertiorari. \nRespectfully submitted,  \nMATTHEW B.

The decision did so by adopting a \ndefinition of Due Process, and a conception of the territo-\nrial boundaries on Congress\u2019s power to legislate against \nextraterritorial threats, which will severely hamper Con-\ngress\u2019s efforts to combat terrorism. Amici therefore sub-\nmit this brief to urge this Court to reverse this erroneous \nand troubling decision. \nINTRODUCTION AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nFor decades, starving terror networks of funding has \nbeen a central focus of Congress\u2019s national security ef-\nforts, one that has been singularly effective in bringing \nterror sponsors to justice, reducing terrorists\u2019 destructive \ncapabilities, and saving American lives. Private civil ac-\ntions have proven to be an integral component of that \nstrategy. Such suits provide a measure of justice to terror \n\n3 \n \n \nvictims and their families and impose uniquely effective fi-\nnancial pressures on the perpetrators, directors, and \nsponsors of terror.  \nCongress\u2019s enactment of the ATA unlocked private \ncivil lawsuits\u2019 terror-fighting potential, removing many of \nthe jurisdictional barriers that once made it difficult to \nreach terror sponsors like the PLO and PA. And after new \njurisdictional barriers emerged to prevent American \nplaintiffs from haling the PLO and PA into U.S. courts, \nCongress, with input from the Executive Branch, re-\nsponded with new legislation, most recently the Promot-\ning Security and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of \n2019 (PSJVTA), Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903. \nThat act restored the ATA\u2019s full effectiveness against the \nPLO and PA, by declaring their post-enactment presence \nin the United States, and their post-enactment support of \nterrorism, to constitute consent to ATA suits in U.S. \ncourts. But the court of appeals in this case held the \nPSJVTA unconstitutional through a novel and erroneous \ninterpretation of the Due Process clause that disregards \nthe understanding of Congress\u2019s virtually unfettered \npower to legislate against extraterritorial threats that has \npersisted since the founding, and instead subjects Con-\ngress\u2019s powers to even greater territorial restraints than \nthose imposed on the States. \nThis decision effectively eviscerates the ATA\u2014con-\ntravening the considered judgment of Congress, sapping \nstrength from a key component of the Nation\u2019s anti-ter-\nrorism strategy, and dangerously constricting Congress\u2019s \npowers to meet an ever-wider variety of extraterritorial \nthreats. The decision will leave the Political Branches with \nsharply limited options to staunch the continued, admit-\n\n4 \n \n \nted, and unapologetic support of terrorism against Amer-\nican citizens by Respondents, even as those organizations \ncontinue to operate freely on U.S. soil. It will also allow \nRespondents to evade responsibility for past acts of terror \nthat have left scores of Americans dead and scores of fam-\nilies to grieve with no chance at justice. \nThis case therefore raises constitutional questions of \nthe highest order about Congress\u2019s authority to combat \nterrorism, and about whether Due Process Clause protec-\ntions designed to limit the States\u2019 power to encroach on \nthe sovereignty of sister States ought to be applied to shel-\nter foreign terrorists and their sponsors, including those \nwhich maintain a presence in the U.S.  \nThis Court should take this case to reverse the decision \nbelow, remove the barriers preventing the PSJVTA\u2019s con-\nstitutional operation, and confirm Congress\u2019s authority to \ncombat terror occurring outside the borders of the United \nStates where the Political Branches have determined that \nfederal interests require the exercise of such authority. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe lower court has nullified an Act of Congress \nand eviscerated a critical component of \nCongress\u2019s comprehensive anti-terror scheme. \nIn the proceedings below in this case, Judge Menashi, \njoined by Chief Judge Livingston and Judges Sullivan and \nPark, identified this case as having \u201cexceptional im-\nportance.\u201d Pet. App. 232a. That description is entirely ac-\ncurate. The decision below facially invalidates an Act of \nCongress as unconstitutional, which, \u201con its own,\u201d makes \nthis case worthy of immediate review. Id. 233a. This \nCourt\u2019s \u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant certiorari any time \u201ca \nlower court has invalidated a federal statute.\u201d Iancu v. \n\n5 \n \n \nBrunetti, 139 S. Ct. 2294, 2298 (2019). And for that reason \nalone, it would be appropriate for this Court to grant cer-\ntiorari in this case.  \nBut this Court\u2019s review is especially critical because \nthe PSJVTA is not just any federal statute. It is a key com-\nponent of Congress\u2019s comprehensive scheme to protect \nAmericans from being harmed by international terror-\nism\u2014and a key for unlocking the terror-fighting potential \nof another federal statute that had been hobbled by im-\nproper constitutional interpretation: the ATA, Pub. L. \n102\u2013572, tit. X, \u00a7 1003, 106 Stat. 4522-4524  (Oct. 29, 1992) \n(codified as amended at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2331 et seq.). Con-\ngress enacted the ATA to \u201cremove the jurisdictional hur-\ndles in the courts confronting victims [of international ter-\nrorism]\u201d\u2014and to ensure that Respondents (and others \nlike them) can be held accountable for harms they have \ninflicted on innocent Americans abroad. The Antiterror-\nism Act of 1991: Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Intel-\nlectual Property & Judicial Admin. of the H. Comm. on \nthe Judiciary, 102d Cong. 10 (1992) (1992 Hearing) (letter \nfrom Sen. Grassley); 137 Cong. Rec. S4511-04 (1991) \n(statement of Sen. Grassley) (same); 137 Cong. Rec. \nS1771-01 (1991) (statement of Sen. Grassley) (same).  \nYet the decision under review has imposed new juris-\ndictional barriers that undermine the ATA, even after \nCongress amended the law to remove such barriers, effec-\ntively placing the PLO and PA beyond the reach of Con-\ngress and American courts, notwithstanding the PLO\u2019s \nand PA\u2019s continued enjoyment of the benefits of operating \nin the United States and their continuing payments to ter-\nrorists for murdering and maiming U.S. citizens. That re-\nsult is not required by the Due Process Clause and should \nnot be left standing. \n\n6 \n \n \nA. Congress enacted the ATA to overcome \njurisdictional obstacles to holding terrorists \naccountable in U.S. courts. \nCongress\u2019s impetus for enacting the ATA dates back to \nthe 1970s and 1980s, when the Nation was stunned by a \nseries of brazen terror attacks against Americans abroad. \n136 Cong. Rec. S4592, S4594 (1990) (statement of Sen. He-\nflin). These included the PLO\u2019s kidnapping and murder of \nU.S. Ambassador Cleo Noel in Sudan in 1973; Hezbollah\u2019s \nsuicide truck-bomb attack that killed 220 U.S. Marines in \nBeirut in 1983; Hezbollah terrorists\u2019 murder of U.S. Navy \nDiver Robert Stethem during the hijacking of TWA Flight \n847 in 1985; and the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103, which \nended the lives of more than 250 people above Lockerbie, \nScotland in 1988. \n1. These horrendous attacks of the 70s and 80s brought \nattention to a significant \u201cgap\u201d in the Nation\u2019s legal strat-\negy for combatting oversees terrorism, 136 Cong. Rec. \nS14283 (1990) (statement of Sen. Grassley). Up to that \ntime, Congress had focused on enacting criminal anti-ter-\nrorism laws\u2014many of which explicitly reached actors and \nconduct beyond our borders. In addition, Congress and \nthe Executive Branch negotiated, ratified, and imple-\nmented a series of international anti-terrorism conven-\ntions prohibiting hijacking,\n2 aircraft sabotage,\n3 hostage-\n \n2 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Seizure of Aircraft, \nS.

But while Congress had long combatted terrorism \nthrough criminal laws that allowed foreign terrorists to \nbe tried in U.S. courts, it was not until the enactment of \nthe ATA that Congress utilized the potential to fight ter-\nrorists through civil lawsuits. With the ATA, Congress \nrecognized that civil lawsuits could provide a means of \n\u201cfill[ing] the gap\u201d in federal national security legal strat-\negy by providing the \u201ccivil counterpart\u201d to the nation\u2019s ex-\ntraterritorial criminal statutes, ibid. (statement of Sen. \nGrassley); see also 1992 Hearing at 11. Congress recog-\nnized that allowing such private civil actions for terror at-\ntacks would not only provide compensation to the victims \nof terror but could provide \u201can important instrument in \nthe fight against terrorism\u201d itself, id. at 10 (letter from \nSen.

No. 102-342, at 22.  \nOne case more than any other illustrated the limita-\ntions of these traditional remedies: the PLO\u2019s 1985 mur-\nder of wheelchair-bound Leon Klinghoffer, an American \npassenger aboard the Italian vessel Achille Lauro. 1990 \nHearing 56. The incident not only prompted public outcry \nand a congressional inquiry into the PLO and its finances, \nid. at 109-117, but also revealed the difficulty in holding \norganizational perpetrators or terrorism accountable, \ngiven the welter of technical challenges that the PLO \nraised when sued by the Klinghoffer family. The ATA\u2019s leg-\nislative record is replete with references to the legal chal-\nlenges of the Klinghoffer case\u2014and shows how Congress \ndrew inspiration from that case in order to solve them.\n11 \n\u201cOnly by virtue of the fact that the attack violated certain \n \n11 See 137 Cong.

Congress amended the ATA in response to new \njurisdictional obstacles that hindered its \noperation. \n1. Things changed, however, after the Court\u2019s deci-\nsions in Daimler AG v. Bauman, 134 S. Ct. 746 (2014), and \nWalden v. Fiore, 134 S. Ct. 1115 (2014). After Daimler and \nWalden were decided, the PLO and PA began advancing \nthe argument that U.S. courts no longer had jurisdiction \nover either of them, and that meritorious suits brought \nagainst them by Americans who had been injured or killed \nin acts of international terrorism had to be dismissed. See \nWaldman v. Palestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317, 322 \n(2d Cir. 2016), vacated sub nom. Sokolow v. Palestine Lib-\neration Org., 140 S. Ct. 2714 (2020); see also Livnat v. Pal-\nestinian Auth., 851 F.3d 45, 142 (D.C. Cir. 2017). \nCertain courts agreed\u2014including the lower court. Alt-\nhough both Daimler and Walden concerned Fourteenth \nAmendment Due Process standards applicable only \nagainst the States, this Court held that these precedents \nshould also govern Fifth Amendment Due Process stand-\nards applicable in federal district court. Waldman, 835 \nF.3d at 337; see also Livnat v. Palestinian Auth., 851 F.3d \n45, 57-59 (D.C. Cir. 2017). And on the basis of that under-\nstanding, the court below applied the personal jurisdiction \n \n27 See, e.g., Ungar v. Palestinian Auth., 715 F. Supp. 2d 253, 269 \n(D.R.I. 2010) ($116 million judgment paid on installment basis); Knox \nv. Palestine Liberation Org., No. 03 Civ. 446 (VM) (THK), 2009 WL \n1591404, at *12 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 26, 2009) ($5 million per month pay-\nments), adopted, 628 F. Supp. 2d 507 (S.D.N.Y. 2009). \n\n15 \n \n \nstandards from Walden and Daimler on terms that essen-\ntially precluded the ATA from being applied to conduct oc-\ncurring abroad by any foreign-terror-sponsoring organi-\nzation like the PLO or PA. The court decided that the ATA \ncould not be constitutionally applied to Respondents be-\ncause neither of them could be considered \u201cat home,\u201d in \nDaimler\u2019s parlance, in this country. 835 F.3d at 331-35. The \ncourt also concluded that the PLO\u2019s and PA\u2019s terror-spon-\nsoring activities lacked the \u201c\u2018substantial connection\u2019\u201d to \nthe United States that Walden demands, because their \n\u201c\u2018suit-related conduct\u2019\u201d occurred abroad,  and \u201cthe plain-\ntiff-victims[\u2019 status as] United States citizens\u201d was insuffi-\ncient to establish the requisite connection. Id. at 335 (quot-\ning Walden, 134 S. Ct. at 1121). These rulings effectively \nprecluded the PLO, the PA, or any similar foreign sponsor \nof terrorism acting abroad, from being hailed into U.S. \ncourts under general or specific personal jurisdiction Due \nProcess standards.\n28  \n 2. In response, Congress quickly and decisively \npassed the ATCA (Pub. L. No. 115-253, 132 Stat. 3183-\n3185 (2018)) using a long-recognized and firmly estab-\nlished basis for obtaining personal jurisdiction\u2014jurisdic-\ntion by consent. The statute provided that any person who \n \n28 Some of the present Amici, as well as the House of Represent-\natives acting on a bipartisan basis, urged this Court to review the de-\ncision in Sokolow, expressing the view that Fourteenth Amendment \npersonal jurisdiction standards had no application to suits arising un-\nder federal law where Congress provided for federal jurisdiction in \nfederal courts. See Br. for the U.S. House of Reps. as Amicus Curiae, \nSokolow v. PLO, No. 16-1071 (Apr. 2017) (H.R. Br.); Br. of U.S. Sena-\ntor Charles E. Grassley et al. as Amici Curiae, Sokolow v. PLO, No. \n16-1071 (Apr. 2017). The Supreme Court declined review. 138 S. Ct. \n1438 (2018). \n\n16 \n \n \nbenefited from a waiver of 22 U.S.C. \u00a7 5202 (a statute ex-\ncluding the PLO and its agents from the United States) or \naccepted specified forms of U.S. foreign assistance (which \nboth the PLO and PA had received) would be deemed to \nhave consented to personal jurisdiction in U.S. civil actions \nbrought under the ATA. Pub. L. 115-253, \u00a7 4(a) (formerly \ncodified at 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A)). After the ATCA be-\ncame law, the PLO and PA stopped accepting any of the \nforeign assistance that qualified under the Act. In addi-\ntion, the Second and D.C. Circuits held that the PLO and \nPA were not benefiting from a waiver of the relevant stat-\nute, and thus the ATCA\u2019s \u201cfactual predicates\u201d had not been \nestablished against them. Klieman v. Palestinian Auth., \n923 F.3d 1114, 1128-31 (D.C. Cir. 2019), vacated, 140 S. Ct. \n2713 (2020); Waldman, 925 F.3d at 574.  \n3. Congress again responded with the Promoting Se-\ncurity and Justice for Victims of Terrorism Act of 2019 \n(PSJVTA). Pub. L. No. 116-94, div. J, tit. IX, \u00a7 903. The \nPSJVTA expanded the bases for jurisdiction established \nby the ATCA. And it specifically identified the PA and \nPLO by name, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(5), expressly providing \nthat those organizations\u2019 post-enactment activities in the \nUnited States would be deemed to constitute consent to \njurisdiction in civil ATA cases, with narrow exceptions for \nparticipation in official U.N. business and other specified \nactivities. 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(B). The PSJVTA also con-\ntained a new jurisdictional provision under which the PLO \nand PA would be deemed to have consented to personal \njurisdiction in civil ATA cases if they made post-enactment \npayments to terrorists who had been imprisoned for injur-\ning or killing American citizens or made such payments to \nthe families of terrorists who had been killed doing so. 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2334(e)(1)(A).  \n\n17 \n \n \nCongress based the PSJVTA on the same consent-\nbased theory that undergirded the ATCA: that imposing \nsuch conditions on \u201cthe PLO and the PA\u201d was eminently \nreasonable as \u201cCongress has repeatedly tied their contin-\nued receipt of privileges,\u201d including this country\u2019s toler-\nance of their \u201ccontinued presence in the United States\u201d \u201cto \ntheir commitment to renounce terrorism.\u201d See H.R. Rep. \nNo. 115-848, at 7 (2018). Congress gave the PLO and PA a \nchoice: abide by conditions on matters of intense interest \nto the United States or provide grounds to \u201creopen[] the \ncourthouse doors to American victims and their families,\u201d \n137 Cong. Rec. S7183 (2019) (statement of Sen. Grassley), \nwho had seen their cases \u201cdismissed for lack of jurisdiction \nafter years of litigation,\u201d id. at S7182 (statement of Sen. \nLankford).  \nC. The court below overturns the PSJVTA, despite \nCongress\u2019s determination that holding the \nPLO and PA accountable in U.S. civil cases \nserves vital U.S. national security interests.  \n1. The court of appeals in this case shut the courthouse \ndoors once again. The court accepted that the PLO and PA \nhad engaged in conduct necessary to trigger jurisdiction \nunder the PSJVTA by paying terrorists who had mur-\ndered Americans and by conducting activities inside the \nUnited States. App. Pet. App. 38a. Yet the court held the \nAct unconstitutional on its face. In the court\u2019s view, the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause requires a that \nCongress can only enact consent-to-jurisdiction statutes \nlike the PSJVTA if it provides those subject to the Act with \nsome \u201creciprocal bargain\u201d in return. Id. 24a-26a. And \ngranting the PLO and PA\u2019s permission to be present and \nengage in activities in the United States does not count as \nsuch a \u201cbenefit.\u201d See id. 28a. If left standing, this ruling \n\n18 \n \n \nwould invalidate Congress\u2019s express determination to re-\nvive the ATA and would likely prohibit Congress from \npassing any future deemed-consent legislation reaching \nthe PLO and PA that would pass constitutional muster.  \n2. Leaving the decision in place would thus hamstring \nkey components of the United States\u2019 antiterrorism strat-\negy. Congress has long understood that terror enterprises \n\u201crest[] on a foundation of money.\u201d See Antiterrorism Act \nof 1990: Hearing on S. 2465 Before the Sen. Subcomm. on \nCourts & Admin. Practice, 101st Cong. 84 (1990) (testi-\nmony of Joseph A. Morris, former General Counsel, U.S. \nInformation Agency). Congress has therefore employed a \nrobust and comprehensive scheme\u2014composed of admin-\nistrative sanctions, civil and criminal penalties\u2014that aims \nto deny malefactors of every dollar they might use to fund \nterrorism. And these government efforts to combat terror \nfinancing have been demonstrably effective. See The 9/11 \nCommission Report, Final Report of the National Com-\nmission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States \n382\u2013383 (2004). For instance, documents found in Osama \nBin Laden\u2019s compound revealed that efforts to restrict \nterrorist funding had frustrated al Qaeda\u2019s efforts to raise \nand transfer money around the world. Juan C. Zarate, \nTreasury\u2019s War: The Unleashing of a New Era of Finan-\ncial Warfare ix (2013). \nCongress has determined that government enforce-\nment alone is not enough to stanch the flow of terror \nfunds. Civil litigation under the ATA plays an irreplacea-\nble role in reinforcing these governmental antiterrorism \nefforts, providing \u201can invaluable supplement to the crimi-\nnal justice process and administrative blocking orders,\u201d \nJimmy Gurul\u00e9, Unfunding Terror: the Legal Response to \nthe Financing of Global Terrorism 325 (2008). Private \n\n19 \n \n \ncivil litigation also provides advantages that make it a \nmore effective terror-fighting tool than criminal enforce-\nment efforts, including a less stringent burden of proof, an \nabsence of constitutional restrictions on investigation, and \nbroader discovery rights than those accorded governmen-\ntal agents. Ibid. Private civil lawsuits also provide \u201can im-\nportant failsafe function\u201d against the winds of political \nchange, \u201cby ensuring that legal norms are not wholly de-\npendent on the current attitudes of public enforcers.\u201d \nJohn C.

Rev. 215, 227 (1983). \nAccordingly, by undercutting the operation of the ATA, \nthe court of appeals not only denied relief to American vic-\ntims of international terrorism, it blunted a vital tool in our \nNation\u2019s war on terror, frustrating an Act of Congress that \nconcerns one of the gravest threats facing our nation. The \nCourt\u2019s review is warranted to reverse that improper re-\nsult. \nII. The lower court has misconstrued the \nrequirements of Due Process and inserted the \njudiciary into matters committed to the Political \nBranches. \nIt is not just the lower court\u2019s result\u2014striking down as \nunconstitutional a federal statute aimed at national secu-\nrity\u2014that raises concerns for Congress and warrants this \nCourt\u2019s review. The decision\u2019s legal underpinnings them-\nselves threaten to undermine Congress\u2019s legitimate au-\nthority to legislate consistent with the Due Process Clause \nand to meet future threats facing the Nation.  \nA. In holding that federal legislation concerning the \nterritorial reach of the federal courts\u2019 adjudicative powers \n\n20 \n \n \nis subject to the same Due Process limits as state laws and \nstate courts, the court below disregarded an understand-\ning of Due Process, and different understandings of state \nversus federal sovereignty that have persisted since the \nfounding.  \n\u201cFor the first 150 years of the Republic, * * *  the recog-\nnized doctrines of jurisdiction worked very differently for \nstate and federal courts.\u201d Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlim-\nited Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. \n1703, 1706 (2020). Unlike the jurisdictional limitations im-\nposed upon state courts by the Fourteenth Amendment, \n\u201cas originally understood, the Fifth Amendment did not \nimpose any limits on the personal jurisdiction of the fed-\neral courts. Instead, it was up to Congress to impose such \nlimits by statute.\u201d Douglass v. Nippon Ysen Kabushiki \nKaisha, 46 F.4th 226, 255 (5th Cir. 2022) (en banc) (Old-\nham, J., dissenting). Accordingly, \u201c[i]f Congress wanted to \nexercise exorbitant [personal] jurisdiction * * *  a federal \ncourt \u2018would certainly be bound to follow it, and proceed \nupon the law.\u2019\u201d Sachs, supra (quoting Picquet v. Swan, 19 \nF. Cas. 609 (C.C.D. Mass. 1828) (No. 11,134) (Story, J.)). \nThis basic distinction between federal and state juris-\ndictional power results from peculiar limits on state sov-\nereignty that have no federal analog. In our federal sys-\ntem, \u201c[w]hen a state enters the Union, it surrenders cer-\ntain sovereign prerogatives.\u201d Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 \nU.S. 497, 519 (2007). \u201c[T]he sovereignty of each State * * \n* implie[s] a limitation on the sovereignty of all its sister \nStates\u2014a limitation express or implicit in both the origi-\nnal scheme of the Constitution and the Fourteenth \nAmendment.\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, \n444 U.S. 286, 293 (1980). Those limitations preserve the bal-\nance among States, \u201cacting to ensure that the States \n\n21 \n \n \nthrough their courts, do not reach out beyond the limits \nimposed on them by their status as coequal sovereigns in \na federal system.\u201d  World-Wide Volkswagen, 444 U.S. at 292. \nThey are an expression of the reality that the States have \nagreed to coexist under a single Constitution, each agree-\ning to respect the needs of the other. \u201c[I]f another State \nwere to assert jurisdiction in an inappropriate case, it \nwould upset the federal balance, which posits that each \nState has a sovereignty that is not subject to unlawful in-\ntrusion by other States.\u201d J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. \nNicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 884 (2011) (plurality). \nBut personal jurisdiction \u201crequires a forum-by-forum, \nor sovereign-by-sovereign, analysis.\u201d McIntyre, 564 U.S. \nat 583. And where the relevant \u201csovereign\u201d is the federal \ngovernment, the Constitution expressly conveys to Con-\ngress the \u201cexternal powers\u201d to assert jurisdiction over \ncases arising outside the territory of the United States. \nUnited States v. Curtiss-Wright Exp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, \n316-18 (1936) (citing Penhallow v. Doane\u2019s Administra-\ntor, 3 U.S. (3 Dall.) 54, 80\u201381 (1795)). And this Court has \nwarned that \u201cthe limitations of the Constitution * * * pre-\nventing [States] from transcending the limits of their au-\nthority\u201d afford \u201cno ground for constructing an imaginary \nconstitutional barrier around the exterior confines of the \nUnited States for the purposes of shutting the govern-\nment off from the exertion of powers which inherently be-\nlong to it by virtue of its sovereignty.\u201d United States v. \nBennett, 232 U.S. 299, 306 (1914).  \nFrom the very beginning, Congress has regulated \nconsistent with the understanding that it could assert ex-\ntraterritorial jurisdiction to address a series of exterior \n\n22 \n \n \nthreats from abroad. And this Court has consistently up-\nheld those actions. See Pet. 17-20. Yet the decision below \nupends that understanding entirely. \nIt is therefore critical for the Court to take this case to \nensure that the Fifth Amendment is not interpreted to im-\npose restrictions on the powers of the federal government \nto enact reasonable legislation advancing extraterritorial \nnational security interests based on federalism con-\nstraints meant to limit only the States\u2019 powers vis-\u00e0-vis \none another. \nB. Yet even taken on its own terms, the court of ap-\npeals\u2019 attempt to apply limits on states\u2019 territorial author-\nity to Congress and the federal courts is entirely improper. \nThe lower court applied notions of consent that would be \nmore at home in contract law than an explanation of fed-\neral power, under which Congress must bargain with ter-\nrorists by giving them \u201cgovernmental benefit[s]\u201d to obtain \ntheir willingness to subject themselves to the jurisdiction \nof U.S. courts. Pet. App. 38a. But even States are not re-\nquired to provide such reciprocal benefits to enact \ndeemed-consent laws. They need only provide defendants \n\u201cfair warning\u201d and be \u201creasonable, in the context of our \nfederal system of government.\u201d Ford Motor Co. v. Mont. \nEighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 358 (2021) (citation \nomitted).  \nThere is no legitimate question that the PSJVTA \nwould pass muster under that analysis, because there is \nno question that the Act gave the PLO and PA the freedom \nto avoid the jurisdiction of U.S. courts simply by ceasing \npay-for-slay \u201cmartyr\u201d payments to people who have killed \nAmericans or confining their activities in the United \nStates within the boundaries set in the Act. And there can \n\n23 \n \n \nbe no doubt that the Act reasonably advances legitimate\u2014\nnay, vital\u2014federal interests. \nFurthermore, as Judge Elrod has observed, the Second \nCircuit\u2019s rule means that \u201ccivil foreign defendants now \nhave more due process rights than criminal foreign de-\nfendants,\u201d Douglass, 46 F.4th at 276 (dissenting), when \nthe greater deprivation of liberty in the criminal context \nobviously calls for greater Due Process protections. See \nPet. 24-25. \nIn the end, the lower court\u2019s constitutional analysis \namounts to little else beyond a disagreement between one \ncircuit court and Congress itself on complex questions of \nforeign policy\u2014including the proper way to conduct an \nanti-terror campaign and whether Respondents should be \nentitled to continue their odious pay-for-slay practice, \nwhich is \u201can incentive to commit acts of terror.\u201d Taylor \nForce Act, Pub. L. 115-141, Title X, \u00a7 1002(1) (22 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2378c-1 note), while still evading the jurisdiction of U.S. \ncourts. But \u201c[t]he political branches, not the Judiciary, \nhave the responsibility and institutional capacity to weigh \nforeign-policy concerns.\u201d Jesner v. Arab Bank PLC, 138 \nS. Ct. 1386, 1403 (2018). The circuit court\u2019s arrogation of \nthose foreign-policy questions to itself is yet another rea-\nson this Court\u2019s review is necessary.  \n \n \n \n\n24 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted. \n  \nJ.

A list of amici and \ntheir academic positions is set forth in the Appendix.1 \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nThis Court reaffirmed in Mallory v. Norfolk \nSouthern Railway Co. that \u201cexpress or implied \nconsent\u201d remains a constitutionally sound basis for \nestablishing personal jurisdiction over a defendant, \nand that consent may be given \u201cby word or deed.\u201d \n600 U.S. 122, 138 (2023) (plurality) (emphasis added); \nsee also id. at 153 (Alito, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment); see generally Robin J. \nEffron & Aaron D. Simowitz, The Long Arm of \nConsent, 80 N.Y.U. Ann. Surv. Am. L. 179 (2024).  In \nthe decision below, the Second Circuit nonetheless \nheld that the conduct deemed to constitute consent \nunder the PSJVTA \u201ccannot support a fair and \nreasonable inference of the defendants\u2019 voluntary \nagreement to proceed in a federal forum,\u201d and \u201clack[s] \nany of the indicia of valid consent previously \nrecognized in the case law.\u201d Pet. App. 26a. \nIn so holding, the Second Circuit effectively \nconcluded that, although a party may validly consent \nto personal jurisdiction in a given forum by \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief in whole or in \npart, and no person or entity other than amicus or his counsel \nfunded its preparation or submission. Sup. Ct. R. 37.6. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n2 \n \n \npurchasing a cruise ship ticket with a forum-selection \nclause tucked into three pages of fine print on the \nticket\u2019s back, Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shute, \n499 U.S. 585 (1991), engaging in discovery abuses, \nIns. Corp. of Ireland Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites \nde Guinee, 456 U.S. 694 (1982), or mistakenly \nentering a general appearance, York v. Texas, 137 \nU.S. 15 (1890), the same result does not obtain for \nsophisticated, well-counseled entities fully apprised of \nthe consequences of their actions. As a result, the \ndecision below gives more protection to defendants \nthat the elected branches concluded should be suable \nunder the Anti-Terrorism Act than it does to users of \nGoogle products who are required to adjudicate their \ndisputes in California, regardless of where their \ndisputes arose.2 Such a result cannot be reconciled \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents.  \nTo that end, the Court does not need to analyze \nhow the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments\u2019 Due \nProcess Clauses might impose different limitations on \nthe exercise of personal jurisdiction; instead, Mallory \nand basic, already settled propositions about the Fifth \nAmendment control the outcome of this case. Mallory \nsets the standard for personal jurisdiction under the \nFourteenth Amendment, and all agree that the Fifth \nAmendment is at least as generous to plaintiffs as the \n \n2 See Google Terms of Service, https://policies.google.com/ \nterms?hl=en-US (last accessed February 3, 2025) (\u201c[A]ll disputes \narising out of or relating to these terms . . . will be resolved \nexclusively in the federal or state courts of Santa Clara County, \nCalifornia, USA, and you and Google consent to personal \njurisdiction in those courts.\u201d); see also TradeComet.com LLC v. \nGoogle, Inc., 647 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 2011). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n3 \n \n \nFourteenth Amendment in that context. Therefore, \nbecause the PSJVTA satisfies Mallory, assertions of \npersonal jurisdiction under the Act must satisfy the \nFifth Amendment. The Court need go no further in \nreversing the decision below. \nSeparately, the Court has every reason to defer to \nthe decision of the elected branches in matters \nimplicating foreign affairs and the regulation of \nterrorism, in which judicial deference is at its zenith, \nespecially where the action of the elected branches \ncame in direct response to prior judicial decisions in \nthis case. The Second Circuit\u2019s jurisdictional decision \nundercut Congress\u2019s authority in this area and, in \ndoing so, ignored law that already polices Congress\u2019s \npower to regulate international terrorism. In this \ncase, separation of powers principles warrant \nheightened deference to the elected branches, not the \nheightened skepticism with which the Second Circuit \nviewed the PSJVTA.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe \nDecision \nBelow \nMisconstrues \nThis Court\u2019s \u201cConsent\u201d Precedents \nAs the Mallory plurality explained, under this \nCourt\u2019s precedents \u201ca variety of \u2018actions of the \ndefendant\u2019 \nthat \nmay \nseem \nlike \ntechnicalities \nnonetheless can \u2018amount to a legal submission to the \njurisdiction of the court.\u2019\u201d 600 U.S. at 145 (plurality) \n(quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704\u201305) (offering as \nexamples \u201c[f]ailing to comply with certain pre-trial \norders, signing a contract with a forum selection \n\n \n \n \n \n \n4 \n \n \nclause, [and] accepting an in-state benefit with \njurisdictional strings attached\u201d). The PSJVTA fits \ncomfortably within these parameters of consent-based \njurisdiction. \nA. The Court\u2019s consent-based personal-jurisdiction \nprecedents have not always been decided on \nconstitutional grounds.  For instance, in Shute, which \nanalyzed the enforceability of a forum selection \nclause, the Court invoked the canon of constitutional \navoidance and concluded that, because the forum-\nselection clause was \u201cdispositive . . . , we need not \nconsider petitioner\u2019s constitutional argument as to \npersonal jurisdiction.\u201d 499 U.S. at 589\u201390; see also \nM/S Bremen v. Zapata Off-Shore Co., 407 U.S. 1, 10\u2013\n11 (1972) (forum selection clauses \u201cshould be enforced \nunless enforcement is shown by the resisting party to \nbe \u2018unreasonable\u2019 under the circumstances\u201d). \nFollowing \nShute, \nconsent-based \npersonal-\njurisdiction has been viewed through a maximalist \nlens, with courts commonly upholding forum-selection \nclauses against parties \u201cwho have \u2018consented\u2019 to the \nforum via a boilerplate agreement that they may \nneither read nor comprehend.\u201d John F. Coyle & Robin \nJ. Effron, Forum Selection Clauses, Non-Signatories, \nand Personal Jurisdiction, 97 Notre Dame L. Rev. \n187, 230 (2021). Shrinkwrap, clickwrap, and end user \nlicense \nagreements \ncontaining \nforum-selection \nclauses have multiplied exponentially, yet their \n\u201creasonableness\u201d is almost always upheld. John F. \nCoyle, \u201cContractually Valid\u201d Forum Selection Clauses, \n108 Iowa L. Rev. 127, 155\u201356 (2022).  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n5 \n \n \nThe decision below dismissed Shute as a case \n\u201cenforc[ing] \nthe \nexpress \njurisdiction-conferring \nlanguage \nof \na \ncontract \nafter \naccounting \nfor \nconsiderations of notice and fundamental fairness,\u201d \nrather than one involving the \u201cinference\u201d of consent. \nPet. App. 25a. But many post-Shute lower-court \ndecisions simply dispense with the need to conduct \nany constitutional due process analysis when \npresented with an enforceable forum selection clause. \nSee Coyle & Effron, supra, at 232\u201334 (collecting \ncases). Either way, treating forum-selection clauses as \nthe Second Circuit did\u2014as merely another contract \nprovision to be enforced\u2014fails to recognize the \nsignificant constitutional assumptions embedded in \ntheir enforceability. \nIn that regard, the Second Circuit wrongly rejected \nthe \nFuld \nPetitioners\u2019 \nargument \nthat \nthe \nconstitutionality of the PSJVTA follows a fortiori from \nShute. Millions of Americans \u201cconsent\u201d to jurisdiction \nevery day by dint of continuing to use products and \nservices whose terms and conditions contain forum-\nselection clauses. A consumer\u2019s continued use of such \nproducts or services is a continued manifestation of \nconsent to personal jurisdiction by deed; and it is her \nintentional conduct of continued use that gives rise to \nconsent rather than any affirmative act with respect \nto the forum-selection clause generally. If such \nboilerplate provisions satisfy constitutional due \nprocess, then a federal statute giving notice to \nsophisticated, well-counseled defendants that their \nengagement in specified conduct will be deemed \n\n \n \n \n \n \n6 \n \n \nconsent to personal jurisdiction must be constitutional \nas well. \nB. The decision below went equally astray in \ndrawing an artificial distinction between \u201cdeemed \nconsent,\u201d which it determined required \u201csome \nexchange of benefits,\u201d and \u201ccertain litigation-related \nconduct,\u201d which it described vaguely as \u201c[an]other \nmeans of demonstrating consent.\u201d Pet. App. 36a n.13. \nIn so doing, it ignored the central principle that \u201c[t]he \nactions of the defendant may amount to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court, whether \nvoluntary or not.\u201d Bauxites, 456 U.S. at 704\u201305 \n(emphasis added). In Bauxites, the Court held that \ndue process under the Fourteenth Amendment is not \nviolated when courts equate the failure to comply with \njurisdictional discovery orders with a \u201can admission of \nthe want of merit in the asserted defense\u201d of personal \njurisdiction. 456 U.S. at 705. In that sense, adverse \ninferences \narising \nfrom \nlitigation \nconduct \nfit \ncomfortably within the consent regime approved by \nthe Court in Mallory, and it is unsurprising that \nMallory drew so extensively on Bauxites to drive home \nthe point that \u201c\u2018actions of the defendant\u2019 that may \nseem like technicalities nonetheless can \u2018amount to a \nlegal submission to the jurisdiction of a court.\u2019\u201d \nMallory, 600 U.S. at 146 (quoting Bauxites, 456 U.S. \nat 704\u201305)); id. at 148 (Jackson, J., concurring) \n(discussing Bauxites).3  \n \n3 The distinction drawn by the Second Circuit between \nconduct within litigation and conduct without (Pet. App. 32a\u2013\n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n7 \n \n \nII. \nThe Reasoning of Mallory Answers \nThis Case \nDespite the Second Circuit\u2019s disavowal of Mallory, \nsee Pet. App. 32a\u201335a, the Court can decide the \ninstant case on the authority of Mallory and basic, \nundisputed assumptions about the Fifth Amendment.  \nA. As Mallory instructs, \u201c\u2018express or implied \nconsent\u2019 \ncan \ncontinue \nto \nground \npersonal \njurisdiction\u2014and consent may be manifested in \nvarious ways by word or deed.\u201d 600 U.S. at 138 (2023) \n(plurality) (emphasis added); see id. at 153 (Alito, J., \nconcurring in part and concurring in the judgment). \nThis case differs from Mallory in the sense that it \naddresses consent by deed, not word, and that the law \nis an act of Congress, not a state legislature; \notherwise, there is not much daylight between the two \nstatutes.  \nThe Second Circuit\u2019s attempt to wave away \nMallory makes no sense: \u201cThe Pennsylvania law at \nissue in Mallory did not involve an actual bargain or \na \u2018voluntary agreement,\u2019 . . . between the state and \neach company,\u201d because Norfolk Southern was \ndeemed to have consented to personal jurisdiction; its \n \n36a) is difficult to understand except as an attempt to mitigate \nthe Second Circuit\u2019s difficulty with reconciling its top-line \nconclusion with Bauxites. See infra at 8. Consent deemed \nex ante\u2014especially as to sophisticated parties closely tracking \nthe enactment of the PSJVTA\u2014provides clear and unambiguous \nnotice, whereas consent deemed by litigation conduct may well \nrest with the broad discretion of a trial court. See, e.g., Bauxites, \n456 U.S. at 707. The former approach is far more consistent with \nthe ordinary meaning of \u201cconsent.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n \n8 \n \n \nregistration to do business in Pennsylvania pursuant \nto one statute brought it within the ambit of a \nseparate statute deeming registration as a foreign \ncorporation a \u201csufficient basis\u201d for the exercise of \ngeneral \npersonal \njurisdiction. \nPet. \nApp. \n244a \n(Menashi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing  \nen banc).  \nTo that end, the \u201creciprocal benefit\u201d rationale set \nforth in the decision below cannot be reconciled with \nthis Court\u2019s decision in Bauxites (among others), \nrequiring the Second Circuit to invent the separate \ncategory of \u201clitigation-related conduct.\u201d See supra \nat 6. But nothing in Mallory suggests that courts \nshould awkwardly parse different categories of \nconsent. Indeed, the disagreement among the Second \nCircuit is evidence enough that this Court should not \ninsert itself into determining whether consent is the \nproduct of a sufficiently \u201creciprocal\u201d \u201cbargain\u201d or \nwhether a particular statute, forum-selection clause, \nor discovery abuse manifests \u201ca reasonable inference \nof consent.\u201d  \nB. The PSJVTA satisfies the Mallory standard.  \nIndeed, the Act presents an easier constitutional \nquestion, because it does not implicate concerns \npresent in cases in which personal jurisdiction is \nbeing exercised pursuant to state (rather than federal) \nlaw. In this case, there are no dormant commerce \nclause or other federalism concerns. Cf. Mallory, \n600 U.S. at 157 (Alito, J., concurring in part and \nconcurring in the judgment). Likewise, unlike the \nPennsylvania statute at issue in Mallory, the PSJTVA \n\n \n \n \n \n \n9 \n \n \ndoes not provide for general, \u201call purpose\u201d jurisdiction \nover defendants. Cf. Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 U.S. \n117 (2014). On the contrary, the PSJTVA restricts its \napplication to claims (i) brought under the Anti-\nTerrorism Act (ii) by U.S. nationals (iii) against \nspecifically named defendants who (iv) continue to \nengage in conduct specified by the statute.4 It does not \nresurrect a \u201cblanket claim of authority over \ncontroversies with no connection to the [United \nStates].\u201d Mallory, 600 U.S. at 170 (Barrett, J., \ndissenting). \nNor does the PSJTVA prompt international comity \nconcerns that have commanded attention in other \nsituations. See, e.g., Daimler, 571 U.S. at 140\u201342. \nInternational \nlaw \nclearly \nrecognizes \na \nstate\u2019s \nprerogative to prescribe law governing terrorism, \n\u201ceven if no specific connection exists between the state \nand the persons or conduct being regulated.\u201d \nRestatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law \u00a7 413. \nIII. \nDeference To The Elected Branches \nAnd Constitutional Departmentalism \nRequire Reversal \nShould the Court consider it necessary to analyze \ndifferences between the Due Process Clauses of the \nFifth and Fourteenth Amendments, the proper frame \nof reference is constitutional deference to the elected \nbranches. \nThe \ndecision \nbelow \nerred \nin \nthis \nfundamental respect, showing disdain for the \n \n4 The constitutionality of \u201cspecial\u201d legislation in the context \nof federal statutes giving relief to victims of terrorism is settled. \nBank Markazi v. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212 (2016). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n10 \n \n \njudgment of the elected branches in a case implicating \nforeign affairs, an area in which deference to the \nelected branches is ordinarily at its zenith. E.g., \nZiglar v. Abbasi, 582 U.S. 120, 142 (2017); Holder v. \nHumanitarian Law Project, 561 U.S. 1, 33\u201334 (2010). \nA. \u201c[T]he Second Circuit\u2019s decision does not merely \nignore that the elected branches interpret the \nConstitution. The Court\u2019s decision rejects the notion \nthat the elected branches\u2019 judgment is even relevant.\u201d \nLong Arm of Consent at 247. In holding that \u201c[a] \nprospective defendant\u2019s activities do not signify \nconsent to personal jurisdiction simply because \nCongress has labeled them as such,\u201d Pet. App. 21a, the \nSecond Circuit treated the PSJVTA as a sort of \nlegislative aggrandizement of what it saw as the \njudicial branch\u2019s exclusive authority to define the \nlimits of personal jurisdiction. This was error.   \nBoth the Mallory plurality and dissent treated \nJustice Scalia\u2019s opinion in Burnham v. Super. Ct. of \nCal., 495 U.S. 604 (1990)\u2014the plurality opinion as \nwell as Parts II.D and III\u2014as the appropriate frame \nfor analyzing consent and other traditional bases of \njurisdiction. See Mallory, 600 U.S. at 139\u201341 \n(plurality); id. at 171\u201376 (Barrett, J., dissenting). In \nBurnham, \nJustice \nScalia \nsuggested \nthat \nthe \n\u201cdesirability or fairness of the prevailing in-state \nservice rule\u201d should be left to the \u201cjudgment [of] the \nlegislatures that are free to amend it,\u201d characterizing \ndue process as \u201cthat process which American society . \n. . , which expresses its judgments in the laws of \nself-interested States\u2014has traditionally considered \n\n \n \n \n \n \n11 \n \n \n\u2018due.\u2019\u201d 495 U.S. at 621, 627 n.5. (opinion of Scalia, J.). \nThat deference to legislative judgment was carried \nforward by the Mallory plurality and dissent alike. \nSee Long Arm of Consent at 214. \nA fortiori, \u201c[t]he federal legislature has an even \nstronger claim to interpret the U.S. Constitution \nwhen \nit \nenacts \nfederal \nconsent-to-jurisdiction \nstatutes.\u201d Id. at 185. Congress\u2019s \u201cinterpretations are \nentitled to independent weight under theories of \nconstitutional departmentalism,\u201d which, however \nthey may differ in their details, contend that \u201cthe \nconstitutional interpretive authority of the federal \nelected branches is at its height when (i) the federal \nelected branches have engaged in actual, explicit \nconstitutional reasoning and (ii) where the nature of \nthe underlying right is unsettled.\u201d Id. at 248\u201349. With \nthe Court having explicitly reserved the question \nwhether the constraints on personal jurisdiction are \ncoterminous \nunder \nthe \nFifth \nand \nFourteenth \nAmendments in Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. \nCt. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 268\u201369 (2017), the detailed \nfindings of Congress in enacting the PSJVTA are \nentitled to substantial deference.  \nB. Similar weight should be accorded the judgment \nof Congress in passing the PSJVTA in explicit \nresponse to decisions dismissing the Fuld and \nSokolow cases for want of personal jurisdiction, just \nas an earlier Congress passed the Antiterrorism \nClarification Act (ATCA) in response to Waldman v. \nPalestine Liberation Org., 835 F.3d 317 (2d Cir. 2016), \n\n \n \n \n \n \n12 \n \n \ncert denied sub nom. Sokolow v. Palestine Liberation \nOrg., 584 U.S. 915 (2018).  \nThis Court has often looked to the judgment of the \nelected branches when considering traditional bases \nof jurisdiction. For instance, two great pre-Mallory \nprecedents, Shaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186 (1977), \nand Burnham took different approaches, but plainly \nagreed that the judgment of the elected branches \nmatters. See Long Arm of Consent at 217\u201320. Shaffer \nwas careful to note that its result might have differed \nif Delaware had \u201cenacted a statute that treats \nacceptance of a directorship as consent to jurisdiction \nin the State.\u201d 433 U.S. at 216. And the Delaware \nGeneral Assembly enacted just such a statute within \ntwo weeks of the Shaffer decision, see 10 Del. C. \n\u00a7 3114(a), \nwhich \nhas \nconsistently \nsurvived \nconstitutional scrutiny. See Aaron D. Simowitz, \nJurisdiction as Dialogue, 52 N.Y.U. J. Int\u2019l L. & Pol. \n485, 511\u201313 (2020). Though Justice Scalia\u2019s plurality \nin Burnham turned away from some aspects of \nShaffer, it also placed great weight on the unanimous \njudgment of state legislatures not to remove \n\u201ctag jurisdiction\u201d from their long-arm statutes. 495 \nU.S. at 627. \nCongress\u2019s \nresponse \nto \ngenerally \napplicable \njudicially created limitations on personal jurisdiction, \nin the form of statutes like the ATCA and the \nPSJVTA, may be best characterized as a prime \nexample of the elected branches engaged in an \nongoing dialogue with the judicial branch as to \nlegislative priorities that require courts to engage \n\n \n \n \n \n \n13 \n \n \nwith the elected branches\u2019 own claims to interpreting \nthe Constitution. See Jurisdiction as Dialogue at 527\u2013\n31; id. at 528 (\u201c[T]here is good reason to think that \n[the regulatory priorities of the elected branches] \nshould \ninform \nthe \nunderlying \nstructure \nof \njurisdiction.\u201d).  \nYet the decision below refused to engage with \nthese considerations at all\u2014a point not lost on the \nelected branches. See No. 24-20, Brief Amici Curiae of \nSen. Charles Grassley, et al. in Support of Certiorari, \nat 23 (\u201cIn the end, the lower court\u2019s constitutional \nanalysis amounts to little else beyond a disagreement \nbetween one circuit court and Congress itself on \ncomplex questions of foreign policy\u2014including the \nproper way to conduct an anti-terror campaign[.]\u201d); \nNo. 24-20, Brief Amicus Curiae of Secretary Mike \nPompeo in Support of Certiorari, at 3 (\u201cThe decision \nbelow\u2014invalidating [an antiterrorism policy] created \nin coordination with the State Department and \nenacted with bipartisan support\u2014frustrates the \npolitical branches\u2019 considered attempt to minimize the \nterror risk overseas.\u201d); cf. No. 24-20, Brief Amicus \nCuriae of the U.S. House of Representatives in \nSupport of Certiorari, at 8 (\u201cIf the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause precludes Congress from \nproviding American victims of international terrorism \nan effective civil remedy in most circumstances, this \nCourt should be the one to say so.\u201d). \nGiven these considerations, one need not take a \nmaximalist view of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause to appreciate that the Second Circuit \n\n \n \n \n \n \n14 \n \n \nwent astray in holding it coterminous with that of the \nFourteenth Amendment. Cf. Stephen E. Sachs, The \nUnlimited Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. \nL. Rev. 1703, 1710 (2020) (\u201c[A]s to the scope of the \ncourts\u2019 \nterritorial \njurisdiction, \nthe \n[Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process] Clause has nothing to \nsay.\u201d). Although the judicial branch has long served as \nan arbiter of interstate federalism and state \nassertions of jurisdiction, it is not the \u201carbiter of \nforeign relations.\u201d Aaron D. Simowitz, Federal \nPersonal Jurisdiction and Constitutional Authority, \n56 N.Y.U. J. Int\u2019l L. & Pol. 345, 362 (2024).  \nTaken together, the institutional competence of \nthe elected branches to make decisions in the field of \nforeign relations, the deference owed those decisions, \nand appreciation for the elected branches\u2019 exercise of \nconstitutional interpretation require that the elected \nbranches of the federal government should generally \nbe competent to authorize personal jurisdiction \nwithout the need for judicial scrutiny under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment. See id. at \n363. To the extent the Court does not consider the \nSecond Circuit\u2019s misapplication of Mallory and this \nCourt\u2019s other consent-based personal jurisdiction \ncaselaw conclusive, proper consideration of the elected \nbranches\u2019 interpretive and structural authority favors \nthe constitutionality of the PSJVTA.  \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n \n15 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe decisions below should be reversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \nKEVIN D.

          "task_beliefs": "My second attempt to acquire the brief for the United States as petitioner has failed, returning the exact same document as my first attempt: the brief for the private petitioners, Miriam Fuld, et al. This repeated failure means my central uncertainty remains entirely unresolved. My knowledge of the case's legal landscape is static, and my ability to predict the outcome has not advanced.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are:\n\n*   **The Central Conflict - The Nature of \"Consent\" (Stable & Unchanged):** The core legal tension remains a balanced scale. The Fuld petitioners' brief, which I have now received twice, consistently argues that this is a stronger case for jurisdiction-by-consent than *Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.* This reinforces my understanding of their position but does not change the fundamental balance, as the respondents' likely counter-arguments (relying on *Ins. Corp. of Ireland* and the lack of a \"reciprocal bargain\") are still equally plausible and potent without the government's intervention.\n\n*   **The Constitutional Debate - 5th vs. 14th Amendment (Stable & Unchanged):** The petitioners' strategy of distinguishing the Fifth Amendment's constraints on the federal government from the Fourteenth's constraints on states is a fixed and known quantity. The table of contents from the Fuld brief (\"The Second Circuit\u2019s Conflation Of Fifth And Fourteenth Amendment Standards Disregards Interstate Federalism\") confirms this is a central pillar of their case. My model of this debate is stable.\n\n*   **The Battle over Originalism (Stable & Unchanged):** The historical arguments are set. The Fuld brief's first major argument (\"The Fifth Amendment\u2019s Original Public Meaning Imposed No Limit On Personal Jurisdiction\") validates my map of their originalist claims. This part of the dialectic is fully understood from the petitioners' side.\n\n*   **The Separation of Powers Clash (Stable & Unchanged):** This secondary battleground remains in place. I have a clear view of the petitioners' and respondents' arguments, but the Executive Branch's view\u2014a crucial element in any separation of powers analysis\u2014is still a complete black box.\n\n*   **The Solicitor General as the Decisive Variable (Hypothesis Stable, Uncertainty Entrenched):** My hypothesis that the SG's brief is the key inflection point is not only unchanged but is now underscored by the frustration of two failed attempts to acquire it. The critical questions I previously identified remain entirely unanswered, and my inability to answer them is now a confirmed procedural problem, not just a temporary information gap.\n    *   **Unresolved Doctrinal Alignment:** I still do not know which side of the *Mallory* / *Ins. Corp. of Ireland* debate the U.S. government will support. This remains the single most important missing signal for predicting the outcome.\n    *   **Unresolved Separation of Powers Stance:** I still do not know how the Executive Branch balances its duty to defend a congressional statute (PSJVTA) against its long-term institutional interest in preserving executive and judicial power from legislative overreach.\n    *   **Unresolved Deference Argument:** I still do not know the extent to which the government will argue for judicial deference to the political branches on this foreign policy issue.\n    *   **Conclusion on Task Beliefs:** My legal map of the case is stable and confirmed, but it is also inert. The repeated failure to acquire the SG's input means I cannot update the relative weights of the competing arguments. My prediction remains in a state of high, and now entrenched, uncertainty.",
          "design_beliefs": "This repeated failure is an extremely valuable observation. It moves beyond simply identifying a tool's unreliability and forces a deeper evolution in my information acquisition strategy and overall operational model. A single failure suggests a fluke; a repeated failure reveals a systemic flaw.\n\nMy design beliefs have evolved significantly:\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents & Source Authentication (Principle Hardened):** My previous update added the sub-principle that \"Source Authentication is Non-Negotiable.\" This second, identical failure hardens that sub-principle into a core doctrine. The `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool is demonstrably and repeatedly returning a document that matches keywords but is not the correct *source*. My verification step is not just a good idea; it is the only thing preventing a catastrophic misinterpretation of the evidence.\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction (Model Refined with Escalation Pathways):** My `Assess -> Target -> Acquire -> Verify` loop is functionally sound, as the `Verify` step correctly caught the error. However, the failure of the `Acquire` step twice in a row reveals a critical missing piece: **Escalation Pathways.** My model must now be: `Assess -> Target -> Acquire -> Verify -> Escalate/Pivot on Failure`. If a refined version of an action fails, I must not try a third time. I must escalate to a fundamentally different action. Potential pivots include:\n    1.  Searching for secondary sources (e.g., news articles, SCOTUSblog analysis) that summarize the target document.\n    2.  Broadening the search to retrieve all related documents and performing manual filtering.\n    3.  Attempting a different search tool or methodology entirely.\n\n*   **Model the Reliability of Tools (Belief Confirmed and Quantified):** My prior belief that the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool has a specific failure mode is now confirmed with high confidence. **The tool cannot reliably distinguish between a party named in a consolidated case caption and the actual filer of the document.** My confidence in this tool for retrieving a specific brief in a multi-party or consolidated case is now near zero. Future use requires significant workarounds.\n\n*   **Develop Sophisticated Query Heuristics (New Principle):** The failure of a simple filtered query (`'proceeding_title': 'brief of petitioner'`) shows that I must be more sophisticated. I am adding the following heuristics to my `Acquire` step:\n    *   **Negative Filtering:** Actively exclude known incorrect terms. A future query for the SG brief should include parameters like `-\"Miriam Fuld\"` or `-\"Arnold & Porter\"`.\n    *   **Affirmative Targeting:** Focus on unique identifiers for the target. A future query should prioritize searching for \"Solicitor General\" as the counsel of record, if the tool allows for such metadata searching.\n    *   **Recall Over Precision:** When precision fails, pivot to recall. A valid next step is to query for *all* briefs filed in the case docket and accept the burden of post-processing the results to find the correct one.\n\n*   **Map the Political-Branch Ecosystem (Validated):** This heuristic's value is strongly validated. My strategic identification of the SG as the key actor was correct. The failure is purely tactical\u2014an inability to execute the data acquisition\u2014which reinforces the importance of having a sound strategy to guide the tactics.\n\n*   **Build a Dialectical Map (Validated):** The map's stability and structure are what allowed me to instantly recognize\u2014twice\u2014that the received document was redundant information. This proves the map is a robust framework for rapidly contextualizing incoming data and identifying when new information is signal versus noise.\n\n*   **Identify the \"Lynchpin Case\" (Reinforced):** This heuristic remains central.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My strategic pivot to a high-recall search has been exceptionally fruitful, resolving the central uncertainties that had previously stalled my analysis. The acquisition of numerous docket filings, most importantly the U.S. Solicitor General's reply brief and key amicus briefs, has fundamentally shifted my understanding of the case from a state of balanced uncertainty to a clear, weighted prediction.\n\nMy cumulative beliefs are now:\n\n*   **The Solicitor General's Stance (Resolved):** My hypothesis that the SG's position is the decisive variable has been confirmed, and that variable is now known. The United States has sided with the Fuld petitioners and argues for reversal. The SG's reply brief, filed by Acting SG Sarah M. Harris, lays out a multi-pronged argument that resolves my previous key questions:\n    *   **Doctrinal Alignment:** The government is advancing a theory of **constructive consent**, arguing that the PSJVTA \"fairly and reasonably deems respondents to consent to personal jurisdiction.\" They explicitly ground this in this Court's consent precedents, including `Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co.` and `Hess v. Pawloski`, arguing the respondents' conduct (making payments, operating in the U.S.) was voluntary and that deeming consent is not unfair or exorbitant. This places the government's considerable weight on the side of a robust consent doctrine in this context.\n    *   **Separation of Powers & Deference:** The government is strongly arguing for judicial deference to the political branches. The reply brief asserts that \"The political Branches\u2019 foreign-policy and national-security judgments carry great weight,\" citing `Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project`. This confirms my hypothesis that a deference argument would be a key part of the government's case.\n    *   **Constitutional Debate (5th vs. 14th Amendment):** The government explicitly argues that \"Congress in any event has broader authority than a State to provide for personal jurisdiction,\" and that the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments do not restrict personal jurisdiction in parallel. This aligns the SG with the Fuld petitioners' core structural argument.\n\n*   **Emergence of a New Dispositive Argument - \"Personhood\" (New & Significant):** The amicus brief from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, among others, has introduced a powerful and potentially dispositive argument that was only a peripheral possibility before: **that the PLO and PA are not \"persons\" entitled to due process protections under the Fifth Amendment.** This argument provides the Court with a potential \"off-ramp\" to reverse the Second Circuit's decision without needing to delve into the complexities of `Mallory` or the precise contours of federal personal jurisdiction. The fact that a sophisticated and influential party like the Chamber is advancing this theory gives it significant weight.\n\n*   **The Dialectical Map - A Tectonic Shift:** The legal landscape is no longer a balanced scale. It is now heavily weighted in favor of reversal. The petitioners' position is supported by a powerful coalition including the U.S. Government and influential amici, presenting the Court with multiple, independent grounds for reversal:\n    1.  **Originalism:** The Fifth Amendment's original public meaning did not limit personal jurisdiction (advanced by Fuld petitioners and Prof. Stephen Sachs).\n    2.  **Constructive Consent:** The PSJVTA is a valid \"consent-by-conduct\" statute under the `Mallory` framework (advanced by the SG).\n    3.  **Federal vs. State Power:** The Fifth Amendment is more permissive for Congress than the Fourteenth is for states (advanced by Fuld and the SG).\n    4.  **Foreign Policy Deference:** The judiciary should defer to the political branches' judgment on this national security matter (advanced by the SG).\n    5.  **Lack of \"Personhood\":** The respondents are not \"persons\" who can claim due process rights in this context (advanced by the Chamber of Commerce).\n\n*   **Prediction Update:** My prediction has shifted from high uncertainty to **high confidence in a reversal** of the Second Circuit's judgment. The sheer number of available paths to reversal, backed by a united front of the petitioners, the U.S. government, and key amici, makes the Second Circuit's holding appear highly vulnerable. The primary remaining uncertainty is not the outcome, but the *reasoning* the Court will adopt for its decision.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a wealth of information about effective information acquisition and analysis, leading to a significant evolution of my strategic principles.\n\nMy design beliefs have evolved to include:\n\n*   **Iterative Uncertainty Reduction with Escalation Pathways (Model Validated & Refined):** My refined model of `Assess -> Target -> Acquire -> Verify -> Escalate/Pivot on Failure` has been spectacularly validated. The initial, precise `Acquire` steps failed twice. The `Escalate/Pivot` to a high-recall, broad search (`CLOSED_SEARCH` for \"brief\" with a high `k`) was not just a workaround but a superior strategy. It yielded not only the primary target (the SG's arguments) but also a rich ecosystem of surrounding documents that were critical for a deep understanding. This confirms that **when precision fails, pivoting to recall is a high-value escalation pathway.**\n\n*   **Develop Sophisticated Query Heuristics (Principle Validated):** The success of the \"Recall Over Precision\" heuristic is now confirmed. My toolkit of query strategies is more robust. The failure of simple filtering and the success of a broad query demonstrate the need for methodological flexibility.\n\n*   **Analyze Procedural Documents for Substantive Clues (New Principle):** The respondents' motion for an extension to file an oversized brief was a procedural document, yet it contained the first concrete evidence of the SG's position and argumentative strategy. This establishes a new, vital principle: **Procedural filings are high-signal sources.** Motions, applications, and letters to the clerk can reveal an opponent's strategy, confirm the existence of documents, and expose the fault lines of the legal battle before the merits briefs are even fully analyzed. They must be prioritized for review.\n\n*   **Map the Amicus Landscape (New Principle):** The various amicus briefs were not merely duplicative. The Chamber of Commerce introduced a novel and powerful \"personhood\" argument. Professor Sachs provided deep originalist support. This demonstrates that amici can play a crucial role in shaping the legal battlefield. My model must now include the heuristic: **Actively map the arguments of key amici to identify novel legal theories, specialized support for a party's main arguments, and the strategic division of labor among allies.**\n\n*   **Model the Reliability of Tools (Belief Confirmed):** My belief that the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool struggles to distinguish between parties in a consolidated case caption is reinforced. The initial failures were due to this specific limitation. The successful pivot to a broad query and manual filtering is the correct workaround for this tool's known failure mode.\n\n*   **Build a Dialectical Map (Validated):** The pre-existing map of the case's core conflicts was indispensable. It provided the structure to instantly contextualize the flood of new information from the SG and amicus briefs. I could immediately see how the SG's arguments resolved my specific uncertainties regarding doctrinal alignment and deference. The map is a dynamic framework for strategic analysis, not just a static summary.\n\n*   **Identify the \"Lynchpin Case\" (Reinforced):** My focus on the `Mallory` / `Ins. Corp. of Ireland` tension was correct. The SG's reply brief and multiple amicus briefs engaged directly with this tension, confirming it as a central doctrinal battleground. This heuristic remains a highly effective way to focus analysis on the most critical legal questions.\n\n*   **Prioritize Primary Source Documents & Source Authentication (Principle Hardened):** This remains a core doctrine. The pivot to a broad search was an attempt to acquire primary sources, and its success reinforces this principle. The ability to read the SG's and amici's own words, rather than relying on summaries, was what enabled the breakthrough in understanding."

I hypothesized that the Solicitor General's stance would be a decisive variable.\n\n*   **The Solicitor General's Stance (Resolved):** My strategic pivot to a high-recall search successfully acquired the SG's reply brief.

Co.` and `Hess v. Pawloski`.\n    *   A strong argument for **judicial deference** to the political branches' foreign policy and national security judgments, citing `Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project`.\n    *   A structural argument that **Congress has broader authority** under the Fifth Amendment to establish personal jurisdiction than states have under the Fourteenth.\n\n*   **Emergence of a Dispositive \"Off-Ramp\" Argument (New & Significant):** The amicus brief from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce introduced a powerful new argument: that the PLO and PA are not \"persons\" entitled to Fifth Amendment due process protections. This provides the Court an alternative basis for reversal that avoids the more complex questions of consent and federal jurisdiction.\n\n*   **The Dialectical Map - A Tectonic Shift:** The legal landscape is now overwhelmingly weighted in favor of reversal.

The sheer number and weight of the arguments for reversal, coming from a united front of powerful actors, makes the outcome highly probable. The primary remaining uncertainty is not *if* the Court will reverse, but *which of the five paths* it will choose for its reasoning.

When precision-based acquisition failed, the `Escalate/Pivot` to a high-recall search was a superior strategy, yielding not just the target document but a rich ecosystem of crucial amicus briefs. This confirms that **pivoting from precision to recall is a high-value escalation pathway when initial searches fail.**\n\n*   **Develop Sophisticated Query Heuristics (Validated):** The \"Recall Over Precision\" heuristic is now a confirmed, effective strategy for overcoming tool limitations or when the exact document title is unknown.\n\n*   **Analyze Procedural Documents for Substantive Clues (New Principle):** The respondents' motion for an extension to file an oversized brief provided the first concrete signal of the SG's position. This established the principle: **Procedural filings are high-signal sources that can reveal opponent strategy and key case dynamics.**\n\n*   **Map the Amicus Landscape (New Principle):** Amicus briefs proved to be a source of novel and potentially dispositive arguments (e.g., the Chamber of Commerce's \"personhood\" theory).
