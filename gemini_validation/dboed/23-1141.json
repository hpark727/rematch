    "legal_questions": [
      "Can U.S. gun manufacturers be held liable for violence in Mexico under theories of proximate causation and aiding and abetting, based on their domestic production and sale of firearms that are later trafficked to Mexican cartels?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "The Mexican government sued several U.S. gun manufacturers in federal court, alleging their practices facilitated illegal gun trafficking to Mexican drug cartels, causing harm to Mexico. The defendants moved to dismiss, arguing the lawsuit was barred by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), which prohibits certain lawsuits against gun manufacturers. The district court dismissed the case, holding that the PLCAA applied and barred Mexico's claims. Mexico appealed.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit reversed, holding that while the PLCAA does apply to lawsuits by foreign governments for harm suffered abroad, Mexico\u2019s lawsuit falls within the statute\u2019s \u201cpredicate exception\u201d for claims alleging knowing violations of laws applicable to gun sales. The court found Mexico adequately alleged that the defendants aided and abetted illegal gun trafficking in violation of U.S. laws, and that this proximately caused harm to Mexico. The court rejected the defendants\u2019 arguments that the causal chain was too attenuated, finding Mexico plausibly alleged direct harm from having to combat well-armed cartels. The court remanded the case for further proceedings, allowing Mexico's lawsuit to move forward.",

This case involves the interpretation of a federal statute, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), and principles of proximate causation and extraterritoriality. I have very little information about the specific legal arguments or the general principles that might guide the Court's decision.\n\nTo maximize information gain for both the specific task (\u03b8) and my general prediction methodology (D), I need a structured approach.\n\n1.  **Understand the core legal dispute (\u03b8):** The immediate priority is to understand the precise legal arguments being made by the petitioners (Smith & Wesson et al.) and the respondent (Mexico). The case summary mentions the PLCAA's \"predicate exception.\" I need to know what that is, how the First Circuit interpreted it, and why the petitioners believe that interpretation is wrong. The best source for this is the petition for a writ of certiorari, which outlines the petitioners' reasons for why the Supreme Court should take the case and reverse the lower court.\n\n2.  **Identify influential factors (D):** While gathering case-specific facts, I should also consider what general factors are predictive of SCOTUS outcomes. These could include:\n    *   The position of the U.S. Solicitor General.\n    *   The judicial philosophies of the justices (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism) when it comes to statutory interpretation.\n    *   The Court's general stance on corporate liability and extraterritorial application of U.S. law.\n\n**Plan:**\n1.  Start by searching the `docket_files` to retrieve the petitioners' main brief (or the petition for certiorari if a merits brief isn't available). This will provide the core legal arguments and the specific statutory language at issue, giving me a strong foundation in the case-specific parameters (\u03b8).\n2.  Next, I will search for the respondent's brief to understand the counterarguments.\n3.  Then, I will look for any brief filed by the Solicitor General, as their position is often highly influential (a D-related heuristic).\n4.  After understanding the specific arguments, I will use `metadocuments` to search for broader legal principles and predictive patterns related to statutory interpretation, the PLCAA, and proximate cause to refine my prediction model (D).\n\nMy first action will be to search for the petitioners' brief to establish a baseline understanding of their legal challenge.",

      "eig_reasoning": "This THINK action represents a crucial planning step that moves the agent from a state of zero knowledge to having a highly structured and efficient plan for information acquisition. \n\nTask EIG is very high (0.9) because the plan correctly identifies the most direct path to reducing uncertainty about the case-specific parameters (\u03b8). By prioritizing the retrieval of the petitioners' brief, the agent will gain immediate access to the core legal arguments, the specific statutory language being contested (the PLCAA's predicate exception), and the reasons for the appeal. This is the single most informative first step to understanding the task.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because the plan explicitly incorporates strategies for meta-learning about SCOTUS prediction (D). It identifies generally influential factors like the Solicitor General's position, judicial philosophies (textualism vs. purposivism), and broader legal trends (extraterritoriality). The plan to actively seek out this information (e.g., the SG brief, metadocument searches) demonstrates a sophisticated approach to building a generalizable predictive model, not just a case-specific one.\n\nJoint EIG is exceptionally high (1.7) because the plan is not only comprehensive but also synergistic. Understanding the specific legal arguments (\u03b8) provides the necessary context to evaluate the impact of the justices' philosophies and other D-level factors. This well-reasoned plan maximizes the potential for information gain in all subsequent actions, making it a near-optimal starting point.",

According to Mexico, America\u2019s firearms \ncompanies have engaged in a series of business \npractices for decades\u2014from selling semi-automatic \nrifles, to making magazines that hold over ten rounds, \nto failing to impose various sales restrictions\u2014that \nhave created a supply of firearms later smuggled \nacross the border and ultimately used by the cartels \nto commit crimes. Mexico asks for billions of dollars in \ndamages, plus extensive injunctive relief imposing \nnew gun-control measures in the United States. \nThe district court dismissed the case under the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), \nwhich \ngenerally \nbars \nsuits \nagainst \nfirearms \ncompanies based on criminals misusing their \nproducts. But the First Circuit reversed. It held that \nPLCAA does not bar this suit because Mexico stated a \nclaim that defendants\u2019 business practices have aided \nand abetted firearms trafficking to the cartels, \nproximately harming the Mexican government. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether the production and sale of firearms in \nthe United States is the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of alleged \ninjuries to the Mexican government stemming from \nviolence committed by drug cartels in Mexico. \n2. Whether the production and sale of firearms in \nthe United States amounts to \u201caiding and abetting\u201d \nillegal \nfirearms \ntrafficking \nbecause \nfirearms \ncompanies allegedly know that some of their products \nare unlawfully trafficked. \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.; Barrett \nFirearms Manufacturing, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A.

Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on \nJanuary 22, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe government of Mexico has sued America\u2019s \nleading firearms companies, seeking to hold them \nliable for violence perpetrated in Mexico by Mexican \ndrug cartels. It accuses the companies of aiding and \nabetting those cartels for decades\u2014all under the nose \nof the U.S. government, every U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, \nand every state regulator. For this, the Mexican \ngovernment seeks billions of dollars in damages, plus \nfar-reaching injunctive relief that would reshape the \nlandscape of American firearms regulation\u2014from a \nban on what it calls \u201cassault weapons\u201d to a court-\nenforced system of universal background checks. \nTo be clear, Mexico\u2019s complaint does not include any \ngroundbreaking factual revelations, nor does it \nuncover any secret dealings between the cartels and \nAmerica\u2019s firearms companies. Instead, Mexico\u2019s suit \nchallenges how the American firearms industry has \nopenly operated in broad daylight for years. It faults \nthe defendants for producing common firearms like \nthe AR-15; for allowing their products to hold more \nthan ten rounds; for failing to restrict the purchase of \nfirearms by regular citizens; and for refusing to go \nbeyond what American law already requires for the \nsafe production and sale of firearms. \nIn Mexico\u2019s eyes, continuing these lawful practices \namounts to aiding and abetting the cartels. According \nto Mexico, American firearms companies are liable \nbecause they have refused to adopt policies to curtail \nthe supply of firearms smuggled south\u2014such as \nmaking only \u201csporting rifles,\u201d or cabining sales to \nthose with a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for a firearm (as \ndefined by Mexico). Pet.App.95a, 104a (\u00b6\u00b6 285, 315). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nMexico\u2019s suit has no business in an American court. \nThe federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct (PLCAA) precludes civil suits seeking to hold \nfirearms companies liable for harms stemming from \nthe downstream criminal misuse of their products. \nAnd it is nearly impossible to imagine a suit that is \nmore clearly barred by PLCAA than this one. \nThe district court agreed, dismissing this case in \nfull. But the First Circuit reversed. It held that \nMexico\u2019s lawsuit qualified for an exception to PLCAA, \nwhich narrowly authorizes suits alleging knowing \nviolations of firearms laws that proximately cause a \nplaintiff\u2019s injuries. To fit within that exception, the \nFirst Circuit held that Mexico plausibly alleged \nAmerica\u2019s firearms companies have violated the \nfederal law against aiding and abetting firearms \ntrafficking\u2014and that their regular business practices \nare the proximate cause of the many diffuse harms \nand costs that Mexico incurs from cartel violence. \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision cannot stand. It defies \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and creates an admitted split \nwith a unanimous Third Circuit decision joined by \nthen-Judge Alito, as well as the decisions of multiple \ncircuits and state high courts. \nThe courts on the other side of the split have it \nright. Applying long-settled principles of proximate \ncause, those courts have dismissed multiple suits \nraising similar claims filed by domestic governments. \nThis suit is even more clearly foreclosed, as it was filed \nby a foreign government, resting on an even more \nattenuated causal chain, punctuated by multiple \nindependent criminal acts, including third-party \nsmuggling across an international border. The First \n\n \n4 \n \n \nCircuit\u2019s contrary holding eviscerates PLCAA\u2019s \nexpress statutory requirement of proximate cause. \nIndeed, if proximate cause tolerates this suit\u2014which \nrests on an eight-step Rube Goldberg, starting with \nthe lawful production and sale of firearms in the \nUnited States, and ending with the harms that drug \ncartels inflict on the Mexican government\u2014then it is \nhard to imagine what it would not allow.  \nThe First Circuit\u2019s aiding-and-abetting holding \nfares no better. As this Court made clear last Term, \naiding and abetting criminal activity must involve \nsomething more than making products generally \navailable while knowing that criminals may misuse \nsome of them downstream. Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023). But Mexico\u2019s complaint alleges \nnothing more than that. It fails to identify any \nproduct, policy, or action by the American firearms \nindustry that is deliberately designed to facilitate the \nunlawful activities of Mexican drug cartels. Instead, \nthe theory of the complaint is that the defendants \nmake firearms available knowing that some will be \nunlawfully smuggled abroad and put to criminal use, \nand that they could be doing more to stop the problem. \nIn allowing this type of passive aiding-and-abetting \ntheory to proceed, the First Circuit defied this Court\u2019s \nunanimous decision in Taamneh.  \nThis Court\u2019s review is warranted. The First \nCircuit\u2019s decision creates a direct and admitted split \non proximate cause, and it brazenly defies this Court\u2019s \nprecedent on aiding and abetting. Both present \nimportant questions of federal law with serious \nimplications well beyond the firearms industry, \naffecting every business whose products might be \ncriminally misused downstream.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe stakes of this case underscore why review is \nneeded. Absent this Court\u2019s intervention, Mexico\u2019s \nmulti-billion-dollar suit will hang over the American \nfirearms industry for years, inflicting costly and \nintrusive discovery at the hands of a foreign sovereign \nthat is trying to bully the industry into adopting a host \nof gun-control measures that have been repeatedly \nrejected by American voters. Worse, so long as the \ndecision below remains good law, scores of similar \nsuits are destined to follow from other governments, \nboth foreign and domestic\u2014all seeking to distract \nfrom their own political failings by laying the blame \nfor criminal violence at the feet of the American \nfirearms industry. Even if ultimately unsuccessful, \nthe costs of that litigation will be devastating\u2014not \nonly for defendants, but more importantly for the \nmillions of law-abiding Americans who rely on the \nfirearms industry to effectively exercise their Second \nAmendment rights. This type of lawfare is exactly \nwhat Congress enacted PLCAA to avoid.  \nAt bottom, this case reduces to a clash of national \nvalues: Mexico makes no secret that it abhors this \ncountry\u2019s approach to firearms, and that it wants to \nuse the American court system to impose domestic \ngun controls on the United States that the American \npeople themselves would never accept through the \nordinary political process. But even though that \ngrievance is placed under the lettering of a complaint, \nand was filed on a docket, it has no basis in law. This \nCourt\u2019s review is badly needed. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \nIn 2005, Congress passed, and President George W. \nBush signed, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. The law was designed to address a specific \nproblem: Around the turn of the century, a growing \nnumber of individuals and governmental entities had \nsued members of America\u2019s firearms industry seeking \nto hold them liable for harms resulting from the \ncriminal misuse of their products. 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(3). Congress sought to end this. In PLCAA, \nit declared that law-abiding firearm companies should \nnot be \u201cliable for the harm caused by those who \ncriminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(5). If a manufacturer or dealer complies \nwith the \u201cheav[y]\u201d array of federal, state, and local \n\u201claws\u201d specifically regulating the sale and marketing \nof firearms, id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4), then it should not be held \nliable in any \u201ccivil action\u201d based on injuries \u201cresulting \nfrom the criminal or unlawful misuse\u201d of its product, \nid. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). PLCAA thus creates a threshold \nstatutory immunity: no covered action may be \n\u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany Federal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902. \nTo be sure, PLCAA is not a blanket shield from any \nand all liability. If a member of the firearms industry \nviolates the law, the Act\u2019s shield may lift. As relevant \nhere, PLCAA provides an exception\u2014the \u201cpredicate \nexception\u201d\u2014for when a company (i) \u201cknowingly\u201d \nviolates a state or federal firearms law, and (ii) that \nviolation \u201cwas a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSince being enacted, PLCAA has been faithfully \napplied to bar suits by American governmental \nentities, see, e.g., City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 524 F.3d 384, 391 (2d Cir. 2008), and by \nAmerican citizens, see e.g., Ileto v. Glock, Inc., 565 \nF.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir. 2009), which have tried to \nhold law-abiding members of the firearms industry \nliable for the criminal misuse of their products. \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nMexico boasts some of the strictest gun laws in the \nworld. See, e.g., Pet.App.146a (\u00b6 397). The country has \nonly one firearm store\u2014and it is located on a military \nbase. At the same time, Mexico is presently suffering \na scourge of violence at the hands of its drug cartels. \nBut rather than take meaningful steps to solve that \nproblem\u2014improving border security, rooting out \npublic corruption, and adequately supporting its \npolice, for starters\u2014the country has instead turned to \nlitigation. \nIn August 2021, the Mexican government, invoking \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, sued seven American firearm \nmanufacturers and one firearm distributor, seeking to \nhold them liable for the violence perpetrated in \nMexico by Mexican drug cartels. \nOf course, Mexico does not allege that any \ndefendant works with Mexico\u2019s drug cartels; has tried \nto arm anyone affiliated with the cartels; or otherwise \ndirectly facilitates any of the cartels\u2019 operations. \nInstead, the complaint claims that the American \nfirearms industry is aiding and abetting Mexico\u2019s \ncartels by continuing certain business practices, \naware that the cartels have been able to obtain \notherwise lawful firearms that are smuggled across \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe border by third-party criminals. See, e.g., \nPet.App.79a (\u00b6\u00b6 227-230); see also id. at 12a, 16a, 24a, \n32a-33a, 41a-42a, 46a, 49a, 141a (\u00b6\u00b6 15, 28, 50, 82, \n86, 106, 108, 110, 123, 130, 383) (alleging a \u201csee-no-\nevil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil approach\u201d). The core \nof the complaint is that the firearm companies are \naware that the cartels obtain these smuggled \nAmerican firearms, yet have failed to take a variety of \naffirmative measures that would allegedly help stem \nthe problem, because doing so would allegedly hurt \nthe companies\u2019 balance sheets. \nTo support its charge that the firearms industry has \n\u201cactively assisted and facilitated\u201d terrorist groups \nsouth of the border for multiple decades, Pet.App.79a \n(\u00b6 227), Mexico points to four sets of policies. \nPet.App.301a. To be clear, Mexico does not allege that \nany defendant adopted any one of these policies in \norder to facilitate cartel violence in Mexico; instead, \nMexico alleges that the defendants have continued \nthese practices so as to boost their bottom lines, \nindifferent to the downstream effects. \nDesign Decisions. Mexico foremost takes issue \nwith defendants\u2019 decisions to keep making and selling \nwhat it calls \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons,\u201d \nPet.App.93a-95a (\u00b6\u00b6 280-82)\u2014or as the Constitution \nwould put it, \u201cArms.\u201d Among other things, Mexico \nfaults the defendants for manufacturing America\u2019s \nmost popular rifle, the AR-15 (\u00b6 282); producing what \nit labels \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines (\u00b6 288) (which are \nin fact standard-capacity magazines); and continuing \nto make other firearms, like sniper rifles (\u00b6 292). \nPet.App.94a-98a. Mexico says that it is tortious for the \ndefendants to make these arms available to the \ngeneral public, as opposed to \u201climit[ing] their sales\u201d to \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe military and \u201cperhaps some law enforcement \nunits.\u201d Pet.App.104a (\u00b6\u00b6 314, 317). \nMarketing Decisions. Mexico also alleges that \ndefendants engage in \u201cmarketing techniques\u201d that \nappeal to criminal groups. Mexico does not claim that \ndefendants specifically target the cartels with \nadvertisements (or advertise at all in Mexico); nor \ndoes Mexico dispute the district court\u2019s holding that \nthe defendants\u2019 ads are neither false nor misleading. \nRather, Mexico alleges that defendants routinely \nshow their firearms have \u201cmilitary-like applications,\u201d \nand associate them with the \u201cpolice and military.\u201d \nPet.App.104a-121a (\u00b6\u00b6 323, 329). And these ads\u2014\neven if directed to Americans in Ohio\u2014have allegedly \ndriven demand in Tijuana, because cartels have \ngravitated to their brands. Pet.App.121a (\u00b6 331). \nDistribution \nDecisions. \nMexico \nfurther \nmaintains that the defendants have aided-and-\nabetted the cartels by participating in the \u201cthree-tier \ndistribution\u201d system, presently sanctioned by the U.S. \nFederal Government. Pet.App.140a (\u00b6 378). Within \nthis system, firearm manufacturers sell to federally \nlicensed wholesalers, who then sell to federally \nlicensed retail dealers, who then sell to retail \ncustomers, with each tier being heavily regulated by \nthe Federal Government.1 According to Mexico, it is \nthe defendants\u2019 policy to sell to \u201canyone with a U.S. \nfederal \nlicense,\u201d \nPet.App.79a \n(\u00b6 228)\u2014i.e., \nany \nwholesaler or dealer approved by the United States. \n \n1 All defendants except Witmer Public Safety Group, Inc., \nd/b/a Interstate Arms, are manufacturers; Interstate Arms is a \nwholesaler. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nMexico says this amounts to supporting the cartels. \nAccording to Mexico, while federal law allows \ndefendants to follow this three-tier system, it does not \ncompel them to do so; all the while, defendants are \naware that under this three-tier system, about 2% or \nso of American firearms are illegally trafficked into \nMexico each year. Pet.App.140a, 159a (\u00b6\u00b6 378; 437). \nMexico alleges that defendants have failed to go \nbeyond what the law demands, and have refused to \naugment this system with \u201cpublic-safety\u201d measures \nthat Mexico says would stem the illegal smuggling of \nfirearms across the southern border. Pet.App.79a \n(\u00b6 229). In particular, Mexico says that defendants \nshould be (i) requiring mandatory background checks \non secondary market sales (\u00b6 245, 369b); (ii) banning \nmultiple sales of firearms (\u00b6 245); (iii) creating a \nsystem to \u201csupervise\u201d the practice of \u201ckitchen table\u201d \nsales (\u00b6 264); and (iv) imposing unspecified \u201canti-theft \nmeasures\u201d to limit the impacts of stolen guns (\u00b6 269). \nPet.App.83a-84a, 89a-90a, 132a. \nMexico does not allege that any defendant sells \ndirectly to anyone it knows deals with the cartels. \nAfter all, most of the defendants do not sell to retailers \nat all. Pet.App.140a (\u00b6 378). Mexico also admits that \na majority of illegal firearms in that country are not \neven made or sold by defendants. Pet.App.159a \n(\u00b6 435). Rather, Mexico\u2019s central claim is that a \u201csmall \npercentage\u201d of dealers traffic \u201cvirtually all\u201d firearms \ngoing into Mexico, and that defendants have chosen to \n\u201cremain willfully blind\u201d as to who they might be. \nPet.App.44a-46a (\u00b6\u00b6 119, 123). \nManufacturing Decisions. Mexico last claims the \ndefendants have made their firearms too easy for \ncriminals to illegally modify or use\u2014and have failed \n\n \n11\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n117: 20240418144202341_Smith20_20Wesson20Cert20Petition20Appendix.json (score: 0.469)\nAPPENDIX \n \n\n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nAPPENDIX A: Plaintiff\u2019s Complaint in the United \nStates District Court For the District of \nMassachusetts (Aug. 4, 2021) ................................ 1a  \nAPPENDIX B: Memorandum and Order by the \nUnited States District Court For the District of \nMassachusetts (Sept. 30, 2022) .......................... 208a  \nAPPENDIX C: Opinion by the United States First \nCircuit Court of Appeals (Jan. 22, 2024) ........... 265a  \nAPPENDIX D: Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act (PLCAA) ............................................. 320a \n \n\n1a \n \n \nAPPENDIX A \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MASSACHUSETTS \nESTADOS UNIDOS \nMEXICANOS, \n \nPlaintiff, \nvs. \nSMITH & WESSON \nBRANDS, INC.; BARRETT \nFIREARMS \nMANUFACTURING, INC.; \nBERETTA U.S.A.

Almost all guns recovered \nat crime scenes in Mexico\u201470% to 90% of them\u2014\nwere trafficked from the U.S.  The Defendants \ninclude the six U.S.-based manufacturers whose \nguns are most often recovered in Mexico\u2014Smith & \nWesson, Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, and \nRuger.  Another manufacturer defendant is Barrett, \nwhose .50 caliber sniper rifle is a weapon of war \nprized by the drug cartels.  The remaining \ndefendant\u2014Interstate \nArms\u2014is \na \nBoston-area \nwholesaler through which all but one of the \ndefendant manufacturers sell their guns for re-sale \nto gun dealers throughout the U.S. \n2.  For decades the Government and its citizens \nhave been victimized by a deadly flood of military-\nstyle and other particularly lethal guns that flows \nfrom the U.S. across the border, into criminal hands \nin Mexico.  This flood is not a natural phenomenon \nor an inevitable consequence of the gun business or \nof U.S. gun laws.  It is the foreseeable result of the \nDefendants\u2019 \ndeliberate \nactions \nand \nbusiness \npractices. \n3.  Defendants design, market, distribute, and sell \nguns in ways they know routinely arm the drug \ncartels in Mexico.  Defendants use reckless and \ncorrupt gun dealers and dangerous and illegal sales \npractices that the cartels rely on to get their guns.  \n\n8a \n \n \nDefendants design these guns to be easily modified \nto fire automatically and to be readily transferable \non the criminal market in Mexico.  Defendants know \nhow to make and sell their guns to prevent this \nillegal trade; the U.S. government and a U.S. court \ntold \nthem \nhow. \n \nDefendants \ndefy \nthose \nrecommendations, and many others, and instead \nchoose to continue supplying the criminal gun \nmarket in Mexico\u2014because they profit from it. \n4.  The Government has strong domestic laws that \nmake it virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully \nobtain guns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in \nthe entire nation and issues fewer than 50 gun \npermits per year. \n5.  Defendants undermine these stringent laws, \nand wreak havoc in Mexican society, by persistently \nsupplying a torrent of guns to the drug cartels.  It is \nestimated that more than a half million guns \nannually are trafficked from the U.S. into Mexico.  \nDefendants produce more than 68% of those U.S.-\norigin trafficked guns, which means that they \nannually sell more than 340,000 guns that flow from \ntheir plants in Massachusetts and other U.S. states \nto criminals south of the border. \n6.  Defendants are fully on notice of the massive \ntrafficking of their guns into Mexico.  It has been \nextensively documented in news accounts, academic \nstudies, \ngovernment \nreports, \nUnited \nNations \ninquiries and reviews, and law enforcement \u201ctraces\u201d \nof guns from crime scenes in Mexico to the \nDefendants\u2019 factories in the U.S. \n7.  Despite this abundant notice, Defendants have \nnot \nimplemented \nany \npublic-safety-related \n\n9a \n \n \nmonitoring \nor \ndisciplining \ncontrols \non \ntheir \ndistribution systems\u2014none at all.  Their policy is to \nsell to any distributor or dealer that has a U.S. \nlicense to buy and sell the product, regardless of the \nbuyer\u2019s record of flouting the law and despite blazing \nred flags indicating that a gun dealer is conspiring \nwith \nstraw \npurchasers \nor \nothers \nto \ntraffic \nDefendants\u2019 guns into Mexico.  Defendants use this \nhead-in-the-sand approach to deny responsibility \nwhile knowingly profiting from the criminal trade. \n8.  Defendants exacerbate their refusal to monitor \nand discipline their distribution systems by \ndesigning military-style assault weapons and \nmarketing them in ways that attract and arm \nruthless transnational criminal organizations like \nthe drug cartels. \n9.  Defendant Barrett manufactures a .50 caliber \nsniper rifle that can shoot down helicopters and \npenetrate lightly armored vehicles and bullet-proof \nglass.  It has become one of the cartels\u2019 guns of \nchoice.  Barrett markets its sniper rifle as a weapon \nof war (\u201cwith confirmed hits out to 1800 meters, the \nBarrett model 82A1 is battle proven\u201d), but \nnevertheless sells it to the general public without \nrestriction.  Barrett knows that its dealers sell these \nmilitary guns to traffickers, often in bulk, to arm the \ncartels that use them to battle Mexican military and \npolice who are trying to stop the drug trade. \n10.  Defendant Century Arms imports into the \nU.S. from Romania a version of the AK-47 assault \nrifle, which it modifies to try to evade U.S. import \nrestrictions on assault weapons, and then sells them \ninto the \u201ccivilian\u201d market.  Century Arms has long \n\n10a \n \n \nknown that its WASR assault rifles are among the \ncartels\u2019 favorites. \n11.  Century Arms and the other Manufacturer \nDefendants specifically design their semi-automatic \nrifles for the battlefield rather than for sport, and \nmake them easily convertible into fully automatic \nmachine guns.  Defendants are well aware that the \ndrug cartels in fact routinely convert Defendants\u2019 \nassault rifles to fire automatically, with devastating \neffect in Mexico. \n12.  The link between Defendants\u2019 design, \ndistribution, and marketing practices and the \ndestruction wrought in Mexico is undeniable.  \nDuring the period 1999 to 2004\u2014when Defendants \nwere prohibited from selling assault weapons \nbecause they were banned in the U.S.\u2014gun \nproduction in the U.S. declined appreciably.  With \nthe ban\u2019s expiration in 2004, Defendants exploited \nthe \nopening \nto \nvastly \nincrease \nproduction, \nparticularly of the military-style assault weapons \nfavored by the drug cartels. \n13.  In a mirror image of that gun-production data, \nfrom 1999 to 2004 homicides in Mexico were \ndeclining.  But they then increased dramatically \nbeginning in 2004 exactly contemporaneously with \nDefendants\u2019 increased production, distribution, and \nmarketing of their military-grade weapons:\n\n11a \n \n \n\n12a \n \n \n14.  The consequences in Mexico have been dire.  \nIn addition to causing the exponential growth in the \nhomicide rate, Defendants\u2019 conduct has had an \noverall destabilizing effect on Mexican society.  Late \n2004 saw the drug cartels\u2019 first assassination of a \nMexican Mayor, followed in later years by their use \nof Defendants\u2019 military-style weapons to attack the \nMexican military and police, and by rampant \nincreases in other gun-related crimes such as \nextortion and kidnapping. \n15.  Defendants\u2019 willfully blind, standardless \ndistribution practices aid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico.  Defendants\u2019 \nunlawful conduct has substantially reduced the life \nexpectancy of Mexican citizens and cost the \nGovernment billions of dollars a year.  And armed \nwith Defendants\u2019 guns, the cartels have aggressively \nmarketed drugs such as fentanyl, destroying and \nending lives in and outside of Mexico, including in \nthe U.S.  Defendants\u2019 guns are the venom in the \nsnakes that are the drug cartels; without those guns, \nthey could be controlled and stopped. \n16. \n \nDefendants \nare \nnot \naccidental \nor \nunintentional players in this tragedy; they are \ndeliberate and willing participants, reaping profits \nfrom the criminal market they knowingly supply\u2014\nheedless of the shattering consequences to the \nGovernment and its citizens. \n17.  This need not happen.  In a 2003 domestic \npublic \nnuisance \ncase \nagainst \nU.S. \ngun \nmanufacturers \nand \ndistributors\u2014including \nDefendants Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, \n\n13a \n \n \nSmith & Wesson, Ruger, and Interstate\u2014the late \nUnited States District Court Judge Jack B. \nWeinstein found as a fact after a trial that \u201ceach \nmanufacturer should implement readily available \nreforms,\u201d including \u201cimposing liability insurance \nstandards; limiting sales at gun shows; limiting \nmultiple sales; limiting how the consumer gun \ntransaction can be conducted to insure security; \neducation and training of dealers; and monitoring \ndealers through visitation and other regular \ninteraction.\u201d NAACP v. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. \n2d 435, 523 (E.D.N.Y. 2003).  Gun industry insiders \nhave urged Defendants to make similar reforms. \n18.  In 2001, the U.S. federal government \nsimilarly called on Defendants to monitor, supervise, \nand set reasonable conditions for their distribution \nsystems to prevent supplying criminals.  Defendants \nrefused.  Defendant Smith & Wesson entered into a \nsettlement agreement with the United States and \nseveral \nU.S. \ncities, \ncommitting \nto \nspecific \ndistribution-system reforms designed to prevent \nsupplying guns to the criminal market.  Under \npressure from others in the industry, Smith & \nWesson reneged on the agreement. \n19.  Defendants instead closed ranks with other \nindustry participants to lobby the U.S. Congress for \nlegislation to protect them in certain instances from \nliability for domestic injuries resulting from their \nconduct.  Congress responded by enacting the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \n(\u201cPLCAA\u201d) in 2005, which protects gun companies \nfrom some liability for harm solely caused by the \nunlawful misuse of guns in the U.S. resulting in \ninjury in the U.S. \n\n14a \n \n \n20.  The United States is, of course, free to choose \nits social policy reflecting a balance between the \nfinancial interests of the gun industry and the rights \nof victims within its jurisdiction.  By the same token, \nhowever, the Government of Mexico is entitled to \nchoose a different social policy that reflects a \ndifferent balance between the interests of victims in \nMexico and the interests of gun manufacturers that \nforeseeably and deliberately cause trafficking of \ntheir guns into Mexico. \n21. \n \nDefendants \nknow \nthat \ntheir \nporous \ndistribution systems cause guns to be routinely \ntrafficked over the border into Mexico, resulting in \nvast and continual harm to the Government and its \npeople.  They therefore must monitor and discipline \nthose distribution systems to comply with not only \nU.S. law, but also the substantive law of Mexico, \nincluding its tort law. \n22.  The Supreme Court of the United States has \nrepeatedly held that, where conduct in one nation \ncauses injury in another the \u201cdefault rule for tort \ncases\u201d is that \u201cthe local law of the state where the \ninjury occurred determines the rights and liabilities \nof the parties,\u201d Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. \n692 (2004), and that \u201ca court will ordinarily apply \nforeign law to determine the tortfeasor\u2019s liability to \na plaintiff injured in a foreign country,\u201d RJR \nNabisco, Inc. v. European Community, 136 S. Ct. \n2090, 2109 (2016).  And RJR Nabisco emphasized \nthat where U.S.-based corporations cause injury \nabroad to foreign sovereigns, the U.S. Constitution \nand statutes allow those sovereigns to sue for \n\u201cviolations of their own laws and to invoke federal \n\n15a \n \n \ndiversity jurisdiction as a basis for proceeding in \nU.S. courts.\u201d Id. \n23.  The U.S. Congress honored this principle of \ntrans-national torts when it enacted PLCAA.  Even \nif applied, PLCAA would not bar the Government\u2019s \ncase.  But it does not apply because it bars certain \nclaims against gun manufacturers and distributors \nonly when the injury occurred in the U.S. and the \ncriminal\u2019s misuse of the gun was unlawful under \nU.S. domestic law.  The Government\u2019s injuries here \noccur in Mexico, and its claims result from unlawful \nmisuse of guns in Mexico, not in the U.S.  Every \naspect of PLCAA confirms that the U.S. Congress \nenacted that statute with only U.S. domestic \nconcerns in mind. \n24.  Just as Defendants may not dump toxic waste \nor other pollutants to poison Mexicans across the \nborder, they may not send their weapons of war into \nthe hands of the cartels, causing repeated and \ngrievous harm, and then claim immunity from \naccountability. \n25.  To be clear, this lawsuit does not challenge or \nquestion the law, policy, or actions of the United \nStates; the Government seeks to hold accountable \nand stop the reckless actions of private companies \nthat foreseeably send their guns into Mexico. \n26.  Likewise, this case has nothing to do with the \nSecond \nAmendment \nright \nof \nlaw-abiding, \nresponsible U.S. citizens to keep and bear arms \nwithin the U.S.  This case involves Defendants\u2019 \nsupplying their guns to law-breaking Mexican \nnationals and others in Mexico.  The cartels have no \n\n16a \n \n \nSecond Amendment rights, and the Defendants have \nno right to supply them. \n27.  The Government comes to this Court because, \nwhile the actionable harm occurs south of the U.S. \nborder, it is caused by Defendants\u2019 conduct north of \nthe border. \n28.  Defendant Smith & Wesson, for example, \nmakes decisions in Massachusetts to design, market, \nand distribute its guns in the reckless, dangerous \nways that supply traffickers and cartels.  Smith & \nWesson\u2019s decisions to renege on the reforms to which \nit had agreed with the U.S. government, and to use \ncorrupt dealers and high-risk business practices that \nit knows arm the cartels, all occur in the U.S.  This \nCourt can stop the flow of guns into Mexico at its \nsource in Massachusetts by requiring Smith & \nWesson to stop actively facilitating the criminal gun \ntrade into Mexico.  The same is true for the other \nDefendants. \n29.  The Government is entitled to that relief \nunder the substantive law of Mexico as well as under \nU.S. law. \nII.  PARTIES \n30.  Plaintiff Estados Unidos Mexicanos (the \n\u201cGovernment\u201d) is a sovereign nation that shares a \nborder with the United States.  The Government \nbrings this action in its own behalf.

According to Mexico, America\u2019s firearms \ncompanies have engaged in a series of business \npractices for decades\u2014from selling semi-automatic \nrifles, to making magazines that hold over ten rounds, \nto failing to impose various sales restrictions\u2014that \nhave created a supply of firearms later smuggled \nacross the border and ultimately used by the cartels \nto commit crimes. Mexico asks for billions of dollars in \ndamages, plus extensive injunctive relief imposing \nnew gun-control measures in the United States. \nThe district court dismissed the case under the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), \nwhich \ngenerally \nbars \nsuits \nagainst \nfirearms \ncompanies based on criminals misusing their \nproducts. But the First Circuit reversed. It held that \nPLCAA does not bar this suit because Mexico stated a \nclaim that defendants\u2019 business practices have aided \nand abetted firearms trafficking to the cartels, \nproximately harming the Mexican government. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether the production and sale of firearms in \nthe United States is the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of alleged \ninjuries to the Mexican government stemming from \nviolence committed by drug cartels in Mexico. \n2. Whether the production and sale of firearms in \nthe United States amounts to \u201caiding and abetting\u201d \nillegal \nfirearms \ntrafficking \nbecause \nfirearms \ncompanies allegedly know that some of their products \nare unlawfully trafficked. \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.; Barrett \nFirearms Manufacturing, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A.

Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered its judgment on \nJanuary 22, 2024. The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThe government of Mexico has sued America\u2019s \nleading firearms companies, seeking to hold them \nliable for violence perpetrated in Mexico by Mexican \ndrug cartels. It accuses the companies of aiding and \nabetting those cartels for decades\u2014all under the nose \nof the U.S. government, every U.S. Attorney\u2019s office, \nand every state regulator. For this, the Mexican \ngovernment seeks billions of dollars in damages, plus \nfar-reaching injunctive relief that would reshape the \nlandscape of American firearms regulation\u2014from a \nban on what it calls \u201cassault weapons\u201d to a court-\nenforced system of universal background checks. \nTo be clear, Mexico\u2019s complaint does not include any \ngroundbreaking factual revelations, nor does it \nuncover any secret dealings between the cartels and \nAmerica\u2019s firearms companies. Instead, Mexico\u2019s suit \nchallenges how the American firearms industry has \nopenly operated in broad daylight for years. It faults \nthe defendants for producing common firearms like \nthe AR-15; for allowing their products to hold more \nthan ten rounds; for failing to restrict the purchase of \nfirearms by regular citizens; and for refusing to go \nbeyond what American law already requires for the \nsafe production and sale of firearms. \nIn Mexico\u2019s eyes, continuing these lawful practices \namounts to aiding and abetting the cartels. According \nto Mexico, American firearms companies are liable \nbecause they have refused to adopt policies to curtail \nthe supply of firearms smuggled south\u2014such as \nmaking only \u201csporting rifles,\u201d or cabining sales to \nthose with a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for a firearm (as \ndefined by Mexico). Pet.App.95a, 104a (\u00b6\u00b6 285, 315). \n\n \n3 \n \n \nMexico\u2019s suit has no business in an American court. \nThe federal Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct (PLCAA) precludes civil suits seeking to hold \nfirearms companies liable for harms stemming from \nthe downstream criminal misuse of their products. \nAnd it is nearly impossible to imagine a suit that is \nmore clearly barred by PLCAA than this one. \nThe district court agreed, dismissing this case in \nfull. But the First Circuit reversed. It held that \nMexico\u2019s lawsuit qualified for an exception to PLCAA, \nwhich narrowly authorizes suits alleging knowing \nviolations of firearms laws that proximately cause a \nplaintiff\u2019s injuries. To fit within that exception, the \nFirst Circuit held that Mexico plausibly alleged \nAmerica\u2019s firearms companies have violated the \nfederal law against aiding and abetting firearms \ntrafficking\u2014and that their regular business practices \nare the proximate cause of the many diffuse harms \nand costs that Mexico incurs from cartel violence. \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision cannot stand. It defies \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and creates an admitted split \nwith a unanimous Third Circuit decision joined by \nthen-Judge Alito, as well as the decisions of multiple \ncircuits and state high courts. \nThe courts on the other side of the split have it \nright. Applying long-settled principles of proximate \ncause, those courts have dismissed multiple suits \nraising similar claims filed by domestic governments. \nThis suit is even more clearly foreclosed, as it was filed \nby a foreign government, resting on an even more \nattenuated causal chain, punctuated by multiple \nindependent criminal acts, including third-party \nsmuggling across an international border. The First \n\n \n4 \n \n \nCircuit\u2019s contrary holding eviscerates PLCAA\u2019s \nexpress statutory requirement of proximate cause. \nIndeed, if proximate cause tolerates this suit\u2014which \nrests on an eight-step Rube Goldberg, starting with \nthe lawful production and sale of firearms in the \nUnited States, and ending with the harms that drug \ncartels inflict on the Mexican government\u2014then it is \nhard to imagine what it would not allow.  \nThe First Circuit\u2019s aiding-and-abetting holding \nfares no better. As this Court made clear last Term, \naiding and abetting criminal activity must involve \nsomething more than making products generally \navailable while knowing that criminals may misuse \nsome of them downstream. Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023). But Mexico\u2019s complaint alleges \nnothing more than that. It fails to identify any \nproduct, policy, or action by the American firearms \nindustry that is deliberately designed to facilitate the \nunlawful activities of Mexican drug cartels. Instead, \nthe theory of the complaint is that the defendants \nmake firearms available knowing that some will be \nunlawfully smuggled abroad and put to criminal use, \nand that they could be doing more to stop the problem. \nIn allowing this type of passive aiding-and-abetting \ntheory to proceed, the First Circuit defied this Court\u2019s \nunanimous decision in Taamneh.  \nThis Court\u2019s review is warranted. The First \nCircuit\u2019s decision creates a direct and admitted split \non proximate cause, and it brazenly defies this Court\u2019s \nprecedent on aiding and abetting. Both present \nimportant questions of federal law with serious \nimplications well beyond the firearms industry, \naffecting every business whose products might be \ncriminally misused downstream.  \n\n \n5 \n \n \nThe stakes of this case underscore why review is \nneeded. Absent this Court\u2019s intervention, Mexico\u2019s \nmulti-billion-dollar suit will hang over the American \nfirearms industry for years, inflicting costly and \nintrusive discovery at the hands of a foreign sovereign \nthat is trying to bully the industry into adopting a host \nof gun-control measures that have been repeatedly \nrejected by American voters. Worse, so long as the \ndecision below remains good law, scores of similar \nsuits are destined to follow from other governments, \nboth foreign and domestic\u2014all seeking to distract \nfrom their own political failings by laying the blame \nfor criminal violence at the feet of the American \nfirearms industry. Even if ultimately unsuccessful, \nthe costs of that litigation will be devastating\u2014not \nonly for defendants, but more importantly for the \nmillions of law-abiding Americans who rely on the \nfirearms industry to effectively exercise their Second \nAmendment rights. This type of lawfare is exactly \nwhat Congress enacted PLCAA to avoid.  \nAt bottom, this case reduces to a clash of national \nvalues: Mexico makes no secret that it abhors this \ncountry\u2019s approach to firearms, and that it wants to \nuse the American court system to impose domestic \ngun controls on the United States that the American \npeople themselves would never accept through the \nordinary political process. But even though that \ngrievance is placed under the lettering of a complaint, \nand was filed on a docket, it has no basis in law. This \nCourt\u2019s review is badly needed. \n \n \n\n \n6 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \nIn 2005, Congress passed, and President George W. \nBush signed, the Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. The law was designed to address a specific \nproblem: Around the turn of the century, a growing \nnumber of individuals and governmental entities had \nsued members of America\u2019s firearms industry seeking \nto hold them liable for harms resulting from the \ncriminal misuse of their products. 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(3). Congress sought to end this. In PLCAA, \nit declared that law-abiding firearm companies should \nnot be \u201cliable for the harm caused by those who \ncriminally or unlawfully misuse firearm products.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(5). If a manufacturer or dealer complies \nwith the \u201cheav[y]\u201d array of federal, state, and local \n\u201claws\u201d specifically regulating the sale and marketing \nof firearms, id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4), then it should not be held \nliable in any \u201ccivil action\u201d based on injuries \u201cresulting \nfrom the criminal or unlawful misuse\u201d of its product, \nid. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). PLCAA thus creates a threshold \nstatutory immunity: no covered action may be \n\u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany Federal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902. \nTo be sure, PLCAA is not a blanket shield from any \nand all liability. If a member of the firearms industry \nviolates the law, the Act\u2019s shield may lift. As relevant \nhere, PLCAA provides an exception\u2014the \u201cpredicate \nexception\u201d\u2014for when a company (i) \u201cknowingly\u201d \nviolates a state or federal firearms law, and (ii) that \nviolation \u201cwas a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nSince being enacted, PLCAA has been faithfully \napplied to bar suits by American governmental \nentities, see, e.g., City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 524 F.3d 384, 391 (2d Cir. 2008), and by \nAmerican citizens, see e.g., Ileto v. Glock, Inc., 565 \nF.3d 1126, 1130 (9th Cir. 2009), which have tried to \nhold law-abiding members of the firearms industry \nliable for the criminal misuse of their products. \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nMexico boasts some of the strictest gun laws in the \nworld. See, e.g., Pet.App.146a (\u00b6 397). The country has \nonly one firearm store\u2014and it is located on a military \nbase. At the same time, Mexico is presently suffering \na scourge of violence at the hands of its drug cartels. \nBut rather than take meaningful steps to solve that \nproblem\u2014improving border security, rooting out \npublic corruption, and adequately supporting its \npolice, for starters\u2014the country has instead turned to \nlitigation. \nIn August 2021, the Mexican government, invoking \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332, sued seven American firearm \nmanufacturers and one firearm distributor, seeking to \nhold them liable for the violence perpetrated in \nMexico by Mexican drug cartels. \nOf course, Mexico does not allege that any \ndefendant works with Mexico\u2019s drug cartels; has tried \nto arm anyone affiliated with the cartels; or otherwise \ndirectly facilitates any of the cartels\u2019 operations. \nInstead, the complaint claims that the American \nfirearms industry is aiding and abetting Mexico\u2019s \ncartels by continuing certain business practices, \naware that the cartels have been able to obtain \notherwise lawful firearms that are smuggled across \n\n \n8 \n \n \nthe border by third-party criminals. See, e.g., \nPet.App.79a (\u00b6\u00b6 227-230); see also id. at 12a, 16a, 24a, \n32a-33a, 41a-42a, 46a, 49a, 141a (\u00b6\u00b6 15, 28, 50, 82, \n86, 106, 108, 110, 123, 130, 383) (alleging a \u201csee-no-\nevil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil approach\u201d). The core \nof the complaint is that the firearm companies are \naware that the cartels obtain these smuggled \nAmerican firearms, yet have failed to take a variety of \naffirmative measures that would allegedly help stem \nthe problem, because doing so would allegedly hurt \nthe companies\u2019 balance sheets. \nTo support its charge that the firearms industry has \n\u201cactively assisted and facilitated\u201d terrorist groups \nsouth of the border for multiple decades, Pet.App.79a \n(\u00b6 227), Mexico points to four sets of policies. \nPet.App.301a. To be clear, Mexico does not allege that \nany defendant adopted any one of these policies in \norder to facilitate cartel violence in Mexico; instead, \nMexico alleges that the defendants have continued \nthese practices so as to boost their bottom lines, \nindifferent to the downstream effects. \nDesign Decisions. Mexico foremost takes issue \nwith defendants\u2019 decisions to keep making and selling \nwhat it calls \u201cmilitary-style assault weapons,\u201d \nPet.App.93a-95a (\u00b6\u00b6 280-82)\u2014or as the Constitution \nwould put it, \u201cArms.\u201d Among other things, Mexico \nfaults the defendants for manufacturing America\u2019s \nmost popular rifle, the AR-15 (\u00b6 282); producing what \nit labels \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines (\u00b6 288) (which are \nin fact standard-capacity magazines); and continuing \nto make other firearms, like sniper rifles (\u00b6 292). \nPet.App.94a-98a. Mexico says that it is tortious for the \ndefendants to make these arms available to the \ngeneral public, as opposed to \u201climit[ing] their sales\u201d to \n\n \n9 \n \n \nthe military and \u201cperhaps some law enforcement \nunits.\u201d Pet.App.104a (\u00b6\u00b6 314, 317). \nMarketing Decisions. Mexico also alleges that \ndefendants engage in \u201cmarketing techniques\u201d that \nappeal to criminal groups. Mexico does not claim that \ndefendants specifically target the cartels with \nadvertisements (or advertise at all in Mexico); nor \ndoes Mexico dispute the district court\u2019s holding that \nthe defendants\u2019 ads are neither false nor misleading. \nRather, Mexico alleges that defendants routinely \nshow their firearms have \u201cmilitary-like applications,\u201d \nand associate them with the \u201cpolice and military.\u201d \nPet.App.104a-121a (\u00b6\u00b6 323, 329). And these ads\u2014\neven if directed to Americans in Ohio\u2014have allegedly \ndriven demand in Tijuana, because cartels have \ngravitated to their brands. Pet.App.121a (\u00b6 331). \nDistribution \nDecisions. \nMexico \nfurther \nmaintains that the defendants have aided-and-\nabetted the cartels by participating in the \u201cthree-tier \ndistribution\u201d system, presently sanctioned by the U.S. \nFederal Government. Pet.App.140a (\u00b6 378). Within \nthis system, firearm manufacturers sell to federally \nlicensed wholesalers, who then sell to federally \nlicensed retail dealers, who then sell to retail \ncustomers, with each tier being heavily regulated by \nthe Federal Government.1 According to Mexico, it is \nthe defendants\u2019 policy to sell to \u201canyone with a U.S. \nfederal \nlicense,\u201d \nPet.App.79a \n(\u00b6 228)\u2014i.e., \nany \nwholesaler or dealer approved by the United States. \n \n1 All defendants except Witmer Public Safety Group, Inc., \nd/b/a Interstate Arms, are manufacturers; Interstate Arms is a \nwholesaler. \n\n \n10 \n \n \nMexico says this amounts to supporting the cartels. \nAccording to Mexico, while federal law allows \ndefendants to follow this three-tier system, it does not \ncompel them to do so; all the while, defendants are \naware that under this three-tier system, about 2% or \nso of American firearms are illegally trafficked into \nMexico each year. Pet.App.140a, 159a (\u00b6\u00b6 378; 437). \nMexico alleges that defendants have failed to go \nbeyond what the law demands, and have refused to \naugment this system with \u201cpublic-safety\u201d measures \nthat Mexico says would stem the illegal smuggling of \nfirearms across the southern border. Pet.App.79a \n(\u00b6 229). In particular, Mexico says that defendants \nshould be (i) requiring mandatory background checks \non secondary market sales (\u00b6 245, 369b); (ii) banning \nmultiple sales of firearms (\u00b6 245); (iii) creating a \nsystem to \u201csupervise\u201d the practice of \u201ckitchen table\u201d \nsales (\u00b6 264); and (iv) imposing unspecified \u201canti-theft \nmeasures\u201d to limit the impacts of stolen guns (\u00b6 269). \nPet.App.83a-84a, 89a-90a, 132a. \nMexico does not allege that any defendant sells \ndirectly to anyone it knows deals with the cartels. \nAfter all, most of the defendants do not sell to retailers \nat all. Pet.App.140a (\u00b6 378). Mexico also admits that \na majority of illegal firearms in that country are not \neven made or sold by defendants. Pet.App.159a \n(\u00b6 435). Rather, Mexico\u2019s central claim is that a \u201csmall \npercentage\u201d of dealers traffic \u201cvirtually all\u201d firearms \ngoing into Mexico, and that defendants have chosen to \n\u201cremain willfully blind\u201d as to who they might be. \nPet.App.44a-46a (\u00b6\u00b6 119, 123). \nManufacturing Decisions. Mexico last claims the \ndefendants have made their firearms too easy for \ncriminals to illegally modify or use\u2014and have failed \n\n \n11 \n \n \nto make easy design changes, lest they dampen the \ncriminal market for their products. Here too, Mexico \ndoes not allege that defendants have violated any \nspecific law, rule, or regulation as to the design, \nmanufacture, or production of firearms. Instead, the \nthrust of Mexico\u2019s allegations is that the defendants \nhave refused to do more\u2014e.g., (i) turn their firearms \ninto \u201csmart guns\u201d that can only be used by their \nowner; (ii) create harder-to-defile serial numbers; and \n(iii) make their firearms (like AR-15s) more difficult \nto unlawfully modify or alter into machineguns. \nPet.App.98a, 129a-131a (\u00b6\u00b6 291, 359, 365).2 \nAll told, the upshot of Mexico\u2019s suit is simple \nenough: The American firearms industry should be \nresponsible for the cartel violence plaguing Mexico. \nBut the path it traces from the above activities to the \ncarnage down south is anything but. In fact, Mexico\u2019s \ncomplaint relies on an eight-step causal-chain to \nsupport its suit: \n1. The defendants sell firearms to independent \nfederally licensed wholesale distributors. \n2. Those distributors then sell those firearms to \nindependent federally licensed retail dealers. \n3. A subset of those retail dealers then sell the \nfirearms to individuals who have illegal \nintentions. \n4. Those individuals or their associates then \nillegally sell some of those firearms to \nsmugglers, or themselves smuggle the \nfirearms across the Mexican border. \n \n2 Mexico argued some of the defendants\u2019 firearms were illegal \nmachineguns. But the First Circuit rejected this. Pet.App.306a. \n\n \n12 \n \n \n5. Cartel members in Mexico then buy or \notherwise obtain the smuggled firearms. \n6. Cartel members then unlawfully use the \nfirearms in violent attacks in Mexico. \n7. Those attacks injure people and property in \nMexico. \n8. The Mexican government suffers some \nderivative fiscal harms addressing the \ninjuries inflicted and attempting to combat \nsimilar cartel violence. \nAs for the last item, Mexico claims the firearms \nindustry has caused it a wide range of harms\u2014from \nthe \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, to the \u201cresources\u201d it has \nhad to dedicate to that problem, to a good deal of \nrelated incidental harms, including \u201cdiminished \nproperty values.\u201d Pet.App.167a-169a (\u00b6\u00b6 447-49). \nIn light of these diffuse harms, the Mexican \ngovernment seeks far-reaching relief that it claims is \navailable under Mexican tort law\u2014which it says \nshould apply to defendants\u2019 conduct in the United \nStates because their firearms are ultimately used to \ninflict harms in Mexico. Pet.App.183a-195a (\u00b6\u00b6 506-\n60) (raising seven claims under Mexican law). Mexico \nasks for $10 billion in damages. See Pet.App.196a. \nAnd it seeks an injunction imposing a barrage of gun-\ncontrol policies, including (i) a ban on \u201cassault \nweapons,\u201d (ii) a ban on \u201clarge-capacity magazines,\u201d \nand (iii) strict limits on \u201cmultiple sales\u201d of firearms. \nPet.App.83a-84a, 132a-134a (\u00b6\u00b6 245, 369). In essence, \nMexico seeks to use Mexican tort laws to regulate how \nfirearms are made and sold in the United States. \n\n \n13 \n \n \nC. Procedural History. \nThe district court dismissed Mexico\u2019s suit in full. \nChief Judge Saylor held that PLCAA \u201cbars exactly \nthis type of action from being brought in [U.S.] \ncourts,\u201d and that no exception applied here. \nPet.App.233a. \nThe First Circuit reversed. The court rejected \nMexico\u2019s primary argument that PLCAA did not apply \nat \nall \nunder \nthe \nextraterritoriality \ndoctrine. \nPet.App.293a. But the court nevertheless went on to \nhold that Mexico\u2019s complaint survived because it \nsatisfied \nPLCAA\u2019s \n\u201cpredicate \nexception.\u201d \nIn \nparticular, the First Circuit found the complaint had \nplausibly alleged that the defendants were violating \nfederal law by aiding and abetting arms trafficking to \nthe cartels\u2014and that their conduct was a proximate \ncause of the diffuse injuries Mexico allegedly suffered \nas a result of cartel violence. Pet.App.306a, 318a. \nAs \nfor \nproximate \ncause, \nthe \nFirst \nCircuit \nacknowledged that it was splitting from the Third \nCircuit and other appellate courts that have rejected \nsimilar \nsuits \nfiled \nby \ndomestic \ngovernments. \nPet.App.314a. But the court held that Mexico\u2019s harms \nwere nonetheless a \u201cforeseeable\u201d consequence of \ndefendants\u2019 actions. Pet.App.310a. For instance, it \nreasoned that independent third-party criminal acts \ndid not break Mexico\u2019s causal chain, because it was \n\u201ccertainly foreseeable that Mexican drug cartels\u2014\narmed with defendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use those \nweapons to commit violent crimes.\u201d Pet.App.313a. \nAnd the court held that nothing more was required to \nsatisfy \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause.\u201d Pet.App.310a.n8. \n\n \n14 \n \n \nAs for aiding and abetting, the court recognized \nthat \u201cthe complaint does not allege defendants\u2019 \nawareness \nof \nany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. But it held that the defendants\u2019 \u201crole\u201d \nin the cartel violence was \u201cso systemic,\u201d that \ndefendants could be liable for \u201cevery wrongful act\u201d \ncommitted by the drug cartels. Pet.App.306a. Or as it \nput it elsewhere, it is \u201cnot implausible\u201d that the \nAmerican firearms industry has operated for decades \n\u201cin order to maintain [an] unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d \nPet.App.301a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision conflicts with multiple \ncircuits and state high courts, defies this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, and threatens severe consequences that \nreach far past the firearms industry. This Court\u2019s \nreview is needed. \nI. \nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S PROXIMATE CAUSE \nHOLDING CREATES A SPLIT AND CONFLICTS \nWITH THIS COURT\u2019S PRECEDENT. \nIn many ways, there is little new about Mexico\u2019s \nsuit: Several domestic governments have tried suing \nthe American firearms industry\u2014raising the same \nsorts of allegations, against many of the same \ndefendants\u2014seeking to hold them liable for criminal \nmisuse of their products. But courts have roundly \nrejected those gambits as too attenuated and too \nremote to satisfy long-established principles of \nproximate cause. \nThe fate of Mexico\u2019s suit should follow a fortiori: It \nis even more attenuated and more remote, as it relies \non a chain of causation that spans an international \nborder and involves foreign criminals committing \n\n \n15 \n \n \nforeign crimes on foreign soil causing injury to a \nforeign government. But the First Circuit let this \naction proceed. And in so doing\u2014by its own \nadmission\u2014it split from numerous other appellate \ncourts. \nIn fact, the First Circuit\u2019s position is a total outlier. \nAnd for good reason: As this Court\u2019s precedent shows, \nMexico\u2019s complaint harbors a law-school exam\u2019s worth \nof proximate cause infirmities. The First Circuit \nexcused those infirmities only by adopting a long-\ndiscredited view of proximate cause that requires only \n\u201cforeseeability,\u201d no matter how attenuated the causal \nchain may be. But that is the precise sort of analysis \nthis Court has repeatedly rejected. It should do so \nagain. \nA. The Decision Below Conflicts With \nMultiple \nCircuits \nand \nState \nHigh \nCourts. \n1. The First Circuit recognized that the PLCAA\u2019s \nexplicit proximate-cause requirement incorporates \n\u201ctraditional understandings of proximate cause.\u201d \nPet.App.310a.n8. It also recognized that other courts, \nincluding the Third Circuit and Connecticut Supreme \nCourt, have applied traditional proximate cause \ndoctrine to reject the exact same type of suit brought \nby other government entities. Pet.App.314a. But the \nFirst Circuit went ahead anyway, allowing the suit to \nproceed because it did not find the earlier decisions \n\u201cpersuasive.\u201d Pet.App.315a.  \nThird Circuit. In the 1990s, the City of \nPhiladelphia sued a group of firearm manufacturers \n(many of whom are also defendants here), seeking to \nhold them liable for local criminal violence. According \n\n \n16 \n \n \nto the complaint, the defendants there had engaged in \ncertain \u201cmarketing and distribution\u201d practices that \nthey knew led to downstream criminal activity. City of \nPhiladelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n419 (3d Cir. 2002); see also 126 F. Supp. 2d 882, 888 \n(E.D. Pa. 2000) (noting allegations that they (i) \nallowed customers to purchase multiple firearms; (ii) \nfailed to curb \u201cstraw purchas[es]\u201d; (iii) sold to all \nlicensed dealers; (iv) \u201cfail[ed] to monitor and \nsupervise\u201d dealers; and (v) used \u201cmarketing schemes\u201d \nthat appealed to criminals). \nWriting for a unanimous panel that included then-\nJudge Alito and Judge Ambro, Judge Greenberg \nexplained that the essence of proximate cause is a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d 277 F.3d at 423 (quoting \nHolmes v. Securities Investor Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. \n258, 268-69 (1992)). The court held the city failed that \nrequirement for four main reasons. \nFirst, the city\u2019s \u201clong and tortuous\u201d chain of \ncausation\u2014where firearms went from federally \nlicensed manufacturers, to wholesalers, to retailers, to \nstraw buyers, to criminals, who would then use them \nunlawfully, ultimately imposing costs on the city\u2014\nwas clearly \u201ctoo attenuated.\u201d 277 F.3d at 422-24.  \nSecond, \nthe \ncity\u2019s \ninjuries \nwere \nentirely \n\u201cderivative,\u201d as they were the byproducts of direct \ninjuries suffered by their citizens. Id. at 424-25. \nThird, the city\u2019s (already flawed) causal chain was \npunctuated by multiple \u201cindependent factors\u201d\u2014in \nparticular, third-party criminal behavior. Id. at 425. \n\n \n17 \n \n \nFourth, apportioning damages and liability would \nbe unworkable because the city\u2019s injuries were caused \nby multiple distinct causes and actors. Id. \nFor these reasons, the Third Circuit affirmed \ndismissal of the action. Id. \nConnecticut Supreme Court. Around the same \ntime, a municipality in Connecticut brought a similar \nsuit against many of the same defendants, alleging \nthat they had (i) made firearms too easy to alter; (ii) \n\u201cknowingly sold guns in a manner that foreseeably led \nto \u201cguns flowing into an illegal market,\u201d and (iii) failed \nto \u201cimplement sufficient controls over [their] methods \nof distribution.\u201d Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 108-09 (Conn. 2001). As above, the \nmunicipality sought relief for harms incurred due to \nlocal criminal violence. Id. at 109. And as above, the \nConnecticut Supreme Court rejected the suit for lack \nof proximate cause. Applying this Court\u2019s cases and \ntraditional proximate cause \u201cprinciples,\u201d the court \nunanimously concluded this type of claim is too \n\u201cindirect, remote, and derivative\u201d to be viable\u2014\ntracking the Third Circuit\u2019s reasoning. Id. at 123-28. \nIllinois Supreme Court. The Illinois Supreme \nCourt has followed the same path. The City of Chicago \nbrought the same type of suit: It claimed that a host \nof firearm manufacturers (again, many of whom are \ndefendants here) engaged in a series of design, \ndistribution, \nand \nmarketing \npractices \nthat \nundermined the city\u2019s \u201cstrict\u201d gun laws, and \ncontributed to the city\u2019s pervasive violence. City of \nChicago v. Beretta, U.S.A. Corp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, \n1107-08 (Ill. 2004) (detailing practices).  \n\n \n18 \n \n \nAnd again, the action was dismissed on proximate-\ncause grounds. The court observed that the firearms \nindustry is \u201chighly regulated,\u201d and that so long as the \ndefendants there engaged in \u201clawful commercial \nactivity\u201d within that market, such activity\u2014without \nmore\u2014is too \u201cremoved\u201d from the independent \ncriminal acts alleged by Chicago. Id. at 1135-37. \nD.C. Court of Appeals. The highest court in D.C. \nalso rejected a similar suit. Once more, the city alleged \nthat although it had strict gun laws, \u201cthere \nnonetheless exists an unchecked illegal flow of \nfirearms into the District to which the defendants by \naction and inaction have contributed.\u201d District of \nColumbia v. Beretta, U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d 633, 638 \n(D.C. 2005) (en banc). And once more, the court found \nproximate cause lacking. Citing the three decisions \nabove, the court reasoned that the \u201csheer number of \ncausal links\u201d made the claim far too attenuated to \npass muster. Id. at 648-49. Indeed, allowing such \nclaims would unduly \u201crelax\u201d the established \u201ccommon-\nlaw limitations of duty, foreseeability, and direct \ncausation.\u201d Id. at 650. \nOther Industries. The kind of action here is not \nunique to the firearms industry. Scores of plaintiffs\u2014\nincluding governments, both foreign and domestic\u2014 \nhave targeted other industries in analogous suits, \nseeking damages for the distant repercussions of their \nproducts\u2019 downstream misuse. But courts have \nroutinely rejected these sorts of claims, universally \ninvoking proximate cause principles that conflict \ndirectly with the First Circuit\u2019s analysis. \nThese cases include lawsuits against various \nindustries:  \n\n \n19 \n \n \n\u2022 tobacco, Ganim, 780 A.2d at 122 & n.11 \n(collecting six circuit courts that have held \u201cthe \nfinancial harms alleged by the plaintiffs\u201d\u2014\ntypically, health insurers and plans\u2014were too \n\u201cremote, derivative, and indirect\u201d); State of Sao \nPaulo v. American Tobacco Co., 919 A.2d 1116, \n1126 (Del. 2007) (rejecting similar suit by \nforeign government);  \n\u2022 finance, City of Cincinnati v. Deutsche Bank \nNat. Trust Co., 863 F.3d 474, 480 (6th Cir. \n2017) (Sutton, J.) (post-2008 mortgages); City of \nCleveland v. AmeriQuest Mortgage Securities, \nInc., 615 F.3d 496, 498 (6th Cir. 2010) \n(subprime lending);  \n\u2022 lead paint, State v. Lead Industries, Ass\u2019n, Inc., \n951 A.2d 428, 457 (R.I. 2008);  \n\u2022 and pharmaceuticals, Ashley Cnty. v. Pfizer, \nInc., 552 F.3d 659, 667-73 (8th Cir. 2009) \n(products used to make methamphetamine). \nThere is no doubt that Mexico\u2019s complaint would be \ndismissed in all of the courts above. Those courts all \napplied traditional proximate-cause principles to \nreject suits far less attenuated and far less remote \nthan this one. But again, Mexico\u2019s chain-of-causation \nhas even more links, as American firearms must be \nsmuggled across the border, purchased by foreign \ncartels, and then used to commit criminal acts abroad \nthat later result in expenditures of money by a foreign \ngovernment. If the above suits lack the \u201cdirect \nrelation\u201d needed for proximate cause, Holmes, 503 \nU.S. at 268, Mexico\u2019s is not close. \n2. Yet in the decision below, the First Circuit held \nthat proximate cause was satisfied because Mexico\u2019s \n\n \n20 \n \n \ninjuries were a \u201cforeseeable\u201d result of the defendants\u2019 \nactions. Pet.App.313a. The only circuit or state high \ncourt it could muster was the 4-3 decision in \nCincinnati v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 \n(Ohio 2002). Pet.App.315a. But that case is hardly a \nmodel, as Ohio\u2019s legislature promptly overturned it. \nSee \n2006 \nOhio \nLaws \n2278-79. \nThe \nelected \nrepresentatives of Ohio thus apparently agreed with \nthe dissent that allowing this type of claim would \ncreate a new doctrinal \u201cmonster\u201d that would \u201cdevour \nin one gulp the entire law of tort.\u201d Cincinnati, 768 \nN.E.2d at 1157-58 (Cook, J., dissenting). \nOther than that, the First Circuit relied mostly on \nan unpublished trial court decision out of Boston, \nfinding its \u201creasoning\u201d more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than the \nThird Circuit\u2019s. Pet.App.315a. But that decision had \nvirtually no reasoning at all. The court there \nrecognized that the plaintiffs\u2019 theory of liability was \n\u201cextreme,\u201d but asserted (with little more) that \u201ca \nmotion to dismiss is not the proper vehicle to \nchallenge [it].\u201d City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *7 (Mass. Super. Ct. July \n13, 2000). That makes little sense: \u201cIf a plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations, taken as true, are insufficient to establish \nproximate causation, then the complaint must be \ndismissed.\u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 134 n.7 (2014). \nB. The Decision Below Conflicts With This \nCourt\u2019s Precedents. \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision also conflicts with this \nCourt\u2019s precedents on proximate cause. \n1. PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception allows claims only \nif the \u201cviolation\u201d of a firearm statute \u201cwas a proximate \n\n \n21 \n \n \ncause of the harm for which relief is sought.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). And as this Court has recognized, \n\u201cwe assume\u201d that Congress incorporated \u201cthe \ncommon-law rule\u201d of proximate cause absent a reason \nto think otherwise. Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 132. Under \nthat traditional approach to proximate cause, \nMexico\u2019s complaint fails for at least four reasons. \nFirst, the chain of causation is too attenuated. This \nCourt has repeatedly emphasized the \u201cgeneral \ntendency of the law\u201d is not to stretch proximate cause \n\u201cbeyond the first step.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 271. This \nCourt has thus repeatedly rejected multi-step causal \nchains, even when they involved far fewer steps than \nthe one here. See, e.g., Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New \nYork, 559 U.S. 1, 9-10 (2010) (six steps); Anza v. Ideal \nSteel Supply Corp., 547 U.S. 451, 457-59 (2006) (two); \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 262-63 (four). In this case, Mexico \nrelies on an eight-step chain of causation peppered \nwith bank shots and border crossings. If this satisfies \nthe \u201cdirect relationship requirement,\u201d then the limit \nis meaningless. Hemi, 559 U.S. at 10. \nSecond, Mexico\u2019s causal chain is not only \nattenuated, but also broken by multiple intervening \ncriminal acts. Typically, intervening volitional acts \nare superseding causes that eliminate proximate \ncause. See Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996). And intervening criminal acts are the \nparadigmatic example. See, e.g., Kemper v. Deutsche \nBank AG, 911 F.3d 383, 393 (7th Cir. 2018). But here, \napart from the other intervening acts that confound \nMexico\u2019s chain of causation, the complaint relies on at \nleast four independent, volitional criminal acts: (i) \nstraw purchasers buying defendants\u2019 firearms in the \nUnited States; (ii) smuggling them into Mexico; (iii) \n\n \n22 \n \n \nselling them to the cartels; and (iv) cartels then using \nthem to commit murder and mayhem in Mexico. Any \none of those criminal acts would break the chain of \ntraditional proximate causation. Taken together, they \nshatter it. \nThird, Mexico\u2019s injuries are derivative of injuries \nsuffered by others\u2014i.e., the victims of the cartels. \nProximate cause \u201cgenerally bars suits for alleged \nharm \u2026 [when] the harm is purely derivative of \nmisfortunes visited upon a third person by the \ndefendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. But that \ndescribes Mexico\u2019s suit to a tee. Mexico\u2019s injuries all \nstem from costs and resources that derive from its \ncitizens being targeted and harmed by its cartels. \nPet.App.167a-168a (\u00b6448). This is yet another clear \nreason that Mexico \u201cstand[s] at too remote a distance \nto recover.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 268. \nFourth, apportioning damages and liability would \nbe unworkable. This Court has explained that \nproximate cause fails when a claim would require \nattributing responsibility for diffuse wrongdoing \nacross various \u201cremote action[s].\u201d Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458-59. But that is this case. Mexico\u2019s suit involves a \nparade of bad actors\u2014straw purchasers, cross-border \nsmugglers, illegal foreign sellers, foreign cartel \nmembers, and many more. There is no sound way to \napportion fault across this far-reaching chain of \nactors, especially since even the complaint admits \nthat the majority of illegal firearms in Mexico were \nnot made or sold by defendants. Pet.App.159a (\u00b6 435). \nIf a main point of proximate cause is to \u201cavoid[] the \ndifficulties associated with attempting to ascertain \nthe amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages attributable to the \nviolation, as distinct from other, independent, \n\n \n23 \n \n \nfactors,\u201d then this is a textbook application. Bridge v. \nPhoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008). \n2. The First Circuit brushed all this aside on the \nground \nthat \nMexico\u2019s \nalleged \nharms \nwere \na \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d consequence of defendants\u2019 actions\u2014and \nthat nothing else was required to satisfy PLCAA. \nPet.App.311a (\u201c[T]he complaint plausibly alleges that \naiding and abetting the illegal sale of a large volume \nof assault weapons to the cartels foreseeably caused \nthe Mexican government to shore-up its defenses.\u201d); \nsee also, e.g., id. at 309a-315a. But that directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s teaching that \u201cforeseeability \nalone does not ensure the close connection that \nproximate cause requires.\u201d Bank of Am. Corp. v. City \nof Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 202 (2017). \nThe First Circuit tried to get around this Court\u2019s \nprecedent by saying that foreseeability is only \ninsufficient in \u201ccertain contexts.\u201d Pet.App.309a. But \nfor decades, and in many different contexts, this Court \nhas regularly held that foreseeability is not enough. \nIndeed, \u201c[c]onditioning liability on foreseeability . . . is \nhardly a condition at all,\u201d because with \u201ca broad \nenough view\u201d virtually anything \u201cmay be foreseen.\u201d \nConsol. Rail Corp. v. Gottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 552-53 \n(1994). Proximate cause thus generally stops at the \n\u201cfirst \nstep\u201d\u2014not \nbecause \nlater \nsteps \nare \nunforeseeable, but because they are too remote to \ncount, lest liability attach for \u201cevery conceivable harm \nthat can be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 132-33. This Court has applied that rule \nacross a host of statutes\u2014from RICO, to the federal \nsecurities laws, to the Clayton Act, to the Lanham Act. \nId. at 132. \n\n \n24 \n \n \nEven if foreseeability alone could suffice in some \ncontexts, PLCAA certainly is not one of them.  \nPLCAA\u2019s predicate exception includes an express \nproximate-cause requirement, and its statutory \nhistory and design make clear that Congress wanted \nto foreclose exactly this type of attenuated claim \nagainst the gun industry in particular. It specifically \ntargeted lawsuits against the manufacturers and \nsellers of \u201cfirearms that operate as designed and \nintended, which seek money damages and other relief \nfor the harm caused by the misuse of firearms by third \nparties, including criminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). \nReading in an expansive proximate-cause test here \nflies in the face of that text.  \nThe First Circuit grappled with none of this. It cited \nBank of America, Pet.App.309a, but it had no \nresponse to any of the points above except its repeated \nrefrain that Mexico\u2019s injuries were foreseeable. \nPet.App.310a-319a.  \nAt most, the First Circuit tried condensing Mexico\u2019s \nchain of causation. It reasoned that the statutory \ntrafficking \u201cviolation\u201d was the \u201cproximate cause\u201d of \nMexico\u2019s injuries, so the causal chain really had six \nsteps, not eight. Pet.App.310a-311a. But this fails \ntwice over. For one, the proximate-cause requirement \nis pegged to a defendant\u2019s violative conduct\u2014here, \ndefendants\u2019 business activities that formed the basis \nof aiding-and-abetting liability. After all, it is \nundisputed that defendants did not themselves \nviolate the trafficking laws; instead, Mexico\u2019s \nallegation \nis \nthat \ndefendants\u2019 \nmanufacturing, \nmarketing, and sales activities constitute unlawful \naiding and abetting. And that conduct occurs at least \ntwo steps before any trafficking. Regardless, even if \n\n \n25 \n \n \nthe chain was only a mere six steps, that is still \nseveral too many under this Court\u2019s precedent. \nThe decision below is thus deeply flawed root-to-\nbranch. Its approach to proximate cause cannot stand. \nII. THE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S AIDING-AND-ABETTING \nHOLDING DEFIES THIS COURT\u2019S PRECEDENT. \nThe First Circuit\u2019s aiding-and-abetting holding is \njust as bad. The court held that America\u2019s firearms \nindustry has plausibly been aiding and abetting \nMexico\u2019s cartels for decades\u2014without a single U.S. \ngovernmental entity doing a thing about it in this \notherwise heavily-regulated industry.  \nThat ruling has no basis in law. Indeed, it flatly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s decision last Term in \nTaamneh\u2014a decision that should have more than a \none-year shelf-life in a federal court of appeals. \n1. Mexico\u2019s complaint should look familiar to this \nCourt: It is cut from the exact same cloth as the one \nfrom Taamneh. As here, the gravamen of that \ncomplaint was that the social media companies (i) \nwere aware that their platforms were being used by \nterrorists, (ii) refused to adopt easy measures to \naddress the problem, and (iii) were thus liable because \nthey facilitated terrorist activity for their own profit. \nComparing the allegations here and in Taamneh \nshows the similarity: \nTaamneh \nSmith & Wesson \nTwitter, Facebook, and \nYouTube \u201ccontinued to \nprovide [their] resources \nand services to ISIS,\u201d \neven after being put on \nDefendants \nhave \n\u201crefused to monitor and \ndiscipline \ntheir \ndistribution \nsystems,\u201d \neven after having been \n\n \n26 \n \n \nnotice by the media, \ngovernment, and others \nthat the terror group \nregularly \u201cused\u201d their \nservices. \nJA.52-53 \n(\u00b6 26). \nput on \u201cnotice\u201d by the \nsame entities that their \nfirearms are regularly \ntrafficked into Mexico by \ncriminals. Pet.App.185a, \n8a (\u00b6\u00b6 514, 6). \nThe defendants \u201chave \ntools by which [they] can \nidentify, \nflag, \nand \nremove ISIS accounts,\u201d \nbut refuse to adopt a \nlegion \nof \neasy-to-\nimplement \nmeasures \nthat would mitigate how \nterror groups use their \nplatforms. \nJA.148 \n(\u00b6 463); see also id. at \n88, 134-35 (\u00b6\u00b6 197, 402-\n04). \nThe firearms industry \n\u201cknow[s] what reforms to \ntheir \ndistribution \nsystems are needed to \nprevent \ntrafficking \nof \ntheir guns into Mexico,\u201d \nbut have refused to adopt \nany \npublic-safety \nmeasures to curb this \npractice. \nPet.App.131a \n(\u00b6 367); see also id. at \n79a-80a (\u00b6\u00b6 227-30).  \nThe social media giants \nhave chosen this course, \nbecause they \u201croutinely \nprofit \nfrom \nISIS.\u201d \nJA.132 (\u00b6 391). \nDefendants \n\u201cdefy\u201d \ncertain \npolicy \n\u201crecommendations\u201d \nbecause \nthey \n\u201cprofit\u201d \nfrom \ncartel \nsales. \nPet.App.7a-8a (\u00b6 3). \n2. This Court\u2019s reasoning in Taamneh squarely \nforecloses Mexico\u2019s aiding-and-abetting claim here. \nIn Taamneh, this Court made plain that the essence \nof aiding and abetting is affirmative culpable \nconduct\u2014i.e., a would-be accomplice must take an \n\u201caffirmative act with the intent of facilitating the \noffense\u2019s commission.\u201d 598 U.S. at 490. There must be \nmore than \u201comissions, inactions, or nonfeasance\u201d in \n\n \n27 \n \n \nthe course of making a product or service available to \nthe general public\u2014otherwise \u201cordinary merchants \ncould become liable for any misuse of their goods and \nservices, no matter how attenuated their relationship \nwith the wrongdoer.\u201d Id. at 489. \nMexico\u2019s complaint fails to allege any such \naffirmative culpable conduct. It is barren of any \nallegation \nof \n\u201cabetting, \ninducing, \nencouraging, \nsoliciting, or advising\u201d between the American \nfirearms industry and the Mexican drug cartels. \nTaamneh, 598 U.S. at 490. Nowhere does Mexico \nallege that the firearms industry has adopted any \npolicy, or developed any practice, with the specific \nintent to further the drug cartels\u2019 terroristic mission. \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s complaint rests entirely on how, \nin its view, the American firearms industry has failed \nto change its longstanding business practices to \ncounteract the proliferation of cartel violence in \nMexico. The complaint\u2019s allegations all rest on how \nthe industry has consistently operated \u201cfor decades.\u201d  \nSee, \ne.g., \nPet.App.121a-123a, \n127a-128a, \n139a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 335, 338, 353, 376). Indeed, Mexico\u2019s complaint \nrelies most heavily on a 2003 decision from Judge \nJack Weinstein, opining on then-industry practices. \nSee, e.g., Pet.App.135a-139a (\u00b6 374). And Mexico\u2019s \nrepeated refrain is that during this time, the \ndefendants have failed to go beyond what \u201clegislation\u201d \nrequires to curtail the supply of firearms\u2014and have \nfailed to do so in order to boost profits. Pet.App.84a \n(\u00b6 246). \nAn illustrative example is Mexico\u2019s allegations \nabout the defendants\u2019 \u201cdesign decisions.\u201d Mexico \nclaims the defendants are culpable, because they have \n\n \n28 \n \n \ncontinued \nto \nproduce \n\u201cweapons \nof \nwar\u201d\u2014e.g., \nAmerica\u2019s most popular rifle (the AR-15), and arms \ncapable \nof \nholding \nmore \nthan \nten \nrounds, \nPet.App.94a-95a, 122a-123a (\u00b6\u00b6 282, 337)\u2014even as \nthey have become aware that these arms are also \npopular among the cartels. Tellingly, Mexico does not \nallege that the defendants created the AR-15 for the \npurpose of aiding, assisting, or supporting the cartels; \nnor would any such claim be plausible. Instead, the \nclaim\u2014again and again\u2014is that in failing to stop \nproducing firearms like the AR-15, defendants have \nmade a \u201cdeliberate design\u201d decision that will continue \nto aid the cartels. Pet.App.272a. \nThe \nother \nallegations\u2014those \nconcerning \nmarketing, \ndistribution, \nand \nmanufacturing \npractices\u2014fit the same bill. For example, Mexico \nfaults the defendants for using the three-tier \ndistribution system currently sanctioned by federal \nlaw, Pet.App.140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79), without augmenting it \nwith various \u201cpublic safety\u201d measures\u2014e.g., requiring \nunlicensed sellers to conduct \u201cbackground checks at \ngun shows,\u201d id. at 91a-92a (\u00b6 275); \u201cattempting to \ncontrol, monitor, or supervise\u201d kitchen table sales, id. \nat 89a (\u00b6 264); or, most fundamental, limiting sales to \nonly those \u201cwith a legitimate need for them,\u201d id. at \n104a (\u00b6 315). Again, Mexico does not allege that the \ndefendants adopted this distribution system so as to \nbolster the cartels. Pet.App.104a (\u00b6\u00b6 314-18). Instead, \nMexico charges the defendants with failing to change \ntheir longstanding distribution practices\u2014that is, \n\n \n29 \n \n \nfailing to supplement what the American firearms \nlaws require, so as to better combat arms trafficking.3 \nBoiled down, Mexico\u2019s theory of liability reduces to \nthis: \u201cA manufacturer of a dangerous product is an \naccessory or co-conspirator to illicit conduct by \ndownstream actors where it continues to supply, \nsupport, or assist the downstream parties and has \nknowledge\u2014actual or constructive\u2014of the illicit \nconduct.\u201d Pet.App.42a (\u00b6 110). \nBut that is precisely the theory of aiding-and-\nabetting liability this Court rejected in Taamneh. \nWithout more, continuing to sell a product while \nknowing that some bad actors will misuse it \ndownstream \nis \nnot \nthe \nsort \nof \n\u201caffirmative \nmisconduct\u201d needed to create accomplice liability. 598 \nU.S. at 500, 503. Any other rule would be untenable. \nFor instance, virtually every beer and wine company \nknows to a certainty that some of their products are \ngoing to end up being unlawfully used by minors or \n \n3 The First Circuit stated a few times the complaint alleged \nthat defendants sold to specific dealers they knew were \ntrafficking firearms to the cartels. See, e.g., Pet.App.312a. But \nthat is just not true; the complaint does not include a single \nallegation of any defendant specifically selling to someone it \nknew worked with the cartels or trafficked any firearms. Once \nmore, most defendants do not sell to dealers at all, Pet.App.140a \n(\u00b6 378); they sell only to licensed wholesalers. Instead, the most \nthe complaint alleges is that Petitioners could have learned who \nthe illicit dealers were but chose to remain \u201cwillfully blind\u201d \n(along with the United States, apparently) so that they did not \nhave to cut off those lucrative sales. Pet.App.46a (\u00b6 123); see also, \ne.g., id. at 42a, 44a-46a (\u00b6\u00b6 109, 118-22). That, however, is \nprecisely the sort of passive conduct this Court rejected in \nTaamneh. See 598 U.S. at 499-500 (insisting on clear line \nbetween \u201cpassive assistance\u201d and \u201cactive abetting\u201d).  \n\n \n30 \n \n \ndrunk drivers, and they could always take additional \nsteps to combat those problems. But nevertheless, \nnobody would think that those companies are aiding \nand abetting any of those downstream illegal acts. \nThe same is true for companies in many different \nindustries. And the same principle controls here. \n3. In holding otherwise, the First Circuit\u2019s decision \nerases the very distinction between active complicity \nand passive conduct that animated Taamneh. \nThe First Circuit tried to distinguish Taamneh by \nsaying that defendants here are \u201cmore active \nparticipants\u201d in the cartels\u2019 business than the social \nmedia groups were with ISIS. Pet.App.305a. That is \nsimply wrong\u2014and completely unsupported by the \ncomplaint\u2019s allegations. As in Taamneh, Mexico \nalleges no connection between Petitioners and cartels \nother than their sale of lawful products with, at worst, \nindifference to how they will later be used. But \nregardless, the First Circuit fails to grapple with \nTaamneh\u2019s core rationale that making a lawful \nproduct or service available to the public is simply not \nenough to establish accomplice liability based on later \ncriminal acts that may occur. 598 U.S. at 499. Even \nwhen a company is engaged in extensive commercial \nactivity (be it running a global social-media network \nor producing and selling firearms to the general \npublic), it is not an active participant in downstream \ncriminal acts unless the company engages in some \nother \u201caffirmative misconduct\u201d for the specific purpose \nof promoting those acts. Id. at 500.  \nAnd again, nowhere does Mexico even try to make \nthat \u201cshowing.\u201d Id. Mexico\u2019s theory is that the \ndefendants have \u201cknown\u201d that the cartels have been \n\n \n31 \n \n \nable to obtain their firearms \u201cfor years,\u201d and \u201chave \nfailed to implement\u201d certain practices to stem that \nproblem. Taamneh, 598 U.S. at 481-82. Yet \u201cfailing to \nstop\u201d a problem of downstream criminal activity is \ndistinct from willing its existence, and that distinction \nis critical for aiding-and-abetting liability. Id. at 503. \nIn collapsing that distinction, the First Circuit \nrelied on the exact same misreading of this Court\u2019s \nprecedent that Taamneh rejected. According to the \nFirst Circuit, Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 703 (1943), means that whenever a merchant \ncontinues to sell lawful products despite knowing \nsome may end up in the hands of criminals, that is \nenough to support a claim that the merchant \n\u201cintended to supply the products for [those] illegal \nsales.\u201d Pet.App.304a.  \nBut Direct Sales said no such thing. Instead, it \ninvolved a company selling morphine directly to a \nparticular doctor in such absurdly large amounts that \nit could not possibly have been used for lawful \npurposes. 319 U.S. at 705. Thus, as this Court \nexplained in Taamneh, Direct Sales stands only for \nthe common sense (but narrow) proposition that \nwhere a \u201cprovider of routine services does so in an \nunusual way,\u201d it cannot escape liability just because \nit is an upstream seller. 598 U.S. at 502. But here, \nagain, Mexico\u2019s complaint does not allege any \n\u201cunusual\u201d activity on the part of the American \nfirearms industry\u2014it asserts no change of course, no \nspecific action, and no designed policy carried out with \nthe specific purpose to assist the cartels. Rather, \nMexico objects to how the industry has operated for \ndecades; its entire complaint is premised entirely on \n\n \n32 \n \n \nthe usual operations of the American firearm \nindustry. That is a far cry from Direct Sales. \n*** \nBedrock \naiding-and-abetting \nprinciples \nthus \nconfirm what common sense compels: America\u2019s \nfirearms industry is not a longstanding criminal \naccomplice to Mexico\u2019s drug cartels. The First Circuit \nreached a contrary result only by defying this Court\u2019s \nprecedents. This Court\u2019s review is needed. \nIII. THE \nQUESTIONS \nPRESENTED \nARE \nEXCEPTIONALLY IMPORTANT. \nThis Court\u2019s review is also warranted because both \nquestions presented are exceptionally important in \ntwo respects. First, the logic of the decision below \nexposes a wide swath of industry to liability for doing \nnothing more than making available legal and non-\ndefective products that can be criminally misused \ndownstream. And second, Mexico\u2019s brazen attempt to \nregulate the American firearms industry based on its \nforeign interests poses a grave threat to the \nsovereignty of the United States, its citizens, and their \nSecond Amendment rights. \n1. The decision below involves two important issues \nof federal law. One, the First Circuit split from other \nappellate \ncourts \nas \nto \nwhat \n\u201ctraditional \nunderstandings \nof \nproximate \ncause\u201d \nrequire, \nPet.App.310a.n8\u2014which has sweeping implications \nfor any federal statute that incorporates a generic \nproximate-cause requirement. And two, the First \nCircuit\u2019s decision defies this Court\u2019s decision in \nTaamneh by allowing claims of accomplice liability \nagainst anyone who makes products available to the \ngeneral public while knowing that some criminals will \n\n \n33 \n \n \nmisuse them downstream. The logic of that decision \nputs crosshairs on the backs of innocent sellers and \nmanufacturers of all kinds. \nWhile both issues are important alone, they are \neven more so in combination. Taken together, the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s twin holdings have implications far \nbeyond the firearms industry. On their logic, any \nbusiness that knows its product is being misused \ndownstream may be held liable as an accomplice. The \ndecision below also broadly expands the ability of \ngovernments to bring suit over these alleged harms\u2014\nfrom climate change to consumer goods, and all in \nbetween. A city or state could sue the fast-food \nindustry for facilitating childhood obesity; or a \npharmaceutical company for continuing to sell cold \nmedicines that criminals use to make illegal drugs.  \nNo imagination is required here\u2014once again, \ndomestic cities and states have tried these sorts of \nsuits plenty of times, against a host of other \nindustries. Supra at 19. But so far, basic norms of \nAmerican law have largely stopped these attenuated \ngambits: Proximate cause demands a direct nexus \nbetween injury and action; and aiding-and-abetting \ndoctrine delineates what actions are sufficient for \nculpability.  \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision upends all of this. By \ncollapsing proximate cause into foreseeability and \nextending accomplice liability over ordinary product \nsales, the decision below opens the floodgates. That is \na boon for plaintiffs\u2019 lawyers and political stunt \nlitigation, but a disaster for the rule of law. And it will \nonly proliferate until this Court fixes the problem. \n\n \n34 \n \n \n2. The decision below also has dire implications for \nAmerican sovereignty, as it allows a foreign \ngovernment under the guise of litigation to regulate \n(if not eliminate) the manufacture and sale of common \nfirearms in the United States. Simply put, Mexico \ndetests the American system that makes firearms \nreadily available to law-abiding citizens in accordance \nwith the Second Amendment. It makes no secret of its \nview that ordinary citizens should not be allowed to \nbuy an AR-15 or a firearm capable of holding over ten \nrounds. And it finds abhorrent how law-abiding \nAmericans have the liberty to obtain such firearms \nwithout having to beg for the government\u2019s grace.   \nAbsent this Court\u2019s intervention, Mexico will be \nhanded a de facto domestic regulatory tool as it \nsaddles the American firearms industry with \nburdensome \nlitigation, \nfar-reaching \ncompulsory \ndiscovery, and the specter of a multi-billion-dollar \njudgment that it can wield to bully the industry into \naltering its practices. And that says nothing of \nMexico\u2019s proposed injunctive relief, which seeks to \nimpose gun control regulations that Congress has \nrepeatedly rejected.  \nThat is not all. Even if the defendants prevail down \nthe road in this suit, so long as the decision below \nremains good law, it invites other countries to run the \nexact same play with the exact same basic complaint.4  \n \n4 In fact, some countries have promised as much already. See, \ne.g., John Cassidy, Can the Government of Mexico Bring the U.S. \nGun Industry to Book?, THE NEW YORKER (Jan. 31, 2024), \nhttps://perma.cc/AZD8-QHJK (describing foreign interest in this \ncase). \n\n \n35 \n \n \nGiving foreign sovereigns the power to impose the \nburdens of such litigation gives them a Damoclean \nSword to dangle over the head of the American \nfirearms industry. Indeed, in passing PLCAA, \nCongress recognized that the severe costs of defending \nsuits like this one could pressure firearms companies \nto curtail their business practices, jeopardizing \ndemocratic control. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8) \n(PLCAA prohibits efforts to \u201cuse the judicial branch to \ncircumvent the Legislative branch of government to \nregulate interstate and foreign commerce\u201d); H.R. Rep. \nNo. 109-124, at 12 (2005) (\u201c[The industry is] in danger \nof being overwhelmed by the cost of defending itself \nagainst these suits.\u201d). That danger is especially acute \nwhen it comes from foreign governments, as they seek \nto use lawfare to suppress American firearms with no \naccountability to the American people.   \nUnless this Court intervenes, the federal courts in \nthe American Northeast are now open to suits by \nevery foreign government that wants to curtail the \nAmerican firearms industry. That is intolerable for a \ncountry with a Second Amendment, and for the \nmillions of law-abiding citizens who depend on the \nindustry to exercise their constitutional rights. \nSimply put, Mexico\u2019s suit threatens to undermine \nAmerican sovereignty and constitutional liberty, and \nit has no business in this country\u2019s courts. \nIV. THIS CASE IS AN IDEAL VEHICLE. \nThis case presents an ideal vehicle to review the \nquestions presented. It arises out of a motion to \ndismiss, so it is limited to the four corners of the \ncomplaint. There is no lengthy factual record that \nwould follow any trial. The petition thus tees up two \n\n \n36 \n \n \nclean legal questions, based on a discrete set of \nallegations that will facilitate efficient review. The \ncomplaint alleges exactly how firearms are made by \ndefendants, sold to wholesalers, then sold to retailers, \nthen purchased by straw purchasers, then taken over \nthe border by smugglers, then used for criminal acts \nby cartels in Mexico, resulting in harm to victims, \nultimately \nimposing \ncosts \non \nthe \nMexican \ngovernment. The questions are simply whether those \nfacts amount to aiding and abetting and satisfy \nproximate cause. \nV. IN THE ALTERNATIVE, SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nWARRANTED. \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision is so egregiously wrong \nthat summary reversal would be appropriate. This \nCourt has summarily reversed decisions of lower \ncourts that contradict controlling precedent. See, e.g., \nMoore v. Texas, 139 S. Ct. 666 (2019) (per curiam); \nPavan v. Smith, 582 U.S. 563 (2017) (per curiam). And \nas explained, the decision below conflicts directly with \nthis Court\u2019s proximate cause cases, as well as last \nTerm\u2019s decision in Taamneh. \nThis case is also a natural candidate for summary \nreversal because it involves a threshold immunity \nfrom suit. As this Court has recognized, a lower court\u2019s \nfailure to respect a clear immunity from suit justifies \nsummary reversal to ensure that the immunity is not \nundermined by costly and intrusive litigation. See, \ne.g., Rivas-Villegas v. Cortesluna, 595 U.S. 1 (2021) \n(qualified immunity); City of Tahlequah v. Bond, 595 \nU.S. 9 (2021); Kisela v. Hughes, 584 U.S. 100 (2018). \nPLCAA grants exactly this type of immunity: It does \nnot merely provide an ordinary defense to liability but \n\n \n37 \n \n \nstates in unmistakable terms that qualifying suits \n\u201cmay not be brought in any Federal or State court.\u201d 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a77902(a). The statute thus \u201cgrant[s] immunity \nto certain parties against [the defined category] of \nclaims.\u201d Ileto, 565 F.3d at 1142; see also City of New \nYork, 524 F.3d at 398. And there is no suit more within \nthe heartland of PLCAA than this one.  \nIn creating this immunity from suit, Congress \nrecognized that it was not just the risk of liability but \nthe cost of defending against suit that needed to be \nforeclosed. That is why the statute says not only that \ncovered suits must fail on the merits, but that they \n\u201cmay not be brought\u201d in the first place. 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a77902(a). Accordingly, the express purpose of the \nstatute \u201cis not served by allowing an action barred by \nthe PLCAA to proceed to trial only to be inevitably \nreversed on appeal.\u201d In re Acad., Ltd., 625 S.W.3d 19, \n35 \n(Tex. \n2021). \nThis \nCourt\u2019s \nintervention \nis \naccordingly warranted, whether in the form of plenary \nreview or summary reversal. \n\n \n38 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \nApril 18, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nANDREW E.

Plaintiff Estados Unidos Mexicanos (the \n\u201cGovernment\u201d), a sovereign nation, brings this \naction to put an end to the massive damage that the \nDefendants cause by actively facilitating the \nunlawful trafficking of their guns to drug cartels and \nother criminals in Mexico.  Almost all guns recovered \nat crime scenes in Mexico\u201470% to 90% of them\u2014\nwere trafficked from the U.S.  The Defendants \ninclude the six U.S.-based manufacturers whose \nguns are most often recovered in Mexico\u2014Smith & \nWesson, Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, and \nRuger.  Another manufacturer defendant is Barrett, \nwhose .50 caliber sniper rifle is a weapon of war \nprized by the drug cartels.  The remaining \ndefendant\u2014Interstate \nArms\u2014is \na \nBoston-area \nwholesaler through which all but one of the \ndefendant manufacturers sell their guns for re-sale \nto gun dealers throughout the U.S. \n2.  For decades the Government and its citizens \nhave been victimized by a deadly flood of military-\nstyle and other particularly lethal guns that flows \nfrom the U.S. across the border, into criminal hands \nin Mexico.  This flood is not a natural phenomenon \nor an inevitable consequence of the gun business or \nof U.S. gun laws.  It is the foreseeable result of the \nDefendants\u2019 \ndeliberate \nactions \nand \nbusiness \npractices. \n3.  Defendants design, market, distribute, and sell \nguns in ways they know routinely arm the drug \ncartels in Mexico.  Defendants use reckless and \ncorrupt gun dealers and dangerous and illegal sales \npractices that the cartels rely on to get their guns.  \n\n8a \n \n \nDefendants design these guns to be easily modified \nto fire automatically and to be readily transferable \non the criminal market in Mexico.  Defendants know \nhow to make and sell their guns to prevent this \nillegal trade; the U.S. government and a U.S. court \ntold \nthem \nhow. \n \nDefendants \ndefy \nthose \nrecommendations, and many others, and instead \nchoose to continue supplying the criminal gun \nmarket in Mexico\u2014because they profit from it. \n4.  The Government has strong domestic laws that \nmake it virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully \nobtain guns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in \nthe entire nation and issues fewer than 50 gun \npermits per year. \n5.  Defendants undermine these stringent laws, \nand wreak havoc in Mexican society, by persistently \nsupplying a torrent of guns to the drug cartels.  It is \nestimated that more than a half million guns \nannually are trafficked from the U.S. into Mexico.  \nDefendants produce more than 68% of those U.S.-\norigin trafficked guns, which means that they \nannually sell more than 340,000 guns that flow from \ntheir plants in Massachusetts and other U.S. states \nto criminals south of the border. \n6.  Defendants are fully on notice of the massive \ntrafficking of their guns into Mexico.  It has been \nextensively documented in news accounts, academic \nstudies, \ngovernment \nreports, \nUnited \nNations \ninquiries and reviews, and law enforcement \u201ctraces\u201d \nof guns from crime scenes in Mexico to the \nDefendants\u2019 factories in the U.S. \n7.  Despite this abundant notice, Defendants have \nnot \nimplemented \nany \npublic-safety-related \n\n9a \n \n \nmonitoring \nor \ndisciplining \ncontrols \non \ntheir \ndistribution systems\u2014none at all.  Their policy is to \nsell to any distributor or dealer that has a U.S. \nlicense to buy and sell the product, regardless of the \nbuyer\u2019s record of flouting the law and despite blazing \nred flags indicating that a gun dealer is conspiring \nwith \nstraw \npurchasers \nor \nothers \nto \ntraffic \nDefendants\u2019 guns into Mexico.  Defendants use this \nhead-in-the-sand approach to deny responsibility \nwhile knowingly profiting from the criminal trade. \n8.  Defendants exacerbate their refusal to monitor \nand discipline their distribution systems by \ndesigning military-style assault weapons and \nmarketing them in ways that attract and arm \nruthless transnational criminal organizations like \nthe drug cartels. \n9.  Defendant Barrett manufactures a .50 caliber \nsniper rifle that can shoot down helicopters and \npenetrate lightly armored vehicles and bullet-proof \nglass.  It has become one of the cartels\u2019 guns of \nchoice.  Barrett markets its sniper rifle as a weapon \nof war (\u201cwith confirmed hits out to 1800 meters, the \nBarrett model 82A1 is battle proven\u201d), but \nnevertheless sells it to the general public without \nrestriction.  Barrett knows that its dealers sell these \nmilitary guns to traffickers, often in bulk, to arm the \ncartels that use them to battle Mexican military and \npolice who are trying to stop the drug trade. \n10.  Defendant Century Arms imports into the \nU.S. from Romania a version of the AK-47 assault \nrifle, which it modifies to try to evade U.S. import \nrestrictions on assault weapons, and then sells them \ninto the \u201ccivilian\u201d market.  Century Arms has long \n\n10a \n \n \nknown that its WASR assault rifles are among the \ncartels\u2019 favorites. \n11.  Century Arms and the other Manufacturer \nDefendants specifically design their semi-automatic \nrifles for the battlefield rather than for sport, and \nmake them easily convertible into fully automatic \nmachine guns.  Defendants are well aware that the \ndrug cartels in fact routinely convert Defendants\u2019 \nassault rifles to fire automatically, with devastating \neffect in Mexico. \n12.  The link between Defendants\u2019 design, \ndistribution, and marketing practices and the \ndestruction wrought in Mexico is undeniable.  \nDuring the period 1999 to 2004\u2014when Defendants \nwere prohibited from selling assault weapons \nbecause they were banned in the U.S.\u2014gun \nproduction in the U.S. declined appreciably.  With \nthe ban\u2019s expiration in 2004, Defendants exploited \nthe \nopening \nto \nvastly \nincrease \nproduction, \nparticularly of the military-style assault weapons \nfavored by the drug cartels. \n13.  In a mirror image of that gun-production data, \nfrom 1999 to 2004 homicides in Mexico were \ndeclining.  But they then increased dramatically \nbeginning in 2004 exactly contemporaneously with \nDefendants\u2019 increased production, distribution, and \nmarketing of their military-grade weapons:\n\n11a \n \n \n\n12a \n \n \n14.  The consequences in Mexico have been dire.  \nIn addition to causing the exponential growth in the \nhomicide rate, Defendants\u2019 conduct has had an \noverall destabilizing effect on Mexican society.  Late \n2004 saw the drug cartels\u2019 first assassination of a \nMexican Mayor, followed in later years by their use \nof Defendants\u2019 military-style weapons to attack the \nMexican military and police, and by rampant \nincreases in other gun-related crimes such as \nextortion and kidnapping. \n15.  Defendants\u2019 willfully blind, standardless \ndistribution practices aid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico.  Defendants\u2019 \nunlawful conduct has substantially reduced the life \nexpectancy of Mexican citizens and cost the \nGovernment billions of dollars a year.  And armed \nwith Defendants\u2019 guns, the cartels have aggressively \nmarketed drugs such as fentanyl, destroying and \nending lives in and outside of Mexico, including in \nthe U.S.  Defendants\u2019 guns are the venom in the \nsnakes that are the drug cartels; without those guns, \nthey could be controlled and stopped. \n16. \n \nDefendants \nare \nnot \naccidental \nor \nunintentional players in this tragedy; they are \ndeliberate and willing participants, reaping profits \nfrom the criminal market they knowingly supply\u2014\nheedless of the shattering consequences to the \nGovernment and its citizens. \n17.  This need not happen.  In a 2003 domestic \npublic \nnuisance \ncase \nagainst \nU.S. \ngun \nmanufacturers \nand \ndistributors\u2014including \nDefendants Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, \n\n13a \n \n \nSmith & Wesson, Ruger, and Interstate\u2014the late \nUnited States District Court Judge Jack B. \nWeinstein found as a fact after a trial that \u201ceach \nmanufacturer should implement readily available \nreforms,\u201d including \u201cimposing liability insurance \nstandards; limiting sales at gun shows; limiting \nmultiple sales; limiting how the consumer gun \ntransaction can be conducted to insure security; \neducation and training of dealers; and monitoring \ndealers through visitation and other regular \ninteraction.\u201d NAACP v. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. \n2d 435, 523 (E.D.N.Y. 2003).  Gun industry insiders \nhave urged Defendants to make similar reforms. \n18.  In 2001, the U.S. federal government \nsimilarly called on Defendants to monitor, supervise, \nand set reasonable conditions for their distribution \nsystems to prevent supplying criminals.  Defendants \nrefused.  Defendant Smith & Wesson entered into a \nsettlement agreement with the United States and \nseveral \nU.S. \ncities, \ncommitting \nto \nspecific \ndistribution-system reforms designed to prevent \nsupplying guns to the criminal market.  Under \npressure from others in the industry, Smith & \nWesson reneged on the agreement. \n19.  Defendants instead closed ranks with other \nindustry participants to lobby the U.S. Congress for \nlegislation to protect them in certain instances from \nliability for domestic injuries resulting from their \nconduct.  Congress responded by enacting the \nProtection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \n(\u201cPLCAA\u201d) in 2005, which protects gun companies \nfrom some liability for harm solely caused by the \nunlawful misuse of guns in the U.S. resulting in \ninjury in the U.S. \n\n14a \n \n \n20.  The United States is, of course, free to choose \nits social policy reflecting a balance between the \nfinancial interests of the gun industry and the rights \nof victims within its jurisdiction.  By the same token, \nhowever, the Government of Mexico is entitled to \nchoose a different social policy that reflects a \ndifferent balance between the interests of victims in \nMexico and the interests of gun manufacturers that \nforeseeably and deliberately cause trafficking of \ntheir guns into Mexico. \n21. \n \nDefendants \nknow \nthat \ntheir \nporous \ndistribution systems cause guns to be routinely \ntrafficked over the border into Mexico, resulting in \nvast and continual harm to the Government and its \npeople.  They therefore must monitor and discipline \nthose distribution systems to comply with not only \nU.S. law, but also the substantive law of Mexico, \nincluding its tort law. \n22.  The Supreme Court of the United States has \nrepeatedly held that, where conduct in one nation \ncauses injury in another the \u201cdefault rule for tort \ncases\u201d is that \u201cthe local law of the state where the \ninjury occurred determines the rights and liabilities \nof the parties,\u201d Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, 542 U.S. \n692 (2004), and that \u201ca court will ordinarily apply \nforeign law to determine the tortfeasor\u2019s liability to \na plaintiff injured in a foreign country,\u201d RJR \nNabisco, Inc. v. European Community, 136 S. Ct. \n2090, 2109 (2016).  And RJR Nabisco emphasized \nthat where U.S.-based corporations cause injury \nabroad to foreign sovereigns, the U.S. Constitution \nand statutes allow those sovereigns to sue for \n\u201cviolations of their own laws and to invoke federal \n\n15a \n \n \ndiversity jurisdiction as a basis for proceeding in \nU.S. courts.\u201d Id. \n23.  The U.S. Congress honored this principle of \ntrans-national torts when it enacted PLCAA.  Even \nif applied, PLCAA would not bar the Government\u2019s \ncase.  But it does not apply because it bars certain \nclaims against gun manufacturers and distributors \nonly when the injury occurred in the U.S. and the \ncriminal\u2019s misuse of the gun was unlawful under \nU.S. domestic law.  The Government\u2019s injuries here \noccur in Mexico, and its claims result from unlawful \nmisuse of guns in Mexico, not in the U.S.  Every \naspect of PLCAA confirms that the U.S. Congress \nenacted that statute with only U.S. domestic \nconcerns in mind. \n24.  Just as Defendants may not dump toxic waste \nor other pollutants to poison Mexicans across the \nborder, they may not send their weapons of war into \nthe hands of the cartels, causing repeated and \ngrievous harm, and then claim immunity from \naccountability. \n25.  To be clear, this lawsuit does not challenge or \nquestion the law, policy, or actions of the United \nStates; the Government seeks to hold accountable \nand stop the reckless actions of private companies \nthat foreseeably send their guns into Mexico. \n26.  Likewise, this case has nothing to do with the \nSecond \nAmendment \nright \nof \nlaw-abiding, \nresponsible U.S. citizens to keep and bear arms \nwithin the U.S.  This case involves Defendants\u2019 \nsupplying their guns to law-breaking Mexican \nnationals and others in Mexico.  The cartels have no \n\n16a \n \n \nSecond Amendment rights, and the Defendants have \nno right to supply them. \n27.  The Government comes to this Court because, \nwhile the actionable harm occurs south of the U.S. \nborder, it is caused by Defendants\u2019 conduct north of \nthe border. \n28.  Defendant Smith & Wesson, for example, \nmakes decisions in Massachusetts to design, market, \nand distribute its guns in the reckless, dangerous \nways that supply traffickers and cartels.  Smith & \nWesson\u2019s decisions to renege on the reforms to which \nit had agreed with the U.S. government, and to use \ncorrupt dealers and high-risk business practices that \nit knows arm the cartels, all occur in the U.S.  This \nCourt can stop the flow of guns into Mexico at its \nsource in Massachusetts by requiring Smith & \nWesson to stop actively facilitating the criminal gun \ntrade into Mexico.  The same is true for the other \nDefendants. \n29.  The Government is entitled to that relief \nunder the substantive law of Mexico as well as under \nU.S. law. \nII.  PARTIES \n30.  Plaintiff Estados Unidos Mexicanos (the \n\u201cGovernment\u201d) is a sovereign nation that shares a \nborder with the United States.  The Government \nbrings this action in its own behalf.

Defendant Witmer Public Safety Group, Inc. \nis a corporation organized and existing under the \nlaws of Pennsylvania, with its principal place of \nbusiness \nat \n311 \nCreese \nStreet, \nAmbridge, \nPennsylvania.  In 2018 Witmer acquired Interstate \nArms Corp., which was the U.S.\u2019s oldest gun \nwholesaler and was incorporated in Massachusetts \nand had its principal place of business in Middlesex \nCounty.  Upon the acquisition, Witmer dissolved \nInterstate Arms Corp. and continued in the \nwholesaling business in Middlesex County, at the \nsame location and with the same key executives, \nunder the registered fictitious name \u201cInterstate \nArms.\u201d \n\n21a \n \n \n41.  Witmer (hereafter \u201cInterstate Arms\u201d) is a \ndistributor of guns, billing itself as a distributor of, \namong \nother \nguns, \n\u201cmilitary-style \nweapons.\u201d \nInterstate Arms has conducted its gun-wholesaling \nbusiness in Massachusetts for more than 40 years \nand was incorporated in Massachusetts until 2018.  \nIt continues to conduct its business through its \nlocation in Middlesex County.

In addition, Interstate Arms\u2019 \nunlawful conduct as alleged below resulted in guns \nthat it bought from the other Defendants, and from \nother gun manufacturers, being trafficked into \nMexico and used in criminal activities there, causing \nthe harm about which the Government complains. \n42.  Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Century Arms, \nColt, Glock, and Ruger each has purposefully availed \nitself of the privilege of conducting activities within \nMassachusetts, including by systematically serving \nthe gun market here; regularly marketing and \nadvertising its products here; regularly making \nsubstantial sales to Defendant Interstate Arms in \nMiddlesex County; and imposing the policies and \npractices by which it sells its guns to Interstate \nArms in Middlesex County and by which Interstate \nArms must sell those guns to dealers throughout the \nU.S.  Each of these Defendants\u2019 unlawful conduct as \nalleged throughout this Complaint\u2014including the \nsales, marketing, advertising, and distribution \n\n22a \n \n \npolicies and practices that occurred in Middlesex \nCounty\u2014resulted in guns that each of them sold to \nDefendant Interstate Arms in Middlesex County \nbeing trafficked into Mexico and used in criminal \nactivities there, causing the harm about which the \nGovernment complains. \n43.  In addition to Defendant Interstate Arms, at \nleast 10 gun dealers in the Boston area (Barnstable, \nBristol, Dukes, Essex, Middlesex, Nantucket, \nNorfolk, Plymouth, and Suffolk counties) sold guns \nthat were traced to crimes in Mexico.  Each of these \n10 dealers sold guns manufactured and distributed \nby some or all of the Defendants and were, and some \nstill are, subject to those Defendants\u2019 distribution \npolicies and procedures. \n44.  The Government\u2019s claims arise out of \nDefendants\u2019 contacts with Massachusetts; the \nGovernment\u2019s claims relate to those contacts; and \nthose contacts give rise to the Government\u2019s claims.  \nThis Court has specific personal jurisdiction over \neach of Smith & Wesson, Beretta, Century Arms, \nColt, Glock, and Ruger, as well as both general and \nspecific jurisdiction over Smith & Wesson and \nInterstate Arms. \n45.  Barrett has purposefully availed itself of the \nprivilege \nof \nconducting \nactivities \nwithin \nMassachusetts, including by systematically serving \nthe gun market here; regularly marketing and \nadvertising its products here; regularly making \nsubstantial sales to its authorized Massachusetts \ndealer, Natick Outdoor Sales, in Middlesex County; \nand imposing the policies and practices by which it \nsells its guns to Natick Outdoor Sales in Middlesex \n\n23a \n \n \nCounty and by which Natick Outdoor Sales must sell \nthose guns to consumers in Middlesex County and \nelsewhere.  Barrett\u2019s unlawful conduct as alleged \nthroughout this Complaint\u2014including the sales, \nmarketing, advertising, and distribution policies \nand practices that occurred in Middlesex County\u2014\nresulted in guns that its dealers sold being trafficked \ninto Mexico and used in criminal activities there, \ncausing the harm about which the Government \ncomplains.  The Government\u2019s claims arise out of \nBarrett\u2019s \ncontacts \nwith \nMassachusetts; \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s claims relate to those contacts; and \nthose contacts give rise to the Government\u2019s claims.  \nThis Court has specific personal jurisdiction over \nBarrett. \n46.  All of the Defendants\u2019 wrongful actions \ndescribed in this complaint are part of, and in \nfurtherance of, the unlawful conduct alleged herein, \nand were authorized, ordered, and undertaken by \nthe Defendants\u2019 various officers, agents, employees, \nor other representatives while actively engaged in \nthe management of the Defendants\u2019 affairs (or that \nof their predecessors-in-interest) within the course \nand scope of their duties and employment, and with \nthe Defendants\u2019 actual, apparent, and ostensible \nauthority. \nIII.  JURISDICTION AND VENUE \n47.  This action is between a foreign state as \nplaintiff and citizens of a State or of different States, \nand the matter in controversy exceeds the sum or \nvalue of $75,000.00.  The Court therefore has subject \nmatter jurisdiction under U.S. Const., Art. III, \u00a7 2, \ncl. 1, and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a)(4). \n\n24a \n \n \n48.  Venue is appropriate in this district under 28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1391(b)(2) \n& \n(3), \nin \nthat \nmultiple \nDefendants reside in this district, each Defendant \nregularly transacts business in this district, and a \nsubstantial part of the events or omissions giving \nrise to the claim occurred in this district. \nIV.  DEFENDANTS HAVE LEGAL DUTIES TO \nDISTRIBUTE THEIR GUNS SAFELY AND \nAVOID ARMING CRIMINALS IN MEXICO. \n49.  The flow of guns from Defendants\u2019 U.S. \nmanufacturing plants and stores to the streets of \nMexico is not an inevitable, natural phenomenon \nlike the migration of monarch butterflies.  Nor is it a \nnecessary consequence of selling a lethal product or \nof U.S. gun laws. \n50.  The flow of guns into Mexico is a foreseeable \nresult of Defendants\u2019 deliberate and knowing \ndecisions to design, market, distribute, and sell guns \nin ways they know with virtual certainty will supply \ncriminals in Mexico. \n51.  Defendants know they have an obligation to \nhelp enforce the gun laws, and not to circumvent \nthem.  But Defendants continually violate and \nactively undermine these laws in order to profit from \nthe criminal market in Mexico. \n52.  The cartels that cause such bloodshed and \nterror may fire Defendants\u2019 guns in Mexico, but they \nare able to do so only because of deliberate decisions \nmade in Massachusetts and in the other Defendants\u2019 \ndomestic corporate offices. \nA.  Defendants Voluntarily Assumed Duties \nto Comply with All Relevant Laws and \nthe Highest Standard of Care. \n\n25a \n \n \n53.  Guns are restricted, lethal weapons, sought \nafter by persons who cannot legally possess them. \nTherefore U.S. law allows only persons who commit \nto fully comply with all applicable laws, and to act as \nagents of law enforcement, to engage in the gun \nbusiness at any level.  Defendants know this. \n54.  Defendants chose to apply for and obtain a \nU.S. federal license to engage in the gun business.  \nWhen they did so, they effectively took an oath to the \nUnited States that, to obtain the privilege of selling \nguns, they would fully comply with and help enforce \nthe law to prevent their guns from being obtained by \ncriminals.  Defendants voluntarily assumed a duty \nto design, market, distribute, sell, export, and \nimport guns while carefully adhering to all relevant \nlaw in the U.S., as well as the law in Mexico where \nthey know their guns are routinely trafficked, to \nminimize gun violence. \nB.  Defendants Must Comply with the Gun-\nImport Laws of Mexico. \n55.  The statutory law of Mexico prohibits gun \ntraffickers\u2014and those aiding and abetting them\u2014\nfrom bringing any of Defendants\u2019 guns into the \ncountry. \n56.  Mexico\u2019s Federal Law on Firearms and \nExplosives of 1972, as amended February 19, 2021 \n(\u201cLFAFE\u201d), prohibits the possession of specific guns \nincluding those classified as exclusively for military \nuse. \n57.  LFAFE, Article 11 reserves for the exclusive \nuse of the Army, Navy, and Air Force numerous \ntypes of handguns, rifles, and shotguns. \n\n26a \n \n \n58.  LFAFE, Article 55 provides that importing \nany gun into Mexico without a permit is unlawful \nand carries a prison term of up to 10 years.  LFAFE, \nArticle 84 bis.  And importing guns classified as \nexclusively for military use without a permit carries \na prison term of up to 30 years.  LFAFE, Article \n84(I). \n59.  Gun traffickers do not have the required \npermits, and Defendants are prohibited from aiding \nand abetting their importing guns into Mexico. \n \n(A border crossing sign upon entry into Mexico) \nC.  Defendants Must Comply with the Tort \nLaw of Mexico. \n60.  Mexico\u2019s Federal Civil Code regulates tort \nliability (responsabilidad civil extra-contractual) \nand wrongful acts, in articles 1910 to 1934.  Under \nthe Code, Defendants have a duty not to create any \nrisk that harms a person or entity in Mexico. \n61.  The Code imposes on Defendants an \nobligation not to engage in any unlawful, negligent, \n\n27a \n \n \nor harmful conduct that causes injury to another.  \nSpecifically, Article 1910 of the Code provides: \nWhoever acting illicitly or against good customs \ncauses damage to another, is obliged to repair it, \nunless they prove that the damage was \nproduced as a consequence of inexcusable fault \nor negligence of the victim. \n62.  The principles of tort liability stemming from \nArticle 1910 require Defendants to act with the \ngreatest possible skill and care, taking necessary \nprecautions to avoid causing any damage to others. \nD.  Defendants Must Comply with the Gun-\nExport Laws of the U.S. \n63.  Defendants have a duty to comply with \nvarious U.S. export regulations\u2014including, but not \nlimited to, the Export Administration Regulations\u2014\nso as to minimize the risk that their guns will be \nmisused by malicious actors in Mexico. \n64.  Under 15 C.F.R. \u00a7 738.4, any exporter of an \nitem with a so-called \u201cECCN\u201d designation and where \nthere are one or more reasons for special \ncontrol/oversight of the product must acquire a \nlicense to export the product to certain countries \ndesignated on a table contained in Supp. No. 1 to 15 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 738. \n65.  Semi-automatic guns (other than shotguns), \nsuch as the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 and the \nCentury Arms WASR-10, are designated under \nECCN 0502.a and flagged as requiring the exporter \nto apply for a license to transport them to Mexico.  \nSupp. No.1 to 15 C.F.R. 774; Supp. No. 1 to 15 C.F.R. \n738. \n\n28a \n \n \nE.  Defendants Must Comply with Other U.S. \nFederal Laws Governing Guns. \n66.  The Defendants also have a duty to comply \nwith all other U.S. federal laws, including various \nprovisions of the Gun Control Act of 1968 (\u201cGCA,\u201d 18 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 921 et seq.), and the National Firearms Act \nof 1934 (\u201cNFA,\u201d 26 U.S.C. Ch. 53). \n67.  The GCA prohibits anyone, including, of \ncourse, gun traffickers, from engaging in the sale of \nguns without a license.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 923(a).  \nDefendants are prohibited from aiding and abetting \nthe sale of guns by anyone who does not have the \nrequired license. \n68.  Other relevant GCA provisions include: \na.  a prohibition on assembling \u201cfrom imported \nparts any semi-automatic rifle or any shotgun \nwhich is . . . not particularly suitable for or \nreadily adapted to sporting purposes\u201d for resale \nto the general public (see \u00a7 922(r)); \nb.  a prohibition on selling \u201cmachinegun[s]\u201d to \nmembers of the general public (\u00a7 922(b)(4)); \nc.  various provisions that ensure that a gun \nis bought by only its actual intended purchaser, \ncriminalizing false, deceptive or inaccurate \nstatements, records or practices associated with \n\u201cstraw purchases,\u201d including, but not limited to, \n\u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(6), \n922(m), \n922(t)(1), \n923(g), \n924(a)(1)(A), 924(a)(3)(A) (see also relevant non-\nGCA provisions at \u00a7\u00a7 3, 4); and \nd.  various provisions prohibiting the sale of \nguns to or possession of guns by various \n\n29a \n \n \ncategories of prohibited persons (e.g., \u00a7 922(d), \n922(g)). \n69.  A \u201cstraw purchaser\u201d is a person who buys a \ngun on someone else\u2019s behalf.  Straw purchases \nviolate a number of federal and, in some cases, state \ngun laws including, but not limited to, provisions of \nthe GCA.  Gun sellers who knowingly supply straw \npurchasers also violate those laws. \n70.  The NFA and related provisions of the GCA \nmandate that machine guns and certain other \nweapons may be made, sold, and possessed only \nsubject to strict regulation and registration, and may \nnot be sold to the general public.  The statute \nprohibits the sale of a \u201cmachinegun\u201d to any person \nexcept those specifically authorized by the U.S. \nAttorney General.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b)(4). \n71.  This provision incorporates the NFA\u2019s \ndefinition of \u201cmachinegun\u201d as: \n\u201cany weapon which shoots, is designed to shoot, \nor \ncan \nbe \nreadily \nrestored \nto \nshoot, \nautomatically more than one shot, without \nmanual reloading, by a single function of the \ntrigger.  The term shall also include [parts] \ndesigned and intended, for use in converting a \nweapon \ninto \na \nmachinegun, \nand \nany \ncombination of parts from which a machinegun \ncan be assembled if such parts are in the \npossession or under the control of a person.\u201d 26 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 5845(b) (emphasis added). \n72.  A gun is \u201cdesigned to shoot\u201d automatically if \nit is designed so that it can be simply or easily \nmodified to fire automatically.  The U.S. Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (\u201cATF\u201d) \n\n30a \n \n \nhas recognized that the NFA\u2019s definition of \n\u201cmachinegun[s]\u201d \u201cincludes those weapons which \nhave not previously functioned as machineguns but \npossess \ndesign \nfeatures \nwhich \nfacilitate \nfull \nautomatic fire by a simple modification or \nelimination of existing component parts.\u201d ATF Rul. \n82-8 at 1. \nF.  Defendants Must Comply with U.S. State \nLaws Applicable to Guns. \n73.  Defendants likewise assumed a duty to \ncomply with the laws of relevant U.S. states that \nprohibit dangerous conduct such as straw purchases, \nand state laws, including public-nuisance statutes, \nthat prohibit supplying criminal gun markets. \n74.  Defendants must also comply with other U.S. \nstate laws applicable to guns, including state unfair \nbusiness practices statutes that prohibit unfair and \ndeceptive advertising, including advertising that \ninduces the unlawful and reckless use of dangerous \nproducts like guns. \n75.  These laws include, but are not limited to, \nlaws from the home states of the Defendants such as \nthe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act (Conn. \nGen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 42-110a et seq.) (for Colt), and the \nMassachusetts Consumer Protection Act (Mass. \nGen. Laws c. 93A) (for Smith & Wesson). \n76.  These and similar laws prohibit Defendants \nfrom encouraging the unlawful or dangerous use of \nguns.  They apply to such reckless marketing even \nwhere the resulting harm occurs outside of the state \nbut the marketing originated from within the state. \nG.  Defendants Must Comply with U.S. State \nTort Law. \n\n31a \n \n \n1. Defendants have a duty to carefully \nmonitor \nand \nsupervise \ntheir \ndownstream distributors and dealers. \na. Defendants have a duty to sell guns \nresponsibly. \n77.  By designing, distributing, selling, and \nmarketing highly dangerous products, Defendants \nassumed a duty to ensure that their guns are sold \nlawfully and carefully, in full compliance with all \napplicable laws, and not to circumvent those laws \nthrough their business practices. \n78.  Part of the duty Defendants assumed was to \ncarefully sell and distribute their guns.  This duty is \nviolated when Defendants sell guns without \nstandards, conditions, or monitoring, through \ndownstream dealers and distributors some of whom \nDefendants know will recklessly or illegally sell \nguns. \n79.  The existence and contours of this duty have \nbeen known for decades. \n80.  The fact that selling guns without standards \nor conditions supplies criminals has also been \nknown.  For example, a congressional report in 1976, \nsupported by the U.S. Departments of Justice and \nTreasury, highlighted that large-volume sales were \na major source of illegal gun supply, and that the \nmultiple-sale reporting requirement (that requires \nreporting to ATF of sales of more than one handgun \nby a dealer to a purchaser within five business days) \nwas not enough to stop it.  In public Congressional \nhearings in 1993, ATF\u2019s director described how \ncriminals obtain guns through corrupt dealers, \n\n32a \n \n \nnoting that 6,000 to 10,000 handguns were diverted \nto the illegal market by one dealer alone. \n81.  Voices within the gun industry have long \nrecognized that Defendants have a duty to control \ntheir distribution networks to prevent the supply of \nguns to criminals. \n82.  For example, a then-top gun industry trade \nassociation official, Robert Ricker, stated under oath \nthat gun manufacturers and distributors have long \nknown \nthat \ntheir \ngun \ndistribution \nsystem \n\u201cencourages and rewards illegal activity by a few \ncorrupt dealers and distributors,\u201d but they choose \u201ca \nsee-no-evil, hear-no-evil, speak-no-evil approach\u201d \nand \u201chide behind the fiction that as long as a retail \ndealer has a valid federal firearms license to sell \nguns, no attention to the dealer\u2019s business practices \nis required by its suppliers.\u201d Declaration of Robert A. \nRicker filed in People v. Arcadia Mach. & Tool, Inc., \nJudicial Council Coordination Proceedings No. 4095 \n(Cal. Super. Ct. Feb. 3, 2003) (\u201cRicker Declaration\u201d) \n\u00b6\u00b6 9, 11, 12. \n83.  Mr. Ricker also stated that \u201cLeaders in the \nindustry [including some of Defendants], have long \nknown that greater industry action to prevent illegal \ntransactions is possible and would curb the supply of \nfirearms to the illegal market,\u201d but they \u201chave \nconsistently resisted taking constructive voluntary \naction to prevent firearms from ending up in the \nillegal gun market and have sought to silence others \nwithin the industry who have advocated reform.\u201d \nRicker Declaration, \u00b68. \n84.  In 1993, a National Alliance of Stocking Gun \nDealers (\u201cNASGD\u201d) publication recognized that \n\n33a \n \n \n\u201cchildren and felons are being sold guns by licensed \nfirearm dealers,\u201d \u201c[w]e as an industry have failed to \n\u2018police\u2019 ourselves in the past\u201d and \u201c[w]e must do so \nnow.\u201d The Alliance Voice, July 1993. \n85.  In 1994, NASGD joined then-U.S. Secretary \nof the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen and others in a \nstatement recognizing that \u201cwithin the firearms \nindustry are elements who divert the flow of \nfirearms from the legitimate trade into the more \nlucrative firearms black market.\u201d The Alliance Voice, \nApr. 1994. \n86.  In 1999, a column by a former Gun Dealer of \nthe Year called on manufacturers and distributors to \n\u201cwake-up\u201d and control their distribution systems, \nincluding requiring that dealers \u201cadhere to some \nstrict guidelines,\u201d writing that: \nIF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHERE AND HOW \nYOUR \nPRODUCTS \nARE \nULTIMATELY \nBEING SOLD \u2013 YOU CHOOSE TO BE \nWILLFULLY BLIND TO THE FACT OR \nANTICIPATED THAT THEY WOULD BE \nILLEGALLY SOLD AND SUBSEQUENTLY \nMISUSED. \nPaul M. Barrett, \u201cLoaded Words:  A Dealer Breaks \nRank, Blaming Gun Makers,\u201d Wall Street Journal \n(June 22, 1999). \n87.  Over twenty years ago, a former Senior Vice-\nPresident for Defendant Smith & Wesson stated \nunder oath that the gun industry is aware \u201cthat the \nblack market in firearms\u201d is in part supplied by \n\u201cmultiple \nthousands \nof \nunsupervised \nfederal \nfirearms \nlicensees,\u201d \nbut \n\u201c[i]n \nspite of \ntheir \nknowledge, however, the industry\u2019s position has \n\n34a \n \n \nconsistently been to take no independent action to \ninsure responsible distribution practices.\u201d Affidavit \nof Robert Hass filed in Hamilton v. Accu-Tek, No. \n95CV0049 (E.D.N.Y.) \u00b6 20. \n88.  Dating at least to the 1990s, officials in \nseveral gun industry trade associations proposed \nthat manufacturers regulate their distribution by \nselling through authorized dealers and requiring \nstandards and safe practices to sell guns.  Those \nproposals were all rejected, and some of their \nproponents were forced out of industry positions in \nresponse. \n89.  Defendants have received similar calls for \nreform from U.S. federal law enforcement in the \nU.S., but have refused to heed them.  For example, \nATF\u2019s strategic plan issued in 2000 stated that its \n\u201c[e]nforcement efforts would benefit if the firearms \nindustry takes affirmative steps to track weapons \nand encourage proper operation of Federal Firearms \nLicensees to ensure compliance with all applicable \nlaws.\u201d ATF, 2000-2005 Strategic Plan 11 (2000). \n90.  In 2001, the U.S. Department of Justice stated \nin a public report that \u201c[g]un manufacturers and \nimporters could substantially reduce the illegal \nsupply of guns by taking . . . steps to control the \nchain of distribution for guns.\u201d DOJ, Gun Violence \nReduction:  National Integrated Guns Violence \nReduction Strategy \u00a7 IV (2001). \n91.  The Department of Justice then listed several \nrecommended steps that Defendants should take to \navoid supplying criminal gun markets: \nThe firearms industry can make a significant \ncontribution to public safety by adopting \n\n35a \n \n \nmeasures to police its own distribution chain.  In \nmany industries, such as the fertilizer and \nexplosives industries, manufacturers impose \nextensive \ncontrols \non \ntheir \ndealers \nand \ndistributors.  Gun manufacturers and importers \ncould substantially reduce the illegal supply of \nguns by taking similar steps to control the chain \nof distribution for guns.  To properly control the \ndistribution of guns, gun manufacturers and \nimporters should:  identify and refuse to supply \ndealers and distributors that have a pattern of \nselling guns to criminals and straw purchasers; \ndevelop a continual training program for dealers \nand distributors covering compliance with guns \nlaws, identifying straw purchase scenarios and \nsecuring inventory; and develop a code of \nconduct for dealers and distributors, requiring \nthem to implement inventory, store security, \npolicy and record keeping measures to keep \nguns out of the wrong hands, including policies \nto postpone all gun transfers until [background] \nchecks are completed.  Id. \n92.  The Justice Department offered Defendants \ninformation to help them identify which of their \ndealers were supplying crime guns, including trace \ndata\u2014the data obtained by ATF when it contacts the \nmanufacturer and others in the distribution chain to \nidentify a gun\u2019s entire commercial history: \nTo assist industry efforts to keep guns from \nfalling into the wrong hands, ATF will supply \nmanufacturers and importers that request it \nwith information about crime gun traces of the \nmanufacturer\u2019s or importer\u2019s guns.  The \nDepartment of Treasury and the Department of \n\n36a \n \n \nJustice are continuing to work with responsible \nmembers of the firearms industry to encourage \nvoluntary measures, such as a code of conduct \nand comprehensive training for dealers, to \nensure that guns are not stolen or sold to \ncriminals or straw purchasers.  Id. \n93.  After a gun is recovered at a crime scene, the \nATF\u2019s first step in tracing it is to contact the gun\u2019s \nmanufacturer.  See ATF, Commerce in Firearms in \nthe United States 20 (2000) (describing trace \nprocedure).  Defendants could use these trace \nrequests to monitor and discipline their distribution \nsystems. \n94.  In a March 17, 2000 settlement agreement \nwith the U.S. government and various cities (the \n\u201c2000 Agreement\u201d), Defendant Smith & Wesson \naccepted an obligation to sell to only \u201cauthorized \ndistributors and authorized dealers\u201d who abided by \na code of conduct, including the requirement that the \ndistributors and dealers store all trace requests and \nreport them to Smith & Wesson.  Under pressure \nfrom other industry players, Smith & Wesson later \nreneged on the 2000 Agreement.  But its existence \nand terms-including the use of trace data to monitor \nand discipline the distribution system-help to define \nthe duty that Defendants assumed when designing \nand marketing their guns. \nb.  Defendants have a duty not to supply \nthe criminal market in Mexico. \n95.  Defendants assumed an obligation to ensure \nthat their distributors and dealers do not recklessly \nor illicitly supply the criminal market in Mexico. \n\n37a \n \n \n96.  Aspects of this duty include, but are not \nlimited to: \na.  providing \nguns \nonly \nto \ndownstream \ndistributors and dealers that abide by \nprotocols and safety standards to prevent \nthe unlawful or negligent diversion of guns \nto bad actors in Mexico; \nb.  terminating \nbusiness \nrelationships, \nrefusing \nto \nsupply \nor \notherwise \ndisciplining any downstream distributor \nor seller of a Defendant\u2019s products where \ntrace data or other indicators suggest that \nthe party is likely engaging in reckless or \nunlawful practices supplying the criminal \nmarket; \nc.  where it appears that a Defendant\u2019s guns \nare being trafficked from a certain source \njurisdiction into Mexico, limiting the \nsupply of guns or certain classes of guns to \nretailers in the source jurisdiction or \ncreating special point-of-sale restrictions \non any relevant classes of guns; \nd.  requiring all retail sellers to employ safe \nand reasonable business practices to \nenforce and adhere to their obligations, \nincluding but not limited to asking \nscreening questions of customers to \nidentify purchasers likely to illegally sell \nor misuse guns or transport them into \nMexico; \ne. requiring that purchasers show multiple \nforms of state identification beyond those \nnecessitated by federal or state law; \n\n38a \n \n \nf.  limiting bulk, multiple, and repeat sales or \nimposing other limitations designed to \nprevent illicit gun trafficking into Mexico; \ng.   obtaining, \nretaining, \nand \nanalyzing \nrelevant information to determine if their \nbusiness practices are supplying criminals \nin \nMexico \nwith \nguns, \nand \ntaking \nappropriate responsive action to prevent \nthat continued supply, including but not \nlimited to: \n\u2022  requiring downstream sellers to provide \ntimely information regarding their \nbusiness practices including alleged or \nproven \nviolations \nof \nlaw, \nstraw \npurchasing or trafficking incidents at \ntheir stores, \u201cmissing\u201d guns, trace \nrequests, inspections and audits, sales \nof assault weapons and sniper rifles, \nmultiple and bulk sales, and repeat \npurchasers; \n\u2022 noting and recording all instances of \nfederal or state law enforcement \nofficials tracing guns recovered during \ncriminal investigations in Mexico back \nto \neach \nDefendant \nor \nto \nany \ndownstream distributors or dealers \nselling the Defendant\u2019s guns; \n\u2022 noting and recording all connections \nbetween any Defendant\u2019s guns and \ncriminal misuse in Mexico identified in \nthe media or other sources; \n\u2022  conducting continuous, routine analyses \nof trace or other data so as to \n\n39a \n \n \ndetermine, \namong \nother \nthings, \nwhether certain distributor and dealer \nnetworks \nare \nassociated \nwith \nabnormally high rates of diversion of \nguns to the criminal market in Mexico; \nwhether certain types of a Defendant\u2019s \nguns (such as semi-automatic assault \nrifles and sniper rifles) appear to be \ndisproportionately used by criminals in \nMexico; and whether there are any \ngeographic or other patterns in the \nmanner in which a Defendant\u2019s guns \nare being diverted to the criminal \nmarket in Mexico. \n2. Defendants have a duty to design safe \nguns. \n97.  The common law of U.S. states, like the \napplicable civil law of Mexico, requires Defendants \nto exercise a high degree of caution in the design, \ndistribution, \nsale, \nand \nmarketing \nof \ntheir \nexceedingly dangerous products. \n98.  This includes a duty not to include features \nmaking guns more attractive to and useful for \nmalicious actors and to include safety features \nreducing their susceptibility to theft and diversion to \nthe criminal market in Mexico. \n99.  These affirmative design safeguards include, \nbut are not limited to, personalized or authorized-\nuser features, such as internal locks or \u201csmart gun\u201d \ntechnology, that inhibit all but a gun\u2019s authorized \nuser from discharging it.  These safety features have \nbeen technologically feasible for many years.  \nInternal locks, and other features less sophisticated \n\n40a \n \n \nthan smart guns, have been used in some guns sold \nto the public.  Guns with authorized-user features \nare less likely to be attractive targets for theft and \nmisuse by criminals because they cannot be fired by \nanyone except the authorized user. \n100.  Defendants also assumed a duty to make \nguns that could not easily have their serial numbers \ndefaced \nor \nobliterated, \nwhich \ncriminals \nand \ntraffickers often do to evade law enforcement. \n101.  Defendants have long had the commercial \nand \ntechnological capability \nto \ninstall \nthese \nsafeguards in their guns.  And they have been well \naware of the need for this technology.  For example, \nDefendant Smith & Wesson undertook in the 2000 \nAgreement to install smart-gun technology in all of \nits new handgun designs by 2003.  Smith & Wesson \nrecognized that this would be an important step to \n\u201creduce the criminal misuse of guns [and to] combat \nthe illegal acquisition, possession and trafficking of \nguns.\u201d \n102.  Smith & Wesson further vowed to invest 2% \nof its annual gun sales revenue to the development \nof this smart-gun technology.  It filed multiple \npatent applications for specific embodiments of \nsmart-gun technology between approximately 1998 \nand 2001. \n103.  Smith & Wesson further committed to \ninclude a second, hidden serial number on all guns, \nso that law enforcement could still fully investigate \nthe commercial history of the gun in a criminal \ninvestigation, even if the criminal or trafficker \ndefaced or obliterated one serial number. \n\n41a \n \n \n3. Defendants have a duty to refrain from \ninflammatory and reckless marketing \nlikely to attract criminal users. \n104.  Independent of any state unfair trade \npractices statutes, all Defendants have an obligation \nto avoid inflammatory or reckless marketing tactics \nlikely to attract and motivate criminals or other \ndangerous users of their guns. \n105.  The Smith & Wesson 2000 Agreement \nreflects this duty, acknowledging an obligation to \n\u201c[n]ot market any gun in a way that would make the \ngun \nparticularly \nappealing \nto \njuveniles \nor \ncriminals.\u201d \nH.  Defendants Cannot Avoid Their Duties by \nBeing Willfully Blind to the Facts. \n106.  The statutes, regulations, and law identified \nabove reflect a standard of conduct and care below \nwhich reasonably prudent manufacturers and \ndistributors may not lawfully fall.  Together, these \nrequirements make clear that Defendants are \nrequired to possess and exercise specialized and \nsophisticated knowledge, skill, information, and \nunderstanding of the market for guns.  They must \nalso be aware of, and prevent, the risks and dangers \nof gun trafficking that arise when Defendants choose \nto sell guns through standardless sales and \ndistribution \nwithout \nproper \nmonitoring \nand \ndiscipline. \n107.  Further, these proscriptions make clear that \nDefendants have a duty and responsibility to \nexercise \ntheir \nspecialized \nand \nsophisticated \nknowledge, information, skill, and understanding to \nprevent the diversion of their guns into Mexico. \n\n42a \n \n \n108.  Prominent among Defendants\u2019 obligations is \nthe duty to be aware of the reality of how their guns \nare sold and used, to take that reality into account \nwhen they decide how to design, sell, and distribute \ntheir guns, and not to be willfully blind to the facts. \n109.  Defendants also have, and are required to \nhave, access to specialized and detailed knowledge of \nsuspicious sales activities.  ATF traces, extensive \npublic reports of unlawful trafficking activity, and \nsophisticated sales data allow Defendants to monitor \nthe volume and type of sales that would alert them \nto suspicious sales activity and problematic dealers.  \nThis information enabled and required Defendants \nto play a decisive role in stopping the supply of their \nguns to the cartels in Mexico. \n110.  A manufacturer of a dangerous product is an \naccessory or co-conspirator to illicit conduct by \ndownstream actors where it continues to supply, \nsupport, or assist the downstream parties and has \nknowledge\u2014actual or constructive\u2014of the illicit \nconduct. \n111.  \u201cWillful blindness\u201d to clear indicators of \nunlawful \nconduct \nconstitutes \nconstructive \nknowledge of that conduct. \n112.  \u201cRed flags,\u201d when assessed in the aggregate, \ncan render it obvious that a downstream seller is \nengaging in criminal or unlawful activity.  A \nmanufacturer or supplier that continues to supply, \nsupport, or assist that seller, after the red flags are \nraised, is a culpable and intentional participant in \nthat unlawful conduct. \n113.  The flags that put Defendants on notice that \nthey were facilitating unlawful trafficking of guns \n\n43a \n \n \ninto Mexico were blazingly red and astoundingly \nnumerous.  Defendants cannot shield themselves \nfrom responsibility by claiming to be ignorant of the \nfact that they routinely supply, and profit from, \ntrafficking to criminals in Mexico. \n114.  Defendants knowingly violated all of the \naforementioned duties and responsibilities.  Their \nknowing violations of those obligations caused harm, \nand continues to cause harm, to the Government and \nits people. \nV.  DEFENDANTS ARE FULLY ON NOTICE \nTHAT THEIR CONDUCT CAUSES \nUNLAWFUL TRAFFICKING TO MEXICO. \n115.  For years Defendants have been confronted \nwith a mountain of facts that make clear that their \nchosen business practices routinely arm the cartels \nin Mexico with massive and lethal arsenals. \n116.  The U.S. federal government has determined \nthat Defendants\u2019 guns are the overwhelming source \nof the cartels\u2019 arsenals, and that the trafficking of \nDefendants\u2019 guns across the border into Mexico is a \ncrisis of extraordinary proportions.  Media reports, \ntrafficking prosecutions, reported cases, articles, \ntrace data, and other information confirm the same \nfacts. \n117.  Defendants\u2019 response to this mountain of \ninformation has been to double down on their \nunlawful practices and fight law enforcement efforts \nto stop the trafficking. \nA.  Defendants Know That Some of Their \nDealers Sell Significant Numbers of \nCrime Guns. \n\n44a \n \n \n118.  Defendants have long been aware that some \nof the dealers they use to sell their guns at retail \nsupply significant numbers of guns to the criminal \nmarket in Mexico.  Defendants know that these \ndealers engage in straw sales, multiple sales, repeat \nsales, and other business practices that supply \ntraffickers who arm the drug cartels. \n119.  It is well known that the overwhelming \nmajority of gun dealers\u2014more than 85%\u2014sell zero \ncrime guns, while a small minority of dealers\u2014fewer \nthan \n10%\u2014sell \nabout \n90% \nof \ncrime \nguns.  \nDefendants know that a fairly small percentage of \ntheir dealers sell virtually all crime guns recovered \nin Mexico.  Public reports and articles have \nidentified some of those dealers by name. \n120.  For example, a 2010 Washington Post article \nidentified by name 12 dealers that sold the most \nguns recovered in Mexico and even included a \ngraphic that made the point even more clear:\n\n45a \n \n \n \n\n46a \n \n \n \n121.  Even when the U.S. national media spoon fed \nthis information to Defendants they continued to use \nthese dealers and did not cut off supplies or begin \nmonitoring and supervising them.  And as noted \nabove distributors such as Defendant Interstate \nSales, which has sold guns traced to crime scenes in \nMexico, distribute guns throughout the U.S., \nincluding to dealers like these that traffic them to \nthe cartels. \n122.  Defendants regularly receive even more \ndirect information about problem dealers.  Trace \nrequests from ATF and other agencies alert \nDefendants \nthat \nguns \nthey \nsell \nto \nspecific \ndistributors and dealers are being recovered at crime \nscenes in Mexico (the ATF tracing program extends \nto crime guns recovered in Mexico).  Industry \nparticipants know that a high volume of crime-gun \ntraces is a trafficking indicator, suggesting that a \ndealer is engaged in unlawful sales such as straw \npurchases.  ATF, Commerce in Firearms in the \nUnited States at 25 (2000). \n123.  Defendants can get trace data from ATF, and \nthey can require that their dealers forward all trace \nrequests to them.  But rather than taking these steps \nto determine which dealers and distributors are \nsupplying the cartels in Mexico, Defendants choose \nto remain willfully blind to the specific facts. \n124.  In the 2003 trial, Judge Weinstein found as \na fact that \u201crelatively excessive numbers of traces to \nspecific retailers or first purchasers is ... cause for \nalarm by Manufacturer Defendants,\u201d and that no \nU.S. law \u201cforeclosed [them] from closing off illegal \n\n47a \n \n \nflows of their guns to such retailers.\u201d NAACP v. \nAcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435, 504 (E.D.N.Y. \n2003).  The Court of Appeals dismissed the \ndefendants\u2019 appeal and refused to vacate Judge \nWeinstein\u2019s findings of fact even though defendants \nhad prevailed on technical grounds.  NAACP v. A.A. \nArms, Inc., No. 03-9354-cv Doc. 1537 (2d Cir. Aug. \n30, 2004). \n125.  Judge Weinstein further found that \u201cthe \nguns in the trace database are overwhelmingly \ncrime guns (that is, recovered in connection with a \ncrime),\u201d that \u201csufficient information in the trace \ndatabase has been made available to defendants and \nwould have been made more extensively available to \nany that sought information,\u201d and that \u201ctrace \ninformation \nprovides \nto \neach \nmanufacturer, \ndistributor \nand \ndealer\u2014with \nsome \ntechnical \nassistance\u2014information that could be used to \nimprove their distribution system to protect against \ncriminals obtaining their guns.\u201d 271 F. Supp. 2d at \n522. \n126.  Defendants know that the ATF alone, \nwithout \nDefendants\u2019 \nown \nmonitoring \nand \ndisciplining their distribution systems, can barely \nmake a start on preventing gun trafficking to \nMexico.  A 2013 report from the U.S. Department of \nJustice Office of Inspector General (OIG) found that \nATF inspected about only 11,000 of the 135,000 \nlicensees each year.  In 2019, ATF inspected about \n10% of all licensees.  Although 2020 posed novel \nchallenges, ATF inspected a mere 5,827 licensees \nduring this past fiscal year despite record-high gun \nsales.  And the 2013 OIG report suggested that ATF \nhad not implemented a mechanism to track and \n\n48a \n \n \nprioritize for inspection retail dealers it considers to \nbe \u201chigh-risk.\u201d \n127.  Judge Weinstein found, based on the \ntestimony of former ATF officials, that \u201cATF lacked \nthe \nability \nto \nadequately \nregulate \nfirearms \ntransactions,\u201d including \u201cparticularly the retail \ndealers, which are a primary conduit of guns from \nthe legal to the illegal market.\u201d 271 F. Supp. 2d at \n521.  He further found as fact that \u201cthe ATF is \nincapable of inspecting all but a tiny percentage of \ndealers, is restricted to one routine compliance \ninspection per year and cannot close corrupt dealers \nfor many years even after notice of revocation, \nindictment and conviction.\u201d Id. \n128.  Even in rare cases where ATF inspects a \nlicensed retail dealer, licenses are rarely revoked, \neven when flagrant violations of U.S. federal law are \nuncovered.  For example, USA Today and The Trace \nreported on an Illinois retail dealer that was allowed \nto stay in business after it received two warnings \nfollowing inspections in 2009 and 2013 for \nrepeatedly failing to conduct background checks or \nto \ncomply \nwith \nU.S. \nfederal \nrecord-keeping \nrequirements, and illegally selling to out-of-state \nresidents.  Court records tied that dealer to at least \n12 guns traced to a trafficking ring suspected of \nsmuggling narcotics into the U.S. from Mexico \nbetween 2013 and 2015.  It was only after those guns \nwere trafficked, and numerous other violations, that \nthe dealer\u2019s license was finally revoked.  \u201cThere\u2019s \nreally no teeth to the laws, and gun dealers know \nthat,\u201d a former ATF agent explained in the article.  \nBrian Freskos et al, \u201cAfter Repeated ATF Warnings, \nGun Dealers Can Count on Agency to Back Off; \n\n49a \n \n \nSometimes Firearms Flow to Criminals,\u201d USA \nToday (May 26, 2021). \n129.  Gun industry insider Robert Ricker \nconfirmed that Defendants know that corrupt \ndealers retain their licenses because ATF is unable \nto effectively and promptly weed them out and \nrevoke their licenses: \nThe firearm industry ... has long known that \nATF is hampered in its enforcement efforts by \ninadequate resources and constraints in federal \nlaw on its ability to enforce current law against \nillegal and \ncorrupt \ndealers. \n\u2026 \nWithout \nindependent action by all segments of the \nindustry to address the flow of guns from \ncorrupt dealers and gun shows into the illegal \nmarket, ATF will continue to fight a losing \nbattle against illegal gun traffickers.  Ricker \nDeclaration, \u00b613. \n130.  This is not meant to criticize ATF or other \nU.S. government policies or activities.  But it does \ndemonstrate that Defendants know\u2014or choose to be \nwillfully blind to the fact\u2014that some of their dealers \nviolate the law, recklessly sell guns, and supply the \ncartels with guns.  And Defendants exploit this lack \nof adequate enforcement to supply and profit from \nthe criminal market. \n131.  Defendants know that having a federal \nfirearms license does not mean that the licensee \nobeys the law.  Pretending otherwise is a fiction that \nDefendants use to falsely claim plausible deniability \nabout their obligation to monitor and discipline their \ndistribution chains. \n\n50a \n \n \n132.  Judge Weinstein found as fact that \u201cthe \nindustry knows that crime gun traces are indicators \nof problems at the dealer level and are adequate \nnotice to all up-stream distribution partners of these \nproblems,\u201d and that \u201cthe reason industry members \ngave for not addressing the clear dangers posed by \nunsupervised dealers causing widespread harm to \ncommunities was:  \u2018if the industry took voluntary \naction, it would be admitting responsibility, and \u2018the \nconcept that if you are proactive and take steps to \nremedy the problem, then you have recognized that \nyou are responsible partially for the problem.\u2019\u201d 271 \nF. Supp. 2d at 521-522. \n133.  Defendants know that ATF enforcement is \nnot sufficient to stem the tide of their guns into \nMexico.  Their policies of supplying any licensed \ndealer ensure that they knowingly assist and \nfacilitate those dealers\u2019 unlawful trafficking to \nMexico. \nB.   \nGovernment and Media Reports Give \nDefendants Continual Notice That \nTheir Distribution Systems Facilitate \nGun Trafficking to Mexico. \n134.  Even without information from trace \nrequests from law enforcement, Defendants are \naware that they are routinely supplying guns \ntrafficked to Mexico. \n135.  In just the past ten years the problem of gun \ntrafficking from the U.S. to Mexico has been \ndocumented in more than 3,000 news articles \npublished in the U.S., in more than 100 academic \nstudies, and in a multitude of government reports.  \nThese and other sources provide Defendants with \n\n51a \n \n \ncompelling notice that their unlawful business \npractices continue to fuel gun violence in Mexico. \n136.  \u201cCartels need guns to support their \nbusiness,\u201d explained Scott Brown, special agent in \ncharge of Homeland Security Investigations in \nPhoenix, in one published article.  \u201cWhen they find \npeople that are either willing to flagrantly violate \nthe law or skirt the law or not practice due diligence, \nthat is enabling the cartels to be armed and to have \na destructive impact both in Mexico and the U.S.\u201d \nBeth Warren, \u201cDEA Supervisor Turned \u2018Pariah\u2019 Sold \nAssault Rifles to Sinaloa Cartel Associates,\u201d \nLouisville Courier Journal (Feb. 24, 2021). \n137.  Among the U.S. Congressional and \ngovernmental reports documenting and publicizing \nthe persistent problem of gun trafficking to Mexico \nare: \n\u2022  House Committee on Homeland Security, \nCombating Border Violence:  The Role of \nInteragency Coordination in Investigations \n(2009). \n\u2022  Congressional Research Service, Mexico\u2019s \nDrug-Related Violence, R40582 (2009). \n\u2022 Gov\u2019t Accountability Office, Guns and \nTrafficking:  U.S. Efforts to Combat Arms \nTrafficking to Mexico Face Planning \nCoordination Challenges (2009). \n138.  United Nations and NGO reports similarly \ndocument and publicize the rampant trafficking of \nDefendants\u2019 guns into Mexico.

So do numerous media studies and reports, \nsuch as: \n\u2022  James C. McKinley, Jr., \u201cU.S. Is Arms \nBazaar for Mexican Cartels,\u201d New York \nTimes (Feb. 25, 2009); \n\u2022 Chris Baltimore, \u201cMexico Cartels Go \nBargain Gun Shopping in Houston,\u201d \nReuters (May 28, 2009); \n\u2022  Chris McGreal, \u201cHow Mexico\u2019s Drug Cartels \nProfit from Flow of Guns Across the \nBorder,\u201d The Guardian (Dec. 8, 2011); \n\u2022  Seth Harp, \u201cArming the Cartels:  The Inside \nStory of a Texas Gun-Smuggling Ring,\u201d \nRolling Stone (Aug. 7, 2019); \n\u2022  Kevin Sieff & Nick Miroff, \u201cThe Sniper \nRifles Flowing to Mexican Cartels Show a \nDecade of U.S. Failure,\u201d Washington Post \n(Nov. 19, 2020), which noted that the \ntrafficked weapons are being used to kill \n\u201crecord numbers of [Mexican] police \nofficers\u2014464 in the first nine months of \n2020 alone.\u201d \n140.  Gun trafficking from the U.S. into Mexico \nand into the hands of the drug cartels was a well-\npublicized problem even before 2005.  See, for \nexample, \u201cU.S. Mother Lode of Firepower for World,\u201d \nAssociated Press (March 31, 1994).  At Mexico\u2019s \nurging, in 1997 the Organization of American States \nadopted a treaty designed to try to slow this \ntrafficking.  That same year President Clinton \n\n53a \n \n \nfurther acknowledged and publicized the problem by \nasking the U.S. Congress to increase military aid to \nthe Government so it could buy guns to combat the \ndrug cartels that were armed with Defendants\u2019 guns. \n141.  Defendants demonstrated their awareness of \nthe problem by fighting U.S. federal efforts to \naddress it.  Retailer customers buying multiple guns \nmay well be trafficking, so U.S. federal law requires \ndealers to timely inform ATF of multiple sales (sales \nof more than one gun over 5 business days) of \nhandguns, by completing and submitting a multiple-\nsale reporting form.  This provides ATF with timely \ninformation to investigate potential trafficking.  But \nthis requirement generally did not apply to long \nguns. \n142.  A November 2010 report from the U.S. \nDepartment of Justice OIG, reviewing ATF\u2019s efforts \nto reduce the flow of illegal guns into Mexico, found \nthat the then-existing multiple-sales reporting \nrequirements \nfor \nhandguns \n\u201cproduce \ntimely, \nactionable investigative leads for ATF\u201d but noted \nthat cartels operating in Mexico preferred military-\nstyle rifles not then subject to the U.S. federal \nreporting requirement.  The OIG report concluded \nthat this omission \u201chinders ATF\u2019s ability to disrupt \nthe flow of illegal weapons to Mexico.\u201d U.S. \nDepartment of Justice Office of the Inspector \nGeneral, Review of ATF\u2019s Project Gunrunner at 31 \n(Nov. 2010). \n143.  ATF issued notice of an emergency rule that \nrequired licensed dealers operating in California, \nTexas, Arizona, and New Mexico to report multiple \nsales of certain assault rifles.  FR Doc. 2010-31761.  \n\n54a \n \n \nThe proposed rule would not prohibit multiple sales \nof assault rifles, but would merely require the same \nreporting of multiple sales that already existed for \nhandguns. \n144.  The gun industry nevertheless tried to keep \nthat information from law enforcement and to \nenable the trafficking to continue.  Defendants\u2019 trade \nassociation sued to prevent enforcement of the rule.  \nIts lawsuit was unsuccessful in blocking the \nreporting requirement.  But the episode confirms \nDefendants\u2019 knowledge of the systematic gun \ntrafficking to Mexico and of traffickers\u2019 preference \nfor multiple sales.  It also confirms that the gun \nindustry prefers to supply and profit from that \ntrafficking rather than help law enforcement put an \nend to it. \n145.  Despite all this notice, Defendants continue \nto \nuse \ntheir \nunmonitored \nand \nundisciplined \ndistribution systems to supply military-grade \nassault weapons in the U.S., causing them to be \nsmuggled across the border and used to arm criminal \norganizations and drug cartels in Mexico.  The \nproblem of Defendants\u2019 guns flowing into Mexico and \narming the cartels only gains more attention, and \nbecomes more lethal, every year. \nC. Specific Incidents Give Defendants \nContinual \nNotice \nThat \nTheir \nDistribution Systems Actively Assist \nTrafficking to Mexico. \n146.  Authorities have repeatedly identified and \nrecovered Defendants\u2019 guns in connection with \nnotorious gun-trafficking rings in which Defendants\u2019 \ndealers supplied cartel traffickers.  Defendants \n\n55a \n \n \nreceived notice of these incidents through ATF trace \nrequests, news reports, and court filings.  They are \nfully aware of their contribution to the epidemic of \ngun violence in Mexico and the scale of the problem \nthey have created.  Following are some illustrative \nexamples. \n147.  From March 2016 to December 2018 gun \ndealers sold to a trafficker 37,200 rounds of \nammunition, 2,649 high-capacity rifle magazines, \n120 body-armor plates, and 3 handguns\u2014including \n2 Colt pistols.  He then smuggled them into Mexico \nduring 87 border-crossings.  \u201cThe defendant was \ndirectly involved with high level members of the \nSinaloa cartel in Mexico... [His] offenses in this case \nare very serious,\u201d prosecutors stressed in court \nfilings.  United States of America v. Marco Antonio \nPeralta-Vega, \nNo. \n4:19-cr-00338 \n(D. \nAriz.), \nGovernment\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum at 3, filed \nJune 4, 2021. \n148.  In October 2017 gun dealers sold to another \ntrafficker Defendants\u2019 assault rifles that are coveted \nby criminals and drug organizations in Mexico.  \nThese included a Smith & Wesson rifle and two \nCentury Arms rifles\u2014all destined for Mexico. \n149.  From 2007 to 2008 Phoenix gun shop X-\nCaliber Guns sold more than 650 guns, mostly \nassault weapons including AK-47s, to straw \npurchasers recruited by a drug cartel.  X-Caliber sold \nthe guns after being told that the purchasers \nplanned to sell them in Mexico, and even advised one \npurchaser to break up the purchases to avoid \ndrawing suspicion.  Several crime guns recovered in \nMexico were traced back to X-Caliber, including:  an \n\n56a \n \n \nassault rifle recovered after a Government raid of a \ndrug-dealer safe house that left eight Mexican \nagents dead; three assault rifles recovered after \nmembers of a drug gang fired on Mexican \nauthorities; a Century Arms WASR-10 and a \ndiamond-encrusted Colt Super pistol recovered after \nthe Nov. 2, 2008 killing of the Sonora police chief \nnear the Arizona border; a Colt Super pistol seized \nin 2008 when Mexican special forces captured a top \nSinaloa Cartel lieutenant; and three assault rifles \nrecovered after federal police officers were fired on \nby the Beltran Leyva drug gang on July 2, 2008. \n150.  From October 2015 to May 2016 dealer \nBallistic Guns conspired with a former Tucson police \nofficer to straw purchase and traffic guns into \nMexico.  They trafficked 35 guns, including 2 \nBarrett .50 caliber rifles, a Ruger rifle, and 9 Colt \nSuper pistols.  ATF agents intercepted one of the .50 \ncaliber rifles at the border.  Authorities stated that \n\u201cevidence from the investigation established that \nthese guns were sold to members from Mexico drug \ncartels and that the guns were intended for Mexico.\u201d \nDylan Smith, \u201cTucson Firearms Dealer Gets 6.5 \nYears for Trafficking Guns to Mexican Cartels,\u201d \nTuscon Sentinel (Mar. 19, 2018). \n151.  From January to November 2003 a Mesquite, \nTexas dealer sold more than 150 guns to another \ntrafficker for drug gangs in Mexico.  In just a few \nweeks, the dealer sold to the trafficker a 9mm pistol, \nan AK-47, and nine AR-15 assault weapons.  One of \nthe guns was connected to the shooting of a police \nofficer in Reynosa, Mexico. \n\n57a \n \n \n152.  From 2006 to 2007 dealer Carter\u2019s Country \nin Spring, Texas supplied a trafficker with guns, \nincluding two Smith & Wesson rifles.  One of the \ntrafficked guns was reportedly used in the \u201cAcapulco \nmassacre\u201d in 2006, when more than a dozen armed \nassailants stormed two offices of the state attorney \ngeneral and executed four police officers and three \nsecretaries.  Years earlier a former employee of \nCarter\u2019s Country testified under oath that Carter\u2019s \nmanagement repeatedly directed its employees to \nencourage straw purchases in order to avoid losing \nsales.  The Washington Post later identified Carter\u2019s \nCountry as a top supplier of crime guns to Mexico, \nwith 2 of the top 12 stores in the U.S. selling the most \ncrime guns recovered in Mexico. \n153.  From July 2012 to September 2012 a dealer \nsold 19 guns to straw purchasers who were \nconspiring with a trafficker\u2014a member of the \n\u201cDuffle Bag Mafia.\u201d The guns included a Century \nArms rifle.  The trafficker\u2019s vehicle had 46 rifles \nhidden inside an auxiliary gas tank.  He was part of \na large-scale scheme to use straw purchasers to \ntraffic the weapons into Mexico for use by Los Zetas. \n154.  From August 2007 to September 2008 \ndealers sold 25 guns to a trafficker for a man known \nto her only as \u201cEl Mano.\u201d The majority of these guns \nwere military-style AK-47 and AR-15 assault rifles, \nincluding a Century Arms WASR-10 rifle and a Colt \npistol later found in the possession of gang members \nin Mexico. \n155.  In 2007 Barry Clint Stuart, a federally \nlicensed gun dealer, attended gun shows and sold \nguns \u201coff paper\u201d or \u201csecond hand.\u201d These guns, and \n\n58a \n \n \nothers bought by straw purchasers, were then \ntrafficked to Nazario Cavazos-Deluna\u2019s drug cartel.  \nThe trafficker was linked to 74 guns sold to the \ncartel.  Stuart also helped the traffickers convert \nguns to fully automatic. \n156.  On April 14, 2010 a U.S. federal jury \nconvicted former F.B.I Special Agent John Thomas \nShipley of dealing guns without a license, causing a \ngun dealer to maintain false records, and making a \nfalse statement to federal authorities.  The \ninvestigation that led to these charges began when \nATF traced back to Shipley a Barrett .50 caliber rifle \nthat was used during a shootout in Chihuahua, \nMexico that resulted in the death of a Mexican Army \ncaptain and six drug cartel members. \n157.  On February 15, 2011, Los Zetas hitmen in \nSan Luis Potos\u00ed Mexico attacked two U.S. ICE \nagents, one of whom was killed.  ATF traced the \nweapon used in the assault to a trafficker who had \nbought it and 39 other guns\u2014including a Century \nArms shotgun\u2014in the Dallas/Fort Worth area. \n158.  On November 9, 2010, a trafficker and \nanother man in a Wal-Mart parking lot in the Dallas \narea transferred two duffle bags containing 40 high-\npowered guns, including a Smith & Wesson revolver, \na Century Arms pistol, and a Century Arms WASR \nrifle.  The guns were destined for Los Zetas. \n159.  Another prolific straw purchaser armed \ncartels with Glock pistols and AK-47s, buying \nspecific guns in demand by the drug cartels.  Several \nNew Mexico dealers sold guns to this trafficker, \nincluding seven Glock pistols and a Ruger rifle.  Two \n\n59a \n \n \nof the Glocks were later seized from Los Zetas in \nMexico. \n160.  From March 2006 to June 2007 10 gun \ndealers in Houston, Texas sold 336 weapons to straw \npurchasers acting on behalf of the Gulf Cartel in \nMexico.  Mexican authorities eventually recovered \n88 of these guns, some at crimes scenes and others \nduring narcotics searches.  They had been used to \nkill 18 Mexican law enforcement officers and \ncivilians. \n161.  From February to November 2008 gun \ndealers sold to a ring of 10 straw purchasers in Mesa, \nArizona.  The straw sales of more than 100 assault \nrifles and other weapons included 26 Colt Super \npistols, 4 Colt pistols, a Smith & Wesson pistol, and \n3 Century Arms rifles.  The guns were trafficked to \nthe Sinaloa Cartel in Mexico. \n162.  From September 2009 to December 2010 \ndealers sold more than 700 guns to other straw \npurchasers in Arizona.  A third of the recovered guns \nwere found in Mexico.  In 2011 the Center for Public \nIntegrity reported that at least six Century Arms \nWASR-10 assault rifles acquired in straw purchases \nfrom a single Arizona gun dealer were recovered \nafter gun battles between drug traffickers and police \nin Sinaloa in May 2008. \n163.  In 2016 U.S. authorities busted another \ntrafficking ring that operated in Laredo, Texas.  \nLocal gun dealers sold 36 military-style weapons to \nstraw purchasers, including Beretta semi-automatic \nhandguns and five Century Arms rifles.  The guns \nwere then trafficked into Mexico. \n\n60a \n \n \n164.  In 2015 dealers throughout the Rio Grande \nValley sold more than 100 guns, in straw purchases, \nto a trafficking ring in McAllen, Texas.  The guns, all \nof which were trafficked to the cartels in Mexico, \nincluded a Colt Super pistol and 2 Century Arms \nrifles. \n165.  A California ring was broken up in 2015 \nwhile trafficking guns to the Sinaloa Cartel.  Their \npurchases included AK-47s, .50 caliber rifles, AR-\n15s, and Glock pistols.  The cartel\u2019s gun broker was \nheard on wiretaps telling a co-conspirator that \nobtaining the guns in the U.S. was easy. \n166.  To get a closer look at how the iron river of \nguns flows into Mexico, the Arizona Daily Star \nanalyzed 32 weapons-smuggling criminal cases in \nfederal courts in Tucson and Phoenix in 2018.  The \nnarratives included what some commentators call \nan \u201coperaci\u00f3n hormiga,\u201d or \u201cant operation,\u201d of quietly \nbuying relatively small quantities of guns at a time \nand then smuggling them across the border. \n167.  From June to January 2018 Tucson-area gun \ndealers sold 50 guns to 2 people who bought them on \nbehalf of their heroin dealer.  The guns included 13 \nCentury Arms assault weapons (WASR-10 rifles and \nAK-type pistols).  A Century Arms assault rifle that \none of the traffickers had bought in October 2017 \nwas recovered in Mexico after a shootout between \nMexican law enforcement and a cartel in La Paz, \nBaja California Sur.  Another person bought a Colt \nrifle for one of the traffickers\u2019 heroin dealer in March \n2017, and that rifle was later recovered in Culiacan, \nMexico. \n\n61a \n \n \n168.  The Arizona Daily Star also documented that \nin December 2017 a Tucson dealer sold a Century \nArms pistol to a 23-year-old woman who bought it at \nthe request of her boyfriend.  Hours later, he \nsmuggled it through Nogales, Arizona into Mexico.  \nIt was used in a crime in Sinaloa less than two \nmonths later. \n169.  From October 2017 to September 2018 large-\nbox stores in Tucson and Green Valley, Arizona sold \n108 high-powered rifles and pistols, in straw \npurchases, to another trafficker.  Every few days for \n11 months he cycled through different big-box stores, \nincluding 45 separate visits to 4 Walmart stores, to \nmake the purchases.  Criminals in Mexico gave him \nthe purchase money and paid him $100 per \npurchase.  The sales included 19 Ruger rifles and \npistols, a Smith & Wesson pistol, 8 Beretta rifles and \npistols, and 5 Glock pistols. \n170.  In several months spanning 2017 and 2018, \ngun dealers sold 225 AK-47 and AR-15 style assault \nrifles to a trafficker and six accomplices.  The guns \nwere trafficked to the Cartel del Noreste, a faction of \nLos Zetas.  The $300,000 worth of guns included: \n\u2022  14 Century Arms rifles; \n\u2022  At least 6 Smith & Wesson rifles; \n\u2022  At least 5 Ruger rifles; \n\u2022  At least 4 Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifles; and \n\u2022  At least 3 Colt rifles. \nATF agents emphasized that AK- and AR-style rifles \nare \u201cweapons of choice\u201d of the cartels in Mexico and \nare \u201cfound to be destined for Mexico when purchased \nin bulk.\u201d United States of America v. Jose J. Soto, et \n\n62a \n \n \nal, No. 6:18-cr-00145-1 (S.D. Tex.), ECF 1 at 3-4, \nfiled Dec. 5, 2018.  ATF agents additionally \nspotlighted the Barrett 50-caliber rifle as a primary \n\u201cweapon of choice\u201d for the cartels in Mexico. \n171.  From April to November 2018 Zeroed In \nArmory, a Houston-area dealer, sold to a trafficking \nring\u2019s primary buyer more than 170 guns, including \n76 AK-style rifles, 86 AR-style rifles, and 6 .50-\ncaliber rifles, at least 2 of which were Barretts.  He \npaid approximately $7,450 for each Barrett .50 \ncaliber rifle and re-sold them for a $4,000 profit.  In \nAugust 2018 Zeroed In Armory sold two Colt rifles to \nthe trafficker in a multiple-sale transaction, and \nthey were recovered two months later in connection \nwith a crime in Nuevo Laredo. \n172.  From April to August 2018 a Gonzales, Texas \ngun dealer sold to a trafficker 14 Century Arms \nrifles, a Barrett .50 caliber rifle, and 3 Ruger rifles.  \nIn November 2018, one of the Century Arms rifles \nwas recovered in connection with a crime in Ciudad \nMier, Tamaulipas, Mexico.  In July 2018 a Dallas-\narea dealer sold to the trafficker a Barrett .50-\ncaliber rifle and six Smith & Wesson rifles.  A few \nmonths later he re-sold the Barrett rifle to a drug \ncartel for a $3,600 profit. \n173.  In January 2018 an Academy Sports & \nOutdoors store in Victoria, Texas sold to the same \ntrafficker a Colt rifle, which was recovered in July \n2018 in connection with a crime in Miguel Aleman, \nTamaulipas, Mexico.  It was part of a 17-gun seizure \nby Mexican law enforcement, the other guns being \nAR- and AK- style rifles. \n\n63a \n \n \n174.  In July 2018 an Academy Sports & Outdoors \nstore in San Antonio, Texas made what the ATF \ntermed \u201csuspicious multiple sale transactions\u201d with \nanother trafficker.  The trafficker bought two Ruger \nrifles. \n175.  From December 2015 to March 2016 gun \ndealers sold 27 guns to a trafficker who bought them \nfor the drug cartels in Mexico.  On December 15, \n2015 an Academy Sports & Outdoors store in \nLaredo, Texas sold to him two Beretta pistols.  He \nreturned to the store on February 24, 2016 for \nanother Beretta purchase.  On March 2, 2016, he \nwas back at Academy Sports to buy two Smith & \nWesson rifles.  He returned to the store yet again two \ndays later to buy two more Smith &Wesson rifles. \n176.  A former employee of another Academy \nSports & Outdoors store claimed that a supervisor \ndirected him to create false gun transaction records \nby forging information on ATF forms.  He asserts \nthat he was wrongfully terminated when he refused \nand reported the unethical and criminal conduct up \nAcademy\u2019s chain of command.  These claims were \nsummarized in a reported court decision, Cleland v. \nAcad. Sports & Outdoors, 2013 U.S. Dist. LEXIS \n121012 (S.D. Miss. Aug. 26, 2013), vacated 2015 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 23492 (5th Cir. Jan. 15, 2015).  Reports \nhave identified Academy as one of the top 12 dealers \nselling the most crime guns recovered in Mexico. \n177.  From April to August 2017 a Texas dealer \nsold 66 guns to another trafficker, including 13 \nRuger pistols and 12 Smith & Wesson pistols.  The \ntrafficker made the purchases during five visits to \nvarious San Antonio gun shows, buying as many as \n\n64a \n \n \n15 guns in a single transaction.  Five of the semi-\nautomatic pistols were recovered in Guadalajara, \nJalisco, Mexico just 17 days after the trafficker \nbought them. \n178.  In February 2017 a criminal was indicted for \ntrafficking guns into Mexico, including a Smith & \nWesson rifle, a Century Arms rifle, and three Colt \nrifles. \n179.  Another trafficker was recruited to transport \nmultiple guns and large-capacity ammunition \nmagazines into Mexico through Nogales, Arizona, \nincluding: \n\u2022  One Smith & Wesson rifle; \n\u2022  Three Colt rifles; and \n\u2022  Two Century Arms rifles. \nA U.S. prosecutor aptly wrote:  \u201cMexico is \nrelentlessly scarred by the violence of the illegal \ndrug industry. . . . The kinds of weapons that the \ndefendant intended to deliver to Mexico had zero \npurpose other than to facilitate the intimidation \nupon which this black market thrives. . . .\u201d \nGovernment\u2019s Sentencing Memorandum, United \nStates v.

This was to \nkill \npeople.\u201d \nId., \nTranscript \nof \nSentencing \nProceedings, ECF No. 45 at 11, filed Nov. 20, 2017. \n180.  In February 2016 another trafficker was \nindicted in Arizona for attempting to smuggle into \nMexico multiple guns, including two Ruger pistols. \n\n65a \n \n \n181.  A Laredo, Texas dealer sold five Beretta \npistols to a trafficker during four separate trips to \nthe store in a three-month period and two Colt Super \npistols during separate visits less than a month \napart.  He continued to frequent the store for other \ngun buys, including two Smith & Wesson rifles in a \nsame-day multiple purchase in March 2016.  \nAnother Laredo dealer had sold him two Smith & \nWesson rifles and three Beretta pistols in same-day \nmultiple purchases two days earlier.  And yet \nanother Laredo dealer had previously sold him three \nBeretta pistols, two of them in the same purchase. \n182.  From Spring 2015 to Winter 2016 gun \ndealers sold 68 assault rifles and 2 semi-automatic \npistols to a 21-person trafficking ring that used \nstraw purchases.  Some of the guns were later \nrecovered in Mexico and others were seized by \nauthorities, including: \n\u2022  At least 30 Century Arms guns in various \nmodels, including more than 10 rifles; \n\u2022  3 Smith & Wesson rifles; and \n\u2022  A Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle. \n183.  In 2006 a Dallas-area trafficker was \nconvicted of buying more than 100 assault rifles, \n9mm handguns, and other high-powered weapons \nfrom U.S. gun dealers over several months.  A pistol \nhe bought in Dallas was used in a cartel gunfight \nnear Reynosa, Mexico in which two Mexican federal \npolice officers were shot. \n184.  In just one month\u2014from August to \nSeptember 2011\u2014Houston-area gun dealers sold 55 \nassault weapons to a trafficking ring using straw \npurchases.  The sales included 44 Century Arms \n\n66a \n \n \nrifles and 3 Smith & Wesson rifles.  The group often \nbought multiple assault weapons in same-day \ntransactions, an obvious red flag indicating a gun \ntrafficking scheme.  A number of the guns were later \nrecovered in Mexico. \n185.  From 2009 through mid-2011 Texas gun \ndealers sold more than 50 guns\u2014mostly AR-15 style \nassault rifles\u2014to a Zapata, Texas-based trafficking \nring.  The weapons were smuggled to Los Zetas. \n186.  In December 2011 two other traffickers were \nsentenced for recruiting straw purchasers to buy \napproximately 40 guns, particularly Colt \u201cEl Grito\u201d \nSuper pistols, which have gold engravings and \ncommemorate Mexico\u2019s independence from Spain on \nSeptember 16, 1810.  At least one of the straw-\npurchased guns was recovered in Mexico. \n187.  A San Ygnacio, Texas dealer sold straw \npurchasers two Century Arms rifles, among other \nassault weapons.  The same dealer sold another \nstraw purchaser a Smith & Wesson rifle and a Colt \nrifle (in addition to two other guns) on a single day \nin March 2010. \n188.  A dealer in Roma, Texas sold a straw buyer \nfour weapons on February 20, 2010, including a \nSmith & Wesson rifle, a Colt rifle, and a Ruger rifle. \n189.  From June 2006 through at least October \n2009 another trafficker masterminded the arming of \nLa Familia, a drug cartel in Mexico.  La Familia was \nat that time fighting the Gulf Cartel, rivals that used \nLos Zetas\u2019 organization to control narcotics supply \nroutes.  Among the guns that the trafficker \nsuccessfully bought in the U.S. and sent into Mexico \nwere a Barrett .50 caliber rifle, five Century Arms \n\n67a \n \n \nrifles, a Colt \u201cEl Jefe\u201d Super pistol (\u201cfor the purpose \nof giving it as a gift to a boss in the La Familia\u201d); six \nColt rifles, and at least two Smith & Wesson \nhandguns. \n190.  In May 2020 U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection officers seized several hundred rounds of \nammunition and a number of guns, including a \nSmith & Wesson pistol, as smugglers attempted to \nmove them across the border in a pickup truck \ntraveling from Del Rio, Texas into Mexico. \n191.  From 2006 to 2009 a massive trafficking ring \noperated in California, moving the guns into Oaxaca, \nMexico.  A single gun dealer in Madera, California \nsold the group more than 400 guns, mostly Ruger \nrifles.  They frequented the store dozens of times \nbuying upwards of 26 Ruger rifles in a single \ntransaction. \n192.  Other examples include: \n\u2022   In October 2018 a man in Kleberg County, \nTexas was apprehended taking to the U.S.-\nMexico border a Century Arms rifle and a \nRuger revolver; \n\u2022  In April 2013 several dealers collectively sold 40 \nAK-47 assault-type guns to straw purchasers in \nthe San Antonio area for transport to Mexico; \n\u2022  In October 2020 three criminals were indicted \nfor making multiple straw purchases in El \nPaso, Texas with intent to smuggle the guns \ninto Mexico; \n\u2022 In July 2019 three criminals were caught \ntrafficking guns to Mexico after a gun dealer \nsold them a Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle and \n\n68a \n \n \nfour AK-47 assault rifles, and accepted a \ndeposit for another Barrett rifle, in eight days; \n\u2022  In August 2018 a Texas man was convicted of \narranging for straw purchasers to buy 10 guns, \n5 of which were later recovered in Mexico. \n193.  Many of the dealers that supplied these guns \nwere willing participants in the illegal trafficking.  \nAs Defendants well know, however, at most the \ntraffickers would be prosecuted while the gun \ndealers would almost certainly remain free to sell \nmore guns to more traffickers another day. \n194.  Defendants\u2019 dealers that supply criminals in \nMexico are not limited to states on the U.S.-Mexico \nborder, or even the Southwest.  One study found that \nfrom 2014 to 2018 more than 25% of U.S.-origin guns \nrecovered in Mexico were traced to a state other than \nTexas, California, or Arizona. \n195.  As noted at the outset of this Complaint, the \nBoston area has more than its fair share of \ndistributors and dealers whose guns have been \ntraced to crime scenes in Mexico.  Defendant \nInterstate has had significant numbers of its guns \ntraced to Mexico.  At least 10 other Boston-area \ndealers had such traces.  And traces reflect only a \ntiny fraction of guns that are trafficked into Mexico; \nauthorities never recover or trace the vast majority \nof trafficked guns. \n196.  Following are a few additional illustrative \nexamples of Defendants\u2019 dealers outside of the \nborder area that have supplied guns for use by \ncriminals in Mexico. \n197.  In 2020 a Kentucky man admitted that, \nwhile working as a DEA supervisor, he helped arm \n\n69a \n \n \nthe Sinaloa Cartel with guns, including Colt rifles.  \nHe bought the assault rifles online from a licensed \ngun store in Lexington, Kentucky, then shipped \nthem to Arizona where they were being amassed \nwith other guns for trafficking into Mexico.  One of \nthe guns was seized by border agents, but another \nmade it into Mexico, where it was later seized. \n198.  In 2018 police in suburban Illinois discovered \nan arsenal of guns in a storage locker, which turned \nout to be connected to a scheme to move hundreds of \nkilograms of cocaine across the border from Mexico.  \nA dealer in Zion, Illinois had sold 20 Beretta pistols \nand a .50 caliber rifle to one of the conspirators.  The \ngun shop owner noted to reporters, \u201cIf somebody \nwalks in with a big pile of cash and all the stuff \nchecks out and he passes the background checks it\u2019s \nlike \u2018oh, this is cool!\u2019 I just made a huge sale you \nknow?\u201d \n199.  Two Ohio gun dealers were charged with a \nconspiracy to resell Barrett sniper rifles to gangs in \nMexico. \n200.  In 2008 and 2009 two out-of-state traffickers \nbought 27 guns from 7 Nevada dealers, including \ntypes frequently used by drug cartels in Mexico such \nas civilian versions of military rifles and a .50 caliber \nsniper rifle. \n201.  In a reported decision, United States v. \nCarranza, No. 2:10-CR-0532-RLH-GWF, 2011 WL \n4007579, at *11 (D. Nev. Aug. 5, 2011), the court \nfound that a suspected straw purchaser was \nproperly arrested because of his  \ncash purchase of eleven assault rifles within a \nperiod of six days, plus his inquiry about \n\n70a \n \n \npurchasing a $10,000 sniper rifle. . . . Five of the \nrifles were Century Arms \u2018AK-47\u2019 type rifles.  \n[The agent] . . . knew . . . that assault style rifles \nare in high demand by drug trafficking \norganizations in Mexico and also by persons in \nCalifornia where the sale of assault style rifles \nis prohibited. \n202.  In May 2012 an Alabama trafficker pleaded \nguilty to scheming to buy military-grade weapons for \nLos Zetas.  He had attempted to buy 20 Beretta 9mm \npistols, 5 Colt rifles, and various AK-47 type rifles, \nto be smuggled across the Rio Grande. \n203.  Criminals in other parts of the U.S. have also \nbeen linked to trafficking guns to Mexico, including \nfor example: \na.  A Colorado man with 50 rifles (30 AR-15s \nand 20 AK-47s) was arrested while on his \nway to sell the guns to a conspirator who \nwould smuggle them into Mexico. \nb.  An Alaska man was part of a network that \ntrafficked guns into Mexico. \n204.  These are provided simply as illustrative \nexamples; they do not purport to catalogue all \ntrafficking cases, but merely identify a small fraction \nof the public information that put Defendants on \nnotice of the trafficking of their guns into Mexico. \n205.  Each of these (and other) traffickers were \nsupplied by dealers that the Defendants choose to \nuse to sell their guns at retail, without any \nmonitoring or standards to ensure that they are \nselling guns legally and responsibly. \n\n71a \n \n \n206.  Each of these (and other) traffickers were \nsupplied through business practices that Defendants \nchoose to use when their guns are sold at retail, such \nas not employing screening to prevent straw sales, \nnot limiting multiple sales, not limiting repeat sales, \nnot screening before selling military-style weapons, \nnot monitoring to prevent supplying traffickers and \nstraw buyers, and not imposing any discipline or \nsanctions after violations are established. \n207.  If Defendants used reasonable care or chose \nto fully comply with and enforce the law, Defendants \nwould not sell their guns without reasonable \nmeasures, and the trafficking of Defendants\u2019 guns \ninto Mexico would be significantly reduced or largely \neliminated.  But Defendants\u2019 response to this \nknowledge has been to continue to use these dealers \nand sales practices. \n208.  Under the United States Supreme Court \ndecision, Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. \n703 (1943), and numerous other precedents and law, \nDefendants knowingly violated the import laws of \nMexico, the U.S. Gun Control Act, and other laws in \nacting as willful accessories to the unlawful sale, \npossession, and use of guns to, for, and by criminals \nin Mexico. \n209.  They choose to continue to unlawfully supply \nthe criminal market in Mexico\u2014because it makes \nthem sales and profit. \nD.   Notorious \nViolent \nIncidents \nGive \nDefendants Continual Notice That Their \nGuns Are Trafficked to Mexico. \n210.  Notorious incidents of gun violence in Mexico \nhave provided yet further notice to Defendants that \n\n72a \n \n \ntheir deliberately chosen distribution practices arm \nthe drug cartels and other criminals in Mexico.  \nDefendants receive notice of these incidents through \nmedia reports and ATF trace requests. \n211.  The media drew it plainly for them again in \nan easy-to-read graphic: \n\n73a \n \n \n\n74a \n \n \n212.  A few examples make the point.  In an event \nthat made international news, on June 26, 2020 \nassassins disguised as road workers attacked Mexico \nCity\u2019s police chief, Omar Garc\u00eda-Harfuch.  Mr. \nGarc\u00eda-Harfuch was wounded but survived; two \nbodyguards and a bystander were killed.  Among the \nweapons used by the assassins were three \nBarrett .50 caliber sniper rifles, a Smith & Wesson \n9mm pistol, a Smith & Wesson 5.56mm caliber \ncarbine, a Ruger 5.56mm caliber rifle, and a Colt \n5.56mm caliber carbine.  This is a photo of the \ndamage done to Mr. Garc\u00eda-Harfuch\u2019s car by these \nguns: \n \n213.  A December 5, 2016 gun battle in Veracruz \nleft 14 dead after armed criminals ambushed state \npolice officers.  Police recovered a number of \nweapons at the scene, including at least 12 AK-47s \nand a .50-caliber Barrett rifle. \n214.  In September 2016 gunmen apparently \nlinked to the Knights Templar cartel shot down a \nhelicopter belonging to a state attorney general\u2019s \noffice using a Barrett .50 caliber rifle in the Tierra \n\n75a \n \n \nCaliente region of Michoacan.  The helicopter\u2019s pilot \nwas killed along with three officers. \n215.  More than 2,000 of the assault weapons \nrecovered in Mexico between 2006 and March 2018 \nwere produced and distributed by Defendant Colt, \nmore than any other manufacturer.  Colt does not \neven try to hide its pandering to the criminal market \nin Mexico.  Colt produces three models of guns that \nit specifically targets to the Mexican market.  These \nare the .38 caliber Super \u201cEl Jefe\u201d pistol; the .38-\ncaliber Super \u201cEl Grito\u201d pistol; and the .38-caliber \n\u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol.  These models are \nstatus symbols and coveted by the drug cartels; they \nare smuggled into Mexico from the U.S. in volume. \n216.  Colt\u2019s special edition .38 Super pistol is \nengraved \nwith \nan \nimage \nof \nthe \nMexican \nrevolutionary Emiliano Zapata on one side of the \nbarrel and a phrase attributed to him on the other:  \n\u201cIt is better to die standing than to live on your \nknees.\u201d One of those pistols was used in 2017 to \nassassinate the well-known investigative journalist \nMiroslava Breach Velducea, who made it her life\u2019s \nwork to uncover corruption, drug trafficking rings, \nand human rights violations. \n217.  Ioan Grillo, author of Blood Gun Money:  \nHow America Arms Gangs and Cartels (2021), wrote \nthat \u201c[i]t was a cruel irony:  An American gun \nembellished with an image of a Mexican freedom \nfighter was used to silence Mexico\u2019s freedom of \nspeech.\u201d Ioan Grillo, \u201cSlow the Iron River of Guns to \nMexico,\u201d New York Times (2021).  This is a photo of \nthe gun: \n\n76a \n \n \n \n218.  The Gulf Cartel\u2019s Jose Luis Zuniga-\nHernandez, aka \u201cEl Wicho,\u201d who had an extensive \ncriminal past dating back to 1990, was arrested in \nOctober 2011 trying to flee Mexico with cocaine and \nmoney.  Authorities seized from him a gold-plated, \ndiamond-and-ruby-encrusted \nColt \n.38 \nSuper \nhandgun that he had paid $57,000 to have custom \nmade. \n219.  In February 2021 the alleged recruiter of the \nJalisco Nueva Generati\u00f3n Cartel (CJNG), one of the \nmost dangerous criminal organizations in Mexico, \nwas arrested in Mexico City.  The recruiter, \ndescribed by authorities as one of the main operators \nof the CJNG, was found armed with a Colt gun. \n220.  April 2014, Jesus Alejandro \u201cComandante \nSimple\u201d Leal, a long-time foot soldier of the Gulf \nCartel, was captured in Reynosa.  During his \ncapture, authorities seized a Colt handgun and an \nAK-47.  The capture set off a series of violent \nfirefights and roadblocks throughout the city.  In one \n\n77a \n \n \nof the firefights, Arnulfo Gomez Hernandez, a \nMexican Federal Police officer, was shot and killed. \n221.  Defendant Ruger\u2019s weapons have likewise \nfigured in notorious incidents.  Ignacio \u201cNachito\u201d \nVillalobos was a member of La Linea, the \nenforcement wing of the Juarez Drug Cartel.  He set \nup a gun-trafficking operation in the small village of \nColumbus, New Mexico across the border from \nPuerto Palomas, Chihuahua, Mexico.  He had the \ncooperation of certain local Columbus officials, \nincluding the town\u2019s mayor and police chief.  They \noperated as co-conspirators in straw purchasing 400 \nguns to be smuggled into Mexico.  These included \nnearly 200 AK-47 type pistols and at least 4 \nRuger .45 caliber pistols.  Two of those pistols were \nlater recovered in Mexico, one of them at a murder \nscene in the Mexican state of Chihuahua. \n222.  Several of Defendants\u2019 guns were used by \nCartel sicarios (hitmen) in a shootout with the \nMexican National Guard, the Mexican Army, and \npolice officers engaged in a joint operation in \nCuliac\u00e1n, Mexico to arrest Ovidio Guzm\u00e1n L\u00f3pez, \nson of Joaquin \u201cEl Chapo\u201d Guzm\u00e1n, the now-\nimprisoned former leader of the Sinaloa drug cartel.  \nThe authorities briefly took Ovidio into custody. \n223.  But cartel members arrived on the scene and \nachieved fire superiority having vehicles mounted \nwith heavy machine guns and a number of \nDefendants\u2019 weapons.  Cartel sicarios used one or \nmore Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifles, a number of \nAK and AR-15 style assault rifles, and Beretta and \nGlock handguns. \n\n78a \n \n \n224.  The heavily armed cartel blocked highways \nwith armed convoys, set up roadblocks, and \nengineered a prison break in which 49 prisoners \nescaped.  They also positioned gunmen outside the \nMexican soldiers\u2019 homes and threatened to execute \nfamily members unless Guzm\u00e1n was released.  \nViolent attacks erupted throughout the city, causing \nmany residents to either flee or lock themselves \ninside their homes.  Eight people were killed and \ntwenty wounded. \n225.  Other high-profile incidents gave further \nnotice to all of the Manufacturer Defendants that \ntheir guns are routinely trafficked into Mexico and \nused in violent episodes that kill, maim, terrorize, \nand degrade the quality of life for everyone in \nMexico. \n226.  Tragically, gun violence begets more gun \nviolence as some private citizens take extreme \nmeasures \nto \nprotect \nthemselves \nand \ntheir \ncommunities.  Defendants\u2019 guns are prominent \nplayers in this two-way private gun violence.  In an \ninterview, one Mexican man involved in the violence \npointed to the words stamped on the barrel of a Colt \nMatch Target assault rifle slung across the chest of \na teenage fighter:  \u201cHARTFORD, CONN, U.S.A,\u201d \nand told the reporter, \u201cWe kill each other, and you \nsend the bullets.\u201d Kate Linthicum, \u201cMexicans are \nkilling each other at record rates.  The U.S. provides \nthe guns.,\u201d Los Angeles Times (Oct. 6, 2019). \n\n79a \n \n \nVI. DEFENDANTS ACTIVELY ASSIST AND \nFACILITATE TRAFFICKING OF THEIR \nGUNS TO DRUG CARTELS IN MEXICO. \n227.  Despite this voluminous notice, Defendants \nhave not instituted a single public-safety protocol in \ntheir distribution systems to detect and deter gun \ntrafficking to Mexico.  Defendants\u2019 choice to use \ndistribution and sales policies that supply the cartels \nviolates all of the obligations and duties they have \nundertaken as manufacturers and distributors of \nthese weapons. \n228.  Each Defendant\u2019s policy is to sell its guns to \nany and all Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone \nwith a U.S. federal license to sell guns.  The only \nother restrictions that Defendants have put on their \ndistribution systems are financial requirements\u2014\nstrictures such as good credit and a prompt-payment \nhistory designed to safeguard the Defendants\u2019 \nbottom lines. \n229.  Defendants have not implemented any \npublic-safety requirements designed to safeguard \nthe lives or quality of life of the millions of affected \nMexican nationals.  Defendants know that, without \nsuch restrictions, they are supplying, supporting, \nand assisting straw purchases and other unlawful \ntransactions by which some gun dealers supply gun \ntraffickers and other criminals in Mexico. \n230.  Defendants know that military-style \nweapons, such as assault rifles and sniper rifles, are \nparticularly sought after by the drug cartels who use \nthem to devastating effect in Mexico.  Defendants \nknow that these guns are frequently supplied to the \ncartels through corrupt or irresponsible sellers and \n\n80a \n \n \nin bulk or repeat sales.  Defendants\u2019 response to \nthese facts has been to double down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels with \nmilitary-style arsenals.  Defendants\u2019 choices have \nhad the effect of maximizing rather than minimizing \nsales to the criminal markets. \n231.  On July 16, 2009, the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives Committee on Homeland Security \nSubcommittee on Border, Maritime, and Global \nCounterterrorism \nheld \na \nhearing \nconcerning \n\u201cCombating \nBorder \nViolence: \n \nThe \nRole \nof \nInteragency \nCoordination \nin \nInvestigations.\u201d \nTestimony provided during the hearing by Special \nAgent Bill Newell established that \u201canalysis of \naggregate [crime gun] trace data can reveal \ntrafficking trends and networks, showing where \nguns are being purchased, who is purchasing them, \nand how they flow across the border.\u201d \n232.  Defendants long had access to this trace data \nand other information indicating that specific \nnetworks of distributors and dealers they were \nsupplying were consistently channeling their guns\u2014\nincluding, in particular, non-sporting assault rifles \nand machineguns\u2014to the drug cartels in Mexico. \n233.  Take, for example, Defendant Century Arms.  \nReports from ATF reveal that in a four-year period \nin the mid-2000s more than 500 Century Arms \nWASR-10 rifles initially purchased in the U.S. were \nrecovered from crime scenes in Mexico.  Century \nArms received communications from the ATF or \nother law enforcement agencies with respect to trace \nrequests on all or the overwhelming majority of \nthose incidents.  Those trace requests revealed that \n\n81a \n \n \nspecific distributor and dealer networks were \ndisproportionately associated with those guns.  \nCentury Arms nevertheless has continued to supply \nits guns to those distributors and dealers. \n234.  All of the other Defendants have had access \nto trace data like that available to Century Arms, \nand those traces illustrated both a) the recovery of \nlarge quantities of Defendants\u2019 guns from crime \nscenes in Mexico and b) a disproportionate \nconcentration of crime gun sales among specific \ndistributor and dealer networks likely to be \nengaging in illicit transactions.  The other \nDefendants, just like Century Arms, nevertheless \ncontinue to supply those distributors and dealers. \n235.  All of the Defendants, as alleged below, \nknowingly violated their legal obligations, directly \nand as culpable accessories to the violations \ncommitted by downstream dealers and traffickers \nwhen selling guns to obvious straw purchasers or \notherwise ineligible purchasers. \n236.  By continuing to supply those sellers, and \nchoosing to use and profit from reckless and \nunlawful sales practices without monitoring or \ndiscipline, Defendants participate with those sellers \nin the unlawful trafficking of Defendants\u2019 guns into \nMexico. \nA. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking Through Straw Purchasing. \n237.  For many years, Defendants have sold tens \nof thousands of guns that have been obtained by \nunauthorized and irresponsible persons in Mexico \nthrough straw purchasing.  In one law enforcement \nstudy, more than half of the guns subject to gun \n\n82a \n \n \ntrafficking investigations had been acquired as part \nof a straw purchase. \n238.  Many of these purchases have occurred in \ncircumstances that clearly indicated to the gun \ndealer that the transaction was a straw purchase.  \nThose purchases would not have been made if \nDefendants required that their dealers be well-\ntrained and committed to following the law and their \nobligations to safely and responsibly sell guns.  As a \nresult, unauthorized and irresponsible persons, \nincluding convicted felons, have obtained thousands \nof guns from these sources, some of which thereafter \nhave been used or will be used to injure the \nGovernment and its citizens. \n239.  Gun industry insider Robert Ricker \nexplained almost 20 years ago that the gun industry \nwas well aware both that straw sales significantly \nsupplied the criminal gun market and that \nresponsible sales practices could stop many of those \nsales, but the industry repeatedly refused to \nimplement those reasonable practices. \n240.  Mr. Ricker explained: \nDuring the entire time I represented gun \nindustry through my work for the [trade \nassociation], it was widely recognized within \nthe industry that straw purchases, often of \nlarge volumes of guns, were a primary avenue \nby which a relatively small number of federally \nlicensed gun dealers supplied the criminal \nmarket. ... It has long been known in the \nindustry that many straw purchases or other \nquestionable sales could be stopped by dealers \nwho are adequately trained and schooled in \n\n83a \n \n \npreventing illegal activity.  However, without \nthe proper training and a commitment to \nresponsible business practices some dealers \nallow many straw sales to go forward, \nundetected by law enforcement authorities.  \nRicker Declaration, \u00b6 9. \n241.  Judge Weinstein concluded as fact in NAACP \nv. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435, 509 (E.D.N.Y. \n2003), that \u201c[a] substantial number of guns \nmanufactured, \nimported \nor \ndistributed \nby \ndefendants were acquired by a straw purchase, [and] \ndiverted to the illegal market.\u201d \n242.  Straw purchasing is the most common \nmethod of trafficking guns into Mexico.  Illegal \ndiversion through straw purchasing has been \ncommon knowledge in the industry, and known by \nDefendants, for many years.  It has been the subject \nof many ATF reports and newsletters and \ncongressional hearings. \n243.  Traffickers rely on licensed dealers.  \nTraffickers prefer to buy guns in bulk, buying 2, or \n10, or even 20 or more guns at one time.  Licensed \ndealers have the desired inventory. \n244.  A licensed dealer that knowingly makes a \nsale to a straw purchaser for trafficking into Mexico \nviolates the law of Mexico on imports, the U.S. law \non exports, and specific U.S. law on straw purchases, \namong other provisions.  Defendants are aware that \nthese laws do not deter a substantial number of \nsellers from engaging in straw purchases for \ntrafficking into Mexico. \n245.  Defendants could sharply limit straw sales \nby regulating their own distribution systems \n\n84a \n \n \nthrough prudent practices, as Judge Weinstein \nfound.  Four principal ways to stop trafficking into \nMexico are:  (1) limiting sales of multiple guns; (2) \nmandatory background checks for secondary gun \nsales; (3) curbs on straw purchasers; and (4) a \nrestriction on assault weapons sales. \n246.  Defendants do not need legislation in order \nto make these reforms to their distribution systems.  \nThey could do it themselves; they choose not to. \n247.  Defendants supply dealers with all the guns \nthey can pay for, without any public-safety \nconditions, even if a gun dealer has been repeatedly \nfound to have violated gun laws, has been indicted \nor its employees have had federal gun licenses \nrevoked, or has repeatedly supplied cartels in \nsuspicious and obvious sales to traffickers, including \nrepeated bulk sales of assault rifles and sniper rifles. \n248.  In addition to participating in violations of \nimport and export laws, Defendants\u2019 failures to curb \nstraw purchases bound for Mexico also encourages \nthe violation of specific strictures on straw \npurchases.  The straw purchaser fraudulently \ncertifies on the ATF Form 4473, required for almost \nall guns purchases at a licensed dealer, that he or \nshe is the actual purchaser of the gun. \n249.  The dealer then separately, and falsely, \ncertifies the sale as lawful on ATF Form 4473.  A \nlicensed dealer that falsely certifies sales to straw \npurchasers as lawful despite knowing that the \nbuyers have falsely represented themselves on ATF \nForm 4473 violates various provisions of federal law \n(primarily, but not exclusively, of the GCA) either \ndirectly or by acting as an accessory to the straw \n\n85a \n \n \npurchaser.  These provisions include, but are not \nlimited to: \na.   18 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 922(m), 924(a)(3)(A), which \nprohibit a dealer from making false entries in \ngun transaction records required by law.  See \nalso \u00a7 923(g) (records to be kept in accordance \nwith regulations); \nb.  \u00a7 922(t)(1), which requires the dealer to verify \nthe identity of the \u201ctransferee\u201d (i.e. the actual \nintended recipient of the gun, rather than the \nstraw purchaser) and to conduct a background \ncheck on that person (see id.); \nc.   \u00a7\u00a7 3, \n4, \nwhich \nprohibit \nanyone \nfrom \naffirmatively concealing a felony by a third \nparty.  See also \u00a7 924(a) (listing violations of \nthe GCA as felonies); \nd.   \u00a7\u00a7 922(a)(6), \n924(a)(1)(A), \nwhich \nprohibit \nbuyers from making false statements as to \nfacts material to the lawfulness of the sale\u2014\nsuch as the identity of the actual purchaser of \nthe gun. \n250.  Defendants chose to use dealers that engage \nin these statutory violations and to supply them with \nthe guns that they transfer to criminals via unlawful \ntransactions.  Defendants did so despite, at \nminimum, willful blindness to red flags like those \ndescribed above.  Defendants thereby became \nculpable participants in these statutory violations.  \nAnd they continue to do so. \nB. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking Through Multiple and Repeat \nSales. \n\n86a \n \n \n251.  Guns are diverted to the illegal market in \nMexico after being sold as part of a \u201cmultiple sale\u201d in \nwhich the purchaser buys more than one gun at once \nover a limited period of time from a dealer.  The \nbuyer later transfers the guns to others who do not \nwant to submit to a background check.  Large \nmultiple sales to one person by a single dealer are a \nfurther source of guns for the illegal market in \nMexico, as are repeat sales in which traffickers \nreturn to stores for multiple purchases. \n252.  Defendants regularly allow their guns to be \nsold by their dealers as part of multiple purchases \nand then diverted to the illegal market and \nsubsequently trafficked into Mexico.  Many of the \nmultiple sales have occurred under circumstances \nthat indicated or should have indicated to the \ndealers that the guns were destined for the unlawful \nmarket.  As a result, unauthorized and irresponsible \npersons have obtained thousands of guns from these \nsources, some of which thereafter have been used or \nwill be used to injure the Government and its \ncitizens. \n253.  The U.S. Congress and ATF for years have \nwarned that making large volume sales is a high-\nrisk practice and a means by which traffickers \nobtain guns to sell in illegal markets, including in \nMexico.  Defendants\u2019 response has been to rely more \nand more on repeat and bulk customers. \n254.  Defendants have long known that they are \nsupplying these traffickers, and they can stop it.  For \nexample, Ugo Beretta, president of the gun \nmanufacturer that bears his name, concedes that it \nis \u201ccommon sense\u201d that dealers should not sell \n\n87a \n \n \nunlimited \nquantities \nof \nguns \nto \nindividual \ncustomers.  He had been under the impression that \nhis company\u2019s management in America makes sure \nit does not allow dealers to engage in bulk sales \nbecause, he said, \u201cthe logic of the matter requires \nthat this is what should be done.\u201d Allen K. Rostron, \n\u201cSmoking Guns:  Exposing the Gun Industry\u2019s \nComplicity in the Illegal Gun Market,\u201d Legal Action \nProject, Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence \n(2003). \n255.  Similarly, gun industry insider Robert \nRicker explained: \nThe gun industry has long known that gun \ntraffickers often acquire guns through multiple \nor large-volume purchases from licensed \ndealers.  Because of the inherently suspicious \nnature of such sales a special federal reporting \nrequirement at the dealer level for multiple \nsales exists.  Although the industry knows of \nthe special reporting requirements, and that \nunscrupulous dealers fail to report many \nmultiple sales, it has long been industry policy \nnot to question or monitor such sales.  ... To my \nknowledge, however, the industry has taken no \nvoluntary action to address this issue and more \nfully monitor large volume sales to individual \nbuyers.  Ricker Declaration,  \u00b68. \n256.  Judge Weinstein concluded as fact in NAACP \nv. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435, 509 (E.D.N.Y. \n2003), that \u201c[f]irearms manufactured, imported or \ndistributed by defendants were acquired as part of a \nmultiple purchase, [and] diverted to the illegal \nmarket.\u201d \n\n88a \n \n \n257.  Defendants continue to use unrestricted \nmultiple sales to sell their guns.  The trafficking of \nDefendants\u2019 assault weapons and other guns into \nMexico, having been acquired through multiple \npurchases in the U.S., continues unabated. \nC. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking Through Kitchen-Table Sales. \n258.  For many years, Defendants have sold \nthousands of guns to so-called \u201ckitchen table\u201d \ndealers (i.e., licensed dealers that do not sell guns \nfrom a retail store).  These dealers sell guns from \ntheir homes\u2014or unlawfully from parking lots or out-\nof-state gun shows\u2014and do not invest in inventory \ntracking or security measures. \n259.  Kitchen table dealers often operate via an \nonline presence or virtual storefront.  After receiving \nan order from a customer, the dealer in turn places \nan order with the manufacturer or distributor, who \nthen ships the guns to the dealer\u2019s home.  The dealer \nthen sells from his house directly or ships the gun in \nthe mail to another licensed dealer, where the \ncustomer picks up the gun. \n260.  Through this process, kitchen table dealers \nsimultaneously \navoid \nthe \nregulations \nand \nrestrictions involved in storefront selling while still \nenjoying lower, wholesale prices.  To receive a \nlicense to sell guns, they need only undergo the same \nprocess as any other dealer:  pay the $200 fee, attach \na photo, and submit to a fingerprint and background \ncheck. \n261.  ATF found in 2000 that nearly a quarter \n(23%) \nof \ntheir \nlicensed-dealer \ntrafficking \ninvestigations involved kitchen table dealers.  Many \n\n89a \n \n \nof these dealers, although federally licensed, are \ncorrupt and sell guns without completing buyer \nbackground checks or complying with other \nreporting requirements.  As a result, unauthorized \nand irresponsible persons have obtained thousands \nof guns from these sources, some of which thereafter \nhave been used or will be used to injure the \nGovernment and its residents. \n262.  More than a decade ago, Ruger\u2019s dealers \nasked it to stop supplying non-storefront dealers.  \nThus, Ruger knew that its own law-abiding, \nresponsible gun dealers recognize that these dealers \ntarnish the reputation of gun sellers by irresponsibly \nand illegally supplying criminals.  But Ruger chose \nto cater to the irresponsible and law-breaking \ndealers, and continued to supply them, over the \nobjections of the \u201cgood guys.\u201d \n263.  The other Defendants know what Ruger \nknew. \n264.  Despite this sordid record, Defendants have \ncontinued to provide a steady source of guns to these \n\u201ckitchen table\u201d dealers without attempting to \ncontrol, monitor, or supervise their sales practices, \nthereby enabling the consistent flow of guns into \nMexico. \nD. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking Through \u201cMissing\u201d Guns. \n265.  In the U.S. a gun is stolen every two minutes.  \nATF and congressional reports have repeatedly \nwarned \nthe \ngun \nindustry \nthat \nthefts \nfrom \nmanufacturers, distributors, dealers, and shipping \ncompanies are a source of supply for criminals.  Yet \nfor many years gun dealers have failed to provide \n\n90a \n \n \nadequate security for their premises, which has \nallowed criminals to steal weapons, some of which \nare then trafficked into Mexico and used to commit \ncrimes. \n266.  Defendants have failed to ensure that \npersons distributing their dangerous products have \nimplemented adequate security to prevent these \nforeseeable thefts.  A law enforcement study found \nthat 25% of the guns in illegal gun trafficking \ninvestigations in the western U.S. had been stolen \nfrom licensed dealers. \n267.  Defendants are aware that dealers are prime \ntargets for burglaries and robberies.  Between 2012 \nand 2016, burglaries of licensed gun dealers \nincreased by 48% and robberies of licensed gun \ndealers increased a staggering 175%. \n268.  In addition to actual stolen guns, dealers also \n\u201close\u201d guns.  It has been reported that between 2004 \nand 2011 ATF discovered nearly 175,000 guns \nmissing from dealer inventories just during \ncompliance inspections.  These weapons could be \nstolen, illegally sold \u201coff the books\u201d without proper \ndocumentation, misplaced, or sold to the black \nmarket.  Some of these weapons are then trafficked \ninto Mexico. \n269.  Unscrupulous dealers choose not to \nimplement simple anti-theft measures because their \nabsence enables the dealers to falsely claim that \nguns that are unaccounted for were stolen, when the \ndealers actually sold them off the books. \n270.  In 2017 ATF reported that around 18,700 \nguns are stolen or definitively lost from licensed \ndealers each year.  Dealers have failed to take the \n\n91a \n \n \nnecessary precautions and safety measures, so \nunauthorized \nand \nirresponsible \npersons \nhave \nobtained thousands of guns from these sources, some \nof which thereafter have been used or will be used to \ninjure the Government and its residents. \n271.  Judge Weinstein concluded as fact in NAACP \nv. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435, 509 (E.D.N.Y. \n2003), that \u201c[f]irearms manufactured, imported or \ndistributed by defendants were diverted into the \nillegal market through theft from a retailer, [and] \ndiverted to the illegal market.\u201d \nE. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking Through Gun Shows. \n272.  Gun shows are a significant source of guns \nfor criminals, who in turn traffic these guns directly \nor indirectly to Mexico. \n273.  Gun show sales by non-licensed sellers to \nprivate citizens constitute a loophole for guns to be \nsold without a Brady background check; they are \ntherefore a ready source of supply to criminals.  \nDefendants are fully aware of this loophole. \n274.  Although a licensed dealer selling at a gun \nshow must comply with the same regulations that \napply to a sale at a business establishment, sellers \nat gun shows are known to sometimes evade or \nviolate laws and supply gun traffickers.  ATF and \nthe U.S. Department of Justice have advised the gun \nindustry that gun shows are an important source of \nguns for criminals. \n275.  ATF officials have found that gun shows are \na source of a sizeable number of guns smuggled into \nMexico, as they are virtually unregulated and occur \n4,000 times per year across the U.S., with an average \n\n92a \n \n \nof 2,500 to 5,000 people attending each.  One study \nshowed that the prevalence of gun shows in a state \nhas a strong relationship to the number of guns \ntrafficked from that state to Mexico.  If the state does \nnot require background checks at gun shows, it is \nover 2.5 times more likely to export crime guns than \nstates that do have this requirement. \n276.  \u201cGun-show cowboy\u201d dealers purchase large \nquantities of guns from distributors and then re-sell \nthem at gun shows on a \u201ccash and carry\u201d basis.  They \naccomplish this by pretending to be an unlicensed \nseller who is not subject to the background check \nrequirements and other legal rules that apply to \nlicensed dealers.  This phenomena has been \nchronicled in Congressional hearings as far back as \n1993 when the head of a gun-dealer trade \nassociation testified that purchasers at gun shows \n\u201cinclude the entire spectrum of the criminal \nelement,\u201d including felons, gangs, underage youth, \nbuyers for underage youth, and multi-state gun \nrunners, and that \u201c[t]here are very few in this \ncountry who want a gun for illicit purposes who do \nnot know that they can get anything they want at \nthe gun shows.\u201d Federal Firearms Licensing:  \nHearing Before the Subcommittee on Crime and \nCriminal Justice of the Committee on the Judiciary \nHouse of Representatives, 103rd Cong., 1st Sess. 99 \n(June 17, 1993). \n277.  Judge Weinstein concluded as fact in NAACP \nv. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435, 504 (E.D.N.Y. \n2003), that \u201c[f]irearms manufactured, imported or \ndistributed by defendants were acquired at a gun \nshow, [and] diverted to the illegal market.\u201d \n\n93a \n \n \nF. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking by Designing and Marketing \nTheir Rifles as Military-Style Assault \nWeapons. \n278.  Defendants\u2019 design and marketing of their \nweapons exacerbate their reckless and unlawful \ndistribution policies.  Defendants design and market \ntheir guns as weapons of war, making them \nparticularly susceptible to being trafficked into \nMexico. \n279.  It has long been foreseeable and expected \nthat Defendants\u2019 marketing of their guns as \nweapons of war would lead to their trafficking to the \ncartels in Mexico and to increased homicides and \nother massive damage to the Government.  The \nGovernment\u2019s injury is the foreseeable result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct. \n1. Defendants \ndesign \ntheir \nguns \nas \nmilitary-style assault weapons. \n280.  Military-style weapons are useful for killing \nlarge numbers of people in a short amount of time, \ntaking on well-armed military or police forces, and \nintimidating \nand \nterrorizing \npeople. \n \nThe \nManufacturer Defendants designed their assault \nweapons to be effective people-killing machines. \n281.  For more than 25 years law enforcement has \ncalled for the Defendants to curtail and strictly \noversee the sales of military-style weapons to \ncivilians, including calls from: \na.  the Chief of Police of the Los Angeles, who \ndecried the \u201cproliferation of military assault \nweapons in the hands of criminals and \ncrazies;\u201d \n\n94a \n \n \nb. the \nNational \nAssociation \nof \nPolice \nOrganizations, \nwhich \nnoted \nthat \n\u201cthe \navailability of, and access to, assault weapons \nby criminals has become so substantial that \npolice forces are being forced to upgrade the \nweapons supplied to police officers merely as a \nmatter of self-defense and self-preservation;\u201d \nc.  the \nInternational \nBrotherhood \nof \nPolice \nOfficers, \nwhich \nasked \nfor \n\u201ccurb[s] \n[on] \nproliferation of military-style assault weapons \nthat have no legitimate sporting purpose;\u201d \nd. the then-Chief of the Milwaukee Police \nDepartment\u2014a \nmember \nof \nthe \nPolice \nExecutive Research Forum, the International \nAssociation of Chiefs of Police, and the Major \nCity Chiefs Association\u2014who noted that \n\u201c[a]ssault \nweapons \nare \nnot \nbuilt \nfor \nsportsmen . . . . They are designed to quickly, \neasily, and efficiently cause lethal wounds to \nhuman beings;\u201d \ne.  the International Association of Chiefs of Police \nwhich concluded that \u201cSemi-Automatic assault \nweapons are routinely the weapons of choice \nfor gang members and drug dealers . . . and, \nare all too often used against police officers;\u201d \nand \nf.  numerous other police organizations. \n282.   The \ncivilian \nassault \nweapons \nthat \nDefendants make and sell originated from military \nweapons developed in the mid-20th century.  In the \n1950s, \nin \nresponse \nto \nthe \nU.S. \nmilitary\u2019s \ndetermination that it wanted a lighter weapon that \nwas more lethal and had a larger ammunition \n\n95a \n \n \ncapacity, the AR-15 was developed.  The AR-15 \nallowed for rapid fire and reloading.  The U.S. \nmilitary adopted it for use in the Vietnam War and \ndubbed it the M-16.  ArmaLite sold the rights to the \nweapon to Colt. \n283.  Colt designed the version that it sells in the \nnon-military commercial market to look and feel like \na genuine military weapon.  Colt\u2019s civilian version, \nthe \u201cArmaLite Rifle-15 Sporter,\u201d can fire in only \nsemi-automatic mode, but otherwise it is physically \nidentical to the M-16. \n284.  Once Colt\u2019s patent expired, other gun \nmanufacturers produced and sold their own AR-style \nweapons.  Defendants\u2019 marketing has made these \nweapons proliferate in civilian markets today.  \nPredictably, because they look and function so \nsimilarly to the M16, they are one of the popular \nweapons trafficked to Mexico. \n285.  Assault weapons have key features that \ndistinguish them from traditional sporting rifles, \nsuch as the capacity to lay down a high volume of fire \nover a wide killing zone.  This \u201chosing down\u201d of an \narea is better suited for military combat than \nsporting guns.  And civilian assault weapons have \nmuch less recoil than traditional sporting guns, \nfacilitating quicker pulls of the trigger. \n286.  Law enforcement has consistently noted the \ndanger that assault weapons pose to public safety: \n\u2022 ATF:  assault weapons \u201care not generally \nrecognized as particularly suitable for or \nreadily adaptable to sporting purposes;\u201d \n\u2022  U.S. Department of Justice expert:  \u201cattacks \nwith semi-automatics \u2013 including assault \n\n96a \n \n \nweapons \u2013 result in more shots fired, more \npersons hit, and more wounds per victim than \ndo attacks with other guns;\u201d \n\u2022  Boston Police Commissioner:  \u201cThis [weapon] \ncan lay down a lot of fire in an urban area where \nthere is basically no cover from it.  You can \nconceal yourself from these weapons, but they\u2019ll \nrip through your car.  They\u2019ll rip through a \ntelephone pole.  They can rip through just about \nanything in an urban environment;\u201d \n\u2022  Montgomery, Alabama Sheriff:  \u201c[T]here\u2019s only \none reason for owning a gun like that\u2014killing \npeople.  There\u2019s no other use other than to kill \npeople.  That\u2019s all they\u2019re made for.\u201d \n287.  The danger posed by these weapons is \ncompounded \nby \nthe \ncriminals \nusing \nthem.  \nNumerous officials noted that assault weapons are \nthe \u201cweapon of choice\u201d for drug traffickers, gangs, \nand terrorists.  An ATF analysis of guns traced to \ncrime showed assault weapons \u201care preferred by \ncriminals over law abiding citizens eight to one.\u201d \nATF, Assault Weapons Profile 19-20 (1994).  This \ncriminal preference for assault weapons shifts the \nbalance of power to the lawless, exposing law \nenforcement officers to far greater danger. \n288.  Defendants design their assault rifles so they \ncan accept large-capacity ammunition magazines \nthat can hold 20, 30, even 75 or 100 rounds that can \nthen be fired without reloading.  Defendants\u2019 assault \nrifles, especially when coupled with large capacity \nmagazines, enable military-style assaults in which \nmany rounds can be fired in seconds. \n\n97a \n \n \n289. \n \nEven \nwhen \nnot \nmodified \nto \nfire \nautomatically, the assault weapons that Defendants \nmarket to civilians can approach the rate of fire of \nautomatic weapons.  Comparing the rate of fire \nbetween automatic and semi-automatic weapons, \none court stated, \u201c[T]he automatic firing of all the \nammunition \nin \na \nlarge-capacity \nthirty-round \nmagazine takes about two seconds, whereas a semi-\nautomatic rifle can empty the same magazine in as \nlittle as five seconds.\u201d Kolbe v. Hogan, 849 F.3d 114, \n125 (4th Cir. 2017).  The court described this \ndifference in rate of fire as \u201cnearly identical.\u201d  Id. at \n136.  Another court concurred, noting that \u201csemi-\nautomatics \nstill \nfire \nalmost \nas \nrapidly \nas \nautomatics.\u201d Heller v. D.C., 670 F.3d 1244, 1263 \n(D.C. Cir. 2011). \n290.  As Defendants know (or choose to willfully \nignore), there are several readily available ways for \nan assault weapon user to achieve even greater rates \nof fire.  Methods include, but are not limited to: \na.  A \u201cgat crank\u201d bolted to an AR-15\u2019s trigger \nwell, which allows a shooter to fire \nmultiple shots with each turn of the crank; \nb.   A bump stock that replaces the stock \n(these accessories were banned during the \nTrump administration, but the ban is \nbeing challenged in courts and at least one \ncourt has struck it down); \nc.  \u201cHell-fire\u201d triggers; \nd.  \u201cPull and release\u201d triggers; and \ne.  Bump firing, which uses the recoil of the \ngun to fire automatically or virtually \nautomatically \nwithout \nmodification \n\n98a \n \n \n(explanations for how to use this technique \nare easily available on You Tube and \nelsewhere). \n291.  An AR-15 can be modified by drilling a few \nholes and widening the inside of its frame to accept \nan M-16 auto-sear.  M-16 auto-sears are available for \nsale online.  Once the auto-sear is installed, the AR-\n15 is capable of automatic firing.  Although this \nmodification is outlawed, Defendants\u2019 chosen design \nnevertheless makes it feasible. \n292.  Defendant Barrett\u2019s .50 caliber sniper rifle is \na weapon of war.  Barrett touts itself as the world \nleader \nin \nlarge-caliber \nrifle \ndesign \nand \nmanufacturing.  The company was established when \nRonnie Barrett designed a .50 caliber shoulder-fired \nrifle, which he patented as an anti-armor gun in \n1987.  He described the rifle in his patent claim as a \n\u201cshoulder-fireable, armor-penetrating gun.\u201d \n293.  In 1999, the U.S. Government Accountability \nOffice reported that Barrett\u2019s .50 caliber rifles were \nlinked to criminal misuse \u201cwith a nexus to terrorism, \noutlaw \nmotorcycle \ngangs, \ninternational \nand \ndomestic drug trafficking, and violent crime.\u201d Gov\u2019t \nAccountability Office, Criminal Activity Associated \nwith .50 Caliber Semiautomatic Rifles 2 (1999). \n294.  Unsurprisingly, the exceptionally lethal .50 \ncaliber rifle is regularly trafficked into Mexico to \narm violent drug cartels. \n295.  According to a 1985 Secret Service report, \n\u201clarge caliber long range weapons pose a significant \nthreat for U.S. National Command Authority \nfigures.\u201d The report warned that .50 caliber rifles are \nmore accurate than shoulder-fired antitank rockets \n\n99a \n \n \nand, if used against aircraft, are immune to \nelectronic counter measures.  They also can be used \neffectively from places of concealment, outside the \nscope \nof \nnormal \nsecurity \nmeasures, \nagainst \npersonnel, aircraft, lightly armored vehicles, and \nbuildings. \n296.  Defendant Barrett\u2019s .50 caliber sniper rifle \nshoots rounds that are 5 to 10 times larger than \nthose fired by semi-automatic models, including the \nAR-15 and AK-47.  Given the range and power of \na .50 caliber Browning Machine Gun round, a rifle \nchambered to fire this round can be used to take \ndown slow- or low-flying aircraft, punch holes in \npressurized chemical tanks, or penetrate lightly \narmored vehicles\u2014such as those used by law \nenforcement and protective limousine services. \n297.   A \nU.S. \nArmy \nNews \nService \narticle \nsummarized the capabilities of the Barrett .50 \ncaliber long range sniper rifle:  \u201cThe M-107 enables \nArmy snipers to accurately engage personnel and \nmaterial [sic] targets out to a distance of 1,500 to \n2,000 meters respectively. . . . The weapon is \ndesigned to effectively engage and defeat materiel \ntargets at extended ranges including parked \naircraft, computers, intelligence sites, radar sites, \nammunition, petroleum, oil and lubricant sites, \nvarious lightly armored targets and command, \ncontrol and communications.\u201d Violence Policy \nCenter, Clear and Present Danger:  National \nSecurity Experts Worry About the Danger of \nUnrestricted Sales of 50 Caliber Anti-Armor Sniper \nRifles to Civilians (2005). \n\n100a \n \n \n298.  A 2003 U.S. Army handbook, A Military \nGuide to Terrorism in the Twenty-First Century, \nspecifically identifies Barrett\u2019s .50 caliber sniper \nrifle as a potential terrorist weapon.  Its buyers have \nincluded representatives of Osama bin Laden, the \nIrish Republican Army, and assorted militia groups.  \nAn ATF agent acknowledged that Barrett\u2019s .50 \ncaliber sniper rifle has become one of the drug \ncartels\u2019 \u201cguns of choice.\u201d \n299.  For example, the cartels have used Barrett \nrifles to shoot down helicopters, such as in this scene: \n \n300.  Defendant Century Arms designs its WASR-\n10 assault rifles as military weapons, knowing that \nthey are a preferred gun for drug cartels in Mexico.  \nCentury Arms\u2019 WASR-10 is a variant of the \nRomanian AK-47 assault weapon. \n301.  Romarm, S.A. manufactures and exports \nfrom Romania, for shipment to Century Arms in the \nU.S., stripped-down versions of WASR-10 assault \nrifles that lack features that might bar them under \n18 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 925(d)(3), \nwhich \nprohibits \nthe \nimportation into the U.S. of weapons that are not \n\u201csuitable for or readily adaptable to sporting \npurposes.\u201d \n\n101a \n \n \n302.  Romarm, S.A. ships the rifles to Century \nArms with the intention that Century Arms will \ndisassemble the imported guns and then reassemble \nthem while (1) reintroducing a number of non-\nsporting \nfeatures \nwith \nprimarily \nmilitary \napplications but also (2) replacing a number of the \nforeign-manufactured parts with American-made \nparts. \n303.  Century Arms performs the disassembly and \nreassembly before distributing WASR-10 rifles, \neither directly or through intermediary distributors, \nto gun dealers throughout the U.S., including to \ndealers with a history of trafficking the military-\nstyle weapons into Mexico. \n304.  Defendant Century Arms\u2019 disassembly and \nreassembly process tries to undermine U.S. federal \ngun importation laws by exploiting an ATF \nregulation \nthat \nsuggests \nthat \nthe \n\u201csporting \npurposes\u201d test of 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 925(d)(3) does not apply \nif the completed guns have ten or fewer imported \nparts.  See 27 C.F.R. \u00a7 478.39(a). \n305.  Under the plain language of 18 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 922(r), however, it is illegal to assemble any semi-\nautomatic rifle that (a) incorporates any foreign-\nmade parts and (b) includes features rendering it not \nsuitable for \u201csporting purposes.\u201d Century Arms \nknowingly violates \u00a7 922(r) by supplying WASR-10 \nrifles to the public after modifying them in \naccordance with the scheme described above. \n306.  Regardless of the violation of the U.S. \nimportation statute, Century Arms engages in these \npractices with full awareness that its WASR-10 is \none of the preferred weapons of the cartels in Mexico \n\n102a \n \n \nin part because of the non-sporting features and \nattributes that Century Arms incorporates into the \nweapons. \n307.  Defendants Colt, Smith & Wesson, and \nRuger, with respect to their AR-15 style weapons, \nand Century Arms with respect to its AK-47 style \nweapon, violate another U.S. federal statute\u2014a ban \non the sale of machine guns. \n308.  Defendants\u2019 AR-15 and AK-47 style guns are \nillicit \u201cmachinegun[s]\u201d even if sold to initially fire \nsemi-automatically.  In ATF\u2019s language, they \n\u201cpossess design features which facilitate full \nautomatic fire by a simple modification or \nelimination of existing component parts.\u201d \n309.  Defendants specifically design these \nweapons so that persons with minimal financial \nresources and little-to-no technical expertise can \neasily modify them to be fully automatic, including \nby simply: \na. replacing the manufacturer-installed sear \nsystem inside the gun (which enables \nsemi-automatic fire) with a third-party \nsear system which enables automatic fire; \nb.  shaving down part of the manufacturer-\ninstalled sear system to change the way it \nfunctions; or \nc.  attaching an external device such as a \n\u201cbump stock\u201d or trigger crank to the gun. \n310.  Defendants sold guns susceptible to these or \nsimilar modifications to the general public and \nthereby either directly or through intermediaries \nviolated \u00a7 922(b)(4). \n\n103a \n \n \n311.  A significant number of Defendants\u2019 guns are \nmodified to fire fully automatically for use by \ncriminals in Mexico.  Mexican authorities estimated \nin 2009 that 30% of seized AK-47 assault rifles had \nbeen modified to be fully automatic.  A 2010 ATF \nanalysis confirmed that conclusion.  And a U.S. \nGovernment Accounting Office report found that \n\u201cthe guns of choice for drug traffickers are high \ncaliber assault rifles, such as AK type and AR 15 \ntype, which are available for purchase in the United \nStates and which can be converted to fully automatic \nfire (i.e., converted into machine guns).\u201d Gov\u2019t \nAccountability Office, Firearms Trafficking:  U.S. \nEfforts to Combat Firearms Trafficking to Mexico \nHave Improved, but Some Collaboration Challenges \nRemain (2016). \n312.  Defendants\u2019 design and sale of guns that can \nbe easily modified to fire automatically causes them \nto be sought after by, and trafficked to, the cartels.  \nThe cartels then use them in Mexico with maximum \nkilling efficiency, at a rate of fire that does not belong \noutside of a battlefield. \n313.  Defendants knowingly violated U.S. federal \nguns laws by selling and marketing machine guns\u2014\nguns \nthat \ncan \nbe \neasily \nmodified \nto \nfire \nautomatically\u2014to the general public, without \ncomplying with the strictures of the National \nFirearms Act and \u00a7 922(b)(4).  Defendants commit \nthese violations with full awareness that their \nweapons\u2019 susceptibility to being modified to fire \nautomatically makes them particularly attractive to \nthe drug cartels in Mexico. \n\n104a \n \n \n314.  Defendants could limit their sales of these \nmilitary-style assault weapons to military and \nperhaps some law enforcement units.  They do not. \n315.  Defendants could restrict the sale of these \nweapons to purchasers with a legitimate need for \nthem.  They do not. \n316.  Defendants could prevent the multiple or \nrepeat sales of these weapons, to prevent trafficking \nto the drug cartels.  They do not. \n317.  Defendants could make guns to not accept \nhigh-capacity magazines that exacerbate the danger \nof assault weapons.  They do not. \n318.  Instead, Defendants indiscriminately supply \nthe civilian market, knowing that they are supplying \nthese weapons of war to gun traffickers who will use \nthem for criminal and destructive purposes in \nMexico. \n2.  Defendants market their guns as \nmilitary-style assault weapons. \n319.  Defendants have refused to heed law \nenforcement\u2019s warnings of the heightened dangers of \nassault weapons.  They have instead increased \nproduction of military-style weapons, advertised \ntheir usefulness in battling the police and military, \nsold them unrestrictedly to the general public, and \nimplemented no measures to prevent trafficking to \ndrug cartels and other criminals in Mexico. \n320.  Defendants have vastly increased production \nand sales of assault weapons.  In 1990, before the \nU.S. federal ban on sales of assault weapons, 74,000 \nassault rifles were produced or imported annually \nfor sale in the U.S.; in 2006, two years after the ban \n\n105a \n \n \nexpired, the number of these rifles sold annually in \nthe U.S. jumped to 398,000; by 2016, more than 2.3 \nmillion new weapons in the style of the AR-15 were \nsold annually to the U.S. civilian market. \n321.  Defendants have aggressively promoted the \nsale of assault weapons in an unsafe manner.  In its \nAnnual \u201cHow to Sell Issue\u201d in 2013, gun-industry \ntrade magazine Shooting Sports Retailer noted that \nexperienced hunters would \u201clikely be put off by the \nmilitary-esque attitude and marketing\u201d of tactical \nassault weapons.  But the magazine explained that \n\u201cthe tactical coolness factor does, on the other hand, \nattract a lot of first-time gun buyers . . . Unlike many \nof the hunting demographic, these potential buyers \nwill likely be interested only in tactical guns, and the \nmilitary-ish looks and features will be a big selling \npoint with them. . . .\u201d \u201cSelling Tactical,\u201d Shooting \nSports Retailer (July/August 2013). \n322.  Manufacturer Defendants\u2019 marketing \nmaterials routinely show their assault weapons \nbeing used by military personnel or positioned near \nindividuals wearing what appear to be military or \nlaw \nenforcement \nuniforms \nor \ngear. \n \nThe \naccompanying text often resembles oaths taken by \nmilitary or law enforcement personnel, implying \nthat Defendants\u2019 products are selected or chosen by \nthese groups; Defendants reinforce this association \nwith pictures of American flags. \n323.  Smith & Wesson\u2019s then-CEO candidly \ndiscussed in an investor call the importance of \ncapitalizing on this \u201chalo effect,\u201d by which the \ncompany attempts to leverage police and military \n\n106a \n \n \nassociations to enhance the credibility and thus the \nsales of its guns to the civilian market. \n324.  Defendant Smith & Wesson\u2019s marketing \ncampaign falsely and misleadingly associates its \n\u201ccivilian\u201d products with the U.S. military and law \nenforcement. \n \nIts \nadvertisements \nrepeatedly \nemphasize its weapons\u2019 ability to function in combat-\nlike scenarios and quickly dispatch a large number \nof perceived enemies with a torrent of fire.  \nExamples of Smith & Wesson\u2019s marketing to the \ngeneral public include: \n \n \n\n107a \n \n \n \n \n \n\n108a \n \n \n\n109a \n \n \n325.  Defendant Colt similarly markets its \n\u201ccivilian\u201d products as military weapons.  It markets \na \u201ccivilian\u201d assault rifle as the \u201cTrooper\u201d and touts \nthat another \u201cshares many features of its combat-\nproven brother\u201d and enables the consumer to \n\u201caccomplish any mission.\u201d Examples of Colt\u2019s \nmarketing to the general public include: \n\n110a \n \n \n\n111a \n \n \n326.  Defendant Barrett markets its \u201ccivilian\u201d .50 \ncaliber rifle as a weapon of war.  In a promotional \nbrochure, Barrett states:  \u201cWith confirmed hits out \nto 1800 meters, the Barrett model 82A1 is battle \nproven.\u201d \n327.  Barrett routinely emphasizes the military \nutility and applications of its weapons, intentionally \nappealing to buyers like the drug cartels that want \nthem for exactly the military-style assaults depicted \nin Barrett\u2019s ads.  In marketing its MRAD sniper \nrifle, Barrett touts, \u201cCrushing force that adapts to a \nwide range of needs without sacrificing performance, \nthe Barrett MRAD is a real monster in every sense.\u201d \nBy labeling its MRAD SMR a \u201cSingle Mission Rifle\u201d \nand emphasizing that it \u201ctransforms the military \nplatform\u201d for civilian use, Barrett is clearly \nappealing to buyers interested in engaging in \noffensive, \nmilitary-style \ncombat \n\u201cmissions.\u201d  \nExamples of Barrett\u2019s marketing to the general \npublic include: \n \n \n\n112a \n \n \n \n \n\n113a \n \n \n\n114a \n \n \n328. \nSimilarly, \nDefendant \nCentury \nArms \nemphasizes that its WASR-10 gun is based on a \ndesign used by \u201cRomanian ranger teams\u201d and even \nmarkets one model of the WASR-10 gun with the \nword \u201cParatrooper\u201d included in the gun\u2019s name.  In \nusing the phrase \u201cEat more ammo!\u201d to market its \nweapons to the general public, Century Arms \nhighlights the ability of its rifles to fire ammunition \nquickly.  This marketing approach would have no \nappeal to lawful civilian users, for whom burning \nthrough ammunition quickly would be wasteful and \nexpensive.  It does, however, appeal to those with \nviolent, criminal intent, like drug traffickers.  \nExamples of Century Arms\u2019 marketing to the \ngeneral public include: \n \n\n115a \n \n \n \n \n \n\n116a \n \n \n\n117a \n \n \n329.  Defendant Glock also routinely markets the \nmilitary-like applications for the guns that it \nmarkets to the general public.  It often advertises the \n\u201ctactical\u201d use of its guns by people clad in military \ndress and associates its guns with use by the police.  \nExamples of Glock\u2019s marketing to the general public \ninclude: \n \n\n118a \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n119a \n \n \n330.  On its webpage designed to sell to the \ngeneral public, Defendant Interstate Arms expressly \nmarkets itself as selling \u201cmilitary-style\u201d weapons:\n\n120a \n \n \n \n\n121a \n \n \n331.  Defendants know that these marketing \ntechniques are disproportionately likely to motivate \nand attract dangerous individuals who harbor \nmilitaristic ambitions or want to attack large \nnumbers of people.  It is the perfect message for drug \ncartels and other criminals who want to do battle \nwith the military and police in Mexico. \n332.  Defendants allow their military guns to be \nsold to any \u201clegal\u201d purchaser 18 years or older, in any \nquantity they can pay for, knowing that their \ndistribution policies enable the guns to be easily \ntrafficked to Mexico. \n3.  Defendants know that their military-\nstyle weapons are the cartels\u2019 weapons \nof choice. \n333.  Defendants are well aware that assault rifles \nand sniper rifles are the weapons of choice for violent \ncartels in Mexico, that they are routinely trafficked \nover the U.S. border into Mexico, and that both the \nMexican and U.S. governments struggle to prevent \nthe diversion. \n334.  Military-style weapons are widely known as \nthe drug cartels\u2019 weapons of choice, even though they \nare not lawfully sold anywhere in Mexico.  AR-15 \nrifles, AK-47 rifles, and .50 caliber sniper rifles are \namong the most sought-after guns by traffickers.  \nAccording to both Mexican and U.S. officials, the \npopularity of AK-47s and AR-15s has greatly \nincreased among cartels since the expiration of the \nU.S. federal assault-weapons ban in 2004. \n335.  Defendants have known for decades that \nthey were supplying the cartels with these police-\nkilling and people-killing machines.  As early as \n\n122a \n \n \n1999, a U.S. federal investigation was targeting the \nmovement of .50 caliber semi-automatic rifles from \nthe U.S. to Mexico for use by drug cartels.  Similarly, \nthe Assistant Director of ATF\u2019s Office of Field \nOperations testified in the U.S. Congress on \nFebruary \n7, \n2008 \nthat \n\u201cdrug \ntrafficking \norganizations have aggressively turned to the U.S. \nas a source of guns . . . includ[ing] the Barrett 50-\ncaliber rifle, the Colt AR-15 .223-caliber assault rifle, \n[and] the AK-47 7.62-caliber assault rifle and its \nvariants,\u201d among others.  Money, Guns, and Drugs:  \nAre U.S. Inputs Fueling Violence on the U.S.-Mexico \nBorder?, Hearing before the Subcommittee on \nNational Security and Foreign Affairs of the \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform, \n111th Congress (2009).  A 2009 Government \nAccountability \nOffice \nreport \nfound \n\u201ca \nlarge \nproportion of the guns fueling Mexican drug violence \noriginated in the United States, including a growing \nnumber of increasingly lethal weapons.\u201d Gov\u2019t \nAccountability Office, Firearms and Trafficking:  \nU.S. Efforts to Combat Arms Trafficking to Mexico \nFace Planning Coordination Challenges at 38 (2009). \n336.  The cartels covet these assault weapons \nbecause Defendants have designed them to be \nparticularly lethal and easily modified into machine \nguns.  Predictably, many of Defendants\u2019 guns \nrecovered at crime scenes in Mexico had in fact been \nmodified to fire in a fully automatic mode. \n337.  ATF also reported in 2009 that the cartels \nseek pistols able to accommodate magazines that \nhold over 10 rounds and large cartridges that can \npierce bulletproof vests.  All of the Manufacturer \nDefendants make guns that can hold large capacity \n\n123a \n \n \nmagazines of over 10 rounds, and most or all make \nguns that can use cartridges that can pierce body \narmor, including Defendant Barrett\u2019s .50 sniper \nrifle, and guns made by Beretta, Colt, Century Arms, \nSmith & Wesson, and Ruger. \n338.  It has been evident for decades that \nDefendants\u2019 distribution policies deliver a consistent \nflood of assault weapons to the cartels.  For example: \na.  In 2008, about one-quarter of guns found \nto have been trafficked from the U.S. were \na type of AR-15 or AK-47. \nb.  Defendants Barrett and Colt topped the list \nin a 2008 ATF presentation identifying \ndrug cartels\u2019 weapons of choice in Mexico.  \nThe list included Barrett\u2019s .50 caliber rifles \nand Colt\u2019s .38 Super pistols and its .45 \npistols. \nc.   In 2009, Mexican officials seized more \nthan 4,400 AK-47 and AR-15 rifles. \nd. A 2009 report cited an independent \ninvestigation listing the six most sought-\nafter guns by drug cartels in Mexico, \nincluding Defendant Colt\u2019s AR-15 .223 \ncaliber assault rifle. \ne. For the period December 2006 -August \n2010, the top two U.S.-sourced guns \nrecovered in Mexico were the AK-47 and \nAR-15.  These two types of guns comprised \n50,000 of the 85,000 crime guns recovered \nduring that period in Mexico. \n\n124a \n \n \nf.  The AK-47 and the AR-15 remained the \nfirst and second-most commonly trafficked \nguns recovered in Mexico from 2009\u20132012. \ng.  In 2011 Hearst conducted a study of 44 \nU.S. gun trafficking cases involving 165 \ncriminal defendants and 1,585 guns \ntrafficked to Mexico.  The most common \ntypes of guns found included Defendant \nColt\u2019s Super .38 pistol and Defendant \nCentury Arms\u2019 Draco 7 pistol. \nh.  Another \nstudy \nexamined \n21 \nU.S. \nprosecutions from February 2006 to \nFebruary 2009 for gun trafficking to \nMexico, accounting for 1,700 guns.  Of \nthese, the makes and models of 492 guns \nwere \nrevealed \nin \ncourt \ndocuments.  \nDefendant Barrett\u2019s .50 caliber armor-\npiercing sniper rifle again made the top of \nthe list. \n339.  The same trends continue today.  Hundreds \nof high-caliber weapons have turned up at crime \nscenes in Mexico throughout the past decade.  The \nMexican Army recovered 554 .50-caliber guns from \n2010 to 2018.  Of those, 496 were rifles, 227 of which \nwere made by Barrett. \n340.  Between 2006 and March 2018 the Mexican \nmilitary recovered some 66,000 guns at crime \nscenes.  Of those for which the make and caliber \nwere recorded, more than 12,000 were assault \nweapons.  More than 2,000 of those were \nmanufactured by Defendant Colt\u2014the most of any \nmanufacturer. \n \nNotably, \nthese \nmilitary-style \n\n125a \n \n \nweapons represent a much smaller percentage of \ncrime guns in the U.S. \n4. Defendants\u2019 reckless marketing of these \nweapons is unlawful. \n341.  Defendants\u2019 design and marketing of these \nweapons of war, combined with their refusal to \nmonitor and discipline their distribution systems, \nviolates \nthe \nmany \nstrictures \nalleged \nabove.  \nDefendants\u2019 design and marketing of these weapons \nis also independently unlawful under certain U.S. \nstates\u2019 laws. \n342.  By way of example only:  Smith & Wesson \nviolated the Massachusetts Consumer Protection \nAct, Mass. Gen. Laws c. 93A (\u201cChapter 93A\u201d), \nthrough marketing that emphasized the ability of \ncivilians to misuse Smith & Wesson assault rifles in \nunlawful, military-style attacks and encouraged \nsuch misuse. \n343.  Smith & Wesson primarily manufactures, \nmarkets, and distributes AR-15-style assault rifles \nlike the Smith & Wesson M&P 15 from a base of \noperations in Massachusetts.  It is thus subject to \nChapter 93A, which prohibits immoral or reckless \nadvertising inducing unlawful or dangerous misuse \nof products, even when harms resulting from the \nunlawful \nmarketing \nare \nfelt \noutside \nof \nMassachusetts. \n344.  Smith & Wesson knowingly violated Chapter \n93A by marketing products, including AR-15 style \nrifles like the Smith & Wesson M&P 15, to the \ncivilian market in ways that highlighted their \nefficacy for civilians wanting to carry out unlawful \n\n126a \n \n \nmilitary-style combat missions and that encouraged \nand promoted the misuse. \n345.  Smith & Wesson did so knowing that its \nmarketing would motivate and attract criminal \nusers\u2014including the cartels\u2014to select and misuse \nits products in unlawful acts of violence.  Smith & \nWesson intentionally emphasized the ability of its \nproducts to rapidly dispatch large numbers of \nopponents in armed combat, appealing especially to \ncriminals like the cartels who want to outgun and \ndefeat law enforcement or military forces. \n346.  For example, Smith & Wesson uploaded onto \nits YouTube channel a video endorsement of its M&P \n15 T model rifle from a professional shooter who \ndescribed using the weapon to establish a \u201cworld \nrecord\u201d in speed shooting involving ten shots fired \ninto four different targets in 1.59 seconds. \n347. \n \nSmith \n& \nWesson \npublished \nthe \nadvertisement noted above for an M&P 15 rifle and \nemphasized that it lets you \u201c[k]ick [b]rass\u201d by \n\u201c[b]urn[ing] through all the ammunition you want.\u201d \nSmith & Wesson repeatedly emphasized through \nbranding, including the \u201cM&P\u201d or \u201cMilitary and \nPolice\u201d designation, that its products are capable of \nbeing deployed in combat-like scenarios. \n348.  Similarly, Colt violated the Connecticut \nUnfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 42-\n110a et seq. (\u201cCUTPA\u201d), through marketing that \nemphasized the ability of civilians to misuse Colt \nassault rifles in unlawful, military-style attacks. \n349.  Colt primarily manufactures, markets, and \ndistributes semi-automatic assault rifles like its Colt \nM4 Carbines from a base of operations in \n\n127a \n \n \nConnecticut.  It is thus subject to CUTPA, which \nprohibits immoral or reckless advertising inducing \nunlawful or dangerous misuse of products, including \nwhen the harms resulting from the unlawful \nmarketing are felt outside of Connecticut. \n350.  Colt knowingly violated CUTPA by \nmarketing products like its semi-automatic assault \nrifles to the civilian market in ways that highlighted \ntheir efficacy for civilians wanting to carry out \nunlawful military-style combat missions and that \nencouraged and promoted the misuse. \n351.  For example, as noted above Colt specifically \nlabels its products with militaristic terms like \n\u201cTrooper\u201d and \u201cPatrol\u201d to increase the viewer\u2019s \nassociation of its products with military-style \ncombat.  As also noted above, Colt\u2019s advertising \nemphasizes that its assault rifles have many \nfeatures identical to Colt weapons used by military \nforces. \n352.  It was economically feasible for Defendants \nto market their products in ways that did not \nunreasonably emphasize features, functions, and \napplications that were likely to especially attract \nand motivate criminal users, including the cartels.  \nDefendants flagrantly breached their duty to avoid \nthis dangerous and inflammatory marketing. \nG. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking by Designing Their Guns to \nAllow Use by Unauthorized Persons. \n353.  Defendants magnify the dangers that their \ndistribution and marketing systems create by \ndesigning guns that are easily transferrable to the \ncriminal market in Mexico.  Defendants have known \n\n128a \n \n \nfor decades that they could include safety features to \nprevent the unauthorized use of their guns. \n354.  Using these safety features would not \ndiminish the utility of their guns for law-abiding, \nauthorized users, but it would make them less \nattractive to criminals and gun traffickers in Mexico \nand protect law enforcement and Mexican families.  \nIt was both commercially and technologically \nfeasible for Defendants to install these design \nsafeguards in their guns. \n355.  Defendants\u2019 guns are defective and \nunreasonably dangerous in that, among other \nthings, they enable any person who gains access to \nthem to fire them.  The absence of safety features \nprecluding unauthorized users facilitates unlawful \ntransfers and trafficking of these guns to Mexico \nwhere they have been used to perpetrate tens of \nthousands of homicides. \n356.  Defendants were, at all relevant times, \naware of the inherent and unreasonable dangers in \nthe design of their guns and knew that they could be \nmade and sold with the means to prevent firing by \nunauthorized users.  Defendants knew of the need \nfor design features to inhibit the trafficking of guns, \nstraw purchases, the reuse of stolen weapons, and \nother access by unauthorized users.  They further \nknew that, without the aid of additional safety \nfeatures, it was reasonably foreseeable that their \nguns would fall into the hands of unintended users \nresulting \nin \ntragic, \npreventable \nshootings\u2014\nincluding shootings with guns trafficked into \nMexico. \n\n129a \n \n \n357.  The technology for safety features that \npermit only authorized users to operate a gun has \nlong \nbeen \navailable \nto \nDefendants. \n \nOne \nmanufacturer, Taurus, has been selling handguns \nwith integral locks since 1997.  As touted on the \nmanufacturer\u2019s website, the Taurus Security System \nis \u201c[for] those with concerns about unauthorized use \nof their Taurus gun,\u201d and \u201crenders the gun \ninoperable by the use of a special key.\u201d \n358.  Defendants could also have developed and \nused more sophisticated safety features that employ \nbiometric, radio frequency, or magnetic technologies \nthat would enable only recognized users to fire the \ngun.  Inventors have created such devices since at \nleast the 1970\u2019s.  A 17-year-old from Boulder, \nColorado developed a smart handgun in 2016 that \nfires only when a finger it recognizes is on the grip. \n359.  Defendant Smith & Wesson agreed to \ninclude these safety features in its guns.  In the 2000 \nAgreement, Smith & Wesson promised to the U.S. \ngovernment and several U.S. cities to, among other \nreforms, develop \u201csmart guns\u201d that could be fired \nonly by the owner.  But Smith & Wesson reneged on \nthat promise. \n360.  Defendants are fully aware that these safety \nfeatures could, and would, prevent shootings that \ncause injury and death.  This includes preventing \ninstances where weapons are stolen by thieves or are \nsold in the criminal market in Mexico.  Smith & \nWesson\u2019s chief executive officer at the time of the \n2000 Agreement admitted that these safety \nmeasures could save lives. \n\n130a \n \n \n361.  The Government and its citizens are \ncontinually \nput \nat \nrisk \nand \nvictimized \nby \nDefendants\u2019 unreasonably dangerous products.  \nPeople in Mexico have been grievously injured or \nkilled because Defendants sell their guns without \nsafety features that would prevent shootings by \nunauthorized users and the trafficking of those \nunsafe guns into Mexico. \n362.  Defendants purposefully and intentionally \nengage in this conduct knowing full well that \nMexican residents, police officers, and military \npersonnel will foreseeably fall victim to death or \nserious \ninjuries \ncaused \nby \nthe \nactions \nof \nunauthorized users of Defendants\u2019 guns.  It was \nreasonably foreseeable that the Government would \nbe forced to bear substantial expenses as a result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct. \nH. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking by Designing Their Guns to \nEnable Defacement of Serial Numbers. \n363.  To evade detection and investigation by law \nenforcement, criminals and the traffickers who \nsupply them often obliterate or deface the serial \nnumbers on guns. \n364.  Guns without serial numbers cannot be \neffectively traced to the last retail purchaser, and \ntherefore can create a \u201ccold trail\u201d when law \nenforcement recovers a gun at the crime scene.  Guns \nwithout \nserial \nnumbers \nare \ntherefore \nmore \nattractive and marketable on the criminal market.  \nDefendants know or choose to be willfully blind to \nthese facts. \n\n131a \n \n \n365.  Defendants can make guns whose serial \nnumbers cannot be obliterated or defaced, or guns in \nwhich a hidden serial number will be hard or \nimpossible for the criminal to detect.  For example, \nyears ago Beemiller d/b/a Hi Point Guns began \nincluding a second hidden serial number on some \nguns.  In the 2000 Agreement, Smith & Wesson \ncommitted to the U.S. federal government that it \nwould likewise include these features. \n366.  Many of Defendants\u2019 guns have been \ntrafficked to Mexico and recovered with obliterated \nor defaced serial numbers.  Defendants nevertheless \nrefuse to include non-defaceable or hidden serial \nnumbers on all of their guns.  This deliberate \ndecision further facilitates, enables, and assists in \nthe trafficking of their guns to Mexico. \nI. Defendants Actively Assist and Facilitate \nTrafficking by Refusing to Implement the \nReforms They Know Are Necessary. \n367.  Defendants well know what reforms to their \ndistribution \nsystems \nare \nneeded \nto \nprevent \ntrafficking of their guns into Mexico.  They simply \nchoose to repudiate the reforms, and to continue \nsupplying the cartels, in order to maximize their \nsales and profits. \n368.  For example, in 1999 Ruger adopted a policy \nprohibiting its distributors from selling to any \ndealers not selling \u201cexclusively\u201d from their retail \nstores.  The policy prevented Ruger dealers from \nselling at gun shows, which Ruger stated \u201cwill help \nensure compliance with laws.\u201d But after a laudatory \nDenver Post editorial generated criticism, Ruger \nissued a \u201cclarification\u201d that repudiated the new \n\n132a \n \n \npolicy and claimed it was not meant to affect dealers \nselling at gun shows. \n369.  In the 2000 Agreement Defendant Smith & \nWesson agreed to reform its distribution practices by \nselling only through authorized distributors and \nauthorized dealers that: \na.   Commit to a standard of conduct to make \nevery effort to eliminate sales of guns that \nmight lead to illegal gun possession or \nmisuse by criminals and other prohibited \npersons (\u201csuspect guns sales\u201d).  Suspect \ngun sales include sales made to straw \npurchasers, multiple sales of handguns \nwithout reasonable explanation (excluding \nsales to licensed dealers), and sales made \nto any purchaser without a completed \nbackground check. \nb.   Make no sales at gun shows unless all \nsales by any seller at the gun show are \nconducted only upon completion of a \nbackground check. \nc.   Maintain an inventory tracking plan. \nd. Implement a security plan for securing \nguns, including guns in shipment. \ne.   Not sell ammunition magazines that are \nable to accept more than 10 rounds. \nf.   Require all employees to attend annual \ntraining that includes how to recognize \nstraw purchasers and other attempts to \npurchase guns illegally; how to recognize \nindicators that guns may be diverted for \nlater sale or transfer to those not legally \n\n133a \n \n \nentitled to purchase them; how to respond \nto those attempts; and the safe handling \nand storage of guns. \ng.   Not complete any transfer of a gun before \nreceiving notice from the National Instant \nCheck System that the transferee is not a \nprohibited person under the Gun Control \nAct. \nh.  Verify the validity of a licensee\u2019s federal \nfirearms license before transferring a gun \nto that licensee. \ni.    Forgo any transfer of a gun to a licensee if \nthe dealer or distributor knows the \nlicensee to be under indictment for \nviolations of the Gun Control Act or any \nviolent felony or serious drug offense as \ndefined in 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(e)(2). \nj.   Transfer guns only to individuals who have \ndemonstrated that they can safely handle \nand store guns. \nk.   Limit multiple handgun sales. \nl.    Not market any gun in a way that would \nmake the gun particularly appealing to \ncriminals, such as advertising a gun as \n\u201cfingerprint resistant.\u201d \nm.  Refrain from selling any modified or \nsporterized semi-automatic assault pistol \nof a type that cannot be imported into the \nU.S. \nn.  Terminate \ndealers \nthat \nsell \na \ndisproportionate number of crime guns \n\n134a \n \n \nunless there is a satisfactory explanation \nand proposal. \no.   Cooperate fully with law enforcement and \nregulators to eliminate illegal guns sales \nand possession. \np. Dedicate one percent of annual gun \nrevenues to a trust fund for a public \ninformation campaign about the risk of \ngun misuse, safe storage, and the need to \ndispose of guns responsibly. \nq. Make safer guns, including a second \n\u201chidden\u201d serial number and an internal \nlocking device (to prevent unauthorized \nuse), and to invest in \u201csmart\u201d authorized-\nuser technology. \nr.   Stop selling large capacity magazines, or \npistols that can accept them. \ns.  Include prominent warnings about the \nrisks of guns and accidental shootings \nwhen guns are improperly stored. \nt.   Not sell guns that can be readily converted \nto an illegal gun or that are resistant to \nfingerprints. \n370.  The Smith & Wesson 2000 Agreement was \nan acknowledgement that gun manufacturers can \nand should sell, market, distribute, and design guns \nto prevent their trafficking to criminal markets. \n371.  Then Smith & Wesson\u2014alone against the \nrest of the industry\u2014faced a boycott.  Smith & \nWesson received the message that it would be \nfinancially punished if it strayed from the industry \nline of selling guns without standards, restrictions, \n\n135a \n \n \nor any measures to prevent supplying the criminal \nmarket.  So Smith & Wesson ultimately disregarded \nits obligations under the 2000 Agreement. \n372.  In the years since the 2000 Agreement, no \ngun manufacturer or distributor has adopted any of \nthe terms or practices in it.  In the years since the \nU.S. Department of Justice specifically called on gun \nmanufacturers and distributors to implement \nsimilar reforms to fulfill their legal responsibilities, \nno gun manufacturer or distributor has heeded those \nrequests. \n373.  Gun industry insider Robert Ricker \nexplained in 2003:  \u201cIt would greatly reduce gun \ncrime if the companies, the manufacturers and \ndistributors could take the information that ATF is \nwilling to share with them [gun trace data] and zero \nin on those problem areas.  . . . You would be able to \nweed out the bad apples.\u201d \n374.  Defendants are also aware of the findings \nmade against them by Judge Weinstein in NAACP \nv. AcuSport, Inc., 271 F. Supp. 2d 435 (E.D.N.Y. \n2003). \nThe \ncourt \nconcluded \nthat \n\u201c[p]rivate \nmanufacturers and distributors of handguns have \nfailed to take minimum circumspect steps to limit \nleakage of their guns into criminal hands.\u201d  Id. at \n453.  He concluded as fact that \u201c[p]laintiff\u2019s \nproposals for changes in the marketing and \ndistribution of guns would reduce the illegal market \nin guns and the [consequent] injuries.\u201d  Id. at 510.  \nIn particular: \n\u201cManufacturing and distribution agreements \nthat are readily entered into by defendants \n\n136a \n \n \nwould have a substantial effect in reducing the \nillegal flow of firearms. . . .\u201d Id. \n\u201cIf some defendant had provided employee \ntraining for employees and others in the \nprimary legitimate merchandising chain, many \nguns would not have found their way illegally \ninto\u201d the illegal secondary market.  Id. \n\u201cIf defendants had studied available trace \nrequest data and acted upon it to better control \nits downstream customers, they could have \nused the information to prevent fear and injury \nto [the affected population].  This information \nwas and is available to defendants.\u201d Id. \n\u201c[T]here \nwas \na \nstatistically \nsignificant \nrelationship between the number of certain \ndistribution oversight practices followed by a \nmanufacturer and its ratio of trace share to \nmarket share...\u201d  Id. at 513. \n\u201c[T]here is a significant relationship between \ncertain characteristics of dealers\u2014e.g., selling \nguns later recovered with an obliterated serial \nnumber\u2014and dealer\u2019s trace rate (traces divided \nby sales).\u201d  Id. at 514. \n\u201c[M]anufacturers that have the following \npractices have smaller crime gun ratios:  \nrequiring evidence of a storefront, having an \nauthorized \ndealer \nprogram, \nmaintaining \nrecords of sales to individual dealers, visiting \ndealers frequently, commissioning market \nstudies, maintaining distributor agreements, \nimposing controls over how the product is \nadvertised and inquiring about inventory level \nof distributors.\u201d  Id. at 522. \n\n137a \n \n \n\u201cThere are indicators other than amount of \nsales which lead to the conclusion that a \nparticular dealer\u2019s guns would be more likely to \nbe in the hands of criminals.  The dealer \nindicators related to crime gun flows are:  (1) \nout of state traces; (2) obliterated serial number \ntraces; (3) multiple traces for the same \npurchaser; (4) multiple traces for the same \npurchaser and the same dealer; (4) multiple \nsales forms; (5) traces from multiple sales form \nguns; (6) record keeping problems; (7) multiple \nlicenses at same location; and (8) bypassed \ngeographically closer dealers to seller\u2014i.e., the \npurchaser for illegal use goes out of his way \ngeographically to buy from retailers with a poor \nrecord for crime gun traces.\u201d  Id. at 522-523. \nThe \u201cmechanisms that could have been \nemployed by defendants\u2014using their existing \nmarketing \ninfrastructures\u2014to \nprevent \n\u2018diversion\u2019 or guns being acquired by persons \nprohibited from owning or possessing guns\u201d \ninclude \u201crequiring dealers and distributors to \nreport the number of trace requests upstream \nto \nmanufacturers \nand \ndistributors; \ndevelopment of a management code that would \nestablish standards of conduct on the part of \nmembers of the distribution system, including \nguidelines regarding sales to types of dealers, \nsuch as stocking dealers with storefront \nestablishments; requiring minimum inventory; \nimposing \nliability \ninsurance \nstandards; \nlimiting sales at gun shows; limiting multiple \nsales; \nlimiting \nhow \nthe \nconsumer \ngun \ntransaction can be conducted to insure security; \n\n138a \n \n \neducation \nand \ntraining \nof \ndealers; \nand \nmonitoring dealers through visitation and other \nregular interaction.\u201d  Id. at 523  \n\u201cRelatively excessive numbers of traces to \nspecific retailers or first purchasers is ... cause \nfor alarm by Manufacturer Defendants who are \nnot foreclosed from closing off illegal flows of \ntheir guns to such retailers.\u201d  Id. at 504. \n\u201cThe likelihood of wrongdoing is substantially \nenhanced \nwhen \ncertain \npractices \nby \nManufacturer Defendants are followed and \ncertain precautions not taken by Manufacturer \nDefendants.\u201d  Id. at 504-505. \n\u201cIt is appropriate for a manufacturer to \nundertake to control its customers by contract \nand supervision to reduce the probability that \nthey will be sources of guns for criminals.\u201d  Id. \nat 506. \n\u201cATF lacks sufficient resources to conduct \nfocused inspections and investigations of many \ndealers who may be violating gun laws.\u201d Id. \n\u201cAnalysis of the [tracing] data demonstrated \nthat more prudent merchandising programs by \nManufacturer \nDefendants \ncould \nhave \nsubstantially \nreduced \nguns \nflowing \ninto \ncriminal hands, used in many murders and \ninjuries which could have been avoided by \nManufacturer \nDefendants\u2019 \nmore \nprudent \nmerchandising.\u201d  Id. at 504. \n\u201cWhen a relatively large number of traces are \ndetermined by Manufacturer Defendants to be \nattributable to particular retailers, prudent \nManufacturer Defendants can take steps to \n\n139a \n \n \nensure that their guns are not too easily falling \ninto criminals\u2019 hands.\u201d  Id. \n375.  Defendants have done the opposite of what \nthey know is needed to minimize the flow of guns to \ncriminals in Mexico.  Among other things, they have \nincreased production and sales of military-style \nassault weapons and high-capacity magazines; \nincreased \nmarketing \nattractive \nto \ncriminals; \ncontinued to use dealers and practices that arm \ncriminals \nin \nMexico; \nand \nfought \nto \nevade \naccountability \nfor \nsupplying \ncriminals \nand \nfacilitating gun violence. \n376.  For decades, Defendants knew or choose to \nbe willfully blind to the fact that their business \npractices supply the unlawful market in guns in \nMexico.  As a direct and foreseeable result of \nDefendants\u2019 irresponsible conduct, Defendants arm \nunauthorized and irresponsible persons who wreak \nhavoc and injure and kill people and cause other \nsubstantial harm in Mexico. \nVII. DEFENDANTS ACTIVELY ASSIST AND \nFACILITATE THE UNLAWFUL \nTRAFFICKING BECAUSE IT MAXIMIZES \nTHEIR SALES AND PROFITS. \nA. Defendants Intentionally Created and Use \na Distribution System that Aids Sales to \nthe Criminal Market. \n377.  Manufacturer Defendants enjoy exclusive \ndiscretion in their methods of distribution and choice \nof the distributors and dealers to which they sell.  \nThey can limit product access to responsible dealers \nand consumers.  They can implement appropriate \n\n140a \n \n \nand prudent distribution practices.  They simply \nchoose not to do so. \n378.  Manufacturer Defendants generally use a \nthree-tier distribution:  (1) manufacturers sell guns \nto distributors, (2) distributors then sell guns to \nretailers, and (3) retailers sell guns to civilian \npurchasers.  This system is not required by law.  \nManufacturers could sell guns through their own \ndealerships (and they sometimes have) or maintain \nin-house distribution departments that sell to \ndealers (some do, for some sales).  But they choose \nnot to. \n379.  Manufacturer \nDefendants \ncould \nalternatively use a three-tier distribution system \nwhile allowing their guns to be sold by only \nauthorized \ndealers \nthat \nmaintain \nminimum \nstandards of responsible conduct and provide \ninformation to the manufacturers that would enable \nthem to assess if their guns are being sold legally \nand carefully.  But they choose not to. \n380.  When responsible, law-abiding industries \nare concerned about problems in the sales or \ndistribution of their products, they do something \nabout it.  Defendants can monitor and control their \ndistribution system\u2014and they do, when it makes \nthem money. \n381.   One example:  years ago, Defendant \nBeretta \nsought \nto \nprotect \nits \nforeign \nsales \nrepresentatives\u2019 business by discouraging U.S. \ndealers from selling guns abroad.  So Beretta wrote \nto at least one of its distributors with a list of factors \nthat would indicate that a dealer might be making \nunauthorized international sales, such as \u201cthe size \n\n141a \n \n \nof the order, past history of the particular dealer, the \nsize and nature of the order relative to normal \nbuying practices of the dealer, et cetera.\u201d Beretta \nadmitted this was done to \u201ccontrol the distribution \nprocess.\u201d \n382.  Defendants have long known they can \nimpose similar controls to prevent dealers from \nsupplying the criminal market.  They choose not to. \n383.   Defendants do not live on another planet in \nwhich they are sheltered from news of their corrupt \ndealers, the trafficking of their guns into Mexico, \nand the devastating damage suffered by the \nGovernment and its people.  They simply choose to \nact as if they are blind\u2014willfully blind\u2014to those \nfacts. \n384. \nDefendants \nhave \naffirmatively \nand \ndeliberately chosen to maintain their supply chain to \nthe cartels, and refused calls for reform, because, \nfrom the perspective of their bottom lines, their \ndistribution systems are huge successes.  Their \nsupply of guns to the criminal market in Mexico is a \nfeature, not a bug. \nB.  A Substantial Portion of Defendants\u2019 \nSales and Profits Come From Guns \nTrafficked to Mexico. \n385.  Defendants have long known that the \ncriminal market in Mexico is a significant source of \nrevenue and profit for them. \n386. \nIn \n2003, \nNortheastern \nUniversity \ncriminologist James Fox estimated that 9.55% of \nhandguns produced in 1997 and 25.51% of handguns \nproduced in 1991 were used in crimes by the end of \n2001 (the study was not limited to crimes in Mexico).  \n\n142a \n \n \nThat is a conservative estimate, as it does not \ninclude the thousands of crimes of illegal gun \npossession.  Other analyses have shown that 18% of \nhandguns sold in 1990 were in the hands of violent \ncriminals or used in violent crimes by 2000. \n387.  Defendants know that many of their guns \nare headed for the criminal market, either \nimmediately or after some time, and they know that \nmeans significant money for them.  And they act \naccordingly to maximize that revenue and profit. \n388.  Visiting Mexico City while campaigning for \npresident in 2016, U.S. President Donald Trump \nstated that \u201c[n]o one wins in either country\u201d when \n\u201cillegal weapons and cash flow from the United \nStates into Mexico.\u201d But that is not true\u2014illicit \nweapons trafficking to Mexico creates immense \nprofit for Defendants and other gun manufacturers \nand dealers. \n389.  Based on the estimates described above, the \nvalue of guns trafficked from the U.S. into Mexico is \nnow well more than $250 million annually \n(calculated at the original sales price).  The annual \nvalue of these Defendants\u2019 guns trafficked into \nMexico is well more than $170 million. \n390.  These are estimates; the actual profits and \nrevenues reaped by Defendants from supplying \ncriminals in Mexico may be even greater.  What is \ncertain is that criminals in Mexico are a significant \nmarket for Defendants, which explains Defendants\u2019 \nbusiness decisions to keep supplying them. \n391.  The illicit trafficking to Mexico and the \nimmense profits to be made have resulted in a \nsubstantial increase in the number of gun stores \n\n143a \n \n \npopulating the border areas.  In 2010, there were \n8,354 licensed dealers in California, Texas, New \nMexico, and Arizona.  By 2019 more than 1,569 new \nlicensed dealers had set up shop in those states, \nwhile nationwide the number of dealers is declining.  \nBorder-state gun dealers now sell twice as many \nguns as dealers in other areas of the country. \n392.  The Government has long recognized and \nlong criticized the build-up of gun dealers along the \nborder.  In January 2008, Mexican Ambassador \nArturo Sarukh\u00e1n criticized the availability of \nweapons along the border:  \u201cBetween Texas and \nArizona alone, you\u2019ve got 12,000 gun shops along \nthat border with Mexico.\u201d \n393.  Thirteen years later, Fabian Medina \nHernandez, former chief of the Office of the Ministry \nof Foreign Affairs of Mexico echoed the same \noutrage:  \u201cI don\u2019t know that they have as many \nMcDonald\u2019s restaurants as they have gun stores \nthere.\u201d (As of 2017 there were approximately 50,271 \nmore gun stores than McDonald\u2019s in the United \nStates.) A chart showing the change in licensed \ndealers from 2010 to 2019 is reproduced here: \n\n144a \n \n \n(Source:  ATF Data) \n \n\n145a \n \n \n394.  This black-market financial boon is not \nlimited to Defendants\u2019 sales to dealers along the \nsouthwestern border.  Research from the University \nof San Diego estimates that nearly half of all U.S. \ngun dealers profit from illegal arms trafficking from \nthe U.S. into Mexico.  Defendants and other gun \nmanufacturers and dealers managed to grow this \nsegment of the gun market even while the number \nof gun owners (not guns) in the U.S. decreased. \n395.  For many dealers, the unlawful flow of arms \ninto Mexico has been their economic lifeblood.  The \nUniversity of San Diego researchers estimate that, \nwithout the demand for weapons trafficking into \nMexico, roughly 47% of licensed gun dealers would \ngo out of business.  The spillover effect on the \nManufacturer Defendants would be substantial \nbecause they would lose significant legitimate sales \nand profits in addition to those generated by the \ntrafficked products. \nVIII.  THE GOVERNMENT HAS TAKEN \n REASONABLE MEASURES TO TRY TO \n PROTECT ITSELF FROM \n DEFENDANTS\u2019 UNLAWFUL CONDUCT. \n396.  The Government has\u2014for decades\u2014enacted \nnumerous laws and policies aimed at limiting the \nnumber of both legal and illegal gun ownership \nwithin the nation.  Defendants\u2019 conduct directly \nundermines these efforts and the Government\u2019s \nability to structure and govern Mexican society. \nA. The \nGovernment \nHas \nSignificantly \nRestricted the Lawful Ownership and \nUse of Guns Within Mexico. \n\n146a \n \n \n397.  Mexico has stringent gun laws, enacted \nsolely at the federal level, in which private gun \nownership is closely monitored, regulated, and \nrestricted.  See Ley Federal de Armas de Fuego y \nExplosivos [LFAFE] Articulo 2\u00b0, Diario Oficial de la \nFederation [DOF] 11-1-1972, ultimas reformas DOF \n12-11-2015 (Mex.).  The United Nations has called \nthese laws among the most restrictive in the world.  \nAnd Mexico remains an insignificant player in the \nmanufacturing and production of guns. \n398.  The Ministries of Internal Affairs and \nNational Defense control all guns nationwide.  The \nLFAFE mandates that all guns in the nation be \nregistered with the Federal Arms Registry.  LFAFE \nsignificantly limits the private possession of guns, \nprohibiting, for example, semi-automatic pistols \nwith a caliber greater than .380 and all guns using \nthe .223 caliber round, commonly used in AR-style \nrifles. \n399.  Applicants for gun permits must prove their \nneed to carry weapons as well as their prior history \nof honesty and prudence, with the testimony of five \npersons well known to the authority.  A photo of a \nMexican Gun Registration Card is reproduced here: \n\n147a \n \n \n\n148a \n \n \n400.  Citizens who pass the background check \nreceive a one-year permit.  Applicants must be \nmembers of a \u201cshooting club\u201d and are limited to \npurchasing and owning one handgun.  This handgun \nis available for self-defense only and must be kept \ninside the home. \n401.  Moreover, guns are available from only one \ndealer and store in the entire country\u2014the UCAM \n(Unidad de Comercializaci\u00f3n de Armamento y \nMuniciones).  The store is located in Mexico City and \nis owned, operated, and heavily guarded by the \nMexican military.  The store sells on average just 38 \nguns a day to civilians. \n402.  Again, the media has provided Defendants \nwith this information in easy-to-read graphics, \nreproduced here: \n \n\n149a \n \n \n \n\n150a \n \n \n403.  Lawful civilian gun ownership in Mexico is \ntherefore extremely rare.  In 2013 only 3,140 private \ncitizens in Mexico (2.6 per 100,000 population) \npossessed a valid weapon permit.  In the five-year \nperiod between 2013 and 2018, the Government \nissued only 218 additional gun licenses. \nB.  The Government Has Implemented Many \nOther Programs to Try to Blunt the \nEffects of Defendants\u2019 Conduct. \n404.  Both the United States and Mexico have \nundertaken measures to try to stem the flow of \nillegal weapons into Mexico, some of them at the \nhighest levels of government.  In 2007, for example, \nthe United States and Mexico announced the Merida \nInitiative, a package of U.S. assistance for Mexico \nand Central America.  As part of the emphasis on \n\u201cshared responsibility\u201d the Government pledged to \ntackle \ncrime \nand \ncorruption, \nand \nthe \nU.S. \ngovernment pledged to address domestic drug \ndemand and the illicit trafficking of guns to Mexico. \n405.  Among its objectives, the M\u00e9rida Initiative \nset out to develop a secure and competitive \u201c21st \nCentury Border\u201d that would ensure the efficient and \nlegitimate \nflow \nof \ngoods \nand \npeople, \nwhile \nguaranteeing the safety of citizens and interrupting \nthe flow of drugs, weapons, and other contraband. \n406.  From March 31 to April 3, 2009, the \n\u201cBinational \nConference \non \nArms \nTrafficking \nbetween Mexico and the United States\u201d was held, \nwith the participation of the heads of the Attorney \nGeneral\u2019s Office and the Secretary of the Interior for \nMexico; and on behalf of the U.S. Government, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security and the Attorney \n\n151a \n \n \nGeneral.  Among the agreements reached at the \nmeeting in Mexico was the creation of a working \ngroup called \u201cSubgroup on Attention to Arms \nTrafficking within the framework of the Merida \nInitiative,\u201d which worked within the Interagency \nCoordination Group for the Prevention and Control \nof Trafficking in Firearms, Ammunition and \nExplosives. \n407.  Other joint Mexico/U.S. efforts have \nincluded:  (1) investigating individuals responsible \nfor illicit guns trafficking; (2) coordinating law \nenforcement efforts in gun cases and violent crime; \n(3) training U.S. and Mexican law enforcement \nofficials to identify gun traffickers; and (4) tracing all \nguns to identify traffickers, trends, patterns, and \nnetworks.  Among the results have been increases in \nATF traces of guns recovered in Mexico, cases \ninitiated and referred to prosecutor to the U.S. \nAttorneys\u2019 Offices, and inspections of U.S. gun \ndealers. \n408.  For decades, U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, the Mexican Federal Police and the \nSecretary of National Defense, have performed \n\u201cmirror operations,\u201d through which Mexican and \nAmerican authorities patrol the border.  Although \ntheir main purpose is to tackle human smuggling, \nthese operations are useful to dissuade the illegal \nactivities of organized crime at the border, including \ngun trafficking. \n409.  In 2010, the Mexican Attorney General\u2019s \nOffice and the U.S. agreed to allow Mexico access to \nthe e-Trace Firearms Tracing System, which \nprovides information on firearms secured in Mexico \n\n152a \n \n \n(model and serial number), as well as the first \npurchaser (name, date, and place of birth) and the \nplace where it was acquired (city, state, and gun \nshop). \n410.  Mexico has also worked with U.S. state \ngovernments to curb arms trafficking.  In March \n2013, a working meeting was held with five U.S. \nstate attorneys general (California, Colorado, Idaho, \nNevada, and New Mexico), in which the issue of \narms trafficking, among others, was discussed. \n411.  In May 2019, the Government spoke with \nU.S. authorities, such as U.S. Customs and Border \nProtection, on ways to reduce arms trafficking, \namong other border security issues. \n412.  The Government\u2019s officials regularly meet \nwith \nrepresentatives \nfrom \nATF, \nthe \nU.S. \nDepartment of Homeland Security, U.S. Customs \nand Border Protection, the U.S. Department of \nState, and the International Narcotics and Law \nEnforcement Bureau, within the framework of the \nArms Trafficking Subgroup of the U.S.-Mexico High-\nLevel Security Group. \n413.  On January 30, 2020, a joint strategy \nbetween Mexico and the United States to seal the \nborders and reduce arms trafficking was made \npublic; \nthe \nGovernment \nhighlighted \nthe \nparticipation of the Mexican Ministry of Public \nAdministration, through its Internal Control Bodies, \nto provide permanent support to its anti-corruption \nprogram. \n414.  At the multilateral level, at the II Session of \nthe Group of Governmental Experts of the \nMultilateral Evaluation Mechanism held from \n\n153a \n \n \nSeptember 24 to October 5, 2007, in Washington, \nD.C., and at the 42nd Session of the Inter-American \nDrug Abuse Control Commission, held from \nNovember 27 to 30, 2007 in Santa Marta, Colombia, \nthe \nGovernment \nurged \ngreater \ninternational \nattention to the links between illicit arms trafficking \nand illicit drug trafficking. \n415.  Within the United Nations, the Government \ncontinued the work of the United Nations Program \nof Action to Prevent, Combat and Eradicate the \nIllicit Trade in Small Arms and Light Weapons in All \nIts Aspects, including at the Latin American and \nCaribbean Preparatory Meeting for the III Biennial \nMeeting of States (Bogota, Colombia, June 2008).  At \nthe 51st Regular Session, the Commission on \nNarcotic Drugs adopted a resolution presented by \nMexico on \u201cLinks between drug trafficking and \nfirearms trafficking,\u201d with the purpose of promoting \nrecognition by the international community of the \ngrowth of this phenomenon, as well as the \nimportance \nof \nimproving \ncontrols \non \nthe \nmanufacture, import and export of firearms and \nammunition. \n416.  The Government ratified the Inter-American \nConvention against the Illicit Manufacturing and \nTrafficking of Firearms, Ammunition, Explosives \nand Other Related Materials (CIFTA) of the \nOrganization of American States, the purpose of \nwhich is to prevent the illicit production and \ntrafficking of arms in the region.  By proposal of \nMexico, an Advisory Committee for CIFTA was \ncreated in which experts study and present proposed \napproaches to the illicit trafficking of weapons in the \nregion. \n\n154a \n \n \n417.  Between September 2008 and June 2009, the \nAttorney General\u2019s Office, through the Inter-\nAmerican Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) \nand CIFTA, promoted the creation of a Hemispheric \nFirearms \nRegistry \nand \nparticipated \nin \nthe \npreparation of the CIFTA Model Legislation Project. \n418.  In March 2015, Mexico and the Government \nof the Republic of Guatemala signed the Protocol on \nCooperation to Prevent and Combat the Illicit \nManufacturing of and Trafficking in Firearms, their \nParts \nand \nComponents, \nAmmunition \nand \nExplosives. \n419.  In 2019 and 2020, the Government promoted \nthe security cooperation agenda with the U.S. and \nCanada, which includes combating arms trafficking.  \nDuring the two years, the Government held 19 high-\nlevel bilateral meetings, which included meetings \nwith the U.S. Attorney General on December 5, \n2019, and January 16, 2020. \n420.  Mexico is also part of the United Nations \nArms Trade Treaty (ATT).  The treaty\u2019s goals are to \nestablish common international standards to better \nregulate the international trade of conventional \nweapons, \neliminate \nthe \nillicit \ntrafficking \nof \nconventional arms, and prevent their diversion.  In \n2015, Mexico hosted the First Conference of the \nParties. \n421.  In August 2020, Mexico participated in the \nSixth Conference of the States Parties to ATT, and \nas a result of the Government\u2019s proposal, the parties \nestablished a forum for the exchange of information \non cases of arms diversion. \n\n155a \n \n \n422.  On May 16, 2019, at the tenth edition of the \nMechanism \nfor \nConsultations \non \nNew \nand \nTraditional Security Issues Mexico-Canada held in \nOttawa, Canada, arms trafficking was addressed. \n423.  On December 5 and 6, 2019, officials from the \nMexican Ministry of the Navy participated in the IV \nMeeting of the North American Drug Policy \nDialogue, held in Washington, D.C. and attended by \ndelegations from the governments of Mexico, the \nU.S. and Canada.  The participants addressed \ncooperation agreements to combat drug and arms \ntrafficking affecting the region, as well as its illicit \nfinancing. \n424.  Mexico is also a party to the United Nations \nConvention against Transnational Organized Crime \n(Palermo Convention) and its three protocols.  In \nJuly 2020, Mexico chaired the Working Group on \nFirearms of the Protocol.  Based on the work carried \nout in the Working Group, Mexico presented a \nResolution during the Conference of the Parties of \nthe Palermo Convention held in October 2020 in \nVienna, Austria.  The document seeks to strengthen \nthe capacity to respond to emerging threats, \nincluding arms trafficking on the deep web, in \naddition to strengthening the inclusion of databases, \nmarking, and registration of weapons. \n425.  Also, the Office of the General Attorney has \na cooperation agreement with Eurojust to receive \nassistance and technical-legal support on matters \nrelated to gun trafficking.  It also has a cooperation \nagreement with Europol that provides assistance to \nState Attorneys and Public Safety Authorities at the \nfederal, state, and municipal level. \n\n156a \n \n \n426.  Mexico participates in the cooperation \nprograms that the European Union offers to 18 Latin \nAmerican \ncountries \nto \nprovide \ntraining \nand \nassistance of experts in order to combat organized \ncrime. \n427.  The Government\u2019s unilateral strategic \ninitiatives \nare \nalso \nongoing. \n \nDuring \nthe \nAdministration of President Andr\u00e9s Manuel L\u00f3pez \nObrador, the Government deployed its Joint Action \nStrategy to Curb the Illicit Flow of Arms on the \nNorthern Border, coordinated by the Secretary of \nSecurity \nand \nCitizen \nProtection, \nwith \nthe \nparticipation of other federal law enforcement \nagencies\u2014the Attorney General\u2019s Office, the Tax \nAdministration Service, the Secretary of National \nDefense, the Secretary of the Navy, and the National \nGuard.  Its main objectives are to curtail the \ncapabilities \nof \norganized \ncrime \ngroups \nand \nstrengthen Mexico\u2019s technological capabilities to \ndeal with arms trafficking. \n428.  The Strategy also includes a scheme to fight \narms trafficking on the northern border, based on \ninspections carried out by the Tax Administration \nSystem (SAT) at six customs crossings (Tijuana, \nBaja California; Nogales, Sonora; Ciudad Juarez, \nChihuahua; Nuevo Laredo, Tamaulipas; Reynosa, \nTamaulipas; and Matamoros, Tamaulipas), through \nperipheral security.  In addition, the Ministry of \nNational Defense participates in joint inspections \nwith SAT in 15 other customs offices. \n429.  To further improve national security, on July \n17, 2020, President Lopez Obrador instructed the \nArmed Forces to take over the country\u2019s border and \n\n157a \n \n \ninterior customs.  The Secretary of National \nDefense, the Mexican Army, will have a presence in \nthe 21 border customs, the Secretary of the Navy in \nthe 17 maritime customs, and in the future it will be \ndefined who will guard the 11 inland customs.  This \ninitiative, in addition to reducing tax evasion, seeks \nto combat the illicit trafficking of arms, ammunition, \nexplosives, drugs, and hydrocarbons.  The activities \ncarried out by the military in customs include their \nintegral administration, the security of the facilities, \nand vehicle and merchandise inspections, among \nothers. \n430.  Periodically, the Government carries out \nFirearms Exchange campaigns through which the \nfederal, state, and local governments, together with \nthe private sector, purchase firearms from citizens \nin exchange for economic incentives or household \nitems.  Likewise, the Government carries out \nFederal Firearms Registration campaigns through \nwhich it verifies the registration of firearms and \ncarries out extraordinary inspections in Military \nZones. \n431.  To stop arms trafficking, the Government \ncreated the Inter-Institutional Coordination Group \nfor the Prevention and Control of Firearms, \nAmmunition and Explosives Trafficking, which met \nseveral times a year:  for example, between \nSeptember 2007 and June 2008, the Technical \nSubcommittee held 128 inter-secretariat meetings \nwith national and international agencies; from \nSeptember 2010 to June 2011, it held 15 meetings; \nbetween September 2011 and June 2012, it held 16 \nmeetings. \n\n158a \n \n \n432.  On several occasions, the Group carried out \nactions in collaboration with the United States:  in \nNovember 2016 and March 2017, the Binational \nMeetings of the Interagency Group for the \nPrevention and Control of Firearms Trafficking were \nheld in Mexico City to review cooperation issues \nbetween Mexico and the United States; on October \n5, 2019, in coordination with the U.S. government, \nthe Group held the Mexico-US Bilateral Workshop \nentitled \u201cDismantling the Tools of Transnational \nCrime-Arms Trafficking and Money Laundering.\u201d \n433.  These efforts and many more\u2014those of the \nGovernment and of the U.S. authorities\u2014have been \nunable to stem the flood of guns resulting from \nDefendants\u2019 persistent, deliberate, and continual \nconduct.  The Defendants, not the Government, have \nthe authority to structure and monitor Defendants\u2019 \ndistribution chains.  The Defendants, not the \nGovernment, have the ability to use real-time sales \ndata and other indicia to detect sales patterns \nreflecting suspect sales.  The Defendants, not the \nGovernment, have the authority to discipline \ndistributors and dealers that sell to straw \npurchasers and otherwise supply traffickers.  The \nGovernment will continue to do all that it can.  But \nthe Defendants must act on the information and \nauthority that only they have. \nIX.  DEFENDANTS CAUSE MASSIVE INJURY \nTO THE GOVERNMENT. \nA.  Defendants Have Flooded Mexico with \nTheir Guns. \n434.  Defendants collectively account for nearly \nhalf of all crime guns recovered in Mexico.  From \n\n159a \n \n \nJanuary through May 2020, Defendants accounted \nfor the following percentages of all recovered guns:  \nSmith & Wesson 9.9%; Barrett 2.3%; Beretta 5.8%; \nCentury Arms 6.2%; Colt 10.8%; Glock 6.7%; and \nRuger 6.2%. \n435.  While Defendants collectively account for \n47.9% of all crime guns recovered in Mexico, they \naccount for about 68.4% of the recovered crime guns \nthat originated in the U.S. (A relatively small \nnumber of crime guns come from outside the U.S.). \n436.  The number of Defendants\u2019 guns annually \nrecovered at crime scenes in Mexico vastly \nunderstates the number that are trafficked into \nMexico; authorities recover only a small fraction of \ntrafficked guns. \n437.  Researchers have estimated that nearly 2.2% \nof all guns manufactured in the U.S. are trafficked \ninto Mexico.  At the current gun-production rate in \nthe U.S.\u201439,695,315 in 2020\u2014this would equate to \na staggering 873,000 guns currently trafficked \nannually into Mexico from the U.S.  A more \nconservative estimate of a half million guns \ntrafficked from the U.S. into Mexico every year is \nstill massive. \n438.  A fair estimate of the number of Defendants\u2019 \nguns annually trafficked into Mexico is given by \napplying their percentage of U.S.-origin recovered \nguns (about 68.4% collectively) to the conservative \nand higher figures for total U.S.-origin trafficked \nguns (500,000 and 873,000 respectively).  Thus, \nbetween 342,000 and 597,000 of Defendants\u2019 guns \nare likely trafficked into Mexico every year. \n\n160a \n \n \n439.  Mexico and the United Kingdom have \nsimilar regulations on legal gun ownership.  Both \ncountries keep a centralized record of gun owners, \nrequire character references for gun purchasers, and \nmandate some interaction with police in the license-\napplication \nprocess. \n \nDespite \nthese \nsimilar \nregulations, however, the nations have vastly \ndifferent numbers of illegal guns.  According to one \nanalysis, in 2017 the UK had about one million \nunregistered guns; Mexico had more than 13.5 \nmillion. \n440.  The connection between Defendants\u2019 \nunlawfully trafficked guns and the predictable but \nhorrendous consequences in Mexico is undeniable.  \nDefendants \nand \nother \nU.S.-based \ngun \nmanufacturers took advantage of the expiration of \nthe \nU.S. \nassault-weapons \nban \nin \n2004 \nto \nsignificantly \nincrease \ntheir \noutput \nof \nguns, \nparticularly \nof \nassault \nweapons.  \nContemporaneously, illegal gun ownership per \ncapita in Mexico increased tenfold and the homicide \nrate increased accordingly.  From 2004 to 2008 the \nhomicide rate in Mexico increased by 45%. \n441.  The chart below shows these two intertwined \ntrends\u2014Defendants\u2019 increased gun production and \nthe concomitant increased gun-homicide rate in \nMexico\u2014as assault weapons like Defendants\u2019 \nWASR-10 and AR-15s became more prevalent. \n\n161a \n \n \n\n162a \n \n \n442.  No nation other than Mexico experienced a \nsimilar homicide surge during this period. \n443.  The connection between gun trafficking from \nthe U.S. and gun homicides in Mexico is further \nevidenced by the correlation between the increase in \ngun production in the U.S. and the percentage of \nhomicides in Mexico committed with a gun.  The \npercentage of homicides in Mexico committed with a \ngun rose from 25% in 2004 to more than 69% in 2018.  \nThe increased percentage of homicides by gun was \ncontemporaneous with the increased gun production \nin the U.S. beginning in 2005 with the expiration of \nthe U.S. assault-weapons ban, as this chart shows: \n \n \n\n163a \n \n \n\n164a \n \n \n444.  The increased homicides in Mexico were \ndriven in large part by the increased production in \nthe U.S. specifically of assault weapons\u2014and the \ntrafficking of them into Mexico.  This chart shows \nthe relationship between the number of rifles \nmanufactured in the U.S. and the number of \nhomicides in Mexico: \n \n\n165a \n \n \n\n166a \n \n \n \n445.  The empirical connection between Defendants\u2019 \ntrafficked guns and the devastating effects in \nMexico is confirmed by many qualitative measures.  \nFor example, in the mid-2000s Mexico experienced: \na.   an increase in gun-related crimes such as \nextortion and kidnapping; \nb. the assassination of the first Mexican \nmayor killed\u2014gunned down in northern \nMexico\u2014by a drug cartel; \nc.   the advent of cartels using high-caliber \nweapons; \nd.   the first killing of a member of the Mexican \narmy by cartels, with the number of such \nattacks quickly accelerating (for example, \nnorthern Tamaulipas (bordering Texas), \nreporting one attack in 2007 but a total of \n42 by 2011); \ne.   a dramatic increase in mass shootings and \ncriminal attacks on public figures, with 90 \nattacks in 2011. \nB.  Defendants\u2019 \nUnlawful \nConduct \nHas \nCaused Massive Injury. \n446.  The nature and magnitude of Defendants\u2019 \nunlawful conduct has inevitably inflicted massive \ninjury on the Government.  It was foreseeable to \nDefendants \nthat \nchoosing \nto \nrecklessly \nand \nunlawfully distribute and market their guns, \nwithout monitoring or discipline, would harm the \nGovernment by facilitating the trafficking of guns \ninto Mexico. \n\n167a \n \n \n447.  The Government has had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight the effects of \nDefendants\u2019 unlawful conduct.  The epidemic of \nviolence that Defendants have created has strained \nthe Government\u2019s resources, including by causing \nthe Government to incur substantial and unusual \ncosts for providing, for example, extraordinary \nhealth care, law enforcement and military and \nservices, criminal justice administration, public \nassistance, and other social services and public \nprograms. \n448.  The Government\u2019s injuries include, but are \nnot limited to: \na.   Losses caused by the decrease in funding \navailable for other public services because \nthe funds were diverted to services \ndesigned \nto \naddress \nthe \neffects \nof \nDefendants\u2019 conduct; \nb.  Costs of providing healthcare and medical \ncare; \nc.   Costs \nof \nadditional \nand \nspecialized \ntraining for military and police; \nd.   Costs associated with the deaths of and \nsubstantial injuries to police and military \npersonnel; \ne.   Costs \nof \nmental-health \nservices, \ntreatment, \ncounseling, \nrehabilitation \nservices, and social services to victims and \ntheir families; \nf.  Costs of law enforcement and public safety \nrelating to the gun-violence epidemic, \nincluding but not limited to attempts to \n\n168a \n \n \nstop the flow of trafficked guns, to arrest \nand prosecute the criminals who use those \nguns, to prevent the epidemic from \nspreading and worsening, and to deal with \nthe escalating levels of crimes caused by \nthe increased availability of trafficked \nguns; \ng. Costs of the increased burden on the \nGovernment\u2019s judicial system, including \nincreased security, increased staff, and the \nincreased cost of adjudicating criminal \nmatters due to the escalating levels of \ncrime caused by Defendants\u2019 conduct; \nh. Costs of providing care for children whose \nparents were victims of Defendants\u2019 \nconduct; \ni. Losses from the decreased efficiency and \nsize of the working population in Mexico; \nj.  Losses from the diminished property \nvalues in the communities affected by \nDefendants\u2019 conduct; \nk.  Losses \nfrom \ndecreased \nbusiness \ninvestment and economic activity; \nl.  Losses incurred by the Government acting \nin its commercial capacity, including from \narmed attacks on employees of state-\nowned enterprises and compensation paid \nto such victims. \n449.  The Government has been forced to expend \nmassive amounts of resources to address the \nforeseeable and widespread epidemic of gun violence \n\n169a \n \n \nflowing from Defendants\u2019 unlawful misconduct.  \nExamples of these losses follow. \n1.  Death and destruction \n450.  Mexico is experiencing growing levels of gun \nviolence and suffering from civilian gun deaths at \none of the highest rates in the world.  Before the \ndramatic increase in gun production in the U.S \n(including by Defendants) beginning in late 2004, \nthe annual number of homicides in Mexico had been \non the decline, including fewer than 2,500 \ncommitted with a gun in 2003. \n451.  But the sharp increase in gun sales in the \nU.S. resulted in a 10-fold increase in gun-related \nhomicides in Mexico, rising to about 23,000 in 2019.  \nIn 1997 only 15% of homicides were committed with \na gun; by 2021 that figure had increased to 69%. \n452.  Despite the Government\u2019s rigorous gun \ncontrol laws and policies, and despite having only \none gun store in the entire nation, the years from \n2007 to 2019 saw more than 180,000 homicides \ncommitted with guns in Mexico. \n453.  Mexico has the third most gun-related \ndeaths in the world.  Murders are the leading cause \nof death in Mexico among teenagers and young \nadults between 15 and 19 years of age. \n454.  The Council on Foreign Relations estimates \nthat as many as half of homicides in Mexico are \nattributable to the drug cartels and other organized \ngangs.  Two-thirds of crime guns recovered in Mexico \nbelonged to two of the most pitiless cartels, the Gulf \nCartel and Los Zetas.  Leading up to Mexico\u2019s 2018 \npresidential elections the drug cartels killed at least \n130 candidates and politicians. \n\n170a \n \n \n455.  The overwhelming majority of these deaths \nwere caused by guns trafficked from the U.S.\u2014\nincluding many weapons designed, marketed, \ndistributed, and sold by Defendants.  A gun \nmanufactured in the U.S. is more likely to be used to \nmurder a Mexican citizen (17,000 in 2019) than an \nAmerican citizen (14,000 in 2019).  And Mexico has \nonly 40% of the population of the U.S. and only one \ngun store. \n456.  The magnitude of these deaths is so \nextensive that, beginning in 2005, it significantly \naffected the life expectancy of all Mexicans.  While \nlife expectancy increased by approximately .5 years \nthroughout Mexico from 2000 to 2005, it decreased \nby about the same amount from 2005 to 2010, as \nreflected in this chart: \n \n\n171a \n \n \n \n \n\n172a \n \n \n457.  Since 2010, in this age of technical and \nmedical progress, life expectancy in Mexico has \ncontinued to decrease. \n458.  The federal police and military in Mexico \nhave been among the victims in the horror story that \nDefendants have written.  From 2006 to 2021, guns \nwere used to kill at least 415 members of the \nMexican Federal Police or National Guard, and to \nwound at least 840 more.  The vast majority of these \nguns were trafficked from the U.S. \n459.  From March 2009 to March 2021, U.S.-origin \nguns were used to kill 25 members of the Mexican \nmilitary and to wound another 84. \n460.  Some of the incidents involving the military \nin the last four years are all-too representative.  May \n20, 2017:  a Smith & Wesson AR-15 was used to kill \none soldier.  December 10, 2017:  four Barrett rifles \nwere used to kill one soldier and wound three others. \n461.  August 15, 2018:  eight Barrett .50 caliber \nsniper rifles were used to wound one soldier.  August \n24, 2018:  a Colt AR-15 was used to kill one soldier.  \nOctober 28, 2018:  a Beretta pistol was used to \nwound one soldier. \n462.  January 9, 2019:  three Century Arms rifles \nwere used to kill a soldier.  February 21, 2019:  two \nColt pistols were used to kill one soldier and wound \nanother.  March 5, 2019:  a Barrett .50 caliber sniper \nrifle was used to wound one soldier.  March 9, 2019:  \na Barrett .50 caliber sniper rifle was used to wound \none soldier.  April 2, 2019:  a Barrett .50 caliber \nsniper rifle was used to wound two soldiers.  \nNovember 14, 2019:  three Barrett .50 caliber sniper \n\n173a \n \n \nrifles were used to kill two soldiers and wound two \nothers. \n463.  July 19, 2020:  a Barrett .50 caliber sniper \nrifle was used to wound one soldier.  September 14, \n2020:  a Colt AR-15 was used to wound a soldier. \n464.  Defendants\u2019 conduct has visited destruction \non property as well as lives.  For example, from 2013 \nto 2020 U.S.-origin guns were used to cause more \nthan $41 million in damage to fifteen Mexican \nmilitary aircraft.  In just two years from 2019 to \n2021 the Mexican Federal Police and National \nGuard incurred damage to an aircraft and 30 \nvehicles in armed assaults with guns.  In the last \ndecade they incurred additional millions of dollars in \ndamage to security equipment. \n2. Economic harm \n465.  Defendants\u2019 conduct has also inflicted \nenormous economic harm on the Government.  In \n2019 more than 3.9 million crimes in Mexico were \ncommitted with a U.S.-origin gun.  About 161,000 of \nthose crimes were committed against businesses. \n466.  The Institute for Economics & Peace\u2019s Mexico \nPeace Index 2020 estimates that the economic \nimpact of violence in Mexico in 2019 was 4.7 trillion \npesos, or $238 billion.  This is equivalent to 21.3% of \nMexico\u2019s gross domestic product (GDP); on a per \ncapita basis, it is approximately five times the \naverage monthly salary in Mexico. \n467.  These costs include:  direct costs incurred by \nthe victim, the government, and the perpetrator; \nindirect costs, including physical and psychological \ntrauma, lost future income, and the impact of fear; \nand a multiplier effect that calculates the additional \n\n174a \n \n \neconomic activity that would have accrued if the \ndirect costs of violence had been avoided. \n468.  Homicides comprised 48% of this impact \n($114 billion), the vast majority of which (69.3%) \nwere due to gun violence; violent assaults with a \nfirearm imposed significant additional costs.  The \nreport documents that \u201c[t]he rise in gun violence \nhas . . . been driven by the illegal import and sale of \nfirearms from the United States.\u201d \n469.  Another study estimates the Government\u2019s \ncosts of trying to prevent the escalating gun violence \nto be more than 1.5% of GDP. \n470.  In addition, although immigration from \nMexico to the U.S. has declined substantially over \nthe last decade, the drug violence perpetrated with \ntrafficked weapons nevertheless causes Mexicans to \nleave their homes to seek out security in the U.S. \n471.  From 2006 to 2010 an estimated 264,000 \nMexican citizens fled their homes as a result of drug-\ncartel violence.  Migration outflow was higher in \nborder cities where homicide rates were highest and \ndrug-related violence most prevalent.  Juarez, for \nexample, lost about 11% of its population while \nReynosa lost 9%, Tijuana 6%, and Matamoros 4%.  \nAccording to one study, each one-point increase in \nthe rate of drug-related homicides per 100,000 \ninhabitants is correlated with 6.34 Mexicans fleeing \ntheir county of residence. \n472.  Another study found a similar correlation \nbetween homicides rates and migration outflow.  \nLooking at the outflow of migrants from the Mexico \nto the U.S between 2007 and 2012, the study \nconcluded that, while migration decisions are \n\n175a \n \n \nsensitive to both local violence and transit violence, \n\u201cthe net effect of the drug violence in Mexico has \nbeen to increase migration to the United States.\u201d \nSandra Orozco-Aleman & Heriberto Gonzalez-\nLozano, Drug Violence and Migration Flows:  \nLessons from the Mexican Drug War, 52 J. Human \nRes. 717 (Summer 2018). \n473.  Even beyond all of these losses, Defendants\u2019 \nunlawful conduct has substantially reduced the \noverall quality of life in Mexico.  Living with the fear \nof fire from Defendants\u2019 guns, and hearing and \nexperiencing that gun violence, diminishes countless \naspects of Mexican life\u2014psychological, educational, \nsocial, and cultural, as well as economic.  To take \nonly one example, in 2020 more than 40% of people \nin Mexico under the age of 18 heard or saw frequent \ngunfire. \n474.  Defendants have undermined the social \npolicy, in addition to the aspirations, of the \nGovernment of Mexico and its people.  The \nGovernment bears many direct and indirect costs \nfrom these harms, including those identified above.  \nGiven their share of guns trafficked into Mexico, the \nDefendants are responsible for close to half of these \nlosses. \n3.  Not statistics \n475.  Defendants\u2019 deliberate conduct that floods \nMexico with their guns causes untold harm to the \nGovernment.  Some of those damages are outlined \nabove.  Were it not for Defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct, \nthere would be far fewer guns in Mexico, and far \nfewer guns in the hands of the cartels.  There might \nstill \nbe \nsnakes\u2014in \nthe \nform \nof \ncriminal \n\n176a \n \n \norganizations\u2014but they would have far less venom \nto inflict harm. \n476.  Life in Mexico would be a far different place \nif that were so\u2014a safer place, a place in which fewer \ntax dollars would be spent on preventing and \nresponding to violence and drug trafficking, and \nmore could be spent on education, social services, \nand other efforts to positively improve lives. \n477.  Everyday existence for the Mexican people \nwould be far different if life could be led without \ndangers and threats from the armed cartels\u2014less \nfear, more freedom to gather together and enjoy life. \n478.  And without the Defendants\u2019 supply of crime \nguns, the less-armed cartels could be controlled and \nstopped far more easily and effectively.  That would \nhelp stem the drug trade that kills not only Mexicans \nbut people in other nations, including the United \nStates.  And it would reduce the violence that the \ncartels spread north of the border. \n479.  Defendants\u2019 wrongful conduct also ends \nlives, extraordinary and wonderful lives of Mexicans \nfrom every walk of life, as illustrated by a small \nsampling of the tens of thousands of lives lost as a \nresult of Defendants\u2019 deliberate conduct. \n480.  Cristina Roman\u2019s husband owned a small \nused-car dealership in Ciudad Juarez.  He and his \nwife had three young sons.  In May 2010, he was \nassaulted in his home and kidnapped by individuals, \nassumed to be in either Los Zetas or the Sinaloa \nCartel, while Cristina and her sons hid.  Despite \nCristina and her husband\u2019s brother paying a \nransom, her husband was killed and his body thrown \ninto the street. \n\n177a \n \n \n481.  Manuel, Cristina\u2019s father, also lived in \nCiudad Juarez.  After gunmen showed up at his door \nto ask for Cristina\u2019s whereabouts in 2011, Manuel \nwas kidnapped, never seen again, and is presumed \ndead. \n482.  Gerardo Heath was a 15-year-old football \nplayer living in Allende, Mexico, a small ranching \ntown near the border with Texas.  On Friday, March \n18, 2011, he was hanging out with friends near his \nhome while his mother, Claudia Sanchez, packed for \nhis football game in San Antonio the next morning.  \nGerardo asked his mother if he could go out with his \nfriends; after initially refusing, she told him yes, but \nnot to be back late.  He put on the new clothes his \nfamily had recently given him for his birthday. \n483.  But Gerardo never came back, having been \nswept up in a spree of killings in Allende that were \ncarried out by Los Zetas during several weeks in \nMarch 2011. \n484.  No\u00e9 Isauro Beltr\u00e1n was a 39-year-old man \nliving in Culiac\u00e1n, Mexico.  He had three daughters \nwith his wife Roc\u00edo and worked at an auto repair \nshop.  In October 2019, during an attack in Culiac\u00e1n \nconducted by the Sinaloa Cartel to free the son of \u201cEl \nChapo,\u201d Beltr\u00e1n was killed as he tried to close the \nrepair shop\u2019s shutters to protect himself and others. \n485.  During the same incident, Jos\u00e9 Arturo and \nJos\u00e9 Nicol\u00e1s, two young workers at a furniture store, \nwere returning from a furniture delivery when they \nwere caught in the gunfire.  Both died at the scene.  \nEduardo, a 32-year-old policeman, died after 100 \nbullets hit his car. \n\n178a \n \n \n486.  Christina Marie Langford Johnson, Dawna \nLangford, and Rhonita Miller were Americans living \nin Mexico in 2019.  They were all members of the \nMormon church and had moved to Mexico many \nyears before.  They each had children and lived in \nthe state of Sonora. \n487.  On the morning of November 4, 2019, the \nwomen were driving in separate vehicles with their \nchildren to meet relatives in the neighboring state \nand Phoenix, Arizona.  Gunfire ripped into each of \nthe vehicles, killing Johnson, Langford, and Miller, \nalong with six of their children.  Authorities suspect \nthat members of the Juarez Cartel, engaged in a \ndispute with the rival Sinaloa Cartel, were \nresponsible for the killings. \n488.  Fernando Ruiz was a 19-year-old plumber \nand bricklayer living in the Mexican border city of \nReynosa.  He was working to pay for his studies.  In \nJune 2021 he was outside fixing a drain when \nmembers of the Gulf Cartel began a city-wide \nshooting spree.  Fernando and his companions were \nshot just as they tried to take cover in somebody\u2019s \nhome. \n489.  In December 2016, in the municipality of \nJes\u00fas Carranza, there were several armed clashes \nbetween criminal groups and the Army, Navy, and \nstate police over three days, which left 20 dead. \n490.  On March 9, 2019, an armed commando of \nthe Santa Rosa de Lima Cartel attacked a bar in \nSalamanca, Guanajuato.  Neighbors described it as \na \u201cmassacre,\u201d as the attackers fired indiscriminately \nagainst customers, waiters, and workers.  According \nto witnesses, the attack took less than two minutes.  \n\n179a \n \n \nSome media linked the attack to the launch, two \nweeks earlier, of an operation of the Federal \nGovernment to combat fuel theft with the support of \nthe Navy, Federal Police, and state police.  After the \nattack, the inhabitants of Salamanca reportedly \nstarted a self-imposed curfew. \n491.  On October 14, 2019, a commando of 37 \npolice officers was serving a warrant.  Around 30 \nmembers of the New Generation Jalisco Cartel\u2014one \nof the deadliest in the country\u2014ambushed them.  An \nofficer who survived explained that the criminals \nhad automatic weapons and that their firepower was \nfar superior to that of the police.  The media \ndescribed the images as Dantesque:  two police \nvehicles set on fire, the others left with threatening \nmessages by the cartel, dead police officers lying on \nthe ground, some of them burned, shell casings \neverywhere. \n492.  In November 2019, in Villa Union, Coahuila, \nfour municipal, state, and federal law enforcement \nofficers were killed during a confrontation with the \nNoreste Cartel.  Seventeen other people were also \nkilled. \n493.  During the June 26, 2020 attempt to \nassassinate Mexico City\u2019s police chief, referred to \nabove, bystander Gabriela Gomez was killed.  Gaby, \nas she was called, was a 26-year-old mother of two \ndaughters, a wife, a sister, and daughter.  She had \nbeen traveling with her husband, sister, and sister-\nin-law in her car, on their way to their food stand at \na subway station. \n494.  At six o\u2019clock in the evening on July 1, 2020, \na commando of ten vehicles arrived at the \n\n180a \n \n \n\u201cRecuperando mi Vida\u201d rehabilitation center in \nIrapuato, Guanajuato.  After threatening the \nworkers and telling them to leave, the intruders \nforced 30 residents to the floor.  According to the \nstate Attorney General\u2019s Office, seven men with long \nguns perpetrated the massacre.  The mothers of the \nresidents were among the first to arrive.  Marina, \nRodrigo\u2019s mother, kept shouting \u201cI brought you here \nso you could get fixed, not die.\u201d She asked the police \nto let her in to find her son, not yet certain that he \nwas one of the deceased.  From December 2019 to \nJuly 2020, six armed attacks were registered against \nrehabilitation centers in Irapuato. \n495.  On the night of September 1, 2020, in \nCuernavaca, Morelos, an armed group opened fire on \nthose attending the funeral of a motorcyclist.  The \nattackers used high-caliber weapons.  The attack left \n9 dead, including several minors, as well as 13 \nwounded.  Diego Miranda, 15, one of the deceased, \nwas considered a promising young soccer player; he \nhad been invited to a tryout for the basic forces of the \npopular team Cruz Azul. \n496.  On March 1, 2021, a commando of armed \nmen killed 10 construction workers while they were \nwaiting for their wages on the sidewalk in Tonala, \nJalisco.  Subsequently, a minor was found dead, hit \nby bullets inside his home.  Additionally, a woman \nand a 14-year-old minor were seriously wounded.  \n\u201cWhy did they do this to us?\u201d asked a boy lying on \nthe floor, bleeding and waiting for the ambulance to \narrive.  The attack was carried out with long \nweapons; at the crime scene, authorities found more \nthan 70 spent cartridges. \n\n181a \n \n \n497.  On March 18, 2021, eight state police \nofficers\u2014Alejandro Lovera Hernandez, Guillermo \nTorres Mixteco, David Pedroza Guadarrama, Martin \nSolares Morales, Ernesto Mondragon Ramfrez, Juan \nDario Mesas Morales, Victor Manuel Garcia \nVazquez, and Mauricio Rodriguez Zarate\u2014were \nkilled in an attack by the Familia Michoacana.  They \nwere ambushed in the municipality of Coatepec de \nHarinas. \n498.  On April 22, 2021, in the port of Acapulco, \nGuerrero, a group of men armed with AK-47 rifles \nbroke into a public bus depot.  They shot and \nmurdered a 70-year-old security guard.  The other \nguard, Francisco Gerardo Estrada Cruz, 24 years \nold, died a day later at the hospital. \n499.  On May 10, 2021, at a local restaurant-bar \nin Jocotepec, Jalisco, in broad daylight, an armed \ngroup descended from a van and opened fire without \nsaying a word.  It took them a couple of minutes to \nkill five people, two of them minors, a 16-year-old, \nand a boy between 12 and 13 years old. \n500.  On July 2, 2021, in Omealca, Veracruz, two \nminors were killed in a shooting between police \nforces and a group of criminals, allegedly belonging \nto the New Generation Jalisco Cartel.  The young \nmen, aged 13 and 15, were washing a car in their \nfront yard during the confrontation. \n501.  On July 17, 2021, an armed group shot at \npeople gathered at a family reunion in Panuco, \nZacatecas.  The attack killed eight and wounded \nseven.  The Colegio de Bachilleres high school \npublished the obituary of its student Jesus \n\n182a \n \n \nVelazquez Miranda, 16, who was killed along with \nhis parents, Adan and Rosario. \n502.  For six days, from July 21 to 27, 2021, \nresidents of the town of Magdalena de Kino, Sonora, \nreported gunshots in different parts of the town.  \nMany of them posted videos on social networks:  in \none, gunshots are heard while people pray, lying on \nthe floor of a church; in another, with the caption \n\u201cMagdalena, no man\u2019s land,\u201d people in the street \nstart running when they hear the gunshots.  The \nsiege ended after members of the state police, the \nNational Guard, and the Secretary of National \nDefense intervened. \n503.  Several shootings and violent clashes on \nFriday July 23, 2021, left 16 dead across different \nareas in the state of Zacatecas.  An armed group shot \nat a car several times, murdering the three people \ninside, a man and two minors.  Another attack was \nreported in the same area; another car had been \nshot, killing a man and a child.  On the same day, a \nman was taken out of his home and murdered on the \nroad.  Armed violence reached the state\u2019s capital too, \nas at least four young men were shot inside a barber \nshop.  Simultaneously, two other men were being \nshot a few blocks away. \n504.  On July 26, 2021, in Salto, Jalisco, police \nofficer Maricruz P\u00e9rez Partida, 32 years old, was \nshot and killed along with her father, her uncle, and \na neighbor, as they were leaving her house and \nwalking to a car.  P\u00e9rez served as sector chief at the \nlocal police station.  She was a mother of three. \n505.  Shortly after noon, on June 18, 2021, in \nReynosa, Tamaulipas, armed individuals in several \n\n183a \n \n \nvehicles \nshot \nat \npedestrians \nin \nseveral \nneighborhoods of the city.  The authorities \nconsidered it an indiscriminate attack against \ncivilians, which killed at least 15 people, including a \nbus driver, a nursing student, a family, and a group \nof construction workers.  Fernando Ruiz was one of \nthem.  He agreed with his stepdad to work on \nconstruction to pay for his studies; he wanted to \nbecome a nurse.  Olga Ruiz described how after \nhearing gunshots, her stepdad told her brother and \nhis co-workers to take refuge inside a house, but the \nbullets hit them before they could hide.  After news \nof the attack spread, Pope Francis sent prayers and \nhis condolences to the families of the deceased. \nX.  CLAIMS FOR RELIEF \n \n\u201cWhy are deadly weapons being sold to those \nwho plan to inflict untold suffering on individuals \nand society? Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is \nsimply for money:  money that is drenched in \nblood, often innocent blood.  In the face of this \nshameful and culpable silence, it is our duty to \nconfront the problem and to stop the arms trade.\u201d \n\u2014 Pope Francis \nCOUNT ONE \n(NEGLIGENCE) \n506.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n507.  Defendants had a duty to exercise ordinary \nand reasonable care in designing, manufacturing, \nmarketing, advertising, promoting, distributing, \n\n184a \n \n \nsupplying, and selling their guns in order to reduce \nthe risk that their guns would be trafficked into \nMexico. \n508.  Defendants knew or chose to be willfully \nblind to the fact that their design, marketing, and \ndistribution of guns posed a serious risk of harm to \npeople in Mexico and to the Government, but they \nnevertheless continued to sell their guns without \nexercising reasonable care. \n509.  Defendants\u2019 negligence caused the actual \ninjuries alleged above.  That negligence is the \nproximate cause of the epidemic of gun-trafficking \ninto, and gun violence within, Mexico. \n510.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 \nnegligence, \nthe \nGovernment \nhas \nsuffered actual injury and damages including, but \nnot limited to, significant expenses for police, \nemergency, health, prosecution, corrections, and \nother services, as well as other extensive economic \nlosses. \nCOUNT TWO \n(PUBLIC NUISANCE) \n511.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n512.  In 2003, Judge Weinstein in NAACP v. \nAcuSport, Inc. concluded that there is \u201creliable \nevidence of an industry-wide connection between the \nlegal market and the illicit market that constitutes \na public nuisance nationally and in New York State \nand City.  Diversion from the legal to the illegal \nmarkets through imprudent marketing cause[s] a \n\n185a \n \n \nlarge part of this diversion.\u201d 271 F. Supp. 2d at 521.  \nThe same is true here.  Defendants cause a public \nnuisance under applicable law. \n513.  Defendants\u2019 conduct arms criminals, \nconstituting a dangerous threat to the public. \n514.  Defendants design, market, distribute, \npromote, and sell guns with reckless disregard for \nhuman life and for the peace, tranquility, and \neconomic well-being of the Mexican public.  They \nhave knowingly refused to monitor and discipline \ntheir distribution systems, making their guns easily \navailable to anyone intent on crime.  Defendants \nknew or chose to be willfully blind to the fact that \nthey facilitate and encourage easy access by persons \nintent on murder, mayhem, or other crimes, \nincluding illegal purchasers who foreseeably traffic \nthe guns into Mexico.  Defendants\u2019 conduct has \nthereby created and contributed to a public nuisance \nby unreasonably interfering with public safety and \nhealth and undermining Mexico\u2019s gun laws, \nresulting in the specific and particularized injuries \nsuffered by the Government. \n515.  The Government and its residents have a \ncommon right to be free from conduct that creates \nunreasonable risk to the public health, welfare, and \nsafety, and to be free from conduct that creates a \ndisturbance and reasonable apprehension of danger \nto person and property. \n516.  Defendants intentionally and recklessly \ndesign, market, distribute, and sell guns that \nDefendants know, or reasonably should know, will \nbe obtained by persons for criminal purposes, \ncausing tens of thousands of their guns to be \n\n186a \n \n \npossessed and used in Mexico illegally.  Defendants \ncause an elevated level of crime, death, and injuries \nto Mexican residents, and a higher level of fear, \ndiscomfort, and inconvenience to the residents of \nMexico. \n517.  As a result of the continued use and \npossession of many of these guns, residents of \nMexico will continue to be killed and injured by these \nguns, and the public will continue to fear for their \nhealth, safety, and welfare, and will be subjected to \nconduct that creates a disturbance and reasonable \napprehension of danger to person and property. \n518.  Defendants\u2019 conduct constitutes a public \nnuisance and, if unabated, will continue to threaten \nthe health, safety, and welfare of the residents of \nMexico, creating an atmosphere of fear that tears at \nthe residents\u2019 sense of well-being and security.  The \nGovernment has a clearly ascertainable right to \nabate conduct that perpetuates this nuisance. \n519.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct, the Government has suffered \nactual injury and damages including, but not limited \nto, significant expenses for police, emergency, \nhealth, prosecution, corrections, and other services, \nas well as other extensive economic losses. \nCOUNT THREE \n(DEFECTIVE CONDITION\u2014\nUNREASONABLY DANGEROUS) \n520.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n\n187a \n \n \n521.  The guns manufactured and supplied by \nManufacturer Defendants were defective in design \nor formulation in that, at the time they left the \nManufacturer Defendants\u2019 control: \na. they were unreasonably dangerous to the \npurchasers and to others against whom \nthey were likely to be used; \nb. the foreseeable risks to the purchasers \nexceeded the benefits associated with their \ndesign or formulation; \nc.  they were more dangerous than an \nordinary consumer would expect when \nused in their intended or reasonably \nforeseeable manner; \nd. a reasonably prudent manufacturer or \ndistributor, being fully aware of the risks \nposed, would not have placed the product \non the market; \ne.  they did not conform to the representations \nof Manufacturer Defendants that the \nguns, when distributed by Defendants, \nwere safe for use by purchasers; \nf.  they failed to employ alternative designs, \nwhich were readily available and feasible, \nthat would prevent the weapons from \nbeing fired by unauthorized users; \ng.  they were designed to be readily converted \ninto \nmachineguns \noperable \nin \nfully \nautomatic mode; \nh. they were designed to try to evade U.S. \nrestrictions \non \nmilitary-style \nassault \nweapons; and \n\n188a \n \n \ni. \nthey \nwere \ndesigned \nto \nenable \nthe \nobliteration \nor \ndefacement \nof \nserial \nnumbers. \n522.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of the \ndefective condition of the guns manufactured and \nsupplied \nby \nManufacturer \nDefendants, \nthe \nGovernment has suffered actual injury and damages \nincluding, but not limited to, significant expenses for \npolice, emergency, health, prosecution, corrections, \nand other services, as well as other extensive \neconomic losses. \nCOUNT FOUR \n(NEGLIGENCE PER SE) \n523.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n524.  Defendants violated statutory duties, the \nGovernment is within the class intended to be \nprotected by the statutes, the statutory violations \nare a proximate cause of the Government\u2019s injury, \nand the Government\u2019s injuries are of the type \nagainst which the statutes are designed to protect. \n525.  Defendants breached the duties they owe to \nthe Government by, among other things, failing to \nmonitor and discipline their distribution systems so \nas to prevent or reduce the trafficking of their guns \ninto Mexico.  In so doing, all Defendants acted with \nactual malice. \n526.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct, the Government has suffered \nactual injury and damages including, but not limited \nto, significant expenses for police, emergency, \n\n189a \n \n \nhealth, prosecution, corrections, and other services, \nas well as other extensive economic losses. \nCOUNT FIVE \n(GROSS NEGLIGENCE) \n527.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n528.  Defendants were negligent as described in \ndetail above. \n529.  Defendants\u2019 active facilitation of the \ntrafficking of guns into Mexico, and their other \nreckless and unlawful conduct described in detail \nabove, led to the epidemic of gun violence in Mexico \nand has strengthened the cartels.  Defendants\u2019 \nreckless and unlawful conduct has caused tens of \nthousands of deaths and cost many billions of dollars \nin \nharm\u2014circumstances \nthat \nconstituted \nan \nimminent or clear and present danger amounting to \nmore than normal and usual peril. \n530.  Defendants in fact knew of the imminent \ndanger that their conduct posed to the Government. \n531.  Defendants were aware of the devastating \nand dangerous consequences of failing to monitor \nand discipline their distribution systems, of \nfacilitating the unlawful trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and of engaging in the other unlawful \nconduct described in detail above.  Defendants \nnevertheless continued, and continue today, to \nengage in all of that conduct, demonstrating their \nconscious disregard of the consequences of their \nactions.  Defendants\u2019 conduct was so reckless and \nwanting in care that it constituted a conscious \n\n190a \n \n \ndisregard of and indifference to the life, safety, and \nrights of persons in Mexico and of the Government. \n532.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 gross negligence, the Government has \nsuffered actual injury and damages including, but \nnot limited to, significant expenses for police, \nemergency, health, prosecution, corrections, and \nother services, as well as other extensive economic \nlosses. \nCOUNT SIX \n(UNJUST ENRICHMENT AND \nRESTITUTION) \n533.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n534.  Manufacturer Defendants have reaped \nenormous profits and gains from the sale of their \nguns that have foreseeably been trafficked into \nMexico. \n535.  Those sales have resulted in enormous \nincreases \nin \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s \nexpenditures, \nincluding but not limited to the following areas:  \nmedical care, police investigations, emergency \npersonnel, public health resources, human services, \ncourts, prisons, and related expenses. \n536.  The Government has also been negatively \naffected by Defendants\u2019 sales due to the decrease in \nproperty \nvalues \nthroughout \nMexico, \nloss \nof \nbusinesses, difficulty in developing the economy and \nsociety \nof \nMexico, \nand \nloss \nof \nsubstantial \nproductivity. \n\n191a \n \n \n537.  Defendants undertook the wrongful conduct \nfor the purpose of increasing the sales and profits, \nwhile at the same time avoiding responsibility for \nthe massive costs caused by those sales, shifting \nthose costs to the Government and its citizens. \n538.  Defendants have, without justification, \nunjustly refused and failed to pay for the \nconsequences of their unreasonable conduct and, as \na result, the Government has been required to pay \nfor the associated costs resulting from Defendants\u2019 \nreckless and unlawful conduct. \n539.  The \nGovernment\u2019s \nexpenditure \nof \nsubstantial sums to pay for the associated costs \nresulting from the use of guns that Defendants sold \nfor enormous profit by Defendants has unjustly \nbenefited \nand \nenriched \nDefendants \nat \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s expense, to its detriment. \n540.  By virtue of the foregoing, the Government \nhas incurred expenses that, in law, equity and \nfairness, ought to have been borne by Defendants.  \nDefendants have unjustly enriched themselves at \nthe Government\u2019s expense. \n541.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct, the Government has suffered \nactual injury and damages including, but not limited \nto, significant expenses for police, emergency, \nhealth, prosecution, corrections, and other services, \nas well as other extensive economic losses. \nCOUNT SEVEN \n(VIOLATION OF CUTPA) \n542.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \n\n192a \n \n \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n543.  Defendant Colt violated the Connecticut \nUnfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7\u00a7 42-\n110a et seq. (\u201cCUTPA\u201d), by marketing that \nemphasized the ability of civilians to use Colt \nassault rifles in unlawful, military-style attacks. \n544. \nColt \nknowingly \nviolated \nCUTPA \nby \nmarketing products like its semi-automatic assault \nrifles to the civilian market in ways that highlighted \ntheir efficacy for civilians wanting to carry out \nunlawful military-style combat missions and that \nencouraged and promoted that misuse.  For \nexample, as noted above Colt specifically labels its \nproducts with militaristic terms like \u201cTrooper\u201d and \n\u201cPatrol\u201d to increase the viewer\u2019s association of Colt\u2019s \nproducts with military-style combat. \n545.  Colt knew that its marketing and advertising \nwould attract persons and organizations that \nintended to use Colt\u2019s products to battle against the \nmilitary and police, including the military and police \nin Mexico. \n546.  Colt further knew that its products would be \ntrafficked into Mexico for use by the drug cartels \nthere.  Colt knew that its products, and its \nmarketing \nof \nthose \nproducts, \ncreated \nan \nunreasonable risk of physical injury to persons in \nMexico. \n547.  Colt\u2019s conduct in producing and marketing \nits military-style assault weapons is a knowing \nviolation of CUTPA, and those violations were a \nsubstantial factor in causing the injuries that the \nGovernment has sustained. \n\n193a \n \n \n548.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct, the Government has suffered \nactual injury and damages including, but not limited \nto, significant expenses for police, emergency, \nhealth, prosecution, corrections, and other services, \nas well as other extensive economic losses. \nCOUNT EIGHT \n(VIOLATION OF MASS. G. L. c. 93A) \n549. The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n550.  Defendant Smith & Wesson violated the \nMassachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass. \nGen. Laws c. 93A (\u201cChapter 93A\u201d), by marketing \nthat emphasized the ability of civilians to use Smith \n& Wesson assault rifles in unlawful, military-style \nattacks. \n551.  Smith & Wesson knowingly violated Chapter \n93A by marketing products like its semi-automatic \nassault rifles to the civilian market in ways that \nhighlighted their efficacy for civilians wanting to \ncarry out unlawful military-style combat missions \nand that encouraged and promoted that misuse.  For \nexample, as noted above Smith & Wesson uses the \n\u201cM&P\u201d or \u201cMilitary and Police\u201d designation, \nemphasizing that its products are capable of being \ndeployed in combat-like scenarios.  And its \nmarketing highlights the ability of its products to \nrapidly dispatch large numbers of opponents in \narmed combat, appealing especially to criminals like \nthe cartels. \n\n194a \n \n \n552.  Smith & Wesson knew that its marketing \nand \nadvertising \nwould \nattract \npersons \nand \norganizations that intended to use Smith & \nWesson\u2019s products to battle against the military and \npolice, including the military and police in Mexico. \n553.  Smith & Wesson further knew that its \nproducts would be trafficked into Mexico for use by \nthe drug cartels there.  Smith & Wesson knew that \nits products, and its marketing of those products, \ncreated an unreasonable risk of physical injury to \npersons in Mexico. \n554.  Smith & Wesson\u2019s conduct in producing and \nmarketing its military-style assault weapons is a \nknowing violation of Chapter 93A, and those \nviolations were a substantial factor in causing the \ninjuries that the Government has sustained. \n555.  The Government engages in trade or \ncommerce and therefore may recover its losses under \nSection 11 of Chapter 93A. \n556.  As a foreseeable and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct, the Government has suffered a \nloss of money or property, including, but not limited \nto, significant expenses for police, emergency, \nhealth, prosecution, corrections, and other services, \nas well as other extensive economic losses. \nCOUNT NINE \n(PUNITIVE DAMAGES) \n557.  The Government hereby repeats and \nincorporates by reference each preceding and \nsucceeding paragraph as though fully set forth \nherein. \n\n195a \n \n \n558.   All of Defendants\u2019 acts and omissions \nstated above were willful and malicious, evidenced a \nconscious disregard for the rights and safety of other \npersons, and had a great probability of causing \nsubstantial harm. \n559.  As a direct and proximate result of \nDefendants\u2019 conduct, the Government has suffered \nactual injury and damages including, but not limited \nto, significant expenses for police, emergency, \nhealth, prosecution, corrections, and other services, \nas well as other extensive economic losses. \n560. \nDefendants\u2019 \nunconscionable \nconduct \nwarrants an assessment of exemplary and punitive \ndamages in an amount appropriate to punish \nDefendants and set an example that will deter \nsimilar conduct in the future. \nXI. DEMAND FOR JUDGMENT \nWHEREFORE, the Government respectfully \ndemands that this Court: \na.  Enter joint and several judgments against \nthe Defendants and in favor of the \nGovernment; \nb. Enter injunctive and equitable relief \nagainst the Defendants requiring them \nto: \n1.  Abate and remedy the public nuisance \nthey have created in Mexico; \n2.

The plaintiff is the \ngovernment of Mexico.  The principal issue is whether \nthe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \n(\u201cPLCAA\u201d), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903 et seq.\u2014a statute \npassed with the express purpose of protecting the \nfirearm industry from civil liability for the criminal \nmisuse of its products\u2014requires dismissal of the \ncomplaint. \n\n209a \n \nMexico\u2019s domestic gun laws are strict.  There is only \none gun store in the entire nation, and it issues fewer \nthan 50 permits per year.  Nonetheless, Mexico is \nsuffering from an epidemic of gun-related violence.  In \n2003, it had fewer than 2,500 gun-related homicides \nper year.  By 2019, that number had risen to 23,000.  \nIn 2019 alone, there were more than 3.9 million crimes \ncommitted in Mexico with U.S.-manufactured guns. \nThe direct causes of that increase are, of course, the \ndecisions of individual actors in Mexico to commit \nviolent crimes.  The indirect causes are no doubt many, \nbut surely a substantial portion of the blame rests \nwith American citizens.  The rise of Mexican criminal \norganizations has been fueled by the unrelenting \ndemand of Americans for illegal drugs, and those same \norganizations now play an ever-increasing role in the \nsmuggling of illegal migrants across the border.  The \ncomplaint here focuses on an additional indirect cause \nof that violence:  the marketing and sales practices of \nAmerican gun manufacturers and distributors. \nAccording to the complaint, the increase in gun-\nrelated violence in Mexico is directly linked to the \nexpiration of the U.S. ban on assault rifles in 2004.  It \nalleges that when that ban expired, the production and \nmanufacturing of firearms in the United States \nincreased \ndramatically. \n \nIn \nparticular, \ngun \nmanufacturers increased the production of military-\nstyle assault weapons, which are the type favored by \ncriminal organizations.  The complaint alleges that \nthe manufacturers are aware of this and are \n\u201cdeliberate and willing participants, reaping profits \nfrom the criminal market they knowingly supply.\u201d  \n(Compl. \u00b6 16). \n\n210a \n \nThe complaint alleges that 70 to 90 percent of guns \nrecovered at crime scenes in Mexico were trafficked \nfrom the United States, with defendants producing \nmore than 68 percent of those guns.  It further alleges \nthat defendants are \u201cfully on notice of the massive \ntrafficking of their guns into Mexico\u201d because it has \nbeen extensively documented in government reports \nand throughout the media.  (Id. \u00b6 6).  According to the \ncomplaint, \ndefendants \nhave \nbeen \nnonetheless \nunwilling to implement any public-safety monitoring \nof their distribution systems to limit that illegal \ntrafficking. \nThe \ncomplaint \nasserts \nclaims \nagainst \neight \ndefendants.  Seven are gun manufacturers\u2014Smith & \nWesson, Beretta, Century Arms, Colt, Glock, Ruger, \nand Barrett.  The eighth defendant is Interstate Arms, \na gun wholesaler and distributor.  All claims arise \nunder state law, and include, among other things, \nclaims for negligence, public nuisance, defective \ndesign, \nunjust \nenrichment, \nand \nviolation \nof \nConnecticut and Massachusetts state consumer-\nprotection statutes. \nDefendants have moved to dismiss all claims \npursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) for failure to state \na claim upon which relief can be granted.  In addition, \ndefendants have moved to dismiss based on lack of \nArticle III standing pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(1).  Certain defendants have also moved to \ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction pursuant to \nFed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2). \nUnfortunately for the government of Mexico, all of \nits claims are either barred by federal law or fail for \nother reasons.  The PLCAA unequivocally bars \n\n211a \n \nlawsuits \nseeking \nto \nhold \ngun \nmanufacturers \nresponsible for the acts of individuals using guns for \ntheir intended purpose.  And while the statute \ncontains \nseveral \nnarrow \nexceptions, \nnone \nare \napplicable here. \nThis Court does not have the authority to ignore an \nact of Congress.  Nor is its proper role to devise \nstratagems to avoid statutory commands, even where \nthe allegations of the complaint may evoke a \nsympathetic response.  And while the Court has \nconsiderable sympathy for the people of Mexico, and \nnone whatsoever for those who traffic guns to Mexican \ncriminal organizations, it is duty-bound to follow the \nlaw. \nAccordingly, and for the reasons set forth below, the \nmotions to dismiss will be granted. \nI.  Background \nA.  Factual Background \n1.  Parties \nEstados Unidos Mexicanos (\u201cMexico\u201d) is a foreign \nnation.  (Compl. \u00b6 30). \nSmith & Wesson Brands, Inc.; Barrett Firearms \nManufacturing, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A. Corp.; Century \nInternational \nArms, \nInc.; \nColt\u2019s \nManufacturing \nCompany, LLC; Glock, Inc.; and Sturm, Ruger & Co., \nInc. are manufacturers and sellers of firearms.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 31-39). \nWitmer Public Safety Group, Inc., currently doing \nbusiness as \u201cInterstate Arms,\u201d is a Boston-area \nwholesaler of firearms.  (Id. \u00b6 40).  All defendant \nmanufacturers, except Barrett, use Interstate Arms to \nsell their guns for resale to gun dealers throughout the \n\n212a \n \nUnited States.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 1, 31-40).  Barrett\u2019s authorized \ndealer in Massachusetts is the Natick Outdoor Store.  \n(Id. \u00b6 32). \n2. \nDefendants\u2019 \nAlleged \nKnowledge \nof \nUnlawful Trafficking of Guns to  Mexico \nAccording to the complaint, defendants are aware of \nthe harmful effects their actions have in Mexico.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 115-226).  Specifically, the complaint alleges that \ngun dealers utilize a variety of practices that enable \nthem to traffic guns to Mexico and that defendants are \naware of those practices.  (Id. \u00b6 118). \nFor example, the complaint alleges that defendants \nknow that the gun dealers they sell to engage in \nconduct such as \u201cstraw sales, multiple sales, repeat \nsales, and other business practices that supply \ntraffickers who arm the drug cartels.\u201d  (Id.).  It also \nalleges that both the public news and government \nsources put defendants on notice of those practices and \nof the specific dealers that routinely cross guns into \nMexico utilizing those tactics.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 119-22).  That \ninformation has been allegedly \u201cspoon fed\u201d to \ndefendants because of its public nature.  (Id. \u00b6 121). \nAccording to the complaint, news sources have \npublished more than 3,000 articles since 2011 in the \nUnited States alone that explain how defendants\u2019 \nproducts contribute to violence in Mexico.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 135, \n139).  Allegedly, those sources have also provided the \nnames of particular dealers whose guns are most \ncommonly found in the hands of Mexican cartels.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 119-20).  The complaint also details congressional, \nother governmental, and NGO data that is publicly \navailable.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 137-40). \n\n213a \n \nAccording to the complaint, defendants willfully \nrefuse to utilize the resources available to them that \nwould make the distribution and sale of firearms safer.  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 121-23).  For example, it alleges that \ndefendants could use ATF trace data to obtain more \ndetailed information as to which dealers contribute to \nthe illegal Mexican gun market, but choose not to.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 123, 125).  Instead, defendants allegedly capitalize \non ATF\u2019s inability to monitor the entire industry and \nsell to dealers whose licenses should be revoked.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 126-30).  According to the complaint, defendants \nhave resisted governmental efforts to address the \npublic safety issues caused by the sale of their \nfirearms.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 141-44). \nThe complaint alleges that defendants intentionally \nallow the continued unlawful trafficking of guns into \nMexico.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 209; 377-95).  Specifically, it alleges \nthat the flow of guns into the illegal market is a \n\u201cfeature\u201d and not a \u201cbug.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 384).  According to the \ncomplaint, defendants have received at least $170 \nmillion annually from such sales.  (Id. \u00b6 389).  It \nfurther alleges that research from the University of \nSan Diego suggests that almost half of all licensed gun \ndealers would be forced to close shop if not for gun \ntrafficking into Mexico.  (Id. \u00b6 395). \n3.  Defendants\u2019 Alleged Conduct \nThe complaint alleges that defendants engage in \nmultiple practices that are contrary to their \nobligations as manufacturers or sellers of dangerous \ngoods.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 227-376). \na.  General Distribution Practices \nDefendants use three-tier distribution systems. (Id. \n\u00b6 378).  Defendants, as manufacturers, sell to \n\n214a \n \ndistributors, who sell to retailers, who then sell to \ncivilian end-users.  (Id.).  According to the complaint, \ndefendants\u2019 distribution practices enable the unlawful \ntrafficking of guns to Mexico for multiple reasons.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 227-376). \nFirst, the complaint alleges that defendants sell to \n\u201cany and all\u201d distributors with federal licenses, \nignoring potential \u201cirresponsible\u201d actors and the \npossible effects on public safety.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 228-30).  \nSecond, it alleges that defendants\u2019 distribution and \nsales practices enable straw purchases, multiple and \nrepeat sales, \u201ckitchen-table sales,\u201d and unlawful sales \nat gun shows.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 237-77). \nA straw purchaser is someone who purchases a gun \non behalf of the final intended recipients, who often \nare not lawfully permitted to purchase a gun \nthemselves.  (Id. \u00b6 69).  According to the complaint, \nstraw purchasers are involved in the movement of the \nmajority of the guns that end up illegally in Mexico.  \n(Id. \u00b6 237).  Allegedly, straw purchases often occur in \nsituations where defendants should have known they \nwere dealing with such a purchaser and where \nadditional training and diligence could have prevented \nthe gun from being passed to criminals or other \ndownstream users.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 238-39).  According to the \ncomplaint, defendants have taken no action to \nimplement such training and diligence.  (Id.). \nMultiple sales occur when someone clusters gun \npurchases to buy multiple guns at the same time from \nthe same dealer, which is further exacerbated by \nrepeat sales to those customers.  (Id. \u00b6 251).  According \nto the complaint, the multiple-sale buyer \u201ctransfers \nthe guns to [persons] who do not want to submit to a \n\n215a \n \nbackground check.\u201d  (Id.).  The guns are then diverted \nto the criminal market and then trafficked illegally \ninto Mexico.  (Id. \u00b6 252).  The complaint further alleges \nthat multiple sales often occur under circumstances \nthat \u201cindicate[] or should have indicated\u201d that the \nguns \u201cwere destined for the unlawful market.\u201d  (Id.).  \nDefendants allegedly know the likely consequences of \ntheir actions, but still choose to \u201cregularly allow their \nguns to be sold . . . as part of multiple purchases.\u201d  (Id.).  \nCongress and ATF have also acknowledged the \u201chigh-\nrisk practice\u201d of multiple sales because it is a common \nway that traffickers purchase guns to sell in the illegal \nmarket.  (Id. \u00b6 253).  Various sources within the gun \nmanufacturing \ncommunity \nhave \nalso \nallegedly \nacknowledged the role such sales play in fueling the \nillegal market.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 253-55). \nThe term \u201ckitchen-table sales\u201d refers to gun sales \nthat occur outside of stores, such as at a dealer\u2019s home \nor a parking lot.  (Id. \u00b6 258).  According to the \ncomplaint, defendants allegedly sell to dealers who \nmake such sales, and who use the Internet to manage \ncustomer orders.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 258-59).  This allows the \ndealer to act as a conduit between a manufacturer or \ndistributor and the ultimate purchasers without the \nlegal restrictions placed on sellers at brick-and-mortar \nstores.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 259-60).  Those types of sales result in \nalmost a quarter of all ATF licensed-dealer trafficking \ninvestigations, because many of those dealers \nallegedly capitalize on their relative freedom to \ncircumvent federal gun sale and reporting laws.  (Id. \n\u00b6 261).  Despite awareness in the industry about the \neffects of selling to dealers engaged in this practice, \ndefendants allegedly ignore the danger and continue \n\n216a \n \ntheir practice of selling to them without proper \nscrutiny.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 262-64). \nGun show sales occur when dealers purchase guns \nfrom other dealers and then sell them at gun shows for \ncash without adhering to legal requirements.  (Id. \n\u00b6 276).  Defendants are also allegedly aware of and \nnonetheless ignore the industry \u201cloophole\u201d that gun \nshows represent.  (Id. \u00b6 273).  This \u201cvirtually \nunregulated\u201d process leads to a considerable number \nof guns being illegally trafficked.  (Id. \u00b6 275). \nb.  Gun Design \nThe complaint highlights a variety of ways in which \ndefendants allegedly design their guns against the \ninterest of public safety.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 283-318). \n(1)  Semi-Automatic Weapons \nSemi-automatic weapons that are available for \ncivilian purchase were originally designed to mirror \nthe efficient and lightweight military weapons of the \n1950s.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 282-84).  Those guns utilize the same \ndesign as military weapons and permit rapid-fire \nemptying of magazines only slightly slower than fully \nautomated weapons.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 285, 288, 289).1  The \ncomplaint alleges that defendants know, or otherwise \nremain willfully blind to the fact, that their civilian \nsemi-automatic weapons are easily converted into \nautomatic weapons.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 290-91).  Allegedly, they \n \n \n1 According to the complaint, it takes two seconds to empty a \nlarge-capacity ammunition magazine in an automatic weapon \nand only five seconds to empty the same size magazine in a semi-\nautomatic weapon.  (Id. \u00b6 289). \n\n217a \n \nchoose designs that facilitate such illegal modification.  \n(Id. \u00b6 291). \n(2)  Military-Style Weapons \nThe complaint alleges that Barrett\u2019s .50 caliber \nsniper rifle \u201cis a weapon of war.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 292).  The gun \nwas designed and marketed as \u201carmor-penetrating\u201d \nand employs ammunition five to ten times larger than \nthat found in semi-automatic guns.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 292, 296).  \nThat ammunition, and the power the gun must \npossess to fire it, allows the rifle to hit a variety of non-\ncivilian targets, such as aircraft, which it can do from \nup to 2,000 meters away.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 296-97).2  For that \nreason, according to the complaint, the weapon is \nfavored among a variety of criminal organizations, \nincluding Mexican drug cartels.  (Id. \u00b6 298). \nThe complaint further alleges that the Century \nArms WASR-10 assault rifle is a military weapon \nbecause it is a \u201cvariant\u201d of an AK-47 assault weapon.  \n(Id. \u00b6 300).  Allegedly, a Romanian company ships \nweapons to Century Arms in the United States, where \nthe company modifies them with military-type \nfeatures.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 301-02). \n(3)  Machine Guns \nDefendants Colt, Smith & Wesson, Ruger, and \nCentury Arms allegedly sell AR-15 and AK-47 guns as \nsemi-automatic weapons that can be easily modified to \nallow for automatic firing.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 307-10).  The \ncomplaint alleges that this design feature is \n \n \n2 The complaint includes a photograph of a helicopter allegedly \nshot down in Mexico by a criminal cartel member using the \nBarrett .50 caliber sniper rifle.  (Id. \u00b6 299). \n\n218a \n \nintentional and attractive to criminal organizations.  \n(Id. \u00b6 312).  The complaint alleges that defendants \n\u201cindiscriminately supply the civilian market\u201d with \nsemi-automatic guns that they know will be used by \ncriminals in Mexico.  (Id. \u00b6 318). \n(4)  Alterable Serial Numbers \nCriminals often destroy or otherwise remove the \nserial numbers on guns to make them more difficult to \ntrack and detect.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 363-64).  Guns whose serial \nnumbers are easily altered or removed are favored by \nMexican criminal organizations because without a \nserial number, investigators often hit a dead end in \nretracing a gun\u2019s movements.  (Id. \u00b6 364).  It is \npossible to create serial numbers that are impossible \nto remove or alter or to include an additional serial \nnumber hidden elsewhere on the gun.  (Id. \u00b6 365).  \nAccording to the complaint, this was a stipulated \nportion of an agreement in 2000 between Smith & \nWesson and the government.  (Id.).3  The complaint \nalleges that because defendants benefit from the \nunlawful trafficking of guns, they do not implement \nstrategies to avoid the destruction of serial numbers.  \n(Id. \u00b6 366). \n \n \n3 According to the complaint, on March 17, 2000, the federal \ngovernment and various cities entered into a settlement \nagreement with Smith & Wesson in which the company accepted \nan obligation to sell to only \u201cauthorized distributors and \nauthorized dealers\u201d who abided by a code of conduct, including \nthe requirement that the distributors and dealers store all trace \nrequests and report them to the company.  (Compl. \u00b6 94). \n\n219a \n \n(5)  Potential Safety Improvements \nThe complaint alleges that defendants exacerbate \nexisting public-safety issues by failing to incorporate \nreasonable \nsafety \nmeasures \nin \ntheir \ndesign, \nmarketing, and distribution practices.  (Id. \u00b6 353).  It \nalso alleges that there are practical steps defendants \ncan take to improve the design of guns that would \nprevent them from being used improperly.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 356-59).  Moreover, according to the complaint, \nthere \nwould \nbe \nno \ndownside \nto \ndefendants \nincorporating such features into their designs, as they \nwould not prohibit lawful users from using the guns, \nand such features are technologically feasible.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 354, 357).  For example, according to the complaint, \nthe Smith & Wesson 2000 Agreement included a \nprovision under which the company agreed to develop \nguns that only a particular, intended user could fire.  \n(Id. \u00b6 359).  Defendants have allegedly refused to take \nsuch measures and therefore, according to the \ncomplaint, \nsell \nguns \nthat \nare \n\u201cdefective \nand \nunreasonably dangerous.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 355-56). \nc.  Marketing Practices \nAccording to the complaint, defendants have \nmarketed and advertised their guns in an unsafe \nmanner.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 319-22). \nThe complaint alleges that defendants \u201croutinely\u201d \nmarket their guns with military and law-enforcement \nimages and language.  (Id. \u00b6 322).  This has been \nreferred to as the \u201chalo effect\u201d and allegedly allows \ndefendants to \u201cleverage\u201d affiliations with military or \npolice to increase civilian interest.  (Id. \u00b6 323).  The \ncomplaint also alleges that the use of explicit military \nand law enforcement references, as well as references \n\n220a \n \nto a weapon\u2019s ability to function in \u201ccombat-like \nscenarios,\u201d attracts dangerous users or criminals.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 321-30). \nThere are several examples of these types of \nmarketing practices in the complaint.  Smith & \nWesson \nadvertisements \ndisplay \n\u201ccombat-like \nscenarios\u201d and include statements such as \u201cauthentic \nMilitary & Police . . . design.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 324).  Colt \nadvertisements market its \u201cTrooper\u201d assault rifle, \ndiscuss missions, and liken a civilian gun to its \n\u201ccombat-proven brother.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 325).  Barrett \nadvertises its .50 caliber rifle as \u201cbattle proven\u201d and \ncapable of hitting targets 1800 meters away.  (Id. \n\u00b6 326).  It also advertises its MRAD sniper rifle as \n\u201ctransform[ing] the military platform to fit civilian \nprecision shooters.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 326-27).  Century Arms \n\u201cemphasizes that its WASR-10 gun is based on a \ndesign used by \u2018Romanian ranger teams,\u2019\u201d includes \n\u201cParatrooper\u201d in a civilian gun name, and highlights \ntheir gun\u2019s ability to \u201ceat more ammo.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 328).4  \nGlock uses military uniforms, associates with police, \nand discusses \u201ctactical\u201d uses to advertise its guns.  (Id. \n\u00b6 329).  Interstate Arms refers to itself as a seller of \n\u201cmilitary-style\u201d guns.  (Id. \u00b6 330). \nIn addition, according to the complaint, Colt \nspecifically markets its guns in ways that specifically \nentice Mexican criminal cartels.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 215-21).  Colt \nsells three guns that it intends for Mexican buyers:  \n \n \n4 According to the complaint, \u201ceat more ammo\u201d indicates the gun\u2019s \ncapacity for rapid-pace, high-output shooting that, allegedly, \nwould be neither necessary nor desired for the average civilian \nbuyer.  (Id. \u00b6 328). \n\n221a \n \nthe \u201cEl Jefe\u201d pistol, the \u201cEl Grito\u201d pistol, and the \n\u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol.  (Id. \u00b6 215).  Allegedly, \nthese \u201cmodels are status symbols and coveted by the \ndrug cartels.\u201d  (Id.). \nAccording to the complaint, defendants utilize these \nmarketing tactics while knowing that they are \n\u201cdisproportionately\u201d \nattractive \nto \ncriminal \norganizations.  (Id. \u00b6 331). \n4. Alleged \nInjuries \nto \nthe \nMexican \nGovernment \nThe complaint alleges \u201cmassive\u201d injury to the \nMexican government as a result of defendants\u2019 \nconduct.  (Id. \u00b6 446). \na.  General Harm \nThe complaint alleges that an estimated 342,000-\n597,000 guns sold by defendants are smuggled \nillegally into Mexico from the United States each year.  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 437-38).  It also states that Mexico now ranks \nthird in the world for number of gun-related deaths.  \n(Id. \u00b6 453). \nThe complaint alleges a direct link between the \nincreasing violence in Mexico and defendants\u2019 conduct.  \n(Id. \u00b6\u00b6 434-45).  It specifically shows a correlation \nbetween the increase in gun manufacturing in the \nUnited States, after the ban on assault-weapons \nexpired in 2004, and (1) the number of illegal guns \nwithin Mexico, (2) the Mexican homicide rate, and \n(3) the increased use of guns for homicide.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 440-\n44). \nb.  Specific Claimed Injuries \nAccording \nto \nthe \ncomplaint, \nthe \nMexican \ngovernment \u201chas had to spend vast funds on a wide \n\n222a \n \nrange of services to fight the effects of Defendants\u2019 \nunlawful conduct,\u201d including \u201csubstantial and unusual \ncosts for providing, for example, extraordinary health \ncare, law enforcement and military services, criminal \njustice administration, public assistance, and other \nsocial services and public programs.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 447). \nSpecifically, the complaint alleges that the Mexican \ngovernment has suffered the following injuries: \na. Losses caused by the decrease in funding \navailable for other public services because the \nfunds were diverted to services designed to \naddress the effects of Defendants\u2019 conduct; \nb. Costs of providing healthcare and medical care; \nc. Costs of additional and specialized training for \nmilitary and police; \nd. Costs associated with the deaths of and \nsubstantial injuries to police and military \npersonnel; \ne. Costs of mental-health services, treatment, \ncounseling, rehabilitation services, and social \nservices to victims and their families; \nf. Costs of law enforcement and public safety . . . ; \ng. Costs \nof \nthe \nincreased \nburden \non \nthe \nGovernment\u2019s \njudicial \nsystem, \nincluding \nincreased security, increased staff, and the \nincreased cost of adjudicating criminal matters \ndue to the escalating levels of crime caused by \nDefendants\u2019 conduct; \nh. Costs of providing care for children whose parents \nwere victims of Defendants\u2019 conduct; \ni. Losses from the decreased efficiency and size of \nthe working population in Mexico; \n\n223a \n \nj. Losses from the diminished property values in the \ncommunities affected by Defendants\u2019 conduct; \nk. Losses from decreased business investment and \neconomic activity; \nl. Losses incurred by the Government acting in its \ncommercial capacity, including from armed \nattacks on employees of state-owned enterprises \nand compensation paid to such victims. \n(Id. \u00b6 448). \nB.  Procedural Background \nThe complaint asserts nine counts, seven of which \nare against all defendants. Count 1 asserts a claim for \nnegligence based on gun design, marketing, and \ndistribution.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 506-10).  Count 2 asserts a claim \nfor public nuisance based on the increase in violence \ntied to defendants\u2019 alleged behavior.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 511-19).  \nCount 3 asserts a claim for defective design based on \nthe allegedly unreasonably dangerous design of \ndefendants\u2019 guns.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 520-22).  Count 4 asserts a \nclaim for negligence per se involving defendants\u2019 gun-\ndistribution systems.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 523-26).  Count 5 asserts \na claim for gross negligence.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 527-32).  Count 6 \nasserts a claim for unjust enrichment and restitution, \nbased on defendants\u2019 profits and gains from the sale of \nillegally trafficked guns.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 533-41).  Count 7 \nasserts a claim against defendant Colt for violation of \nthe Connecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. \nGen. Stat. \u00a7 42-110a, et seq.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 542-48).  Count 8 \nasserts a claim against defendant Smith & Wesson for \nviolation of the Massachusetts Consumer Protection \nAct, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 549-56).  \nCount 9 asserts a claim for punitive damages against \nall defendants.  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 557-60). \n\n224a \n \nDefendants have filed multiple motions to dismiss.  \nAll defendants have moved to dismiss under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 12(b)(1) and 12(b)(6) for lack of Article III \nstanding and failure to state a claim upon which relief \ncan be granted.  Interstate Arms and Smith & Wesson \nhave separately moved to dismiss for failure to state a \nclaim.  Ruger, Century Arms, Glock, and Beretta have \nmoved to dismiss pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(2) \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction.  Barrett and Colt have \nmoved to dismiss for both lack of personal jurisdiction \nand failure to state a claim.5 \nFor the reasons set forth below, although plaintiff \nhas made a sufficient showing of standing for the \ncomplaint to survive a motion to dismiss, all counts \nwill be dismissed for failure to state a claim upon \nwhich relief can be granted.  The court need not reach \nthe motions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  \nSee Johnson v. Andrews, 1994 WL 455013, at *4 (D. \nMass. Aug. 17, 1994); In re Vitamins Antitrust Litig., \n2001 WL 849928, at *11 (D.D.C. Apr. 11, 2001); see \nalso 4 CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT & ARTHUR R. MILLER, \nFEDERAL PRACTICE & PROCEDURE \u00a7 1067.6 (4th ed.) \n(stating that a court can \u201cresolv[e] the suit on the \nmerits when they clearly must be decided in favor of \nthe party challenging [personal] jurisdiction, thereby \nobviating any need to decide the [jurisdictional] \nquestion\u201d). \n \n \n5 On December 31, 2021, plaintiff voluntarily dismissed its claims \nagainst two foreign corporations named as defendants (Beretta \nHolding S.p.A and Glock Ges.m.b.H). \n\n225a \n \nII.  Standard of Review \nA.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(1) \nOn a motion to dismiss for lack of subject-matter \njurisdiction, \u201cthe party invoking the jurisdiction of a \nfederal court carries the burden of proving its \nexistence.\u201d  Johansen v. United States, 506 F.3d 65, 68 \n(1st Cir. 2007) (quoting Murphy v. United States, 45 \nF.3d 520, 522 (1st Cir. 1995)).  If the party seeking to \ninvoke federal jurisdiction \u201cfails to demonstrate a \nbasis for jurisdiction,\u201d the motion to dismiss must be \ngranted.  Id.  When ruling on a motion to dismiss \nunder Rule 12(b)(1), the court \u201cmust credit the \nplaintiff\u2019s well-[pleaded] factual allegations and draw \nall reasonable inferences in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.\u201d  \nMerlonghi v. United States, 620 F.3d 50, 54 (1st Cir. \n2010). \nB.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \nTo survive a motion to dismiss under Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b)(6), the complaint must state a claim that is \nplausible on its face.  See Bell Atl. Corp. v. Twombly, \n550 U.S. 544, 570 (2007). For a claim to be plausible, \nthe \u201c[f]actual allegations must be enough to raise a \nright to relief above the speculative level . . . .\u201d  Id. at \n555 (cleaned up).  \u201cThe plausibility standard is not \nakin to a \u2018probability requirement,\u2019 but it asks for more \nthan a sheer possibility that a defendant has acted \nunlawfully.\u201d  Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, 678 \n(2009) (quoting Twombly, 550 U.S. at 556).  When \ndetermining whether a complaint satisfies that \nstandard, a court must assume the truth of all well-\npleaded facts and give the plaintiff the benefit of all \nreasonable inferences.  See Ruiz v. Bally Total Fitness \nHolding Corp., 496 F.3d 1, 5 (1st Cir. 2007) (citing \n\n226a \n \nRogan v. Menino, 175 F.3d 75, 77 (1st Cir. 1999)).  \nDismissal is appropriate if the complaint fails to set \nforth \u201cfactual allegations, either direct or inferential, \nrespecting each material element necessary to sustain \nrecovery under some actionable legal theory.\u201d  \nGagliardi v. Sullivan, 513 F.3d 301, 305 (1st Cir. \n2008) (quoting Centro Medico del Turabo, Inc. v. \nFeliciano de Melecio, 406 F.3d 1, 6 (1st Cir. 2005)). \nIII.  Analysis \nA.  Article III Standing \nStanding is a threshold question in every case; \u201c[i]f \na party lacks standing to bring a matter before the \ncourt, the court lacks jurisdiction to decide the merits \nof the underlying case.\u201d  United States v. AVX Corp., \n962 F.2d 108, 113 (1st Cir. 1992).  To satisfy the case-\nor-controversy requirement of Article III of the \nConstitution, plaintiffs bear the burden of establishing \nthat they (1) have suffered an \u201cinjury-in-fact\u201d that is \n\u201cconcrete \nand \nparticularized\u201d \nand \n\u201cactual \nor \nimminent;\u201d (2) that the injury is \u201c\u2018fairly traceable\u2019 to \nthe actions of the defendant;\u201d and (3) that the injury \nwill likely be redressed by a favorable decision.  \nBennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. 154, 167 (1997) (quoting \nLujan v. Defenders of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 \n(1992)); Katz v. Pershing, LLC, 672 F.3d 64, 71 (1st \nCir. 2012).  Those elements must be proved \u201cwith the \nmanner and degree of evidence required at the \nsuccessive stages of the litigation.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at \n561. \nDefendants only contest the second requirement: \nthey contend that the harms alleged are not \u201cfairly \ntraceable\u201d to their actions. \n\n227a \n \nThe \u201cfairly traceable\u201d component of constitutional \nstanding examines the causal connection between the \nassertedly unlawful conduct and the alleged injury.  \nSee California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 2113-14 \n(2021) (explaining that plaintiff failed to show how \ndefendant\u2019s \u201caction or conduct has caused or will cause \nthe injury\u201d for which they seek redress).  One critical \nquestion is whether the \u201ccausal relation between [the] \ninjury and challenged action depends upon the \ndecision of an independent third party.\u201d  California v. \nTexas, 141 S. Ct. at 2117; see also Clapper v. Amnesty \nInt\u2019l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 413 (explaining that the Court \nhas been \u201creluctant to endorse standing theories that \nrequire \nguesswork \nas \nto \nhow \nindependent \ndecisionmakers \nwill \nexercise \ntheir \njudgment\u201d).  \nHowever, even if the causal relation depends on the \nactions of independent third parties, \u201cstanding is not \nprecluded,\u201d but rather is \u201csubstantially more difficult \nto establish.\u201d  Lujan, 504 U.S. at 562 (cleaned up).  To \nsatisfy the element of causation, the plaintiff must at \nleast show \u201cthat third parties will likely react in \npredictable ways,\u201d even where such actions are \nunlawful.  Department of Commerce v. New York, 139 \nS. Ct. 2551, 2566 (2019). \nHere, \nplaintiff \ncontends \nthat \nthe \nMexican \ngovernment and its citizens \u201chave been victimized by \na deadly flood\u201d of firearms from the United States \u201cinto \ncriminal hands in Mexico\u201d as a consequence of \ndefendants\u2019 \n\u201cdeliberate \nactions \nand \nbusiness \npractices.\u201d  (Compl. \u00b6 2).  According to the complaint, \ndefendants \u201cdesign, market, distribute, and sell guns \nin ways they know routinely arm the drug cartels in \nMexico.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 3).  Specifically, the complaint alleges \nthat the trafficking of firearms into Mexico, and the \n\n228a \n \nresulting violence, are the direct product of the \nintentional sales practices of defendants.  (Id. \u00b6 3). \nThe causal relation between the harm alleged and \ndefendants\u2019 conduct depends upon the decisions of \nmultiple independent parties\u2014that is, the decisions of \ndistributors to sell to retailers; the decisions of those \nretailers to sell to straw purchasers or similar persons; \nthe decisions of those purchasers to transfer weapons \nto cartel members or other criminal actors; and the \nindependent choices of those individuals to engage in \ncriminal behavior.  And the chain of causality does not \nstop there.  The plaintiff is not an individual victim of \ngun violence; it is the Mexican government, which \nalleges a series of consequential harms arising out of \nthat violence, such as increased costs for health care \nand law enforcement. \nNonetheless, the complaint sufficiently alleges\u2014at \nleast for standing purposes\u2014that those third parties \n\u201cwill likely react in predictable ways,\u201d even if \nunlawfully.  Department of Commerce, 139 S. Ct. at \n2556.  The complaint alleges that 70 to 90 percent of \nguns that are recovered at crime scenes in Mexico were \ntrafficked from the United States, and that defendants \nproduce more than 68 percent of those trafficked guns.  \n(Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 1,5).  It further alleges that defendants\u2019 \npolicy is \u201cto sell to any distributor or dealer that has a \nU.S. license to buy and sell the product, regardless of \nthe buyer\u2019s record of flouting the law and despite \nblazing red flags indicating that a gun dealer is \nconspiring with straw purchasers or others to traffic \nDefendants\u2019 guns into Mexico.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 7). \nFurthermore, the complaint alleges throughout that \nviolence in Mexico is a predictable, or \u201cforeseeable,\u201d \n\n229a \n \nresult of defendants\u2019 actions.  (See, e.g., id. \u00b6\u00b6 2, 50, \n80, 87, 356).  For example, section five of the \ncomplaint\u2014titled \u201cDEFENDANTS ARE FULLY ON \nNOTICE \nTHAT \nTHEIR \nCONDUCT \nCAUSES \nUNLAWFUL \nTRAFFICKING \nTO \nMEXICO\u201d\u2014\nprovides examples of reports and articles that publicly \nrevealed which gun dealers were the biggest \ncontributors to the illegal gun market in Mexico.  (Id. \n\u00b6 120).  (See also id. \u00b6 122 (\u201cDefendants regularly \nreceive even more direct information about problem \ndealers.  Trace requests from ATF and other agencies \nalert Defendants that guns they sell to specific \ndistributors and dealers are being recovered at crime \nscenes in Mexico.\u201d)). \nThe causation requirement of Article III standing \n\u201crequires \nno \nmore \nthan \nde facto \ncausality.\u201d  \nDepartment of Commerce, 139 S.Ct. at 2566 (quoting \nBlock v. Meese, 793 F.2d 1303, 1309 (D.C. Cir. 1986) \n(Scalia, J.)); Bennett v. Spear, 520 U.S. at 167-68.  At \nthe pleading stage, \u201cgeneral factual allegations of \ninjury resulting from the defendant\u2019s conduct may \nsuffice, for on a motion to dismiss we presume that \ngeneral allegations embrace those specific facts that \nare necessary to support the claim.\u201d  Bennett v. Spear, \n520 U.S. at 168 (cleaned up).  Under the \ncircumstances, the requirement of de facto causation \nis satisfied here. \nAccordingly, the complaint plausibly alleges that \nMexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cfairly traceable\u201d to defendants\u2019 \nconduct for purposes of Article III standing. \n\n230a \n \nB.  The Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct \nThe PLCAA was enacted in 2005.  (Pub. L. No. 109-\n92, 119 Stat. 2095).  The statute contains a lengthy \npreamble setting forth various congressional findings \nand statutory purposes.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901.  Among \nthose findings is the following: \n(5)  Businesses in the United States that are \nengaged in interstate and foreign commerce \nthrough the lawful design, manufacture, marketing, \ndistribution, importation, or sale to the public of \nfirearms or ammunition products that have been \nshipped or transported in interstate or foreign \ncommerce are not and should not be liable for the \nharm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully \nmisuse firearm products or ammunition products \nthat function as designed and intended. \n(6  The possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by \nothers is an abuse of the legal system, erodes public \nconfidence in our Nation\u2019s laws, threatens the \ndiminution of a basic constitutional right and civil \nliberty, invites the disassembly and destabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors lawfully \ncompeting in the free enterprise system of the \nUnited States, and constitutes an unreasonable \nburden on interstate and foreign commerce of the \nUnited States. \n(7) \nThe \nliability \nactions \ncommenced \nor \ncontemplated by the Federal Government . . . and \nothers are based on theories without foundation in \nhundreds of years of the common law and \njurisprudence of the United States and do not \n\n231a \n \nrepresent a bona fide expansion of the common law.  \nThe possible sustaining of these actions by a \nmaverick judicial officer or petit jury would expand \ncivil liability in a manner never contemplated by the \nframers of the Constitution, by Congress, or by the \nlegislatures of the several States. \nId. \u00a7 7901(a)(5)-(7). \nAmong the stated purposes of the statute is to \n\u201cprohibit causes of action against manufacturers [and] \ndistributors . . . of firearms . . . for the harm solely \ncaused by the criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm \nproducts . . . by others when the product functioned as \ndesigned and intended.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7901(b)(1). \nAs relevant here, the statute provides that a \n\u201cqualified civil liability action may not be brought in \nany Federal or State court.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7902(a).  The term \n\u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d is defined to mean \u201ca \ncivil action or proceeding . . . brought by any person \nagainst a manufacturer or seller\u201d of a firearm \u201cfor \ndamages, punitive damages, injunctive or declaratory \nrelief,\u201d or other relief, \u201cresulting from the criminal or \nunlawful misuse\u201d of a firearm by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d subject to certain exceptions.  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). \nFor the following reasons, the Court finds that the \nPLCAA applies to this case and therefore, at a \nminimum, Counts 1-6 and Count 9 must be dismissed. \n1.  Choice-of Law Analysis \nPlaintiff first contends that under choice-of-law \nprinciples, tort claims are generally governed by the \nlaw of the place where the injury occurred, and \ntherefore Mexican law, not the PLCAA, should apply \nto this dispute.  That argument may be disposed of \nsummarily: because the PLCAA is a jurisdiction-\n\n232a \n \nstripping \nstatute, \nno \nchoice-of-law \nanalysis \nis \nnecessary. \nStatutes that \u201ccompletely prohibit\u201d certain types of \nactions or that \u201caddress[] \u2018a court\u2019s competence to \nadjudicate a particular category of cases\u2019\u201d are \u201cbest \nread as jurisdiction-stripping statute[s].\u201d  Patchak v. \nZinke, 138 S. Ct. 897, 906 (2018) (quoting Wachovia \nBank, N.A. v. Schmidt, 546 U.S. 303, 316 (2006)).  To \ndetermine whether a statute is jurisdictional, the \ncourt must look to the language used and whether the \nstatute \n\u201cimposes \njurisdictional \nconsequences.\u201d  \nPatchak, 138 S. Ct. at 905.  A statute can be \njurisdictional even if it does not use the word \n\u201cjurisdiction.\u201d  See id. (\u201cAlthough \u00a7 2(b) does not use \nthe word \u2018jurisdiction,\u2019 this Court does not require \njurisdictional statutes to \u2018incant magic words.\u2019\u201d \n(citation omitted)).  Examples of jurisdictional \nlanguage include:  \u201can action shall not be filed or \nmaintained in a Federal court;\u201d \u201can appeal may not be \ntaken;\u201d \u201cno person shall file or prosecute;\u201d and \u201cno \naction shall be brought under.\u201d  See Patchak, 138 S. \nCt. at 905-06 (collecting cases).  An example of \n\u201cjurisdictional consequences\u201d includes a directive by \nCongress, in the statute, that pending actions \nconcerning the statute\u2019s scope \u201cshall be promptly \ndismissed.\u201d  Id. at 905. \nBy its plain terms, the PLCAA limits the types of \nlawsuits \nthat \ncan \nbe \nbrought \nagainst \ngun \nmanufacturers and distributors in federal and state \ncourt.  Specifically, the PLCAA states that a \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action may not be brought in any Federal \nor State court.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a) (emphasis added).  \nThe PLCAA also provides that any such pending \naction, as of the date of enactment, must be \n\n233a \n \n\u201cimmediately dismissed by the court.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7902(b).6  The PLCAA, therefore, is a jurisdictional \nstatute.  And because it bars exactly this type of action \nfrom being brought in federal and state courts, no \nchoice-of-law analysis is necessary. \n2.  Presumption Against Extraterritoriality \nPlaintiff further contends that the PLCAA does not \napply when the lawsuit is brought by a foreign \ngovernment for harms that primarily occurred in a \nforeign country.  To resolve that question, the Court \nmust consider whether the presumption against \nextraterritoriality applies. \n\u201cIt is a longstanding principle of American law \u2018that \nlegislation of Congress, unless a contrary intent \nappears, is meant to apply only within the territorial \njurisdiction of the United States.\u2019\u201d  E.E.O.C. v. \nArabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. 244, 248 (1991) (quoting \nFoley Bros., Inc. v. Filardo, 336 U.S. 281, 285 (1949)).  \n\u201cThis principle finds expression in a canon of statutory \nconstruction known as the presumption against \nextraterritoriality: \n \nAbsent \nclearly \nexpressed \ncongressional intent to the contrary, federal laws will \nbe construed to have only domestic application.\u201d  RJR \n \n \n6 The Court recognizes that the Second Circuit reached an \nopposite conclusion in City of New York v. Mickalis Pawn Shop, \nLLC, 645 F.3d 114, 127 (2d Cir. 2011).  However, since that \nopinion, the Supreme Court clarified in Patchak that a statute \nemploying language such as \u201cno action shall be brought under,\u201d \nand instructing that all covered pending actions must be \ndismissed upon enactment, is jurisdictional in nature.  As noted, \nthe PLCAA has both jurisdictional language and jurisdictional \nconsequences. \n\n234a \n \nNabisco, Inc. v. European Cmty., 579 U.S. 325, 335 \n(2016) (citation omitted).  The main objective of the \npresumption against extraterritoriality is \u201cto protect \nagainst unintended clashes between our laws and \nthose of other nations which could result in \ninternational discord.\u201d  Arabian Am. Oil Co., 499 U.S. \nat 248. \nThe Supreme Court has developed a two-step test to \nexamine \nwhether \na \ngiven \nstatute \napplies \nextraterritorially.  See RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337.  \nThe first step examines whether Congress included \nexplicit language in the statute that allows it to be \napplicable to conduct in foreign nations.  See id. at 337.  \nIf a court does not find \u201caffirmative and unmistakable\u201d \nlanguage in the statute that makes it applicable \nextraterritorially, see id. at 335, then, at the second \nstep, the courts must determine the statute\u2019s \u201cfocus\u201d \nand \u201cwhether the conduct relevant to that focus \noccurred in United States territory,\u201d WesternGeco LLC \nv. ION Geophysical Corp., 138 S. Ct. 2129, 2136 (2018).  \nIf the relevant conduct occurred within United States \nterritory, then the \u201ccase involves a permissible \ndomestic application of the statute\u201d and the \npresumption does not apply.  WesternGeco LLC, 138 S. \nCt. at 2136. \na.  Step One \nAs to the first step, \u201cthe question is not whether we \nthink Congress would have wanted a statute to apply \nto foreign conduct . . . but whether Congress has \naffirmatively and unmistakably instructed that the \nstatute will do so.  When a statute gives no clear \nindication of an extraterritorial application, it has \nnone.\u201d  RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 335 (quoting \n\n235a \n \nMorrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. \n247, 255, 261 (2010)) (cleaned up).  General references \nto \u201cforeign commerce\u201d or the use of generic terms such \nas \u201cany\u201d are not sufficient to defeat the presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality.  See Morrison, 561 U.S. at \n262-63; Kiobel v. Royal Dutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. \n108, 118 (2013). \nThe relevant portions of the PLCAA are \u00a7\u00a7 7902 and \n7903.  As noted, \u00a7 7902 of the PLCAA bars any \n\u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d in any United States \ncourt.  A \u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d includes \u201ca \ncivil action or proceeding\u201d brought by \u201cany person\u201d \nagainst gun manufacturers or sellers.  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(a).  \u201cPerson\u201d is defined as \u201cany individual, \ncorporation, . . . or any other entity, including any \ngovernmental entity.\u201d  \u00a7 7903(3) (emphasis added). \nThe PLCAA thus explicitly bars any governmental \nentity from bringing a civil action in any United States \ncourt \nagainst \ngun \nmanufacturers \nor \nsellers.  \nNonetheless, \u201cit is well established that generic terms \nlike \u2018any\u2019 . . . do not rebut the presumption against \nextraterritoriality.\u201d  Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 118; see also \nid. (explaining that \u201cthe fact that the text [of the \nstatute] reaches \u2018any civil action\u2019\u201d does not suggest \napplication to torts committed abroad).  Accordingly, \nthe use of the word \u201cany\u201d throughout the PLCAA is not \nsufficient to rebut the presumption. \nSimilarly, the PLCAA also contains numerous \nreferences to \u201cforeign commerce.\u201d  For example, both \nthe congressional findings and purposes set out in \n\u00a7 7901 use the term, and one of the explicit statutory \npurposes is to \u201cprevent the use of such lawsuits to \nimpose unreasonable burdens on interstate and \n\n236a \n \nforeign commerce.\u201d  \u00a7 7901(b)(4) (emphasis added); see \nalso \u00a7 7903(2) (defining \u201cmanufacturer\u201d to include \u201ca \nperson \nwho \nis \nengaged \nin \nthe \nbusiness \nof \nmanufacturing the product in interstate or foreign \ncommerce\u201d (emphasis added)).  Again, however, such \ngeneral references are not sufficient to overcome the \npresumption.  See Morrison, 561 U.S. at 262-63 \n(explaining that \u201cwe have repeatedly held that even \nstatutes that contain broad language in their \ndefinitions of \u2018commerce\u2019 that expressly refer to \n\u2018foreign commerce\u2019 do not apply abroad\u201d (cleaned up)). \nThus, there are insufficient indications in the text of \nthe PLCAA to overcome the presumption against \nextraterritoriality.  The Court will therefore turn to \nstep two of the analysis. \nb.  Step Two \nAt the second step, the court must examine \n\u201cwhether the case involves a domestic application of \nthe statute;\u201d this is done by \u201clooking to the statute\u2019s \n\u2018focus.\u2019\u201d  RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337.  \u201cThe focus of \na statute is the object of its solicitude, which can \ninclude the conduct it seeks to regulate, as well as the \nparties and interests it seeks to protect or vindicate.\u201d  \nWesternGeco LLC, 138 S. Ct. at 2137 (cleaned up).  \u201cIf \nthe conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in \nthe United States, then the case involves a permissible \ndomestic application even if other conduct occurred \nabroad . . . .\u201d  RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337.  That is, \n\u201c[e]ven where the significant effects of the regulated \nconduct are felt outside U.S. borders, the statute itself \ndoes not present a problem of extraterritoriality, so \nlong as the conduct which Congress seeks to regulate \noccurs \nlargely \nwithin \nthe \nUnited \nStates.\u201d  \n\n237a \n \nEnvironmental Def. Fund, Inc. v. Massey, 986 F.2d \n528, 531 (D.C. Cir. 1993).  Thus, when the conduct \nregulated by the statute occurs within the United \nStates, the presumption against extraterritoriality \ndoes not apply.  See Massey, 986 F.2d at 531. \nIn WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp., the \nSupreme Court examined the Patent Act, which \nprovides damages for patent infringement.  138 S.Ct. \n2129 at 2137-39.  The court found that patent \ninfringement was \u201cplainly the focus\u201d of that statute.  \nId. at 2137.  And it determined that the specific \nconduct that constituted the infringement was the act \nof exporting components from the United States.  See \nid. at 2138 (\u201c[I]t was ION\u2019s domestic act of supplying \nthe \ncomponents \nthat \ninfringed \nWesternGeco\u2019s \npatents.\u201d).  Because the \u201cconduct [] that is relevant to \n[the statute\u2019s] focus clearly occurred in the United \nStates,\u201d it found that this was a domestic application \nof the Patent Act and the presumption did not apply.  \nId. at 2138-2139.  It did not matter that there were \nother \u201cincidental\u201d \u201coverseas events\u201d or that the profits \nlost were \u201cforeign profits.\u201d  Id. at 2138-39. \nSimilarly, in Environmental Defense Fund, Inc. v. \nMassey, the D.C. Circuit determined that the statute \nat issue in that case was not subject to the \npresumption against extraterritoriality because the \ndecision-making processes that it regulated took place \n\u201calmost exclusively in this country\u201d and \u201cinvolve[d] the \nworkings of the United States government.\u201d  986 F.2d \nat 532.  In other words, because the statute regulated \na \u201cparticular process\u201d that was \u201cuniquely domestic,\u201d \nthe presumption did not apply.  Id. \n\n238a \n \nThe focus of the PLCAA is both the civil actions that \nit \u201cseeks to regulate\u201d and the commercial activity and \nconstitutional rights it \u201cseeks to protect.\u201d  See \nMorrison, 561 U.S. at 267; WesternGeco, 138 S. Ct. at \n2137; 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(b)(1), (6).  That is, the PLCAA \nseeks to regulate the types of claims that can be \nasserted against firearm manufacturers and sellers \nand seeks to protect the interests of the United States \nfirearms industry and the rights of gun owners.  \nIndeed, the statute seeks to prohibit exactly the type \nof claim that is currently before this Court. \nThe PLCAA therefore seeks to regulate a \u201cparticular \nprocess\u201d of government that is \u201cuniquely domestic\u201d:  \nthe types of cases that can be brought in United States \ncourts against domestic gun manufacturers and \ndistributors.  See Massey, 986 F.2d at 532; 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7902(a), 7903(5)(A).  The regulation of the types of \ncases that can be brought in federal and state courts \nagainst domestic defendants is unquestionably a \ndomestic matter.  It is the type of conduct that \n\u201ctouch[es] and concern[s] the territory of the United \nStates . . . with sufficient force to displace the \npresumption against extraterritorial application.\u201d  \nKiobel, 569 U.S. at 124-25. \nFurthermore, the conduct of defendants for which \nplaintiff seeks to hold defendants liable occurred in the \nUnited States.  The complained-of practices\u2014such as \nthe manufacture of certain types of guns, the \nmarketing of guns in a manner intended to appeal to \ncriminal organizations, and the sale of guns through \ndistribution networks that facilitate the transfer to \nsuch organizations\u2014all occurred entirely within the \nborders of the United States.  Mexico is seeking to hold \n\n239a \n \ndefendants liable for practices that occurred within \nthe United States and only resulted in harm in Mexico. \nIn short, \u201cthe conduct relevant to the statute\u2019s focus \noccurred in the United States.\u201d  RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. \nat 337.  Therefore, this case \u201cinvolve[s] a permissible \ndomestic application\u201d of the PLCAA, \u201ceven if other \nconduct occurred abroad,\u201d id., and even if the \n\u201csignificant effects of the regulated conduct are felt \noutside U.S. borders,\u201d Massey, 986 F.2d at 531. \nThis case thus represents a valid domestic \napplication of the PLCAA, and the presumption \nagainst extraterritoriality does not apply.7 \n \n \n7 In determining whether the presumption applied, the D.C. \nCircuit in Massey also considered whether \u201cthe failure to extend \nthe scope of the statute to a foreign setting [would] result in \nadverse effects within the United States.\u201d  Massey, 986 F.2d at \n531.  In particular, the court discussed the Sherman Antitrust \nAct, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1-7 (1976), and the Lanham Trademark Act, 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1051 et. seq. (1976), as \u201cprime examples\u201d of when \navoiding \u201cnegative economic consequences within the United \nStates\u201d \nwas \nsufficient \nreason \nto \nextend \na \nstatute \nextraterritorially.  Massey, 986 F.2d at 531.  If the PLCAA did not \napply to the claims by Mexico, and this lawsuit were to succeed, \nthere would be economic consequences within the United States, \nwhich would clearly undermine the intent of Congress. See 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6) (stating that lawsuits against firearm \nmanufacturers \u201cinvite[] the disassembly and destabilization of \nother industries and economic sectors lawfully competing in the \nfree enterprise system of the United States, and constitute[] an \nunreasonable burden on interstate and foreign commerce of the \nUnited States\u201d). \n\n240a \n \n3.  Application of General Prohibition of the \nPLCAA \nThere is no doubt that the general prohibition of the \nPLCAA applies to this lawsuit.  It is unquestionably a \n\u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d\u2014that is, \u201ca civil action \nor proceeding . . . brought by any person against a \nmanufacturer or seller\u201d of a firearm \u201cfor damages, \npunitive damages, injunctive or declaratory relief,\u201d or \nother relief, \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse\u201d of a firearm by the person or a third party.\u201d  \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A).  Such a lawsuit \u201cmay not be \nbrought in any Federal or State court.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7902(a).  \nAccordingly, for the claims to survive a motion to \ndismiss, an exception to the statute must apply. \n4.  Statutory Exceptions \nThe PLCAA contains six exceptions that permit civil \nactions against gun manufacturers and distributors.  \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Of those six, three are \npotentially applicable here. \na.  Predicate Exception \nThe first potentially applicable exception is the so-\ncalled \n\u201cpredicate \nexception.\u201d \n \n15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).8  That exception excludes from the \ndefinition of \u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d any \n \n \n8 Courts refer to \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) as the \u201cpredicate exception\u201d \nbecause it requires \u201cproof of a knowing violation of a \u2018predicate \nstatute.\u2019\u201d  Phillips v. Lucky Gunner, LLC, 84 F. Supp. 3d 1216, \n1224 (D. Colo. 2015) (quoting Ileto v. Glock, 565 F.3d 1126, 1132 \n(9th Cir. 2009)).  See also City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 524 F.3d 384, 390 (2d Cir. 2008); District of Columbia v. \nBeretta U.S.A. Corp., 940 A.2d 163, 168 (D.C. 2008) (\u201c[O]ther \ncourts construing [the section\u2019s] language, have referred to \n\n241a \n \naction in which a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product knowingly violated a State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing \nof the product, and the violation was a proximate \ncause of the harm for which relief is sought, \nincluding \u2013 \n(I) any case in which the manufacturer or \nseller knowingly made any false entry in, or \nfailed to make appropriate entry in, any record \nrequired to be kept under Federal or State law \nwith respect to the qualified product, or aided, \nabetted, or conspired with any person in \nmaking any false or fictitious oral or written \nstatement with respect to any fact material to \nthe lawfulness of the sale or other disposition \nof a qualified product; or \n(II) any case in which the manufacturer or \nseller aided, abetted, or conspired with any \nother person to sell or otherwise dispose of a \nqualified \nproduct, \nknowing, \nor \nhaving \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual \nbuyer of the qualified product was prohibited \nfrom possessing or receiving a firearm or \nammunition under subsection (g) or (n) of \nsection 922 of Title 18 . . . . \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I)-(II) (emphasis added).  \nThe term \u201cqualified product,\u201d as applied here, means \na firearm.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(4). \n \n \nsubsection (5)(A)(iii) as the \u2018predicate exception\u2019 to the PLCAA \nbecause, to take effect, it requires that the manufacturer or seller \nhave committed an underlying (or predicate) statutory \nviolation.\u201d). \n\n242a \n \nThe predicate exception applies only to \u201cstatutes,\u201d \nnot common-law causes of action.  To the extent, \ntherefore, that the complaint asserts claims for \nnegligence or other causes of action arising under \ncommon law, the exception does not apply.  Indeed, the \nclaims asserted in Counts 1 through 6 and Count 9 are \nnot claimed to arise under any federal or state statute.  \nThe only statutory claims asserted are set forth in \nCount 7, which alleges a claim against Colt under the \nConnecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. \nStat. \u00a7 42-110a, et seq., and Count 8, which alleges a \nclaim \nagainst \nSmith \n& \nWesson \nunder \nthe \nMassachusetts Consumer Protection Act, Mass. Gen. \nLaws ch. 93A. \nBoth CUTPA and Chapter 93A are consumer-\nprotection statutes that generally prohibit unfair and \ndeceptive acts or practices.  The question is thus \nwhether \nthose \nstatutes \nshould \nbe \nconsidered \n\u201capplicable\u201d to the sale or marketing of firearms, and \nthus fall within the predicate exception. \nThe Second Circuit interpreted the predicate \nexception in City of New York v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., \n524 F.3d 384 (2d Cir. 2008).  The court began by noting \nthat the general language in \u00a7 7903(5)(A) is followed \nby more specific language that refers to statutes that \nregulate the firearms industry in specific ways (for \nexample, requiring recordkeeping and prohibiting the \nsale of firearms to certain purchasers).  Beretta, 524 \nF.3d at 402.  Because of that, the court concluded that \nthe \n\u201cgeneral \nterm\u2014\u2019applicable \nto\u2019\u2014should \nbe \nconstrued to embrace only objects similar to those \nenumerated by sections 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I) and (II)\u201d and \ntherefore \u201cto mean statutes that clearly can be said to \nregulate the firearms industry,\u201d as opposed to any \n\n243a \n \nfederal or state statute that is \u201ccapable of being \napplied\u201d to the sale or marketing of firearms.  Id. at \n402-03 (cleaned up).  The court explained that such a \nreading would also \u201cmore accurately reflect[] the \nintent of Congress.\u201d  Id. at 402. \nThe court further observed that reading the \npredicate exception to include any law \u201ccapable of \nbeing applied to\u201d the sale or marketing of firearms \nwould \u201callow the predicate exception to swallow the \nstatute.\u201d  Id. at 403.  And such a reading would go \nagainst the \u201cinterpretive principle that statutory \nexceptions are to be construed narrowly in order to \npreserve the primary operation of the general rule.\u201d  \nId. at 403 (cleaned up) (citing Commissioner v. Clark, \n489 U.S. 726, 739 (1989)). \nThe court then held that the New York criminal-\nnuisance statute was a statute of general applicability \nthat had never been applied to firearms suppliers, and \ntherefore did not fall within the exception.  Id. at 400, \n404.  It went on to hold, however, that the predicate \nexception encompasses not only those statutes that \n\u201cexpressly regulate firearms,\u201d but also those that \n\u201ccourts have applied to the sale and marketing of \nfirearms\u201d or that \u201cdo not expressly regulate firearms \nbut that clearly can be said to implicate the purchase \nand sale of firearms.\u201d  Id. at 404. \nAs the dissent in Beretta pointed out, the court\u2019s \napproach creates a number of ambiguities and other \nissues that (in the dissenting judge\u2019s view) would have \nbeen better resolved by certifying a question to the \nNew York Court of Appeals whether the statute at \nissue is \u201capplicable to the sale and marketing of \nfirearms.\u201d  Id. at 408 (Katzmann, J., dissenting). \n\n244a \n \nIn any event, there are reasons to conclude that \nCongress did not intend the predicate exception of the \nPLCAA to permit lawsuits based on violations of \ngenerally applicable state statutes that do not \nspecifically address firearms.  See Soto v. Bushmaster \nFirearms Int\u2019l, LLC, 331 Conn. 53, 162 (2019) \n(Robinson, J., dissenting) (concluding that the \npredicate exception does not apply to consumer-\nprotection statutes of general applicability).  There are \nalso reasons to conclude, as the Beretta court did, that \ngenerally applicable statutes that \u201chave [been] \napplied\u201d in the past to the sale or marketing of \nfirearms, or that \u201cclearly can be said to implicate the \npurchase and sale of firearms,\u201d fall within the \nexception.  Beretta, 524 F.3d at 404.  Indeed, the \nConnecticut Supreme Court has held that CUTPA \nqualifies as a \u201csale or marketing\u201d statute that falls \nwithin the exception.  Soto, 331 Conn. at 125, 129.9 \nRather than resolve the issue, the Court will \nassume, for present purposes, that the predicate \nexception applies to the two state statutory claims.  \nHowever, because Count 1 (negligence), Count 2 \n \n \n9 Soto involved a lawsuit by victims of gun violence, rather than \na governmental entity alleging that it suffered indirect harms \nfrom such acts.  Cf. Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 258 Conn. \n313 (2001).  The predicate exception also requires that \u201cthe \nviolation [of the statute]\u201d must be \u201ca proximate cause of the harm \nfor which relief is sought.\u201d  \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  As set forth below, \nthe Connecticut Supreme Court held in Ganim that a \ngovernmental entity does not have statutory standing under \nCUTPA to assert relief for injuries to citizens caused by gun \nviolence.  It is therefore doubtful whether the proximate-cause \nrequirement could be satisfied even if CUTPA falls within the \npredicate exception. \n\n245a \n \n(public nuisance), Count 3 (defective design), Count 4 \n(negligence per se), Count 5 (gross negligence), \nCount 6 (unjust enrichment and restitution), and \nCount 9 (punitive damages) all involve common-law, \nnot statutory, claims, they do not fall within the \npredicate exception set forth in \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nb.  Negligence Per Se Exception \nThe second potentially applicable exception to the \ngeneral prohibition is set forth in \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(ii), \nwhich (as relevant here) permits an action \u201cagainst a \nseller for . . . negligence per se.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(ii). \n \nThat \nexception, \nhowever, \nis \ninapplicable for at least three reasons. \nFirst, the exception clearly does not apply to the \nseven defendants who are manufacturers of firearms.  \nThe exception applies only to claims against \u201ca seller,\u201d \nwhich is a defined term; by contrast, the predicate \nexception applies to claims against \u201ca manufacturer or \nseller.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(ii), (iii).  That distinction \nmust be presumed to be meaningful, and to reflect a \ndeliberate intent on the part of Congress that the \nexception should not apply to \u201cmanufacturers.\u201d  See \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 173 (2001) (stating \nthat \u201cwhere Congress includes particular language in \none section of a statute but omits it in another section \nof the same Act, it is generally presumed that \nCongress acts intentionally and purposely in the \ndisparate inclusion or exclusion\u201d (cleaned up)); see also \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(C) (\u201cThe exceptions [in the \nPLCAA] shall be construed so as not to be in \nconflict . . . .\u201d). \nThe PLCCA defines a \u201cseller,\u201d as relevant here, to \nmean \u201ca dealer (as defined in section 921(a)(11) of Title \n\n246a \n \n18) who is engaged in the business as such a dealer in \ninterstate or foreign commerce and who is licensed to \nengage in the business as such a dealer under chapter \n44 of Title 18.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(6)(B). Section \n921(a)(11), in turn, defines \u201cdealer\u201d in part as \u201cany \nperson engaged in the business of selling firearms at \nwholesale or retail.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 921(a)(11) The same \nstatute defines \u201cmanufacturer\u201d in part as \u201cany person \nengaged in the business of manufacturing firearms or \nammunition for purposes of sale or distribution.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 921(a)(10). \n \nAgain, \nthat \ndemonstrates \na \ncongressional intent to distinguish between \u201csellers\u201d \nand \u201cmanufacturers.\u201d \nIt is true, of course, that manufacturers sell \nproducts, and that therefore in a general sense all \nmanufacturers are sellers.  But if the statute were \ninterpreted so that all manufacturers were included in \nthe statutory definition of \u201cseller,\u201d the statutory \ndistinction between \u201cmanufacturers\u201d and \u201csellers\u201d \nwould be meaningless, and render the definition of \n\u201cmanufacturer\u201d in \u00a7 921(a)(11) entirely redundant.  \nSee Corley v. United States, 556 U.S. 303, 314 (2009) \n(explaining that a \u201cstatute should be construed so that \neffect is given to all its provisions, so that no part will \nbe inoperative or superfluous, void or insignificant\u201d \n(cleaned up)). \nIt is also true that a \u201cmanufacturer\u201d may also be a \n\u201cseller.\u201d But there is nothing in the complaint\u2014other \nthan the general allegation that each of the seven \nmanufacturers is a \u201cmanufacturer and seller\u201d of \nfirearms, see Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 31-39\u2014that plausibly \nsuggests that those manufacturers satisfy the \nstatutory definition of \u201cseller.\u201d In particular, none of \nthe seven is alleged to be \u201cengaged in the business of \n\n247a \n \nselling firearms at wholesale or retail,\u201d or to possess \nthe necessary licenses to do so.  To the contrary, a \ncentral focus of the complaint is the allegation that the \nmanufacturers use a three-tier distribution system to \navoid being in the business of wholesaling or retailing \nfirearms.  For example, the complaint alleges the \nfollowing: \nManufacturer Defendants generally use a three-tier \ndistribution: (1) manufacturers sell guns to \ndistributors, (2) distributors then sell guns to \nretailers, and (3) retailers sell guns to civilian \npurchasers.  This system is not required by law.  \nManufacturers could sell guns through their own \ndealerships (and they sometimes have) or maintain \nin-house distribution departments that sell to \ndealers (some do, for some sales).  But they choose \nnot to. \n(Compl. \u00b6 378). \nIn short, the complaint does not plausibly allege \nthat any of the seven manufacturers are \u201csellers\u201d \nwithin the meaning of the \u201cnegligence per se\u201d \nexception of \u00a7 7903(A)(5)(ii).  At most, Interstate Arms \n(which is alleged to be a wholesaler and distributor of \nfirearms, see Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 40-41) could qualify as a \n\u201cseller\u201d within the meaning of the exception. \nSecond, the exception applies to actions for \nnegligence per se.  Count 4 alleges such a cause of \naction in general terms, without identifying the law of \nany particular jurisdiction.  There is no federal \ncommon law, and the statute itself creates no cause of \naction; therefore, such a cause of action must arise \nunder the law of one or more states.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(C) (\u201cno provision of this chapter shall be \n\n248a \n \nconstrued to create a public or private cause of action \nor remedy\u201d); Phillips v. Lucky Gunner, LLC, 84 \nF. Supp. 3d 1216, 1225 (D. Colo. 2015) (stating that \nany claim that falls within the exception must arise \nunder state law).  Neither the complaint nor plaintiff\u2019s \nopposition to the motion to dismiss identifies what \nstate (or states) that might be.  Because plaintiff filed \nthis action in Massachusetts, and because no party \nhas argued for the application of the law of any other \njurisdiction, the Court will apply Massachusetts law.10 \nUnder Massachusetts law, negligence per se is not \nan independent cause of action.  See Deutsche \nLufthansa AG v. Massachusetts Port Auth., 2018 WL \n3466938, at *2 (D. Mass. July 18, 2018) (\u201cThe Supreme \nJudicial Court has repeatedly reaffirmed the principle \nthat negligence per se does not exist as a cause of \naction independent from a general negligence \naction \u2026.\u201d).  Rather, under Massachusetts law, a \nstatutory violation \u201ccan only be some evidence of the \ndefendant\u2019s negligence.\u201d  Deutsche, 2018 WL 3466938, \nat *2.  Thus, as to any statutory violations that \nplaintiff contends constitutes negligence per se, the \nexception is not applicable under Massachusetts law. \n \n \n10 Interstate Arms, which is the only defendant that is alleged to \nbe a wholesaler or distributor, and therefore a \u201cseller\u201d within the \nmeaning of the exception, is alleged to have \u201cconducted its gun-\nwholesaling business in Massachusetts for more than 40 years.\u201d \n(Compl. \u00b6 41).  The complaint further alleges that it \u201cwas \nincorporated in Massachusetts until 2018,\u201d that it \u201ccontinues to \nconduct its business through its location in Middlesex County,\u201d \nand that it \u201cis at home in Massachusetts and resides in Middlesex \nCounty.\u201d (Id.).  It seems likely, therefore, that Massachusetts law \nwould apply to a claim against it in any event. \n\n249a \n \nFinally, and in any event, even if the Court \nconsiders negligence per se as an abstract principle, \ndisconnected from the law of any state, the exception \nstill would not apply.  Generally, a claim for negligence \nper se applies only where an actor \u201cviolates a statute \nthat is designed to protect against the type of accident \nthe actor\u2019s conduct causes, and if the accident victim is \nwithin the class of persons the statute is designed to \nprotect.\u201d  RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF TORTS \u00a7 14 (2010).  \nHere, the complaint asserts a claim for negligence per \nse alleging that defendants\u2019 conduct violates various \nfederal criminal firearm statutes.  (Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 66-68, \n305, 310, 313).  Congress enacted federal firearms \nlaws to protect against unlawful gun violence in the \nUnited States, and therefore to protect the victims of \nthat violence.  However, Congress did not enact those \nlaws \nto \nprotect \nforeign \ngovernments\u2014and \nin \nparticular, not to protect foreign governments from \nincreases in health care and law-enforcement \nexpenses incurred as a result of acts of violence \nperpetrated against foreign citizens in foreign nations.  \nThe citizens of Mexico might conceivably fall within \nthe class of persons that the statute was intended to \nprotect, but the Mexican government certainly does \nnot.11 \n \n \n11 See, e.g., Town of Plainville v. Almost Home Animal Rescue & \nShelter, Inc., 182 Conn. App. 55, 67 (2018) (concluding, in \nconsidering a claim for negligence per se, that a municipality was \nnot within the class of persons or things that a criminal statute \naddressing animal cruelty was intended to protect, even if the \nmunicipality incurred increased expenses for care provided to \nanimals that were abused or neglected). \n\n250a \n \nAccordingly, and for those reasons, the negligence \nper se exception set forth in \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(ii) does not \napply to Count 4. \nc. \nDesign-Defect Exception \nThe third potentially applicable exception concerns \nclaims for design or manufacturing defects.  Section \n7903(5)(A)(v) of the PLCAA provides as follows: \nan action for death, physical injuries or property \ndamage resulting directly from a defect in design \nor manufacture of the product, when used as \nintended or in a reasonably foreseeable manner, \nexcept that where the discharge of the product \nwas caused by a volitional act that constituted a \ncriminal offense, then such act shall be \nconsidered the sole proximate cause of any \nresulting death, personal injuries or property \ndamage. \nThat section thus contains an exception to an \nexception\u2014that is, if the discharge of a firearm is \ncaused by a volitional criminal act, then the design-\ndefect exception does not apply.12 \nThe complaint alleges in multiple places that the \nharm for which Mexico seeks redress is perpetrated by \ndrug cartels and \u201cother criminals.\u201d  (See, e.g., Compl. \n\u00b6\u00b6 1, 480-505).  That is a sufficient basis from which \nto conclude that the claims are based on volitional acts \nperpetrated by drug cartels and \u201cother criminals\u201d and \n \n \n12 Moreover, the Court notes that the exception does not require \na criminal conviction, but rather a volitional criminal act.  See \nRyan v. Hughes-Ortiz, 81 Mass. App. Ct. 90, 100 (2012) (citing \nAdames v. Sheahan, 233 Ill. 2d 276, 311 (2009)). \n\n251a \n \nthus constitute intervening criminal offenses that \n\u201cshall be the sole proximate cause\u201d of the resulting \ninjuries \nand \nproperty \ndamage. \n \n15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(v). \nAccordingly, the design-defect exception set forth in \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(v) does not apply to Count 3. \n5. Conclusion \nIn summary, the application of the PLCAA under \nthe \ncircumstances \npresented \nhere \nis \nnot \nan \nimpermissible extraterritorial application of United \nStates law; the general prohibition of the statute \napplies to this lawsuit; and none of the statutory \nexceptions apply to Counts 1 through 6 and 9.  Those \nclaims are accordingly barred by the PLCAA, and will \nbe dismissed.  The Court does not reach the issue of \nwhether Counts 7 or 8, which are generally applicable \nconsumer-protection statutes, fall under the predicate \nexception to the PLCAA.  However, for other reasons, \nand as set forth below, both of those claims fail to state \na claim upon which relief can be granted.13 \nC.  State Statutory Claims Against Colt and \nSmith & Wesson \nCounts 7 and 8 allege claims under the Connecticut \nUnfair Trade Practices Act, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42-\n110a, et seq., and the Massachusetts Consumer \nProtection Act, Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, respectively. \n \n \n13 Because all nine counts fail for other reasons, the Court need \nnot address defendants\u2019 remaining arguments, which are based \non lack of proximate cause, absence of a legal duty to plaintiff, \nand failure to state a claim for public nuisance. \n\n252a \n \n1. Count 7: Connecticut Unfair Trade \nPractices Act \nCount 7 alleges a claim against defendant Colt \nunder the CUTPA, Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42-110a, et seq.  \nEven assuming that the predicate exception to the \nPLCAA \napplies, \nMexico \nlacks \nstanding \nunder \nConnecticut law to assert such a claim. \nCUTPA provides that \u201c[n]o person shall engage in \nunfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive \nacts or practices in the conduct of any trade or \ncommerce.\u201d  Conn. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 42-110b(a).  To be \nentitled to relief under CUTPA, a plaintiff must \n\u201cestablish both that the defendant has engaged in a \nprohibited act and that, as a result of this act, the \nplaintiff suffered an injury.\u201d  Sticht v. Wells Fargo \nBank, N.A., 2022 WL 267470, at *3 (D. Conn. Jan. 28, \n2022) (cleaned up).  \u201cThe language \u2018as a result of\u2019 \nrequires a showing that the prohibited act was the \nproximate cause of a harm to the plaintiff.  Mere \u2018but \nfor\u2019 causation is not sufficient to support a CUTPA \nclaim.\u201d  Id.  (cleaned up). \nA plaintiff must also have statutory standing under \nCUTPA in order to assert a claim.  \u201c[S]tanding to bring \na CUTPA claim will lie only when the purportedly \nunfair trade practice is alleged to have directly and \nproximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injuries.\u201d  Tyus v. \nBertera Subaru, 2021 WL 4993058, at *8 (D. Conn. \nOct. 27, 2021) (quoting Soto v. Bushmaster Firearms \nInt\u2019l, LLC, 331 Conn. 53, 94 (2019), cert. denied sub \nnom.  Remington Arms Co., LLC, et al. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019)).  The standing inquiry focuses on the \ndirectness or remoteness of a plaintiff\u2019s claimed \ninjuries.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 258 Conn. \n\n253a \n \n313, 372-73 (2001).  See also Gilbert v. Zablauskas, \n2022 WL 1404219, at *1 (Conn. Super. Ct. Apr. 29, \n2022) (explaining that Connecticut courts \u201chave \napplied \ntraditional \ncommon-law \nprinciples \nof \nremoteness and proximate causation to determine \nwhether a party has standing to bring an action under \nCUTPA\u201d (quoting Soto, 331 Conn. at 93-94)).14 \nIn Ganim, the city and mayor of Bridgeport brought \nclaims under CUTPA against various firearm \nmanufacturers, trade associations, and retail sellers. \n258 Conn. at 316.  The facts in Ganim are clearly \nanalogous to those here.  Like Mexico, the city and \nmayor of Bridgeport claimed that because of \ndefendants\u2019 conduct they had incurred increased \nexpenses for police services, emergency services, \nhealth care, and social services.  Ganim, 258 Conn. at \n345.  In addition, they sought damages for the harm \ncaused to their citizens who were injured or killed by \nfirearms.  Id. \nThe Supreme Court of Connecticut determined that \nthe city and mayor did not have standing to bring such \na claim.  Id. at 373. Specifically, the court concluded \nthat there were too many links in the causal chain \nconnecting the defendants\u2019 conduct to the plaintiffs\u2019 \n \n \n14 A plaintiff may have Article III standing and yet still lack \nstatutory standing under CUTPA.  See Gibson v. Bartlett Dairy, \nInc., 2022 WL 784746, at *9 (E.D.N.Y. Mar. 15, 2022) (finding \nthat plaintiff has Article III standing but that \u201c[p]laintiff does, \nhowever, lack statutory standing\u201d under CUTPA); see also Gale \nv. Chicago Title Ins. Co., 2008 WL 4000477, at *2-3 (D. Conn. Aug. \n21, 2008) (determining, at the motion to dismiss stage, whether \nplaintiff has Article III standing and also whether plaintiff has \n\u201cstanding under CUTPA\u201d). \n\n254a \n \nharm.  See id. at 354 (explaining that the \nmanufacturers lawfully sell handguns to distributors \nor wholesalers who then lawfully sell them to retailers, \nwho then sell to legitimate consumers or \u201cstraw man\u201d \npurchasers, and it is not until then that they could \nenter the illegal market, and even then, a future \nintervening act by an unauthorized user must occur \nthat results in injury to another). \nMoreover, the Ganim court explained that the \nharms that plaintiffs ultimately suffered were \nderivative of the injuries suffered by the \u201cprimary \nvictims\u201d\u2014the persons who have been actually \nassaulted or killed by the misuse of the handguns.  Id. \nat 358-60.  Because of that, the court determined that \nthe city and mayor lacked standing to bring a CUTPA \nclaim because the \u201charms they claim[ed] [were] too \nremote from the defendants\u2019 misconduct\u201d and \u201ctoo \nderivative of the injuries of others.\u201d  Id. at 365, 373. \nThe Supreme Court of Connecticut applied that \nsame standing inquiry to the CUTPA claims asserted \nin Soto v. Bushmaster Firearms Int\u2019l, LLC, 331 Conn. \n53 (2019). Plaintiffs in Soto were administrators of the  \nestates of elementary school students and faculty who \ndied in the school shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary \nSchool.  Id. at 66 n.2.  The court held that those \nplaintiffs, unlike the Ganim plaintiffs, did have \nstanding under CUTPA.  Id. at 100.  The court \nexplained that \u201cin this case, unlike in Ganim, it is the \ndirect victims of gun violence who are challenging the \ndefendants\u2019 conduct [and] no private party is better \nsituated than the plaintiffs to bring the action.\u201d  Id. at \n98-99.  The court noted that \u201cGanim, in fact, provides \nan instructive contrast to the present case\u201d because \nthe harms claimed by the \u201cmunicipal plaintiffs\u201d were \n\n255a \n \ntoo \u201cindirect, remote, and derivative\u201d as compared to \nthose who are more \u201cdirectly harmed by the [gun \nmanufacturers\u2019] alleged misconduct,\u201d such as those \n\u201cwho have been assaulted or killed by the misuse of \nhandguns.\u201d  Id. at 97-98. \nHere, plaintiff is the Mexican government, which \nseeks redress for harms that are derivative of the \ninjuries suffered by its citizens.  And, as in Ganim, \n\u201cthere are numerous steps between the conduct of the \nvarious defendants and the harms suffered by the \nplaintiffs.\u201d  Ganim, 258 Conn. at 355.  Where the \ncausal link is \u201ctoo remote\u201d from defendants\u2019 conduct \nand a plaintiff\u2019s harms are \u201ctoo derivative of the \ninjuries of others\u201d a plaintiff lacks standing to assert a \nclaim under CUTPA.  Ganim, 258 Conn. at 365; Soto, \n331 Conn. at 97-99. \nThe government of Mexico here is in essentially the \nsame position as the city government of Bridgeport \nwas in Ganim, and it therefore lacks standing to assert \na claim under CUTPA. Accordingly, Count 7 will be \ndismissed. \n2. Count 8: Massachusetts Gen. Laws ch. 93A \nCount 8 alleges a violation of Mass. Gen. Laws ch. \n93A, the Massachusetts consumer-protection statute, \nagainst defendant Smith & Wesson.  Specifically, it \nalleges that Smith & Wesson violated Chapter 93A by \nmarketing its guns in ways that \u201cemphasize[] the \nability of civilians to misuse Smith & Wesson assault \nrifles in unlawful, military-style attacks.\u201d  (Compl. \u00b6 \n342). \na. \nDeceptive Acts \nChapter \n93A \nprohibits \nunfair \nmethods \nof \ncompetition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices. \n\n256a \n \nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 11. A violation of \nChapter 93A requires that the conduct in question fall \nwithin \u201c \u2018the penumbra of some common-law, \nstatutory, or other established concept of unfairness\u2019 \nor \nbe \n\u2018immoral, \nunethical, \noppressive \nor \nunscrupulous.\u2019\u201d  Commercial Union Ins. Co. v. Seven \nProvinces Ins. Co., 217 F.3d 33, 40 (1st Cir. 2000) \n(quoting Cambridge Plating Co. v. Napco, Inc., 85 F.3d \n752, 769 (1st Cir. 1996)) (cleaned up). \n\u201cTo plausibly state a Chapter 93A claim premised \non a deceptive act, the plaintiff must allege \u2018(1) a \ndeceptive act or practice on the part of the seller; (2) \nan injury or loss suffered by the consumer; and (3) a \ncausal connection between the seller\u2019s deceptive act or \npractice and the consumer\u2019s injury.\u2019\u201d  Tomasella v. \nNestl\u00e9 USA, Inc., 962 F.3d 60, 71 (1st Cir. 2020) \n(quoting Casavant v. Norwegian Cruise Line, Ltd., 76 \nMass. App. Ct. 73, 76 (2009)).  \u201c[A]n advertisement is \ndeceptive when it has the capacity to mislead \nconsumers, \nacting \nreasonably \nunder \nthe \ncircumstances, to act differently from the way they \notherwise would have acted (i.e., to entice a reasonable \nconsumer to purchase the product).\u201d Aspinall v. Philip \nMorris Companies, Inc., 442 Mass. 381, 396 (2004).  \n\u201cThe spectrum of liability for deceptive acts or \npractices spans from affirmative misrepresentations \nto certain kinds of nondisclosures, such as advertising \n[that] may consist of a half truth, or even may be true \nas a literal matter, but still create[s] an over-all \nmisleading impression through failure to disclose \nmaterial information.\u201d  Tomasella, 962 F.3d at 71 \n(cleaned up). \nHere, the complaint alleges that the marketing \ncampaign of Smith & Wesson is false and misleading \n\n257a \n \nbecause it \u201cassociates its \u2018civilian\u2019 products with the \nU.S. \nmilitary \nand \nlaw \nenforcement\u201d \nand \nits \nadvertisements \u201crepeatedly emphasize its weapons\u2019 \nability to function in combat-like scenarios and quickly \ndispatch a large number of perceived enemies with a \ntorrent of fire.\u201d (Compl. \u00b6 324).1515 Chapter 93A, \nhowever, prohibits statements that are actually false \nor misleading.  See Aspinall, 442 Mass. at 396.  But \nthe complaint alleges that the violation by Smith & \nWesson is that its firearms do exactly what they are \nadvertised to do. \nThe complaint does not allege that the firearm \ncannot in fact \u201cquickly dispatch\u201d bullets.  Rather, it \nalleges that the violation by Smith & Wesson is that \nthe firearm functions exactly as it is advertised to, and \nin doing so it has caused harm in Mexico.  Such \nadvertising is perhaps distasteful, but it is not false, \nmisleading, or deceptive within the meaning of the \nstatute. \nb. \nUnfair Acts \nThe complaint further alleges that the conduct of \nSmith & Wesson is \u201cunfair\u201d within the meaning of \nChapter 93A.  The challenged advertisements may be \n\u201cunfair\u201d if they \u201c1) [are] within the penumbra of some \ncommon law, statutory or other established concept of \n \n \n15 The complaint specifically includes two Smith & Wesson \nadvertisements. (Compl. \u00b6 324).  One of the advertisements \nstates, \u201c[b]urn through all the ammunition you want with the \nnew M&P 15-22.\u201d (Id.).  The other advertisement contains an \nimage of someone who appears to be in military or law \nenforcement gear using a sniper rifle.  (Id.) \n \n\n258a \n \nunfairness, 2) [are] immoral, unethical, oppressive or \nunscrupulous and 3) cause[ ] substantial injury to \nconsumers, competitors or other business entities.\u201d \nTomasella, 962 F.3d at 79 (citations omitted).  While \n\u201cMassachusetts leaves the determination of what \nconstitutes an unfair trade practice to the finder of \nfact,\u201d that determination is \u201csubject to the court\u2019s \nperformance of a legal gate-keeping function.\u201d Mass. \nEye & Ear Infirmary v. QLT Phototherapeutics, Inc., \n552 F.3d 47, 69 (1st Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \nThe crux of Mexico\u2019s claim is that Smith & Wesson \nengaged in unfair conduct by marketing their firearms \nin such a way that \u201cemphasized the ability of civilians \nto use Smith & Wesson assault rifles in unlawful, \nmilitary-style attacks.\u201d  (Compl. \u00b6 550). Specifically, \nthe complaint alleges that by placing \u201cM&P\u201d on their \nads, which signifies \u201cMilitary and Police,\u201d the \nadvertisements \u201cattract persons and organizations \nthat intend[] to use Smith & Wesson\u2019s products to \nbattle against the military and police\u201d and \u201ccarry out \nunlawful military-style combat missions.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 551-\n52). \nMexico has, however, failed to identify any common-\nlaw or statutory authority that the advertisements \nviolate.  Again, while the defendant\u2019s conduct may be \ndistasteful, nothing about the advertisement is \nunlawful or \u201cimmoral, unethical, oppressive or \nunscrupulous.\u201d See Tomasella, 962 F.3d at 80-81.  The \npublic is fully aware that the police and military use \nfirearms.  An image depicting an officer\u2019s lawful use of \na firearm does not suggest to the reasonable consumer \nthat they should engage in criminal, \u201ccombat-like\u201d \nconduct.  And the Court is unwilling to hold that the \nadvertising of lawful conduct to sell a lawful product, \n\n259a \n \nwithout more, constitutes an \u201cunfair\u201d act.  See, e.g., \nMcCarthy v. Sturm, Ruger & Co., 916 F. Supp. 366, \n369 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 5, 1996), aff\u2019d sub nom.  McCarthy \nv. Olin Corp., 119 F.3d 148 (2d Cir. 1997) (refusing to \nfind advertisements to be negligent because they \nhighlighted \nthe \nammunition\u2019s \n\u201cdestructive \ncapabilities\u201d which could make it \u201cattractive to \ncriminals\u201d because the advertisements were not in any \nway false or misleading). \nAccordingly, the complaint fails to allege that the \nmarketing practices of Smith & Wesson violate any \ncommon-law, statutory, or other established concept of \nunfairness. \nc. \nOccurring \nPrimarily \nand \nSubstantially within the Commonwealth \nChapter 93A provides that an action under \u00a7 11 can \nonly be brought if \u201cthe actions and transactions \nconstituting the alleged unfair method of competition \nor the unfair or deceptive act or practice occurred \nprimarily \nand \nsubstantially \nwithin \nthe \ncommonwealth.\u201d  Mass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A, \u00a7 11. \nIn considering whether the unfair or deceptive act \n\u201coccurred primarily and substantially within the \ncommonwealth,\u201d Massachusetts courts consider three \nfactors: (1) \u201cwhere the defendant committed the \ndeception,\u201d (2) \u201cwhere the plaintiff was deceived and \nacted upon the deception,\u201d and (3) \u201cthe situs of \nplaintiff\u2019s losses due to the deception.\u201d  Garshman Co. \nv. General Elec. Co., 176 F.3d 1, 6-7 (1st Cir. 1999) \n(citing Clinton Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Corson Grp., Inc., 907 \nF.2d 1260, 1265-66 (1st Cir. 1990)).  However, \n\u201c[w]hether the \u2018actions and transactions [constituting \nthe sec. 11 claim] occurred primarily and substantially \n\n260a \n \nwithin the commonwealth\u2019 is not a determination that \ncan be reduced to any precise formula.\u201d  Stoneridge \nControl Devices, Inc. v. Teleflex, Inc., 2004 WL 389105, \nat *7 (Mass. Super. Feb. 17, 2004).  Rather, it is a \n\u201cpragmatic, functional analysis,\u201d with the \u201cfirst factor \n[being] the least weighty of the three factors.\u201d  Roche \nv. Royal Bank of Canada, 109 F.3d 820, 827, 829 (1st \nCir. 1997); see also Kuwaiti Danish Comput. Co. v. \nDigital Equip. Corp., 438 Mass. 459, 473 (2003) \n(instructing courts to look to \u201cwhether the center of \ngravity of the circumstances that give rise to the claim \nis \nprimarily \nand \nsubstantially \nwithin \nthe \nCommonwealth\u201d). \nFor example, in Bushkin Associates, Inc. v. \nRaytheon Co., a New York corporation brought a \nChapter \n93A \nclaim \nagainst \nRaytheon, \na \nMassachusetts corporation.  393 Mass. 622 (1985).  \nThe plaintiff based his Chapter 93A claim on allegedly \nfalse statements that were made in a telephone \nconversation by a Raytheon officer.  Bushkin, 393 \nMass. at 672.  The plaintiff contended that those \nstatements caused it to disclose sensitive business \ninformation and suffer economic losses.  Id.  The \nSupreme Judicial Court held that Chapter 93A was \ninapplicable because the majority of the conduct \noccurred outside of Massachusetts.  Id.  Specifically, \nthe SJC explained that although the statements were \n\u201cmade in Massachusetts,\u201d they were \u201creceived and \nacted on in New York,\u201d and \u201c[a]ny loss was incurred in \nNew York.\u201d  Id. \nThe First Circuit followed the reasoning of Bushkin \nin Compagnie De Reassurance D\u2019Ile de France v. New \nEngland Reinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d 56 (1st Cir. 1995).  \nThere, the court explained that, as in Bushkin, \u201cnon-\n\n261a \n \nMassachusetts residents [were] attempting to recover \nfor the allegedly unfair trade practices\u201d of a \nMassachusetts \ncorporation. \n \nNew \nEngland \nReinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d at 90.  Although the \nallegedly deceptive acts originated in Massachusetts, \nthe deceptive information was \u201cintended to be, and \nwas, circulated abroad, and plaintiffs received and \nacted upon it there.\u201d  Id.  And the \u201csitus of plaintiffs\u2019 \nlosses was also in Europe.\u201d  Id.  The court determined \nthat because Chapter 93A is designed to \u201cprotect \nagainst in-state frauds\u201d and the bulk of defendants\u2019 \nconduct occurred elsewhere, their \u201cfraudulent conduct \ndid not occur primarily and substantially in \nMassachusetts.\u201d  Id. \nHere, a foreign nation is attempting to recover for \nthe allegedly unfair trade practices of a Massachusetts \ncorporation.  Even assuming that the advertisements \nand marketing originated in Massachusetts, the \ncomplaint clearly suggests that its advertisements \nand marketing practices were \u201cintended to be [] \ncirculated abroad\u201d and were \u201creceived and acted upon \n[] there.\u201d  New England Reinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d at \n90.  (See also Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 551-52 (explaining that Smith \n& Wesson knew its marketing practices would attract \npersons and organizations to use their products \nagainst the military and police, \u201cincluding the military \nand police in Mexico\u201d and would be \u201cappealing \nespecially to criminals like the cartels\u201d)); (id. \u00b6 384 \n(\u201cDefendants have affirmatively and deliberately \nchosen to maintain their supply chain to cartels . . .  \nTheir supply of guns to the criminal market in Mexico \nis a feature, not a bug.\u201d)).  Furthermore, the situs of \nplaintiff\u2019s losses is entirely in Mexico.  (See Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 \n\n262a \n \n450-64); New England Reinsurance Corp., 57 F.3d at \n90. \nIn short, this matter did not occur primarily and \nsubstantially in the Commonwealth.  For that reason, \nChapter 93A does not apply. \nAccordingly, Count 8 fails to state a claim under \nMass. Gen. Laws ch. 93A. \nIV. \nConclusion \nFor the foregoing reasons: \nThe motion of all defendants to dismiss for lack of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction pursuant to Fed. R. Civ.

The government of \nMexico brings this lawsuit against seven U.S. gun \nmanufacturers and one gun distributor.1  The district \ncourt dismissed Mexico\u2019s complaint because it \nconcluded that Mexico\u2019s common law claims were \nbarred by the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms \nAct (PLCAA).  That act prohibits the bringing of \ncertain types of lawsuits against manufacturers and \nsellers of firearms in federal and state courts.  We \nagree that the PLCAA\u2019s limitations on the types of \nlawsuits that may be maintained in the United States \napply to lawsuits initiated by foreign governments for \nharm suffered outside the United States.  However, we \nalso hold that Mexico\u2019s complaint plausibly alleges a \ntype of claim that is statutorily exempt from the \nPLCAA\u2019s general prohibition.  We therefore reverse \nthe district court\u2019s holding that the PLCAA bars \nMexico\u2019s common law claims, and we remand for \nfurther proceedings.  Our reasoning follows. \nI. \n\u201cBecause this appeal flows from the district court\u2019s \norder granting a motion to dismiss, we draw the \nrelevant facts from the complaint, accepting all well-\npleaded factual allegations as true.\u201d  Foisie v. \n \n \n1 Defendants are Smith & Wesson Brands, Inc.; Barrett Firearms \nManufacturing, Inc.; Beretta U.S.A. Corp.; Century International \nArms, Inc.; Colt\u2019s Manufacturing Company, LLC; Glock, Inc.; and \nSturm, Ruger & Co., Inc. and Witmer Public Safety Group, Inc., \ndoing business as Interstate Arms. Mexico also initially named \ntwo foreign holding companies as defendants, but later \nvoluntarily dismissed its claims against those companies. \n\n271a \n \nWorcester Polytechnic Inst., 967 F.3d 27, 32 (1st Cir. \n2020). \nMexico has strict gun laws that make it \u201cvirtually \nimpossible\u201d for criminals to obtain firearms legally \nsourced in the country.  It has one gun store in the \nentire nation and issues fewer than fifty gun permits \na year.  Despite these strong domestic regulations, \nMexico has the third-most gun-related deaths in the \nworld.  The number of gun-related homicides in \nMexico grew from fewer than 2,500 in 2003 to \napproximately 23,000 in 2019.  The percentage of \nhomicides committed with a gun similarly rose from \nfifteen percent in 1997 to sixty-nine percent in 2021. \nThe increase in gun violence in Mexico correlates \nwith the increase of gun production in the United \nStates, beginning with the end of the United States\u2019 \nassault-weapon ban in 2004.2  The complaint details a \nsteady and growing stream of illegal gun trafficking \nfrom the United States into Mexico, motivated in large \npart by the demand of the Mexican drug cartels for \nmilitary-style weapons.  For example, Mexico claims \nthat between seventy and ninety percent of the guns \nrecovered at crime scenes in Mexico were trafficked \ninto the country from the United States. \nMexico\u2019s government has borne a variety of harms \nas a result of this gun-violence epidemic, including but \nnot limited to: costs of additional medical, mental-\nhealth, and other services for victims and their \nfamilies; costs of increased law enforcement, including \n \n \n2 Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, Pub. \nL. No. 103-222, 108 Stat. 1796, 1996-1998(expired 2004). \n\n272a \n \nspecialized training for military and police; costs of the \nincreased burden on Mexico\u2019s judicial system; \ndiminished property values; and decreased revenues \nfrom business investment and economic activity. \nIn an attempt to redress these harms, Mexico \nbrought this lawsuit in federal district court in \nMassachusetts, seeking both damages and injunctive \nrelief.  Combined, defendants produce more than \nsixty-eight percent of the U.S. guns trafficked into \nMexico, which comes out to between 342,000 and \n597,000 guns each year.  Mexico alleges that \ndefendants know that their guns are trafficked into \nMexico and make deliberate design, marketing, and \ndistribution choices to retain and grow that illegal \nmarket and the substantial profits that it produces. \nMexico alleges that one way defendants deliberately \nfacilitate gun trafficking into Mexico is by designing \ntheir guns as military-style weapons, knowing that \nsuch weapons are particularly sought after by the drug \ncartels in Mexico.  For instance, defendants make \nassault rifles with high rates of fire, low recoil, and the \ncapacity to hold large amounts of ammunition.  The \nguns can be easily converted into fully automatic \nweapons.  Some of defendants\u2019 guns are \u201cweapons of \nwar,\u201d such as the \u201carmor-penetrating\u201d Barrett .50 \ncaliber sniper rifle, which can be (and has been) used \nto take down aircrafts and armored vehicles.  Such \nweapons are especially attractive to Mexican drug \ncartels, which frequently engage in military-style \ncombat against Mexican military and police personnel.  \nDefendants also choose to forgo safety features (such \nas allowing only recognized users to fire the weapon) \nthat might decrease the guns\u2019 attractiveness to \nwrongdoers without diminishing their utility for law-\n\n273a \n \nabiding citizens.  Similarly, Mexico alleges that \ndefendants intentionally design their guns to have \neasily removable serial numbers, making them much \nmore attractive to criminals both in the United States \nand abroad. \nMexico alleges that defendants not only design their \nguns as military-grade weapons; they also market \nthem as such.  Defendants\u2019 marketing materials depict \ntheir weapons in use by or in proximity to military and \nlaw \nenforcement \npersonnel \nand \ncontain \nother \nreferences \nto \nmilitary \nand \nlaw \nenforcement.  \nAdvertisements include statements like \u201cauthentic \nMilitary & Police . . . design,\u201d \u201cbattle proven,\u201d and \n\u201ctransforms the military platform to fit civilian \nprecision shooters.\u201d  Mexico alleges that defendants \nengage in these marketing techniques knowing that \nthey are disproportionately likely to attract groups \nharboring militaristic ambitions, like the Mexican \ncartels. \nMexico also alleges that defendants\u2019 distribution \nsystem facilitates illegal trafficking to Mexico.  \nDefendants generally use a three-tier distribution \nsystem.  Manufacturers (most defendants) sell to \ndistributors; distributors (one defendant) sell to \ndealers; and dealers sell to consumers.  Guns flow from \nthis distribution system into Mexico in multiple ways.  \nThe most common method of trafficking is through \n\u201cstraw sales\u201d\u2014sales made to a buyer purchasing on \nbehalf of somebody else who is not lawfully permitted \nto buy a gun.  Often, straw sales occur in \ncircumstances that clearly indicate to the dealer that \nthe transaction is a straw sale and could be prevented \nif defendants required their dealers to be well-trained \nand follow the law. \n\n274a \n \nOther types of transactions that pose a particularly \nhigh risk of trafficking include sales of multiple guns \nto the same buyer over a limited period of time; sales \nby \u201ckitchen-table\u201d dealers who deal online or in \nlocations that make it easy to avoid regulations; and \nsales by non-licensed sellers at gun shows without \nbackground checks.  In addition, many guns are stolen \nor simply \u201clost\u201d from firearm companies\u2019 inventory, \nand frequently thereafter end up in Mexico.  According \nto the complaint, some of these \u201clost\u201d guns are actually \nsold off the books, with dealers choosing not to \nimplement anti-theft measures to allow them to \nfalsely claim the guns were stolen. \nMexico alleges that defendants are aware of these \npractices and the resulting trafficking of guns into \nMexico, yet deliberately maintain a distribution \nsystem that facilitates illegal sales, resisting calls for \nreform by the U.S. government and prominent gun \nindustry insiders, among others.  Not only that, but \ndefendants are aware that specific distributor and \ndealer networks are disproportionately associated \nwith gun trafficking into Mexico.  Mexico alleges that \ndefendants are on notice as to which dealers are \nresponsible for the lion\u2019s share of gun trafficking.  \nMexico points to data collected by the U.S. Bureau of \nAlcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) and \na 2010 news article naming twelve dealers that sold \nthe most guns recovered in Mexico.  Despite having \naccess to this information, defendants continue \nsupplying guns to those same dealers. \nImportantly, according to the complaint, the aspects \nof defendants\u2019 businesses that facilitate trafficking are \nnot unfortunate and unintended byproducts of a \nlawful enterprise.  Rather, they are the result of \n\n275a \n \ndefendants\u2019 affirmative and deliberate efforts to create \nand maintain an illegal market for their weapons in \nMexico.  Says Mexico, supplying guns to the illegal \nmarket in Mexico is \u201ca feature, not a bug,\u201d of \ndefendants\u2019 businesses.  And the motivation behind \nthis feature is money.  Mexico estimates that \ndefendants collectively receive over $170 million a \nyear from sales of guns trafficked into Mexico.  As a \nresult of the profit potential of the Mexican market, \ngun dealers along the border have proliferated while \nelsewhere in the nation their numbers have decreased.  \nGun dealers in border states now sell twice as many \nguns as dealers in other parts of the country.  As stated \nsuccinctly by Mexico, defendants \u201care not accidental or \nunintentional players in this tragedy; they are \ndeliberate and willing participants, reaping profits \nfrom the criminal market they knowingly supply\u2014\nheedless of the shattering consequences to [Mexico] \nand its citizens.\u201d \nII. \nDefendants filed multiple motions to dismiss \nMexico\u2019s complaint.  All defendants moved to dismiss \nfor lack of Article III standing under Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure 12(b)(1) and for failure to state a claim \nunder Rule 12(b)(6).  Some defendants also moved to \ndismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction under Rule \n12(b)(2).  The district court held that Mexico had \nArticle III standing, but it dismissed two counts for \nfailure to state a claim on which relief could be \ngranted.3  It also found that litigation of the remaining \n \n \n3 The two counts were state statutory claims under the \nConnecticut Unfair Trade Practices Act and the Massachusetts \n\n276a \n \ncounts was barred by the PLCAA, which prohibits the \nfiling of a \u201cqualified civil liability action\u201d\u2014defined as \n\u201ca \ncivil \naction \nor \nproceeding . . . \nagainst \na \nmanufacturer or seller of a qualified product . . . for \ndamages . . . resulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty\u201d\u2014in \u201cany Federal or State court.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7902(a), 7903(5)(A).  It therefore dismissed the \ncomplaint without addressing the motions to dismiss \nfor lack of personal jurisdiction. Mexico timely \nappealed, raising multiple challenges to the district \ncourt\u2019s application of the PLCAA to this lawsuit. \nIII. \nMexico first contends that the PLCAA does not \napply to lawsuits brought by foreign governments for \nharm suffered outside the United States.  It raises \nthree arguments in support of this contention:  first, \nthat applying the PLCAA to such a lawsuit is an \nimpermissible extraterritorial application of the \nstatute; second, that the PLCAA\u2019s substantive terms \nmust be interpreted to have only domestic scope; and \nthird, that principles of international comity support \nMexico\u2019s reading of the statute.  We address these \narguments \nin \nturn, \nfinding \nthem \nultimately \nunavailing. \nA. \n\u201cCourts presume that federal statutes \u2018apply only \nwithin the territorial jurisdiction of the United \nStates.\u2019\u201d WesternGeco LLC v. ION Geophysical Corp., \n \n \nConsumer Protection Act, respectively. Mexico does not, on \nappeal, challenge the dismissal of those counts. \n\n277a \n \n138 S. Ct. 2129, 2136 (2018) (quoting Foley Bros. v. \nFilardo, 336 U.S. 281, 285 (1949)).  This rule, \ncommonly \ncalled \nthe \npresumption \nagainst \nextraterritoriality, is a \u201ccanon of construction\u201d that \nguides \nour \ninterpretation \nof \nfederal \nstatutes.  \nYegiazaryan v. Smagin, 599 U.S. 533, 541 (2023) \n(quoting Morrison v. Nat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. \n247, 255 (2010)).  Under the presumption, we construe \nfederal laws \u201cto have only domestic application\u201d unless \nwe find \u201cclearly expressed congressional intent to the \ncontrary.\u201d  Id. (quoting RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European \nCmty., 579 U.S. 325, 335 (2016)).  The presumption \n\u201creflects concerns of international comity insofar as it \n\u2018serves to protect against unintended clashes between \nour laws and those of other nations which could result \nin international discord.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Kiobel v. Royal \nDutch Petroleum Co., 569 U.S. 108, 115 (2013)).  And \nit also embodies \u201cthe commonsense notion that \nCongress generally legislates with domestic concerns \nin mind.\u201d  Id. (quoting Smith v. United States, 507 U.S. \n197, 204 n.5 (1993)). \nA two-step framework applies to questions of \nextraterritoriality.  RJR Nabisco, 579 U.S. at 337.  \u201cAt \nthe first step, we ask whether the presumption against \nextraterritoriality \nhas \nbeen \nrebutted\u2014that \nis, \nwhether the statute gives a clear, affirmative \nindication that it applies extraterritorially.\u201d  Id.  If so, \nthen an extraterritorial application of the statute is \npermissible.  Id.  If not, we proceed to the second step \nand ask if the statute\u2019s application in the case at hand \nis truly extraterritorial or if, instead, \u201cthe case \ninvolves a domestic application of the statute.\u201d  Id. \nThe district court concluded that the PLCAA\u2019s \nprohibition of lawsuits by \u201cany governmental entity\u201d \n\n278a \n \nand various references to \u201cforeign commerce\u201d fell short \nof a clear expression of congressional intent that the \nstatute applies extraterritorially.  It therefore held \nthat the presumption against extraterritoriality had \nnot been overcome at step one.  Defendants do not \nobject to this holding on appeal.  Nor do we see any \nneed to question it, given that we agree with the \ndistrict court\u2019s conclusion at step two: that the \napplication of the PLCAA in this case is permissibly \ndomestic, not impermissibly extraterritorial. \nDetermining whether an application of a statute is \ndomestic or extraterritorial requires us to  \nlook[] to the statute\u2019s \u201cfocus.\u201d  If the conduct \nrelevant to the statute\u2019s focus occurred in the \nUnited States, then the case involves a \npermissible domestic application even if other \nconduct occurred abroad; but if the conduct \nrelevant to the focus occurred in a foreign \ncountry, then the case involves an impermissible \nextraterritorial application regardless of any \nother conduct that occurred in U.S. territory.   \nId.  \u201cThe ultimate question regarding permissible \ndomestic application turns on the location of the \nconduct relevant to the focus.\u201d  Abitron Austria GmbH \nv. Hetronic Int\u2019l, Inc., 600 U.S. 412, 422 (2023).  We \ntherefore first ascertain the focus of the PLCAA and \nthen determine where the conduct relevant to that \nfocus occurred. \n\u201cThe focus of a statute is the object of its solicitude, \nwhich can include the conduct it seeks to regulate, as \nwell as the parties and interests it seeks to protect or \nvindicate.\u201d  Id. at 418 (internal quotation marks \nomitted) (quoting WesternGeco, 138 S. Ct. at 2136).  \n\n279a \n \nThe \u201cconduct\u201d that the PLCAA \u201cseeks to regulate\u201d is \nthe filing and adjudication of certain lawsuits in \ndomestic courts.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(b)(1), (4) (stated \npurposes include \u201cprohibit[ing] causes of action\u201d and \n\u201cprevent[ing] the use of such lawsuits to impose \nunreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign \ncommerce\u201d).  Its operative provision states that \u201c[a] \nqualified civil liability action may not be brought in \nany Federal or State court,\u201d and that any such pending \nactions \u201cshall be immediately dismissed by the court.\u201d  \nId. \u00a7 7902.  That is the only \u201cconduct\u201d that the statute \n\u201cregulate[s].\u201d \nThe PLCAA is also explicit about \u201cthe parties and \ninterests it seeks to protect.\u201d  Its stated \u201cpurposes\u201d are, \namong other things, \u201c[t]o prohibit causes of action \nagainst manufacturers, distributors, dealers, and \nimporters of firearms . . . for the harm solely caused by \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products,\u201d \nand \u201c[t]o preserve a citizen\u2019s access to a supply of \nfirearms and ammunition for all lawful purposes.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 7901(b)(1), (2); see also id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5) - (8) (finding \nthat the firearm industry should not be liable for third \nparties\u2019 unlawful acts and that lawsuits seeking to \nimpose such liability abuse the legal system); id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(1) - (2) (invoking the Second Amendment).  \nIn short, it seeks to protect (1) U.S. firearm companies \nand their interests in manufacturing, marketing, and \nselling guns to the public; and (2) U.S. citizens and \ntheir interests in having access to guns. \nWe therefore agree with the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that the PLCAA\u2019s focus is \u201cregulat[ing] the \ntypes of claims that can be asserted against firearm \nmanufacturers and sellers . . . to protect the interests \nof the United States firearms industry and the rights \n\n280a \n \nof gun owners.\u201d  Estados Unidos Mexicanos v. Smith \n& Wesson Brands, Inc., 633 F. Supp. 3d 425, 444 (D. \nMass. 2022). \nMexico resists this conclusion by proposing a \ndifferent focus of the PLCAA:  \u201cgun misuse and the \nresulting injury.\u201d  It argues that the district court \nerred by looking only at the PLCAA\u2019s operative \nprovision\u2014which prohibits \u201cqualified civil liability \naction[s],\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902\u2014and not its definitions \nsection\u2014which defines such actions as \u201ccivil action[s] \nor proceeding[s] or . . . administrative proceeding[s]\u201d \nfor harm \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). \nWe agree that statutory provisions do not exist \u201cin a \nvacuum\u201d and \u201cmust be assessed in concert with . . . \nother provisions.\u201d  WesternGeco, 138 S. Ct. at 2137.  In \nWesternGeco, for example, the Supreme Court \ndetermined that the focus of a statute providing a \nremedy \nfor \npatent \ninfringement \nwas \n\u201cthe \ninfringement.\u201d  Id. (quoting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 284).  But \nbecause the statute identified several types of \ninfringement, the Court looked to a separate provision \nto determine what \u201cthe infringement\u201d was in the case \nat hand.  Id.  That provision \u201cprovide[d] that a \ncompany \u2018shall be liable as an infringer\u2019 if it \u2018supplies\u2019 \ncertain components of a patented invention \u2018in or from \nthe United States\u2019 with the intent that they \u2018will be \ncombined outside of the United States in a manner \nthat would infringe the patent if such combination \noccurred within the United States.\u2019\u201d Id. at 2137-38 \n(quoting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(f)(2)).  From this definition, \nthe Court gleaned that the regulated conduct\u2014that is, \n\u201cthe \ninfringement\u201d\u2014was \n\u201cthe \ndomestic \nact \nof \n\n281a \n \n\u2018suppl[ying] in or from the United States.\u2019\u201d Id. at 2138 \n(alteration in original) (quoting 35 U.S.C.  \u00a7 271(f)(2)).  \nSo, because it was that domestic act \u201cthat infringed \n[the] patents,\u201d the \u201cconduct . . . relevant to [the] focus \nclearly occurred in the United States.\u201d  Id. \nMexico contends that we should follow what it sees \nas a similar approach:  treat the command of section \n7902(a) (precluding \u201cqualified civil liability action[s]\u201d \nin any U.S. court) as insufficient to determine the \nfocus; look at the definition of \u201cqualified civil liability \naction\u201d in section 7903(5)(A) (as meaning suits against \ndefendants for damages resulting from unlawful use of \ncertain firearms); and then declare that the statute\u2019s \nfocus is actually on certain elements of that definition \n(damages and misuse). \nBut while WesternGeco makes clear that it is \nsometimes necessary to turn to a secondary provision \nto help give meaning to the statute\u2019s focus, it does not \nstand for the proposition that whenever a term is \ndefined in a separate provision, all parts of that \ndefinition become the focus of the statute.  In \nWesternGeco, the portion of the secondary provision on \nwhich \nthe \nCourt \nconcentrated \nwas \nthe \nvery \n\u201cinfringement\u201d that was the focus of the primary \nprovision.  Other parts of the definition\u2014such as the \nrequirement that the components be \u201cespecially made \nor especially adapted for use in the invention,\u201d id. at \n2135 (quoting 35 U.S.C. \u00a7 271(f)(2))\u2014were not the \nstatute\u2019s focus because they did not constitute the act \nof infringement, which was the focus of the primary \nprovision.  Here, \u201cqualified civil liability action[s]\u201d are \nthe focus and we look to section 7903(5)(A) simply to \ndefine the scope of that term, not to find in the \nelements of that definition some other focus. \n\n282a \n \nTo drive this point home, imagine a law stating that \n\u201ca qualified shirt may not be worn in any Federal or \nState court\u201d and defining \u201cqualified shirt\u201d as \u201ca \ncollarless shirt made from cotton.\u201d  Under Mexico\u2019s \nlogic, a focus of that statute would be the cotton \nindustry.  And therefore the law would not prohibit the \nwearing of collarless shirts made from cotton grown \noutside the United States.  But no reasonable person \nwould think that the statute would not apply with \nequal force regardless of the origin of the cotton in a \ncourt attendee\u2019s shirt.  So too, here; Mexico cannot \nshift the focus of the PLCAA from \u201cqualified civil \nliability action[s]\u201d to something else merely because \nthat term\u2014which Mexico concedes is the focus of the \nPLCAA\u2019s operative provision\u2014is defined in a separate \nprovision. \nAt a more fundamental level, Mexico\u2019s argument \nthat the statute\u2019s focus is \u201cgun misuse and the \nresulting injury\u201d has too little connection to the \nPLCAA\u2019s purpose or effect.  While curtailing gun \nmisuse is a laudable goal (and one that may be the \nfocus of other statutes), it is not the goal of the PLCAA.  \nThat statute\u2019s purpose, and effect, is to insulate U.S. \ngun industry actors from certain types of lawsuits in \ndomestic courts.  And that conduct is inherently \ndomestic. \nMexico also argues that to say that the focus of the \nPLCAA is on regulating the types of claims that can be \nbrought against U.S. gun industry actors \u201cis so broad \nas to be tautological\u201d because \u201c[a]ll statutes \u2018regulate \nthe type\u2019 of activity to which they are directed, and all \nsuch \u2018regulat[ion]\u2019 by definition occurs in the United \nStates\u2014in the U.S. Courts that apply the statutes.\u201d  \nBut this argument confuses the effect of a regulation \n\n283a \n \nwith its focus; not all statutes are directed toward \nregulating lawsuits in the way the PLCAA is.  For \nexample, the statute in WesternGeco in some sense \n\u201cregulated\u201d the conduct of U.S. courts by creating a \ncause of action that those courts can adjudicate.  But \nthe focus of that statute was clearly on regulating \npatent infringement, e.g., infringement said to occur \nby shipping components overseas for assembly.  138 S. \nCt. at 2137-38.  Here, by contrast, the PLCAA seeks to \nregulate the lawsuits themselves. \nHaving thus determined the PLCAA\u2019s focus, we find \nit evident that the conduct relevant to that focus \noccurs domestically.  Both the conduct that the statute \nseeks to regulate\u2014the filing and adjudication of \nlawsuits\u2014as well as the conduct that it seeks to \nprotect\u2014defendants\u2019 manufacturing, marketing, and \nselling of guns\u2014take place entirely within the United \nStates. \nMexico argues finally, and mostly in passing, that \ndefendants \u201cengage in conduct in Mexico when they \naid and abet trafficking guns into Mexico.\u201d  The \nSupreme Court has held that \u201csuppl[ying] in or from \nthe United States\u201d components of a patented invention \nwith the intent that they be assembled abroad is a \n\u201cdomestic act.\u201d  Id. (alteration in original).  Mexico \ndevelops no reason why selling guns in the United \nStates with the intent that they be resold to persons in \nMexico should not similarly be considered a domestic \nact. \nFor all these reasons, the presumption against \nextraterritoriality does not bar application of the \nPLCAA to this case. \n\n284a \n \nB. \nWe now turn to Mexico\u2019s argument that the PLCAA \nnonetheless by its terms does not apply to a lawsuit \nbrought by a foreign government based on damages \noccurring outside the United States caused by misuse \noutside the United States.  Recall that the PLCAA \nprohibits lawsuits \u201cbrought by any person\u201d (including \n\u201cany governmental entity\u201d) \u201cagainst a manufacturer or \nseller of a [firearm] . . . for damages . . . or other relief, \nresulting from the criminal or unlawful misuse of a \n[firearm] by the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(3), (5)(A).  Mexico argues that (1) \u201ccriminal or \nunlawful misuse\u201d means only misuse that occurs in \nthe United States and is unlawful under U.S. law; (2) \n\u201cdamages . . . or other relief\u201d covers only injury \nincurred in the United States; and (3) \u201cany \ngovernmental entity\u201d encompasses only domestic \ngovernmental entities. \nThe Supreme Court recently rejected a similar \ncontention in Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. United \nStates, which involved a section of the U.S. Criminal \nCode granting federal district courts exclusive \njurisdiction over \u201call offenses against the laws of the \nUnited States.\u201d  598 U.S. 264, 268-69 (2023) (quoting \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3231).  The defendant, a bank owned by \nthe Turkish government, argued that because the \nstatute \u201crefers generically to \u2018all\u2019 federal criminal \noffenses without specifically mentioning foreign states \nor their instrumentalities, . . . foreign states and their \ninstrumentalities do not fall within [the statute\u2019s] \nscope.\u201d  Id. at 269.  The Court observed that the \u201ctext \nas written\u201d \u201cplainly encompasses\u201d the defendant\u2019s \noffenses.  Id.  It therefore \u201cdecline[d] to graft an \natextual \nlimitation \nonto \n[the \nstatute\u2019s] \nbroad \n\n285a \n \njurisdictional grant over \u2018all offenses,\u2019\u201d or to \u201ccreate a \nnew clear-statement rule requiring Congress to \n\u2018clearly indicat[e] its intent\u2019 to include foreign states \nand their instrumentalities.\u201d  Id. \nSimilarly, in Pfizer, Inc. v. Government of India, the \nSupreme Court considered a provision of the Clayton \nAct allowing \u201cany person\u201d injured by a violation of U.S. \nantitrust laws to sue in U.S. district court.  434 U.S. \n308, 311-12 (1978) (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 15(a)).  The \nCourt held that \u201cany person\u201d includes foreign \ngovernments, in part because that interpretation \nfurthered the \u201ctwo purposes\u201d of the provision:  \u201cto \ndeter violators and deprive them of \u2018the fruits of their \nillegality,\u2019 and \u2018to compensate victims of antitrust \nviolations for their injuries.\u2019\u201d Id. at 314 (quoting Ill. \nBrick Co. v. Illinois, 431 U.S. 720, 746 (1977)).  The \nCourt reasoned that \u201c[t]o deny a foreign plaintiff \ninjured by an antitrust violation the right to sue would \ndefeat these purposes\u201d because \u201c[i]t would permit a \nprice fixer or a monopolist to escape full liability for \nhis illegal actions and would deny compensation to \ncertain of his victims, merely because he happens to \ndeal with foreign customers.\u201d  Id. at 314-15. \nTaken together, Turkiye and Pfizer guide our \napproach to interpreting the PLCAA.  Here, as in \nTurkiye, the \u201ctext as written\u201d does not contain the \nexceptions Mexico proposes.  Nothing in the text of the \nPLCAA limits its scope to misuse or injury that occurs \nin the United States, or to U.S. plaintiffs.  And, as in \nPfizer, the context and purpose of the PLCAA weigh \nagainst such a limitation.  Congress quite clearly \nenacted the PLCAA to insulate the U.S. gun industry \nfrom certain lawsuits.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5)-(8); \nid. \u00a7 7901(b)(1), (4).  Limiting that protection to \n\n286a \n \nlawsuits brought for harm occurring in the United \nStates, thereby exposing the U.S. gun industry to \nidentical lawsuits for harm suffered abroad, would run \ndirectly contrary to that purpose.  We also think it \nunlikely that Congress intended to allow recovery for \nvictims of gun violence occurring abroad but preclude \nthat same recovery for victims of gun violence \noccurring within U.S. borders. \nNevertheless, Mexico urges us to read into the \nPLCAA an implicit domestic restriction on the \nstatute\u2019s scope.  It likens this case to Small v. United \nStates, which involved a statute criminalizing \npossession of a firearm by \u201cany person . . . who has \nbeen convicted in any court of, a crime punishable by \nimprisonment for a term exceeding one year.\u201d  544 \nU.S. 385, 387 (2005) (quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g)(1)).  \nThere the Supreme Court held that the phrase \n\u201cconvicted in any court\u201d encompasses only domestic, \nnot foreign, convictions.  Id.  But at the same time the \nCourt made clear that its conclusion would be different \n\u201cshould statutory language, context, history, or \npurpose show the contrary.\u201d  Id. at 391.  Finding \u201cno \nconvincing indication to the contrary\u201d in the statute, \nthe Court applied an assumption \u201csimilar\u201d to the \npresumption \nagainst \nextraterritoriality \nbecause \n\u201cCongress generally legislates with domestic concerns \nin mind.\u201d  Id. at 388, 391 (quoting Smith v. United \nStates, 507 U.S. 197, 204 n.5 (1993)). \nThe holding in Small provides no succor to Mexico.  \nAs we have explained, the PLCAA was also \nundoubtedly enacted with domestic concerns in mind; \ni.e., the impact of certain types of lawsuits filed in \ndomestic courts against domestic firearm companies.  \nSo prohibiting all such lawsuits regardless of who \n\n287a \n \nbrings them perfectly aligns with that domestic \nconcern.  The fact that a statute is focused on domestic \nconcerns (here, lawsuits in U.S. courts) does not mean \nthat every term in the statute need be read as \nsomehow domestically limited.  See, e.g., Turkiye, 598 \nU.S. at 269; Pfizer, 434 U.S. at 314-15.  And that is \nespecially so where, as here, limiting the statute in \nthis way would run directly contrary to its stated \npurposes. \nMexico begs to differ.  It points to four \u201cclues\u201d that \nthe PLCAA does not apply to lawsuits arising out of \nthe use of guns in violation of foreign laws.  We \naddress each in turn. \nFirst, Mexico points out that the definition of the \nterm \u201cseller\u201d in the PLCAA explicitly includes \n\u201cimporter[s]\u201d \nbut \ndoes \nnot \nexplicitly \nmention \n\u201cexporters.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(6)(A).  Similarly, \n\u201cimporters,\u201d but not \u201cexporters,\u201d are specifically \nidentified as a category of business that the PLCAA \nseeks to protect.  Id. \u00a7 7901(b)(1).  Mexico argues that \nthis \u201cconfirms\u201d that Congress only intended the \nPLCAA to be domestic in scope.  But this is too slender \na reed on which to support the interpretation Mexico \nseeks to advance.  Even assuming Congress intended \nto exclude from the PLCAA\u2019s coverage the export of \nguns (an issue we do not decide here), that does not \nalter our conclusion that Congress certainly intended \nto include all lawful domestic sales of guns\u2014even \nwhen those domestically sold guns end up causing \nharm abroad.  There are plausible reasons why \nCongress might have wanted to protect domestic \nsellers more than exporters, including Congress\u2019s \nstated purpose of \u201cpreserv[ing] a citizen\u2019s access to a \nsupply of firearms and ammunition for all lawful \n\n288a \n \npurposes.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(b)(2) (emphasis added).  If \na domestic seller goes out of business, that hampers \nU.S. citizens\u2019 access to guns more than if an exporter \ngoes out of business.  Thus, the lack of any express \nmention of \u201cexporters\u201d does not mean that the PLCAA \ndoes \nnot \napply \nto \nactions \nagainst \ndomestic \nmanufacturers and sellers for harm suffered in \nanother country. \nSecond, Mexico points out that the PLCAA applies \nonly to actions \u201cresulting from the criminal or \nunlawful misuse\u201d of a firearm, and excludes any action \nin which the manufacturer or seller knowingly \nviolated a \u201cState or Federal statute\u201d applicable to gun \nsales or marketing.  Mexico argues that \u201ccriminal or \nunlawful misuse\u201d should be read as referring only to \nviolations of domestic laws, just as \u201cconvicted in any \ncourt\u201d was read to encompass only domestic \nconvictions in Small.  Otherwise, Mexico says, the \nexception for knowing violations of law would \npresumably not be limited to state and federal \nstatutes.  We disagree.  Given the basic concern \nmotivating Congress, it makes perfect sense to read \n\u201ccriminal or unlawful misuse\u201d broadly as including the \nviolation of any law.  Otherwise, Congress would have \nfavored foreign plaintiffs over domestic plaintiffs and \nleft a gaping hole in the shield that was the object of \nthe legislation. \nMexico replies that Congress would not have \nrequired U.S. courts to interpret foreign criminal law \nin determining whether the use of a gun was \u201ccriminal \nor unlawful.\u201d  Again, we disagree.  Courts in the \nUnited States are capable of interpreting foreign law, \nand commonly do so.  See, e.g., Piper Aircraft Co. v. \nReyno, 454 U.S. 235, 245 (1981) (\u201c[T]he mere fact that \n\n289a \n \nthe court is called upon to determine and apply foreign \nlaw does not present a legal problem of the sort which \nwould justify the dismissal of a case otherwise \nproperly before the court.\u201d  (internal quotations \nomitted)).  Indeed, Mexico asks the court to interpret \nforeign law in this very case by arguing that Mexican \nlaw applies.  To the extent Mexico is concerned that \nincorporating foreign law into the meaning of \n\u201ccriminal or unlawful use\u201d will introduce \u201cextreme\u201d \nvariations, the phrase already reflects the varied laws \nof fifty different states.  See, e.g., Cynthia V. Ward, \n\u201cStand Your Ground\u201d and Self-Defense, 42 Am. J. \nCrim. L. 89, 90 (2015) (describing contrasting state \napproaches to \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws).  The PLCAA \nprecludes certain lawsuits against firearm companies \npremised only on others\u2019 unlawful use of firearms\u2014\nregardless of which jurisdiction\u2019s law determines that \nthe use was unlawful. \nIt also makes perfect sense that in crafting a specific \nand defined exception for knowing violations of law by \na defendant, Congress would limit the exception to \ninstances in which the defendant knowingly violated a \n\u201cState or Federal statute.\u201d  To do otherwise and except \nfrom the limitations of the PLCAA cases in which a \nmanufacturer violated a law of a foreign country would \ngrant foreign governments the ability to define the \nscope of that exception.  See Small, 544 U.S. at 389\u2014\n90 (finding Congress not to have granted foreign \ngovernments the ability to determine who could not \nown a gun in the United States).  The PLCAA is \ndesigned to protect domestic firearm companies that \noperate lawfully in the United States under the \nnumerous federal and state laws regulating their \noperations.  See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(4) (finding \n\n290a \n \nthat the U.S. gun industry is \u201cheavily regulated by \nFederal, State, and local laws\u201d).  That goal would be \nhampered if the PLCAA\u2019s protections fell away \nwhenever a plaintiff alleged a violation of only foreign \nlaws\u2014which may be significantly more restrictive \nthan domestic regulations. \nThird, Mexico argues that RJR Nabisco supports its \nclaim that \u201cdamages . . . or other relief\u201d covers only \ninjury in the United States.  RJR Nabisco involved the \nprivate right of action for \u201c[a]ny person injured . . . by \nreason of a violation of\u201d the Racketeer Influenced and \nCorrupt Organizations Act (RICO).  579 U.S. at 346 \n(quoting 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1964(c)).  The Supreme Court \nheld that the presumption against extraterritoriality \nprecluded RICO\u2019s private right of action from applying \nto injuries suffered abroad.  Id.  But here, as discussed \nabove, the focus of the PLCAA is not on redressing \ninjury but rather on preventing certain lawsuits \nagainst U.S. firearm companies.  So it is not an \nextraterritorial application of the PLCAA to bar a \nlawsuit in a U.S. court against a U.S. company for \nharm suffered abroad.  See also WesternGeco, 138 S. \nCt. at 2138 (distinguishing \u201cinjury,\u201d a \u201csubstantive \nelement of a cause of action\u201d in RJR Nabisco, from \n\u201cdamages\u2014a separate legal concept\u201d). \nFinally, Mexico argues that the term \u201cany \ngovernmental entity\u201d excludes foreign governmental \nentities because the PLCAA\u2019s factual findings refer to \nactions \u201ccommenced or contemplated by the Federal \nGovernment, States, municipalities, private interest \ngroups and others,\u201d and do not expressly mention \nforeign governments.  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8); id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7).  This argument stumbles at the starting \nline.  The statements in the findings of fact merely \n\n291a \n \nreflect that Congress enacted the PLCAA in response \nto actions that had been \u201ccommenced or contemplated\u201d \nby the listed entities.  They do not suggest that \nCongress did not intend for the PLCAA to apply to \nidentical lawsuits by others that would have the same \nimpact on the U.S. firearm industry. \nIn sum, the text, context, and purpose of the PLCAA \nall point toward a conclusion that \u201c[q]ualified civil \nliability action[s]\u201d include those filed in United States\u2019 \nfederal and state courts by foreign governments for \ninjury incurred abroad. \nC. \nThe \nforegoing \nbrings \nus \nto \nMexico\u2019s \nlast \nextraterritoriality argument:  Its contention that our \nreading of the statute should give way to Mexico\u2019s \ninvocation of international comity.  Mexico argues that \nit is for Congress, not the courts, to decide whether to \npreclude a foreign-law claim for injuries incurred \nabroad\u2014especially when the plaintiff is a foreign \nsovereign.  It therefore urges application of a clear-\nstatement rule before reading a statute like the \nPLCAA to bar such lawsuits. \nIn making its comity argument, Mexico turns again \nto RJR Nabisco and its holding that RICO did not \ncreate a private cause of action for injuries suffered \nabroad.  579 U.S. at 346.  In so holding, the Supreme \nCourt reasoned that \u201cproviding a private civil remedy \nfor \nforeign \nconduct \ncreates \na \npotential \nfor \ninternational friction\u201d because it risks \u201cupsetting a \nbalance of competing considerations that [foreign \ncountries\u2019] own . . . laws embody.\u201d  Id. at 346-47 \n(quoting F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran \nS.A., 542 U.S. 155, 167 (2004)).  Mexico contends that \n\n292a \n \nthis case is the \u201cmirror image\u201d of RJR Nabisco: \n\u201c[P]recluding a claim under [foreign] law for injury \nincurred [abroad]\u201d interferes with foreign sovereigns\u2019 \napplication of their laws just as much as \u201cgranting a \nclaim under U.S. law for injury incurred abroad.\u201d  Cf. \nNestle USA, Inc. v. Doe, 141 S. Ct. 1931, 1948 (2021) \n(Sotomayor, J., concurring in part and concurring in \nthe judgment) (\u201cClosing the courthouse doors . . . gives \nrise to foreign-policy concerns just as invariably as \nleaving them open.\u201d  (cleaned up)).  Therefore, Mexico \nargues, absent a clear statement from Congress, \ncourts should not apply the PLCAA to claims arising \nunder foreign law for conduct that occurs in the United \nStates but causes injuries abroad. \nWe decline to adopt this clear-statement rule for the \nPLCAA.  As should be abundantly clear by now, the \nPLCAA\u2019s focus is on protecting U.S. firearm \ncompanies from certain costly lawsuits, thereby also \npreserving U.S. citizens\u2019 access to firearms.  Creating \nan atextual exception for lawsuits by foreign \ngovernments would expose U.S. firearm companies to \nthe very type of lawsuit the PLCAA seeks to prohibit, \nthereby running contrary to its stated goals.  In at \nleast this respect, this case is different from RJR \nNabisco, in which limiting RICO\u2019s private cause of \naction to exclude injuries suffered abroad did not \nundermine any stated purposes of the statute. \nThe practical consequence of applying the PLCAA to \nthis case is not lost on us.  It may be that Mexico, as it \nclaims, would be unable to pursue its lawsuit in the \nonly forum that could provide effective injunctive \nrelief.  But that is a necessary consequence of \nCongress\u2019s decision to protect the U.S. firearm \nindustry by regulating the types of lawsuits that can \n\n293a \n \nbe adjudicated by U.S. courts.  And the prohibition \napplies to lawsuits filed by domestic entities and \nindividuals on an equal basis.  Cf. Pfizer, 434 U.S. at \n318-19 (\u201c[A] foreign nation is generally entitled to \nprosecute any civil claim in the courts of the United \nStates upon the same basis as a domestic corporation \nor individual might do.\u201d). \nIn sum, we hold that the PLCAA applies to lawsuits \nby foreign governmental entities for harm suffered \noutside this country, just as it applies to lawsuits by \ndomestic governmental entities for harm suffered in \nthis country.  We turn next to Mexico\u2019s contention \nthat, even if the PLCAA applies generally to suits by \nforeign governments for foreign harms, it also excepts \nfrom its ban claims of the type presented in Mexico\u2019s \ncomplaint. \nIV. \nAs the title of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act suggests, the statute is designed to protect \nonly \u201clawful\u201d commerce in arms.  It contains various \nexceptions to ensure that it does not insulate firearm \ncompanies against lawsuits resulting from their \nunlawful behavior.  One of those exceptions, known as \nthe predicate exception, exempts from the PLCAA\u2019s \nclutches \u201can action in which a manufacturer or seller \nof a qualified product knowingly violated a State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of \nthe product, and the violation was a proximate cause \nof the harm for which relief is sought.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  Mexico contends that its lawsuit \nmeets this description. \nDefendants advance three arguments for rejecting \nMexico\u2019s contention: first, defendants say that \n\n294a \n \nMexico\u2019s claims are not for violations of \u201cstatute[s]\u201d; \nsecond, they contend that Mexico\u2019s complaint does not \nadequately plead violations of predicate statutes; and \nthird, they assert that Mexico has not adequately \nalleged proximate cause.  We conclude that Mexico \nsurvives each of these threshold challenges at this \nstage of the litigation.  We therefore hold that the \nPLCAA does not prevent this case from moving \nforward.  Our reasoning follows. \nA. \nThe district court held that Mexico\u2019s common law \nclaims did not qualify for the predicate exception \nbecause, it thought, the exception applies only to \n\u201cstatutory claims,\u201d not \u201ccommon-law causes of action.\u201d  \nEstados Unidos Mexicanos, 633 F. Supp. 3d at 446.  \nSaid differently, the district court thought that the \n\u201cState or Federal statute\u201d that the defendant violated, \nrather than the common law, must also provide the \nprivate right of action under which the plaintiff sues. \nMexico tells us that no other court has construed the \nPLCAA this way, and points to a variety of decisions \napplying the predicate exception to common law \nclaims alleging knowing violations of statutes.4  \n \n \n4 See, e.g., Brady v. Walmart Inc., No. 8:21-cv-1412-AAQ, 2022 \nWL 2987078, at *6-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022) ; Prescott v. Slide \nFire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1139-40 & 1139 n.9 (D. Nev. \n2019) ; Corporan v. Wal-Mart Stores E., LP, No. 16-2305-JWL, \n2016 WL 3881341, at *3-4 & *4 n.4 (D. Kan. July 18, 2016) ; City \nof New York v. A-1 Jewelry & Pawn, Inc., 247 F.R.D. 296, 353 \n(E.D.N.Y. 2007) ; King v.

Gander Mountain Co. , 13 N.Y.S.3d 777, 787 (N.Y. \n\n295a \n \nDefendants do not contest this assertion, nor do they \ncite any cases construing the PLCAA as the district \ncourt did in this case. \nWe, too, conclude that the predicate exception \nencompasses common law claims in addition to \nstatutory claims, as long as there is a predicate \nstatutory violation that proximately causes the harm.  \nThe text of the PLCAA compels this conclusion.  While \nother PLCAA exceptions exempt suits \u201cfor\u201d specific \ncauses of action, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(ii), (iv), (v) (\u201can \naction . . . for negligent entrustment or negligence per \nse\u201d; \u201can action for breach of contract or warranty\u201d; \u201can \naction for [harm arising from a product defect]\u201d), the \npredicate exception more broadly exempts actions \u201cin \nwhich\u201d the manufacturer or seller violated a statute, \nid. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  If Congress had wanted to limit \nthe predicate exception to claims for violating a \npredicate statute, it could have simply phrased this \nexception the same as the others.  See Keene Corp. v. \nUnited States, 508 U.S. 200, 208 (1993) (\u201c[W]here \nCongress includes particular language in one section \nof a statute but omits it in another . . ., it is generally \npresumed that Congress acts intentionally and \npurposely in the disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d  \n(omission in original) (quoting Russello v. United \nStates, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983))). \nDefendants reply that \u201cin which\u201d means that the \nstatutory violation must be contained \u201cin\u201d the cause of \n \n \nSup. Ct 2014) ; Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, 150-\n51 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 A.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. \nDiv. 2013) ; Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City of Gary, 875 N.E.2d \n422, 434-35 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007). \n\n296a \n \naction, such that it must be an element of the claim.  \nCertainly to prevail Mexico would need to prove a \nmanufacturer or seller liable for the knowing violation \nof a statute applicable to the sale or marketing of a \nqualified product.  So proof of a statutory violation is a \ncondition to prevailing on, for example, a cause of \naction for negligence.  But that does not mean that a \nlawsuit for negligence cannot be \u201can action in \nwhich . . . a seller . . . knowingly violated\u201d a requisite \nstatute. \nThe \npredicate \nexception\u2019s \nproximate \ncause \nrequirement \nharmonizes \nwell \nwith \nthis \nunderstanding.  The requisite proximate cause serves \nas a nexus between the predicate statutory violation \nand common law claims that otherwise might bear no \nrelation to a seller\u2019s transgression of firearm statutes.  \nThis \nensures \nthat\u2014contrary \nto \ndefendants\u2019 \nprotestations\u2014our reading of the predicate exception \ndoes not allow any claim at all to proceed merely \nbecause it is alleged in the same case as an unrelated \nstatutory violation. \nThe proximate cause requirement makes less sense \nunder the district court\u2019s reading.  Courts \u201cgenerally \npresume that a statutory cause of action is limited to \nplaintiffs whose injuries are proximately caused by \nviolations of the statute.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static \nControl Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 132 (2014).  \nAnd for any statutory cause of action containing a \nproximate cause requirement (as most do), the district \ncourt\u2019s \nreading \nwould \nrender \nthe \nidentical \nrequirement of the predicate exception entirely \nsuperfluous.  See Consumer Data Indus. Ass\u2019n v. Frey, \n26 F.4th 1, 7 (1st Cir. 2022) (\u201cA statute . . . ought to be \nconstrued in a way that \u2018no clause, sentence, or word \n\n297a \n \nshall be superfluous, void, or insignificant.\u2019\u201d (quoting \nDuncan v. Walker, 533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001))).  Of \ncourse, as defendants point out, not all statutory \ncauses of action have a built-in proximate cause \nrequirement.  But even with this caveat, proximate \ncause makes far more sense as a nexus between a \npredicate statutory violation and other causes of \naction than as a catchall designed to graft a proximate \ncause requirement onto rare statutory causes of action \nwith alternative causation frameworks. \nThe examples Congress provided of lawsuits that fit \nwithin the exception dispel any doubt that the \nexception allows for more than purely statutory causes \nof action.  The predicate exception expressly \nencompasses, as an example of allowed lawsuits, \u201cany \ncase in which the manufacturer or seller aided, \nabetted, or conspired with any other person to sell or \notherwise dispose of a qualified product, knowing, or \nhaving reasonable cause to believe, that the actual \nbuyer of the qualified product was prohibited from \npossessing or receiving a firearm or ammunition \nunder subsection (g) or (n) of section 922 of title 18, \nUnited States Code\u201d\u2014conduct made unlawful by the \nGun Control Act, 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(d).  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(II).  Yet, nothing in section 922 seems \nto create any private right of action.  Nor does any \nparty suggest that it does.  To the contrary, Mexico \ncites various cases holding that the Gun Control Act \ncontains no statutory private right of action, and \ndefendants do not dispute this characterization.5  And \n \n \n5 The cases that Mexico cites are not from this circuit. See \nBannerman v. Mountain State Pawn, Inc., No. 3:10-CV-46, 2010 \n\n298a \n \ngiven that agreed-upon reading, it would make no \nsense for Congress to have listed such a case as an \nexample if only statutory actions could survive under \nthe predicate exception. \nDefendants argue that, read to include non-\nstatutory causes of action, the predicate exception \nwould \u201cwholly subsume\u201d a different exception in the \nPLCAA for \u201caction[s] brought against a seller for . . . \nnegligence per se.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(ii). \nGenerally speaking, negligence per se requires \nviolation of \u201ca statute that is designed to protect \nagainst the type of accident the actor\u2019s conduct causes\u201d \nand that the \u201cvictim is within the class of persons the \nstatute is designed to protect.\u201d  Restatement (Third) of \nTorts \u00a7 14. Defendants complain that our reading of \nthe predicate exception would allow plaintiffs to bring \nany common law claim based on any statutory \nviolation, \nthereby \nrendering \nthese \nrestrictions \nsuperfluous. \nDefendants\u2019 argument glosses over the heightened \nmens rea requirement in the predicate exception, \nwhich applies only when the defendant \u201cknowingly\u201d \nviolates a statute. So there are statutory violations\u2014\ni.e., those that are not \u201cknowing\u201d\u2014that may be \nactionable under the doctrine of negligence per se but \ndo not serve as predicate violations.  So, there is no \n \n \nWL 9103469 (N.D. W. Va. Nov. 5, 2010), aff\u2019d, 436 F. App\u2019x 151 \n(4th Cir. 2011) ; Est. of Pemberton v. John\u2019s Sports Ctr., Inc., 135 \nP.3d 174 (Kan. Ct. App. 2006) ; T & M Jewelry, Inc. v. Hicks ex \nrel. Hicks, 189 S.W.3d 526 (Ky. 2006) .  We do not decide here \nwhether the Gun Control Act provides a private right of action.  \nFor purposes of the present case, we merely accept the parties\u2019 \napparent agreement that it does not. \n\n299a \n \nsuperfluousness in our reading of the statute.  And it \nis perfectly sensible for Congress to allow claims \nsatisfying the negligence per se standard to proceed, \nwhile at the same time creating a separate exception \nfor knowing violations of statutes regulating the sale \nor marketing of firearms.6 \nFor these reasons, we conclude that the predicate \nexception allows common law claims for injury \nproximately caused by a defendant\u2019s knowing \nviolation of a predicate statute.  We turn next to \ndefendants\u2019 contention that Mexico has not adequately \nalleged such a violation. \nB. \nMexico alleges that defendants knowingly violated \npredicate statutes in two ways: by aiding and abetting \nillegal downstream sales, and by selling unlawful \n\u201cmachineguns.\u201d \n1. \nFirst, \nMexico \nreasons \nthat \nby \ndeliberately \nfacilitating the unlawful trafficking of their guns into \nMexico, defendants aid and abet violations of various \nfederal statutes that prohibit selling guns without a \nlicense, exporting guns without a license, and selling \nto straw purchasers.  Resting on their position that the \npredicate exception is limited to statutory causes of \naction (which we have rejected), defendants do not \ncontend that the complaint fails to allege widespread \n \n \n6 In fact, the district court in this very case found the negligence \nper se exception inapplicable because Massachusetts does not \nrecognize the negligence per se doctrine. See Estados Unidos \nMexicanos, F. Supp. 3d at 449. \n\n300a \n \nsales of firearms by dealers in knowing violation of \nseveral state and federal statutes.  Nor do defendants \ndispute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to prove \nthat a defendant aided and abetted any such violation.  \nInstead, defendants contend that even for pleading \npurposes the complaint fails to allege facts plausibly \nsupporting the theory that defendants have aided and \nabetted such unlawful sales. \nWe \ndisagree, \nfinding \ninstead \nthat \nMexico\u2019s \ncomplaint adequately alleges that defendants have \nbeen aiding and abetting the sale of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of relevant state and \nfederal laws.  \u201c[T]he essence of aiding and abetting\u201d is \n\u201cparticipation in another\u2019s wrongdoing that is both \nsignificant and culpable enough to justify attributing \nthe principal wrongdoing to the aider and abettor.\u201d  \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471, 504 (2023). \nReduced to its essence, aiding-and-abetting liability \nrests on \u201ctwin requirements\u201d that the assistance \nprovided to the principal wrong-doer be both (1) \n\u201cknowing\u201d and (2) \u201csubstantial.\u201d  Id. at 491-92.  These \nrequirements \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser \nshowing of one demanding a greater showing of the \nother.\u201d  Id.  They \u201c\u2018should be considered relative to one \nanother\u2019 as part of a single inquiry designed to capture \nconscious and culpable conduct.\u201d  Id. at 504 (quoting \nCamp v. Dema, 948 F.2d 455, 459 (8th Cir. 1991)). \nDefendants argue that Mexico has at best alleged \ndefendants\u2019 knowing indifference to the downstream \nillegal trafficking of their guns into Mexico.  They \nargue that \u201cbecause Defendants themselves are not \nalleged to \u2018participate\u2019 in this wrongful conduct at all, \n\n301a \n \nmuch less with any plausible intent of facilitating it, \nthey cannot be deemed accomplices.\u201d \nThis \nargument \nreflects \na \nfundamental \nmisunderstanding of the complaint.  Fairly read, the \ncomplaint alleges that defendants are aware of the \nsignificant demand for their guns among the Mexican \ndrug cartels, that they can identify which of their \ndealers are responsible for the illegal sales that give \nthe cartels the guns, and that they know the unlawful \nsales practices those dealers engage in to get the guns \nto the cartels.  The complaint further alleges that even \nwith all this knowledge, and even after warnings from \nthe U.S. government, defendants continue to supply \nthe very dealers that they know engage in straw sales \nand large-volume sales to traffic guns into Mexico, \nthat they design military-style weapons and market \nthem as such knowing that this makes them more \ndesirable to the cartels, and that they place serial \nnumbers on their weapons in a manner that facilitates \ntheir removal, as is preferred by cartels.  And the \ncomplaint alleges that as a result of this conduct, \ndefendants collectively reap $170 million per year in \nrevenue from this illegal market.  It is therefore not \nimplausible that, as the complaint alleges, defendants \nengage in all this conduct in order to maintain the \nunlawful market in Mexico, and not merely in spite of \nit. \nNotionally, imagine a dealer, a distributor, and a \nmanufacturer standing abreast of one another at the \nborder.  The manufacturer hands the distributor ten \nguns, the distributor hands them to the dealer, and the \ndealer then hands them to a group of ten customers, \namong whom there are eight well-known agents of the \ncartel acting as straw purchasers.  Rather than \n\n302a \n \nrefusing to fill an order for ten more guns by that \ndealer, the manufacturer tweaks its advertisements to \nbetter appeal to the cartel, supplies them more guns, \nand so on over and over again.  We think it clear that \nby passing along guns knowing that the purchasers \ninclude unlawful buyers, and making design and \nmarketing decisions targeted towards those exact \nindividuals, the manufacturer is aiding and abetting \nillegal sales.  And this scenario, in substance, is fairly \nanalogous to what Mexico alleges. \nThe allegations here are also remarkably analogous \nto the facts in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 703 (1943).  In that case, the defendant company \nconducted from New York a business providing mail-\norder prescription drugs to doctors around the \ncountry.  Id. at 704-06.  One customer was a doctor in \nSouth Carolina who was illegally reselling morphine \nsulfate supplied to him by the defendant.  Id. at 704.  \nThe defendant was convicted of criminally conspiring \nwith the doctor.  Id. at 704-05.  In affirming the \nconviction, the Supreme Court pointed to evidence \nthat the doctor was ordering the product in large \nvolumes incompatible with lawful use by legitimate \npatients, that the defendant facilitated this behavior \nthrough mass advertising and offering bulk sales at \nsteep discounts (even after the U.S. government \nwarned it that it was a source of supply for an illegal \nmarket), and that the company had a \u201cstake in the \nventure\u201d in the form of profits from the illegally sold \ndrugs.  Id. at 706-07, 712-13.  From this evidence, the \nCourt concluded, the jury could have found beyond a \nreasonable doubt that the defendant supplier \u201cnot only \nkn[ew] and acquiesce[d]\u201d in the illegal enterprise, but \n\n303a \n \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand . . . to make its \naccomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nHere, \nsimilarly, \nthe \ncomplaint \nalleges \nthat \ndefendants have resisted taking measures that would \nmake it more difficult for their firearms to fall into the \ncartels\u2019 hands (despite warnings from the U.S. \ngovernment), that they design and market their guns \nin such a way as to make them attractive to the illegal \nmarket, and that they benefit financially as a result.  \nAnd unlike in Direct Sales, the defendants here are \nalleged to know that they supply dealers who sell \nillegally, making the inference that they are working \nin concert with these unlawful actors even stronger.  \nNeither must we determine whether there is evidence \nof these facts sufficient to support a criminal \nconviction as in Direct Sales; we ask only whether the \nfacts alleged in the complaint plausibly support an \naiding-and-abetting theory of liability in this civil \ncase.  Direct Sales strongly supports our conclusion \nthat they do. \nDefendants attempt to distinguish Direct Sales by \nrelying on the Court\u2019s observation that given the \nquantities sold the drugs could not have all been used \nfor any lawful purpose.  Id. at 710-12.  In contrast, they \nassert, the \u201cvast majority of retailers\u201d are law-abiding \nand \u201conly 2%\u201d of U.S. firearms end up in Mexico.  But \nin Direct Sales the Court distinguished morphine\u2014a \nproduct \u201cincapable of further legal use except by \ncompliance with rigid regulations\u201d\u2014from other \ncommodities \u201cnot restricted as to sale by order form, \nregistration, or other requirements.  Id. at 710.  The \ndefendant\u2019s sales methods and volumes, which might \nbe perfectly innocuous for everyday items, were \nevidence of illicit intent when employed to sell a \n\n304a \n \ndangerous item whose legitimate market is highly \nrestricted.  Id. at 711-12.  \u201cThe difference,\u201d the Court \nsaid, \u201cis like that between toy pistols or hunting rifles \nand machine guns.\u201d  Id. at 710. \nAnd so in Direct Sales the defendant must have \nknown that the sales volume meant there were likely \nillegal sales, and by encouraging volume sales, the \ndefendant could have been found to have intended to \nsupply the products for the illegal sales.  Here we also \nhave a highly regulated product7 allegedly being sold \nin an illegal manner, and an allegation that \ndefendants know what is going on and take steps to \nfacilitate it.  In this important respect, Direct Sales \nagain provides a close and instructive analogy. \nDefendants also point out that Direct Sales rejected \nthe proposition that a seller could be held liable for a \nbuyer\u2019s illegal acts based merely on their knowledge or \nlack of concern as to the buyer\u2019s unlawful plans.  But \nfor all the reasons described above, the complaint \nadequately alleges that defendants make deliberate \ndesign and distribution choices to facilitate the illegal \ntrafficking of their guns to Mexico.  Thus they are not \nmere passive observers of the buyer\u2019s illegal activity, \nbut more akin to a calculated and willing participant \nin the supply chain that ends with a profitable illegal \nfirearm market in Mexico. \nDefendants argue that the Supreme Court\u2019s recent \nopinion in Twitter calls for a different result.  We \n \n \n7 As Congress observed in enacting the PLCAA, \u201c[t]he \nmanufacture, importation, possession, sale, and use of firearms \nand ammunition in the United States are heavily regulated.\u201d  15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). \n\n305a \n \ndisagree.  In Twitter, the Supreme Court held that \nmajor social media platforms used by ISIS to enlist \nrecruits and raise funds were not liable under the \nJustice Against Sponsors of Terrorism Act for aiding \nand abetting an ISIS terrorist attack on a nightclub in \nTurkey.  598 U.S. at 505-07.  The defendants in \nTwitter had no meaningful stake in ISIS\u2019s use of their \nplatforms and had an undisputed lack of intent to \nsupport ISIS.  Id.  The only affirmative conduct that \nthe defendants engaged in was creating their \nplatforms and making them available to the public, \nwhich was not alleged to have been done with ISIS in \nmind or to support terrorism.  Id. at 498.  There was \nalso no allegation that ISIS even used the platforms to \nplan or coordinate the attack.  Id. \nHere, by contrast, Mexico alleges that defendants \nengage in conduct\u2014design decisions, marketing \ntactics, and repeated supplying of dealers known to \nsell guns that cross the border\u2014with the intent of \ngrowing and maintaining an illegal market in Mexico \nfrom which they receive substantial revenues.  And for \nRule 12(b)(6) purposes we assume that defendants\u2019 \nconduct in fact helped incite the unlawful sales.  See, \ne.g., SBT Holdings, LLC v. Town of Westminster, 547 \nF.3d 28, 35 (1st Cir. 2008) (\u201c[W]e draw all rational \ninferences from the facts alleged in favor of the \nplaintiffs.\u201d).  Defendants are therefore alleged to be \nmuch more active participants in the alleged activity \nthan were the Twitter defendants, and the holding in \nthat case does not compel a different result in this one. \nOf course, the complaint does not allege defendants\u2019 \nawareness of any particular unlawful sale.  But \nneither did the convicted mail-order company in Direct \nSales have such specific knowledge.  The Supreme \n\n306a \n \nCourt clarified in Twitter that such a \u201cstrict nexus\u201d is \nnot always required.  598 U.S. at 497.  \u201c[I]n \nappropriate circumstances, a secondary defendant\u2019s \nrole in an illicit enterprise can be so systemic that the \nsecondary defendant is aiding and abetting every \nwrongful act committed by that enterprise.\u201d  Id. at \n496.  Here, defendants operate at a systemic level, \nallegedly designing, marketing, and distributing their \nguns so that demand by the cartels continues to boost \nsales.  In these circumstances, defendants need not \nknow about any particular unlawful sale that funnels \ntheir guns into Mexico. \nIn sum, we conclude that the complaint adequately \nalleges that defendants aided and abetted the \nknowingly unlawful downstream trafficking of their \nguns into Mexico.  Defendants\u2019 arguments to the \ncontrary are premised either on an inaccurate reading \nof the complaint or on a misapplication of the standard \nof review on a motion to dismiss under Rule 12(b)(6).  \nWhether plaintiff will be able to support those \nallegations with evidence at summary judgment or at \ntrial remains to be seen.  At this stage, though, we \nmust \u201caccept all well-pleaded allegations of [Mexico] \nas true and afford all inferences in [Mexico\u2019s] favor.\u201d  \nVazquez- Ramos v. Triple-S Salud, Inc., 55 F.4th 286, \n291 (1st Cir. 2022) (cleaned up) (quoting Arroyo-\nMelecio v. P.R. Am. Ins. Co. , 398 F.3d 56, 65 (1st Cir. \n2005)). \n2. \nMexico\u2019s argument that defendants unlawfully sold \n\u201cmachineguns\u201d fares less well.  The Gun Control Act \nprohibits selling a \u201cmachinegun\u201d without specific \n\n307a \n \nauthorization.  18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(b)(4).  \u201cMachinegun\u201d is \ndefined as follows: \nThe term \u201cmachinegun\u201d means any weapon \nwhich shoots, is designed to shoot, or can be \nreadily restored to shoot, automatically more \nthan one shot, without manual reloading, by a \nsingle function of the trigger.  The term shall also \ninclude the frame or receiver of any such weapon, \nany part designed and intended solely and \nexclusively, or combination of parts designed and \nintended, for use in converting a weapon into a \nmachinegun, and any combination of parts from \nwhich a machinegun can be assembled if such \nparts are in the possession or under the control of \na person. \n26 U.S.C. \u00a7 5845(b). \nMexico claims that defendants\u2019 semiautomatic \nweapons meet this definition because they can easily \nbe modified to fire automatically.  It cites a 1982 ATF \nadministrative ruling stating that this definition \n\u201cincludes those weapons which have not previously \nfunctioned as machineguns but possess design \nfeatures which facilitate full automatic fire by a simple \nmodification or elimination of existing component \nparts.\u201d  ATF Rul. 82-8, 1982-2 A.T.F.Q.B. 49 (1982). \nBinding precedent from the Supreme Court and this \ncourt forecloses Mexico\u2019s interpretation.  In Staples v. \nUnited States, the Supreme Court held that the \nNational Firearms Act\u2014which prohibits possession of \nan unregistered \u201cmachinegun\u201d (as defined above)\u2014\nrequires that the defendant knew that the possessed \nweapon \u201chad the characteristics that brought it within \nthe statutory definition of a machinegun.\u201d  511 U.S. \n\n308a \n \n600, 602 (1994).  The defendant in that case possessed \nan AR-15 rifle, in which certain components had been \nswapped out or filed down to enable automatic firing.  \nId. at 603.  The Supreme Court held that to be properly \nconvicted the defendant must have known that his \nrifle had been so modified.  Id. at 619.  It rejected a \nreading of the statute under which \u201cany person who \nhas purchased what he believes to be a semiautomatic \nrifle or handgun . . . can be subject to imprisonment, \ndespite absolute ignorance of the gun\u2019s firing \ncapabilities, if the gun turns out to be an automatic.\u201d  \nId. at 615.  And the majority also rejected the dissent\u2019s \nargument based on a class of \u201creadily convertible \nsemiautomatics\u201d because \u201cthat class bears no relation \nto the definitions in the Act.\u201d  Id. at 612 n.6. \nSimilarly, in United States v. Nieves-Casta\u00f1o, we \nreversed the conviction of a defendant who knew that \nshe possessed an AK-47 but did not know that it had \nbeen modified to allow automatic firing.  480 F.3d 597, \n602 (1st Cir. 2007).  We stated that \u201c[w]hile an \nautomatic weapon meets the definition of a machine \ngun, a semi-automatic weapon does not.\u201d  Id. at 600 \n(citing Staples, 511 U.S. at 602 & n.1). \nMexico argues that Staples and Nieves-Casta\u00f1o are \ninapposite because those cases were about the mens \nrea requirement for a possession crime, not the \ndefinition of \u201cmachinegun.\u201d  It cites a district court \ncase from Nevada distinguishing Staples on this basis.  \nSee Parsons v. Colt\u2019s Mfg. Co., No. 19-cv-01189, 2020 \nWL 1821306, at *5 (D. Nev. Apr. 10, 2020), modified \non reconsideration, No. 19-cv-01189, 2020 WL \n2309259 (D. Nev. May 8, 2020).  But critical to the \nholdings of both Staples and Nieves- Casta\u00f1o was that \nknowing \npossession \nof \na \nreadily \nconvertible \n\n309a \n \nsemiautomatic weapon does not constitute de facto \nknowing possession of a \u201cmachinegun.\u201d  In other \nwords, a readily convertible semiautomatic weapon is \nnot, without more, the same as an automatic weapon.  \nMexico\u2019s reading would erase this distinction\u2014\ncreating an equivalency that the holdings of Staples \nand Nieves-Casta\u00f1o do not allow.  It would also \neffectively outlaw the knowing possession of any \nsemiautomatic \nweapon, \nsince \n\u201cvirtually \nany \nsemiautomatic weapon may be converted . . . into a \nmachinegun within the meaning of the Act.\u201d  See \nStaples, 511 U.S. at 615.  Whether convertible \nsemiautomatic weapons are to be prohibited in their \nentirety is not an issue presented by this appeal. \nC. \nThe final hurdle that Mexico must clear is the \npredicate exception\u2019s proximate cause requirement.  A \nviolation of a predicate statute allows a lawsuit to \nproceed only if \u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of \nthe harm for which relief is sought.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nProximate cause \u201cdemand[s] \u2018some direct relation \nbetween the injury asserted and the injurious conduct \nalleged.\u2019\u201d United States v. Kilmartin, 944 F.3d 315, 330 \n(1st Cir. 2019) (quoting Paroline v. United States, 572 \nU.S. 434, 444 (2014)).  \u201cProximate cause is commonly \nunderstood as a function of the foreseeability of the \nharm,\u201d id. at 331, although in certain contexts \nforeseeability alone may be insufficient, see, e.g., Bank \n\n310a \n \nof Am. Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, 202 (2017) \n(Fair Housing Act).8 \nMexico\u2019s \nclaim \nof \nproximate \ncause \nis \nstraightforward: \ndefendants \naid \nand \nabet \nthe \ntrafficking of guns to the Mexican drug cartels, and \nthis trafficking has foreseeably required the Mexican \ngovernment to incur significant costs in response to \nthe increased threats and violence accompanying drug \ncartels armed with an arsenal of military-grade \nweapons. \nDefendants attempt to complicate this causal \ntheory.  They maintain that the chain of causation \nactually has eight steps: (1) manufacturers sell guns \nto distributors; (2) distributors sell the guns to dealers; \n(3) dealers sell the guns to buyers with illegal \nintentions; (4) those buyers sell the guns to smugglers \nor smuggle them into Mexico themselves; (5) the \ncartels buy the guns; (6) the cartels use the guns; (7) \nthe cartels\u2019 use of the guns injures people and property \nin Mexico; and (8) the Mexican government suffers \nderivative financial harm from those injuries.  There \nare at least two fatal flaws in this argument. \nFirst, the starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s \ncausation analysis is the \u201cviolation\u201d of \u201ca State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of \nfirearms.  We ask whether \u201cthe violation\u201d proximately \ncaused \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \nharm. \n \n15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  Here, the violation that defendants \n \n \n8 Neither party proposes a definition of proximate cause specific \nto the predicate exception of the PLCAA. In the absence of any \nsuch suggestions, we apply traditional understandings of \nproximate cause. \n\n311a \n \nallegedly aid and abet occurs when a dealer knowingly \nviolates the law in selling guns intended for cartels.  \nViewed in this light, the relevant chain of causation \nstarts at step 3 of the defendants\u2019 list.  And from that \npoint, the Mexican government\u2019s expenditure of funds \nto parry the cartels is a foreseeable and direct \nconsequence. \nSecond, the fact that one can fashion a multi-step \ndescription of the causal chain does not mean that the \ninjurious conduct and the injury alleged are \ninsufficiently connected.  Consider a defendant who \nfalls asleep at the helm of a large ship, leaning on the \nhelm, so as to move the tiller, which turns the rudder, \nwhich then turns the ship off course, hitting and \nweakening a dike, and thereby causing a reasonably \ncautious downstream farmer to build a levee.  Surely \nthe ability to describe this causation in multiple steps \nwould not mean that, as a matter of law, the negligent \nhelmsperson did not foreseeably cause the farmer \ncompensable harm.  Rather, one would more \nreasonably say that negligently steering the ship \nforeseeably caused the need to shore-up flood defenses.  \nSo, too, here, the complaint plausibly alleges that \naiding and abetting the illegal sale of a large volume \nof assault weapons to the cartels foreseeably caused \nthe Mexican government to shore-up its defenses. \nDefendants nevertheless claim that the Third \nCircuit adopted their view of proximate cause in City \nof Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n\n312a \n \n423-24 (3d Cir. 2002).9  In that case, though, \nPhiladelphia alleged \u201c[a]t most . . . awareness of the \nmeans by which prohibited purchasers end up \npossessing handguns.\u201d  Id. at 424 & n.14.  The \u201ctrace \nrequest information\u201d available at that time \u201cd[id] not \nput a gun manufacturer on notice that a specific \ndistributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id. at 424 n.14.  Thus all gun \nmanufacturers knew was that \u201csome handguns reach \nprohibited purchasers.\u201d  Id.  And without more, the \nplaintiffs could not show \u201cintent on the part of the gun \nmanufacturers.\u201d  Id.  Here, by contrast, Mexico \nexpressly alleges that the defendants did know which \ndealers were making illegal sales. \nDefendants further contend that there is no \nproximate cause because the causal chain contains \nmultiple criminal acts by third parties.  They argue \nthat \u201can \u2018intervening criminal act of a third party\u2019 is \nthe \ntextbook \nintervening \nact,\u201d \nCopithorne \nv. \nFramingham Union Hosp., 520 N.E.2d 139, 141 \n(Mass. 1988).  But the complete sentence in \nCopithorne from which defendants\u2019 brief cherry-picks \nactually states: \u201cThe intervening criminal act of a \nthird party is a superseding cause which breaks the \nchain of proximate causation only where the original \nwrongdoer reasonably could not have foreseen such \nact.\u201d  Id.; see also, e.g., Restatement (Second) of Torts \n\u00a7 448 (intervening crime is superseding cause \u201cunless \nthe actor at the time of his negligent conduct realized \n \n \n9 The Third Circuit decided City of Philadelphia before Congress \nenacted the PLCAA, so it analyzed proximate cause under \nnegligence law, not the PLCAA. 277 F.3d at 422-26. \n\n313a \n \nor should have realized the likelihood . . . that a third \nperson might avail himself of the opportunity to \ncommit such a . . . crime\u201d); id. \u00a7 449 (\u201cIf the likelihood \nthat a third person may act in a particular manner is \nthe hazard or one of the hazards which makes the \nactor negligent, such an act whether innocent, \nnegligent, intentionally tortious, or criminal does not \nprevent the actor from being liable for harm caused \nthereby.\u201d).  Here, the complaint alleges not only that \nit was foreseeable that defendants\u2019 guns would end up \nin the hands of Mexican cartels, but also that \ndefendants actually intended to bring about that \nresult.  And it is certainly foreseeable that Mexican \ndrug cartels\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 weapons\u2014\nwould use those weapons to commit violent crimes.  \nThe acts of these third parties are therefore properly \nconsidered as part of the proximate causation chain. \nDefendants\u2019 superseding-criminal-act argument is \nespecially unconvincing in the context of the PLCAA, \nwhich precludes only those claims \u201cresulting from the \ncriminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u201d by \nsomeone other than the defendant.  15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A).  If a third party\u2019s unlawful act always \nundercuts proximate cause, the predicate exception \nwould be meaningless.  See Abramski v. United States, \n573 \nU.S. \n169, \n183 \nn.8 \n(2014) \n(rejecting \nan \ninterpretation of a gun-control statute that \u201cwould \nrender the statute all but useless\u201d). \nDefendants then shift focus from the conduct to the \ninjury.  They argue that the Mexican government\u2019s \nalleged harms are wholly derivative of injuries \nsuffered by the direct victims of cartel violence, citing \na \u201cgeneral tendency of the law\u201d not to stretch \nproximate causation \u201cbeyond [its] first step\u201d to reach \n\n314a \n \nindirect victims.  Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 \nU.S. 258, 271 (1992) (quoting Associated Gen. \nContractors v. Cal. State Council of Carpenters, 459 \nU.S. 519, 534 (1983)).  Under this principle, \u201ca plaintiff \nwho complained of harm flowing merely from the \nmisfortunes visited upon a third person by the \ndefendant\u2019s acts was generally said to stand at too \nremote a distance to recover.\u201d  Id. at 268-69; see also \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. \nSome courts have applied this principle to bar \nsimilar lawsuits by cities against gun manufacturers.  \nFor example, the Third Circuit held that Philadelphia \nhad not alleged proximate cause because it sought \n\u201creimbursement for expenses that arise only because \nof the use of firearms to injure or threaten City \nresidents,\u201d even though some of the alleged damages \nwere \u201cdifferent from the damages suffered by direct \nvictims of gun violence\u201d\u2014like costs to \u201cinvestigate and \nprosecute gun trafficking [and] to patrol gun infested \nneighborhoods.\u201d  City of Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 425; \nsee also Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 A.2d 98, \n124 (Conn. 2001) (applying similar reasoning). \nOn the other hand, some courts have recognized \nthat selling guns into an illegal market may cause \ndirect harm to a governmental entity that is not \nderivative of harm to its residents.  A court in \nMassachusetts allowed the city of Boston to proceed in \nits lawsuit against firearm companies where the city \nalleged various direct harms resulting from the \ndefendants\u2019 \u201cfueling an illicit market\u201d of guns.  City of \nBoston v. Smith & Wesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 \nWL 1473568, at *6 (Mass. Super. July 13, 2000).  Such \nharms included costs of increased security at public \nschools, costs of increased law enforcement, lower \n\n315a \n \nproperty values, and diminished tax revenues.  Id.  \nThe Supreme Court of Ohio adopted this reasoning, \nfinding direct injuries in the form of \u201csignificant \nexpenses for police, emergency, health, prosecution, \ncorrections and other services.\u201d  Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136, 1148 (Ohio 2002).  \nSimilarly, a New Jersey court rejected a remoteness \nargument with respect to expenditures associated \nwith \u201cdeterrence, investigation of gun crimes, and \nother related services.\u201d  James v. Arms Tech., Inc., 820 \nA.2d 27, 41 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2003); see also \nIn re JUUL Labs, Inc., Mktg., Sales Practices & Prods. \nLiab. Litig., 497 F. Supp. 3d 552, 664-65 (N.D. Cal. \n2020) (finding proximate cause where government \nentities \u201cdo not seek to recover costs expended by . . . \nany other third party\u201d). \nWe find the reasoning of the latter cases persuasive.  \nWhen faced with an epidemic of unlawful gun \ntrafficking into its country, a government will \nforeseeably\u2014indeed inexorably\u2014incur costs of its own \nthat are not merely derivative of those borne by the \ndirect victims of gun violence.  One obvious example is \nthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.  \nThe government directly and uniquely bears these \ncosts as a direct result of defendants\u2019 alleged \nfacilitation of gun trafficking to the Mexican cartels. \nImagine that a U.S. company sent a mercenary unit \nof combat troops to attack people in Mexico City.  Such \nan attack would directly cause Mexico itself the \nexpense of paying soldiers to defend the city.  \nProximate cause would be quite clear.  So, too, here, \n\n316a \n \nwhere the defendants are alleged to have armed the \nattackers for their continuing assaults. \nMexico may also be able to show that other of its \nalleged harms are proximately caused by defendants\u2019 \nactions, and not merely derivative of harms to its \ncitizens.  For example, if Mexico can prove that it had \nto proactively spend more funds to bolster its \nhealthcare facilities, social services, and judicial \nsystem in response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of \ndefendants\u2019 guns, these expenses might also not be \nmerely derivative of the injuries suffered by individual \nvictims.  On the other hand, other alleged harms, such \nas lower economic efficiency due to the decreased size \nof the working population, are derivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.  The bottom line is that \nMexico has plausibly alleged at least some injuries \nthat it has suffered directly from the illegal trafficking \nof guns into Mexico, and that are not merely derivative \nof the harm suffered by the victims of gun violence. \nThis conclusion is consistent with Supreme Court \nprecedent.  In Holmes (a RICO case), the Court held \nthat there was no proximate cause linking the \ndefendants\u2019 manipulation of stock prices, which \ncaused broker-dealers who purchased the stock to \nexperience financial distress, to the harm suffered by \nthe broker-dealers\u2019 customers when the broker-dealers \ncould not pay the customers\u2019 claims.  503 U.S. at 271-\n74.  In that case, the only path from the stock \nmanipulation to the customers\u2019 harm was through the \nbroker-dealers\u2019 harm.  Id. at 271 (\u201c[T]he conspirators \nhave allegedly injured these customers only insofar as \nthe stock manipulation first injured the broker-dealers \n\n317a \n \nand left them without the wherewithal to pay \ncustomers\u2019 claims.\u201d). \nContrast the situation in Holmes from one \ncontemplated by the Court in Lexmark: \nConsider two rival carmakers who purchase \nairbags for their cars from different third-party \nmanufacturers.  If the first carmaker, hoping to \ndivert sales from the second, falsely proclaims \nthat the airbags used by the second carmaker are \ndefective, both the second carmaker and its \nairbag supplier may suffer reputational injury, \nand their sales may decline as a result.  In those \ncircumstances, there is no reason to regard either \nparty\u2019s injury as derivative of the other\u2019s; each is \ndirectly and independently harmed by the attack \non its merchandise. \n572 U.S. at 138-39. \nThis case is more like the airbag example in \nLexmark than the stock manipulation in Holmes.  \nUnlike in Holmes, the causal path from the gun \ntrafficking to the Mexican government\u2019s expenditures \ndoes not flow solely through the harm suffered by \nvictims of gun violence.  Rather, like in the airbag \nexample, the harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of gun \nviolence and directly to the Mexican government.  \nAdmittedly, the government\u2019s expenditures are \npresumably in large part for the purpose of preventing \nand mitigating the harm from gun violence to its \ncitizens.  But that does not make it \u201cpurely derivative\u201d \nin the sense that sometimes defeats proximate cause.  \nSee id. at 133. \n\n318a \n \nDefendants\u2019 final attack on proximate cause is a \npragmatic one.  Defendants point to two \u201cfunctional \nfactors\u201d that courts apply while analyzing proximate \ncause under RICO: the feasibility of \u201cascertain[ing] \nthe amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages attributable to the \nviolation, as distinct from other, independent, factors\u201d; \nand the \u201cadministrability\u201d of apportioning damages \nwithout \u201cmultiple recoveries.\u201d  Sterling Suffolk \nRacecourse, LLC v. Wynn Resorts, Ltd., 990 F.3d 31, \n35-36 (1st Cir. 2021) (quoting In re Neurontin Mktg. & \nSales Pracs. Litig., 712 F.3d 21, 35-36 (1st Cir. 2013)). \nAssuming these considerations apply outside of the \nRICO context, they would not require the dismissal of \nthe complaint in this case.  The foregoing discussion \nconcerning Mexico\u2019s non-derivative harm disposes of \ndefendants\u2019 concern about multiple recoveries.  We are \nalso not persuaded that determining the damages \nattributable to each defendant will be as difficult as \ndefendants suggest.  And in this case any such \ndifficulties are best resolved once Mexico has had an \nopportunity to engage in discovery and submit expert \nreports bearing on damages.  Accord City of Boston, \n2000 WL 1473568, at *7 n.33 (\u201cThe difficulty in \nascertaining damages in this case is best assessed \nwhen the case has gone beyond the pleading stage.\u201d).  \nIn any event, Mexico seeks injunctive relief in addition \nto damages, and defendants\u2019 concerns about double \nrecoveries and apportioning damages do not apply to \ninjunctive relief.  Cf. Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven \nwhen a plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with \nsufficient certainty to recover damages, it may still be \nentitled to injunctive relief . . . .\u201d). \nWe conclude that Mexico has adequately alleged \nproximate causation, thereby satisfying the final \n\n319a \n \ndemand of the predicate exception.  Of course, our \nholding at this stage is based on the allegations in the \ncomplaint, construed favorably to Mexico.  Mexico will \nhave to support its theory of proximate causation with \nevidence later in the proceedings. \nV. \nThe parties\u2019 briefing touches on certain issues \nbeyond the PLCAA, including which jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.  The district court did not reach these issues \nbecause it found the PLCAA dispositive.  Having \nconcluded that the PLCAA does not bar Mexico\u2019s \nlawsuit at this stage of the proceedings, we think it \nprudent to allow the district court to address the \nremaining issues in the first instance, rather than \ndeciding them ourselves without the benefit of the \ndistrict court\u2019s analysis or focused briefing from the \nparties. \nVI. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we reverse the district \ncourt\u2019s conclusion that the PLCAA bars Mexico\u2019s tort \nclaims and remand to the district court for further \nproceedings consistent with this opinion.\n\n320a \n \nAPPENDIX D \n15 U.S.C.

Findings; purposes \n(a) Findings \nCongress finds the following: \n(1) The Second Amendment to the United States \nConstitution provides that the right of the people to \nkeep and bear arms shall not be infringed. \n(2) The Second Amendment to the United States \nConstitution protects the rights of individuals, \nincluding those who are not members of a militia or \nengaged in military service or training, to keep and \nbear arms. \n(3) Lawsuits have been commenced against \nmanufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers \nof firearms that operate as designed and intended, \nwhich seek money damages and other relief for the \nharm caused by the misuse of firearms by third \nparties, including criminals. \n\n321a \n \n(4) The manufacture, importation, possession, \nsale, and use of firearms and ammunition in the \nUnited States are heavily regulated by Federal, \nState, and local laws.  Such Federal laws include the \nGun Control Act of 1968, the National Firearms Act \n[26 U.S.C. 5801 et seq.], and the Arms Export \nControl Act [22 U.S.C. 2751 et seq.]. \n(5) Businesses in the United States that are \nengaged in interstate and foreign commerce through \nthe \nlawful \ndesign, \nmanufacture, \nmarketing, \ndistribution, importation, or sale to the public of \nfirearms or ammunition products that have been \nshipped or transported in interstate or foreign \ncommerce are not, and should not, be liable for the \nharm caused by those who criminally or unlawfully \nmisuse firearm products or ammunition products \nthat function as designed and intended. \n(6) The possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by \nothers is an abuse of the legal system, erodes public \nconfidence in our Nation\u2019s laws, threatens the \ndiminution of a basic constitutional right and civil \nliberty, invites the disassembly and destabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors lawfully \ncompeting in the free enterprise system of the United \nStates, and constitutes an unreasonable burden on \ninterstate and foreign commerce of the United \nStates. \n(7) \nThe \nliability \nactions \ncommenced \nor \ncontemplated by the Federal Government, States, \nmunicipalities, and private interest groups and \nothers are based on theories without foundation in \nhundreds of years of the common law and \n\n322a \n \njurisprudence of the United States and do not \nrepresent a bona fide expansion of the common law.  \nThe possible sustaining of these actions by a \nmaverick judicial officer or petit jury would expand \ncivil liability in a manner never contemplated by the \nframers of the Constitution, by Congress, or by the \nlegislatures of the several States.  Such an expansion \nof liability would constitute a deprivation of the \nrights, privileges, and immunities guaranteed to a \ncitizen of the United States under the Fourteenth \nAmendment to the United States Constitution. \n(8) \nThe \nliability \nactions \ncommenced \nor \ncontemplated by the Federal Government, States, \nmunicipalities, private interest groups and others \nattempt to use the judicial branch to circumvent the \nLegislative branch of government to regulate \ninterstate and foreign commerce through judgments \nand judicial decrees thereby threatening the \nSeparation of Powers doctrine and weakening and \nundermining important principles of federalism, \nState sovereignty and comity between the sister \nStates. \n(b) Purposes \nThe purposes of this chapter are as follows: \n(1) \nTo \nprohibit \ncauses \nof \naction \nagainst \nmanufacturers, distributors, dealers, and importers \nof firearms or ammunition products, and their trade \nassociations, for the harm solely caused by the \ncriminal or unlawful misuse of firearm products or \nammunition products by others when the product \nfunctioned as designed and intended. \n(2) To preserve a citizen\u2019s access to a supply of \nfirearms and ammunition for all lawful purposes, \n\n323a \n \nincluding hunting, self-defense, collecting, and \ncompetitive or recreational shooting. \n(3) To guarantee a citizen\u2019s rights, privileges, and \nimmunities, as applied to the States, under the \nFourteenth Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, pursuant to section 5 of that \nAmendment. \n(4) To prevent the use of such lawsuits to impose \nunreasonable burdens on interstate and foreign \ncommerce. \n(5) To protect the right, under the First \nAmendment to the Constitution, of manufacturers, \ndistributors, dealers, and importers of firearms or \nammunition products, and trade associations, to \nspeak freely, to assemble peaceably, and to petition \nthe Government for a redress of their grievances. \n(6) To preserve and protect the Separation of \nPowers doctrine and important principles of \nfederalism, State sovereignty and comity between \nsister States. \n(7) To exercise congressional power under article \nIV, section 1 (the Full Faith and Credit Clause) of the \nUnited States Constitution. \n(Pub.

Based on the initial analysis of the task, I have now established a foundational understanding. The central issue is the scope of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), a federal statute that generally shields gun manufacturers from liability. The key to the case appears to be the PLCAA's \"predicate exception,\" which allows lawsuits for knowing violations of statutes related to the sale or marketing of firearms. The First Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that Mexico's lawsuit could proceed under this exception, finding that Mexico had plausibly alleged that the manufacturers' business practices constituted aiding and abetting the illegal trafficking of firearms into Mexico, which proximately caused the harm the country suffered. My prediction will therefore hinge on how the Supreme Court interprets the scope of this predicate exception and the principles of proximate causation in the context of harms occurring in a foreign country.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief was that I had no knowledge of effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. The initial reasoning process has provided a strong set of foundational heuristics and a general methodology. I now believe that an effective strategy involves a two-pronged approach:\n1.  **Case-Specific Analysis:** First, build a deep understanding of the specific legal arguments by analyzing primary source documents. The most valuable initial sources are the petitioners' and respondent's briefs, as they will define the precise legal questions and statutory language in dispute.\n2.  **General Predictive Factor Analysis:** Second, overlay the case-specific facts with broader, historically predictive factors. I have identified several key factors to investigate:\n    *   **The Solicitor General's Position:** The U.S. government's stance is often highly influential on the Court. Finding and analyzing the Solicitor General's amicus brief is a high-priority action.\n    *   **Judicial Philosophy:** For cases of statutory interpretation like this one, understanding the justices' preferred interpretive methods (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism) is critical.\n    *   **Precedent and Doctrinal Patterns:** The Court's recent history on related issues, such as corporate liability, the extraterritorial application of U.S. law, and proximate causation, will provide important context.\nThis structured approach\u2014moving from the specific legal arguments in the briefs to broader predictive patterns\u2014is now my core strategy for information gathering and analysis."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to center on the interpretation of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) and its \"predicate exception.\" My initial belief was that the case hinged on how the Supreme Court would interpret the scope of this exception and the principles of proximate causation. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari from the gun manufacturers (Petitioners) has significantly sharpened this understanding by revealing their specific legal strategy.\n\nThe Petitioners' arguments are twofold and attack both necessary elements of the predicate exception: a \"knowing violation\" of a statute and \"proximate cause.\"\n\n1.  **Aiding and Abetting (The \"Knowing Violation\" Element):** The Petitioners argue forcefully that their conduct does not constitute \"aiding and abetting\" illegal firearms trafficking. Their central pillar for this argument is the Supreme Court's recent, unanimous 2023 decision in *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh*. They contend that *Taamneh* established that simply providing a product or service with general knowledge that criminals might misuse it is not enough for aiding-and-abetting liability. They frame Mexico's lawsuit as a \"passive aiding-and-abetting theory\" that alleges nothing more than the defendants making firearms generally available while knowing some are trafficked, which they claim *Taamneh* directly forecloses. This is a powerful argument, as it relies on the Court's most recent and unanimous statement on a closely related issue.\n\n2.  **Proximate Cause:** The Petitioners argue that the First Circuit's decision \"eviscerates\" the proximate cause requirement of the PLCAA. They characterize the causal chain from their lawful manufacturing in the U.S. to the harm suffered by the Mexican government as an attenuated \"eight-step Rube Goldberg\" involving multiple independent criminal acts by third parties (e.g., straw purchasers, smugglers, cartels). They cite established Supreme Court precedent like *Holmes v. Securities Investor Prot. Corp.* to argue for a more direct link between conduct and harm. Crucially, they claim the First Circuit's ruling creates a circuit split with a Third Circuit decision (*City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp.*), which was notably joined by then-Judge Alito.\n\nMy prediction is now leaning more strongly in favor of the Petitioners. The reliance on a recent, unanimous precedent like *Taamneh* provides a very clear path for the Court to reverse the First Circuit without creating new law. The proximate cause argument, bolstered by a claimed circuit split, further strengthens their position.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial strategy of a two-pronged approach (Case-Specific Analysis and General Predictive Factor Analysis) has been strongly validated and refined by this observation.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization:** The Certiorari Petition has proven to be an exceptionally high-value primary source. It provides a concise, powerful, and legally sophisticated roadmap of one party's entire case. My initial heuristic to prioritize the main briefs from the petitioner and respondent is confirmed as a highly effective starting point for case-specific analysis.\n\n2.  **Heuristic Development & Refinement:** My set of general predictive heuristics has grown more sophisticated:\n    *   **Primacy of Recent, Unanimous Precedent:** The Petitioners' heavy reliance on *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* highlights a critical new heuristic: *A recent, unanimous Supreme Court decision on a core legal principle at issue is an extremely strong predictor of the outcome.* The Court is unlikely to contradict its own fresh and undivided thinking.\n    *   **The \"Circuit Split\" Hook:** The Petitioners' explicit framing of a circuit split, especially one involving a sitting Justice (Alito), confirms the importance of this factor. It is not just a procedural reason for the Court to take a case, but often a substantive signal that a majority of the Court may already be aligned with the position of the other circuit. Future analysis must actively search for and evaluate claims of circuit splits.\n    *   **Analyze Rhetorical Framing:** The Petitioners' framing of the case as a \"clash of national values,\" an instance of \"lawfare\" by a foreign sovereign, and a threat to Second Amendment rights demonstrates that legal arguments are not presented in a vacuum. Understanding the political and philosophical framing is crucial for predicting how arguments will land with justices who have well-defined judicial philosophies.\n\nMy methodology is evolving. I now see the value in a sequential analysis of the primary briefs: reading the Petitioner's brief first establishes a strong baseline of their arguments and key precedents, which then creates a focused set of questions to answer when analyzing the Respondent's brief (e.g., \"How do they distinguish *Taamneh*?\"). This structured approach seems more efficient than trying to synthesize everything at once."

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v.

July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n20: 20240703141240416_23-114120Hogan20Lovells20CoC.json (score: 0.488)\nNo. 23-1141 \nIN THE \nAnspretne Court of the giniteb Otate0 \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nfor the First Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains \n8,747 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court \nRule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 3rd day o \nuly 202 \nAZA SALT y5ER \nON \nNOTARY PUBLIC \nDistrict of Columbia \nMy commission expires April 30, 2029.\n\n63: 20240703141249275_23-114120Hogan20Lovells20CoS.json (score: 0.473)\nEst. :4+ \nWILSONOES \nPRINTING \n(a, INC. \nE-Mail Address: \nbriefs@wilsonepes.com \nWeb Site: \nwww.wilsonepes.com \nNo. 23-1141 \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n1115 H Street, N.E. \nWashington, D.C. 20002 \nTel (202) 789-0096 \nFax (202) 842-4896 \nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on July 3, 2024, three (3) copies of the BRIEF IN OPPOSITION in the \nabove-captioned case were served, as required by U.S. Supreme Court Rule 29.5(c), on the \nfollowing: \nNOEL J.

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y.

July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case remains centered on the interpretation of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), its \"predicate exception,\" and the common law principles of proximate causation. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari provided a clear roadmap of the gun manufacturers' (Petitioners') legal strategy, which has heavily influenced my predictive model.\n\nMy beliefs, shaped by the Petitioners' arguments, are as follows:\n1.  **The \"Knowing Violation\" Element:** The Petitioners' argument that their conduct does not constitute \"aiding and abetting\" under the predicate exception is very strong. Their reliance on the Supreme Court's recent and unanimous decision in *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* is the cornerstone of this position. They argue that *Taamneh* forecloses liability for merely providing a product with general awareness that it might be misused by third parties. This precedent provides the Court with a straightforward, non-controversial path to reverse the First Circuit.\n2.  **The \"Proximate Cause\" Element:** The Petitioners' second major argument is that the causal chain between their legal U.S. sales and the harm to the Mexican government is too attenuated, broken by numerous independent criminal acts. They ground this in established precedent like *Holmes v. Securities Investor Prot. Corp.* and, critically, claim the First Circuit's ruling creates a circuit split with a Third Circuit decision that then-Judge Alito joined.\n\nBased on this, my prediction leans strongly in favor of the Petitioners. However, this latest observation\u2014my own internal reasoning\u2014serves as a crucial check on this belief. It confirms that my current understanding is one-sided. My confidence in a pro-Petitioner outcome is provisional and contingent on the weakness of the Respondent's (Mexico's) counter-arguments. My primary uncertainty is now sharply defined: I must discover how Mexico will attempt to distinguish the facts of this case from the precedent set in *Taamneh* and how they will defend the First Circuit's proximate cause analysis. My analysis is now primed to seek answers to these specific questions in Mexico's brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for predicting Supreme Court outcomes continues to evolve from a set of static heuristics into a dynamic, procedural strategy for inquiry.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization:** The high value of primary source briefs is re-confirmed. Starting with the Petitioner's Certiorari Petition is an effective way to establish the core legal battleground.\n2.  **Heuristic Refinement:** My key predictive heuristics, developed from the Petitioner's brief, remain central:\n    *   **Primacy of Recent, Unanimous Precedent:** The emphasis on *Twitter v. Taamneh* confirms that such decisions are powerful predictive tools, as the Court is disinclined to quickly undermine its own recent, unified holdings.\n    *   **The \"Circuit Split\" Hook:** The claim of a circuit split, especially one involving a sitting Justice, is a major factor for both the Court taking the case and for predicting the eventual merits decision.\n    *   **Analyze Rhetorical Framing:** The political and philosophical framing of legal arguments remains a crucial element for understanding how they will be received by the Justices.\n3.  **Process and Strategy Evolution:** My approach to information gathering has become more sophisticated.\n    *   **Sequential Analysis:** The strategy of analyzing the Petitioner's brief first to establish a baseline, followed by the Respondent's brief, is validated as an efficient method. It creates a focused inquiry, turning the reading of the second brief into an active search for answers to specific questions (e.g., \"How do they counter the *Taamneh* argument?\").\n    *   **The Metacognitive Check:** This observation highlights a new, critical step in my design process: the \"strategic pause\" or metacognitive check. After processing a major piece of evidence (like a party's main brief), it is essential to stop and explicitly:\n        1.  Summarize the current belief state.\n        2.  Identify the most significant remaining uncertainties.\n        3.  Formulate the next information-gathering action to directly target those uncertainties.\n    This transforms the process from passively accumulating data to actively and efficiently managing my own ignorance. It is the core of an optimal experimental design strategy."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has become significantly more nuanced. While my initial analysis, based on the Petitioners' brief, pointed towards a likely reversal, the Respondent's Brief in Opposition has introduced substantial counterarguments that balance the scales and increase my uncertainty about the outcome.\n\n1.  **The \"Knowing Violation\" / *Taamneh* Debate:** My prior belief was that the Petitioners' reliance on *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* provided a clear path to victory. Mexico's brief has effectively challenged this. They are not arguing to overturn *Taamneh* but to distinguish it on the facts. Their core argument is that the gun manufacturers' alleged conduct is not \"passive indifference\" or the provision of a neutral service (like Twitter's platform), but rather \"affirmative and intentional conduct\" designed to profit from the illegal market. They substantiate this with specific allegations from the complaint:\n    *   **Targeted Marketing:** Designing and marketing firearms to appeal specifically to cartels, such as Colt's \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol, which is allegedly a cartel favorite.\n    *   **Willful Supply Chain Management:** Knowingly supplying a small subset of dealers responsible for a high volume of crime guns, and continuing to supply them even after being notified of their role in illegal trafficking.\n    *   **Active Resistance to Safety:** Actively resisting and reneging on agreements (e.g., the 2000 federal settlement) to implement safer sales practices.\n    This reframes the question from \"Are they liable for third-party misuse?\" to \"Did they aid and abet illegal sales through their own affirmative actions?\" This distinction makes the application of *Taamneh* far less certain and weakens it as a dispositive precedent for this case.\n\n2.  **The \"Proximate Cause\" & Circuit Split Argument:** My previous belief, shaped by the Petitioners, was that the First Circuit's proximate cause analysis was an outlier that created a circuit split, particularly with a Third Circuit case involving then-Judge Alito. Mexico's brief directly and persuasively attacks this claim. They argue there is no true split because the cases cited by Petitioners were:\n    *   Decided *before* the enactment of PLCAA and therefore did not interpret the specific proximate cause standard of the statute's \"predicate exception.\"\n    *   Applied varying state common-law doctrines, not a uniform federal standard.\n    *   Based on different and less detailed factual allegations.\n    By arguing \"Different courts applying different laws to different facts reaching different conclusions is not a split,\" Mexico significantly undermines a primary reason for the Supreme Court to grant certiorari.\n\n3.  **Statutory Interpretation of PLCAA:** Mexico has added a new layer to the analysis by citing PLCAA's legislative history. They quote the bill's sponsors (Sens. Craig, Hatch, Sessions) emphasizing that the Act was not intended to protect manufacturers from liability for their \"own negligence or criminal conduct.\" This supports their interpretation that the \"predicate exception\" is meant to cover exactly the kind of intentional, unlawful conduct they have alleged.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction:** My prediction has shifted from strongly favoring the Petitioners to a state of high uncertainty. Mexico has presented a plausible legal and factual framework for why the First Circuit's decision should stand, or at the very least, why the Supreme Court should deny certiorari at this early stage. The case now appears less like a clean question of law and more like a fact-intensive dispute over whether the manufacturers' specific actions constitute aiding and abetting. The Court may be inclined to deny the petition and let the case proceed to discovery to develop a factual record, adopting Mexico's \"poor vehicle\" argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for analyzing Supreme Court cases continues to mature, with this observation providing crucial refinements to my heuristics and overall process.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization & Sequential Analysis:** The strategy of analyzing the Petitioner's cert petition first, followed by a targeted reading of the Respondent's Brief in Opposition, is powerfully validated. This sequential approach allowed me to establish the core legal battleground and then efficiently seek out the direct counterarguments, maximizing the value of each information-gathering step.\n\n2.  **Heuristic Refinement:** My core heuristics have become more sophisticated:\n    *   **Primacy of Recent, Unanimous Precedent:** This heuristic holds, but with a critical update. The key battle is often not about the precedent itself, but its *applicability*. A party can effectively neutralize a powerful precedent like *Taamneh* by plausibly arguing that the facts of the current case fall outside its scope. My future analysis must focus on how each side frames the factual record to either fit within or distinguish itself from controlling precedent.\n    *   **The \"Circuit Split\" Hook:** A claimed circuit split is a major driver for certiorari, but it is not infallible. I have learned to apply a new sub-heuristic: *verify the split*. I must now actively question whether the allegedly conflicting cases were decided under the same statute, the same legal standard, and on comparable facts. A well-crafted brief in opposition can dismantle this hook by showing the split is illusory.\n    *   **Analyze Rhetorical Framing:** The power of narrative framing is clearer than ever. Mexico's brief successfully shifts the narrative from \"blaming a lawful industry for criminal misuse\" to \"holding companies accountable for their own alleged intentional and unlawful business practices.\" This is a crucial element in predicting how arguments will land with the Justices.\n\n3.  **Process and Strategy Evolution:** My DBOED process has incorporated a new, vital component and refined existing ones.\n    *   **The Metacognitive Check:** The \"strategic pause\" I implemented after the last observation proved to be the most valuable new step in my process. By explicitly identifying my uncertainties (how Mexico would counter *Taamneh* and the circuit split), I was able to formulate a precise search query that led directly to this highly informative brief. This confirms that actively managing my own ignorance is central to an optimal design strategy.\n    *   **The \"Poor Vehicle\" Heuristic:** I am adding a new predictive factor to my model: the procedural posture of the case. A respondent's argument that a case is a \"poor vehicle\" for review because it is at an early, factually undeveloped stage (like a motion to dismiss) is a standard and often effective reason for the Court to deny certiorari. I will now weigh this factor heavily when assessing the probability of a cert grant.\n    *   **Cumulative Knowledge:** My understanding is no longer just a snapshot but a developing story. I can now trace the evolution of the core legal debate from the Petitioners' initial framing to the Respondent's direct rebuttal, giving me a much richer, multi-dimensional view of the legal landscape of this specific case."

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailer\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n87: 20241126130716174_COC.json (score: 0.533)\nNo. 23-1141\n\nINTHE\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\n\u2018SMITH & WeSSON BRANDS, INC.

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailers or buyers\u2014such \nas requiring them to show some \u201clegitimate need\u201d \nbefore buying an AR-15. Id. 104a (\u00b6 315).  \nBecause Petitioners allegedly know that some \ndownstream dealers make unlawful sales, and \nbecause they have failed to adopt measures to stop \nsuch sales, Mexico alleges that they are an \u201caccessory\u201d \nto those sales. Namely, Petitioners \u201ccontinue[] to \nsupply, support, or assist\u201d those sales\u2014i.e., they have \ncontinued \nlongstanding \nmanufacturing \nand \ndistribution practices\u2014even with the \u201cknowledge\u201d \nthat some criminals have been able to exploit the \nstatus quo, leading to a flow of firearms being \nsmuggled into Mexico. Id. 42a (\u00b6 110); BIO 25-26. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nBased on these allegations, Mexico asserts a wide \nvariety of claims, primarily under Mexican tort law \n(which it insists should apply). Id. 183a-95a (\u00b6\u00b6 506-\n60). The complaint seeks $10 billion in damages. See \nid. \n195a-96a. \nIt \nalso \nrequests \ntransformative \ninjunctive relief, id.\u2014including, among much else, a \nban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d; a ban on firearms capable \nof holding \u201clarge-capacity magazines\u201d; strict limits on \n\u201cmultiple sales\u201d of firearms; and far-reaching \nbackground checks, beyond what American law now \nrequires. See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 132a-34a, 140a-41 \n(\u00b6\u00b6 245, 369, 379-84).  \nC. The Decisions Below. \nThe district court dismissed Mexico\u2019s suit in full. \nThe court first rejected Mexico\u2019s \u201cextraterritoriality\u201d \nargument, holding that PLCAA fully applies to suits \nbrought by foreign sovereigns in American courts \nagainst American firearms companies based on their \ndomestic \noperations \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nPet.App.233a-239a. The district court further held \nthat Mexico\u2019s case is \u201cexactly\u201d the \u201ctype of action\u201d \nPLCAA was passed to prevent, and that the suit had \nto be \u201cimmediately\u201d dismissed. Pet.App.232a-33a. \nThe First Circuit reversed. It agreed with the \ndistrict court in rejecting Mexico\u2019s extraterritoriality \nargument. Id. 293a. But it agreed with Mexico\u2019s \nfallback argument that its claims could nevertheless \nproceed because they satisfied PLCAA\u2019s predicate \nexception. Id. 293a-94a. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nFirst \nCircuit \nheld \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 alleged longstanding business practices \nviolated the federal ban on \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the \nunlawful sale of firearms by independent licensed \n\n \n12 \n \n \ndealers. The court acknowledged that, \u201cof course,\u201d \nMexico did \u201cnot allege defendants\u2019 awareness of any \nparticular unlawful sale.\u201d Id. 305a. But it noted that \nPetitioners \u201ccan identify\u201d the downstream dealers \nthat \u201care responsible for the illegal sales\u201d of firearms \nthat end up in Mexico. Id. 301a. And it quoted this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Twitter that \u201ca secondary \ndefendant\u2019s role in an illicit enterprise can be so \nsystemic that the secondary defendant is aiding and \nabetting every wrongful act committed by that \nenterprise.\u201d Id. 306a (quoting Twitter, 598 U.S. at \n496). The court then held that Petitioners fit that \ndescription, because they \u201coperate at a systemic level, \nallegedly designing, marketing, and distributing their \nguns so that demand by the cartels continues to boost \nsales,\u201d making them complicit in dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales. Id.  \nThe First Circuit also held that the complaint \nsatisfied proximate cause because Petitioners\u2019 alleged \n\u201caiding and abetting the illegal sale of a large volume \nof assault weapons to the cartels foreseeably caused \nthe Mexican government to shore-up its defenses,\u201d \nand to incur related costs. Id. 311a. \nWhile the petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court dismissed six of the eight defendants for \nlack of personal jurisdiction. Dct.Dkt.220. This Court \nthen granted certiorari. Undeterred, Mexico moved \nthe district court for partial final judgment under \nRule 54(b) so it could appeal that personal-jurisdiction \nruling. That court, however, stayed proceedings to \nawait this Court\u2019s decision. Dct.Dkt.228. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. To qualify for PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, the \ndefendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct must be \u201ca \nproximate cause\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s asserted injuries. \nHere, Mexico relies on an eight-step causal chain\u2014\npeppered by independent criminal actors and \nderivative sovereign harms\u2014to try to link the lawful \nproduction and sale of firearms within the United \nStates to the chaos ravaging Mexico courtesy of its \ndrug cartels. If this attenuated theory of liability \nsatisfies proximate cause, that term has no meaning. \nA. PLCAA incorporates the traditional principle \nthat proximate cause means direct cause. And a \ncausal chain is not direct when it is interrupted by an \nindependent act carried out by an independent \nactor\u2014much less multiple independent acts, and even \nless multiple crimes. Accordingly, the general rule is \nthat a company that makes or sells a lawful product \nis not a proximate cause of harms resulting from third \nparties\u2019 independent criminal misuse of that product, \nbecause that independent misuse is the direct cause\u2014\nnot the creation and distribution of the lawful product. \nB. Mexico\u2019s causal chain here is extraordinarily \nindirect. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, crime after crime, spanning an international \nborder, all to link Petitioners\u2019 conduct in this country \nto the mayhem south of the border. That stretches \nproximate cause far beyond anything this Court has \nseen. Indeed, if Mexico can establish proximate cause \nhere, it is impossible to see who cannot\u2014to the peril \nof virtually every industry. But the central function of \nproximate cause is to maintain the floodgates of \nliability. Mexico\u2019s lawsuit would bomb the levees. \n\n \n14 \n \n \nC. Mexico tries to salvage its complaint from its \nmany infirmities, but it cannot escape the attenuated \nnature of its suit. In the main, Mexico tries to cut a \nfew links from its causal chain by arguing that its \nrelevant starting point is not Petitioners\u2019 own \nconduct, but rather the unlawful sale of firearms by \ndownstream dealers. Yet that runs headlong into \nPLCAA\u2019s text, which expressly authorizes claims only \nwhen a firearm company\u2019s own \u201cviolation\u201d of the law \nproximately harmed the plaintiff. And here, that \nalleged violation is aiding and abetting\u2014not any later \noffense. \nBut even if Mexico were right\u2014and the causal \nchain began at unlawful sales by independent \ndealers\u2014it would still fall far short of satisfying \nproximate cause. Even on this framing, some of those \nsales would still have to get illegally smuggled into \nMexico by independent criminals, where some would \nthen illegally end up with the cartels, who then would \nuse some to commit crimes in Mexico, which then \nwould cause financial harms to Mexico\u2019s government. \nSo even on its preferred terms, Mexico\u2019s chain must be \ndragged across an international border and carried by \na cast of independent criminals committing a bevy of \nindependent crimes. However one cuts it, Mexico\u2019s \ntheory of causation is far too indirect. \nII. PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception also requires that \na firearms company violate a firearms-specific \nstatute. Here, Mexico says Petitioners\u2019 longstanding \nand strictly regulated business practices amount to \naiding and abetting every unlawful sale of their \nproducts \nby \nindependent \nfirearms \ndealers \ndownstream. That theory is as wrong as it sounds. \n\n \n15 \n \n \nA. Aiding-and-abetting liability requires culpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., some affirmative act taken for the \npurpose of assisting the commission of a crime. \nTypically, accomplice liability is tied to a specific \nunlawful act. In rare cases, one can be an accomplice \nto an unlawful criminal enterprise\u2014on the hook for \nall its misdoings. But for such sweeping liability to \nattach, the support must be pervasive and systemic. \nManufacturers and suppliers are not guilty of \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d downstream crimes when they \ndo nothing but make and sell lawful products in the \nordinary course. Every business knows its products \nmay be misused\u2014even criminally so\u2014by customers \ndownstream. But such knowledge has never been \nenough to generate criminal liability, lest the entire \neconomy grind to a halt. Instead, courts have long \nheld that businesses are not accomplices to the \ncriminal misuse of their products unless they take \nsome atypical action for the purpose of assisting a \ncrime. And no court has ever held that the routine \npractices of a lawful industry can constitute the kind \nof pervasive and systemic aid required for a business \nto be categorically liable for all its customers\u2019 crimes. \nB. Mexico has not unearthed a decades-long aiding-\nand-abetting scheme. To start, Mexico admits its suit \nis not tied to any specific unlawful sale\u2014for example, \nit does not allege that any Petitioner sold a particular \nfirearm knowing it would be unlawfully sold or \notherwise misused in some specific unlawful act. \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s theory is premised on Petitioners \nassisting unlawful firearm sellers writ large. Mexico \nthus must allege pervasive and systemic assistance on \nthe part of the firearms industry to substantiate its \naiding-and-abetting claim.  \n\n \n16 \n \n \nThis it cannot do. Mexico\u2019s suit rests on nothing but \nPetitioners\u2019 routine business practices. Indeed, that is \nthe whole point: It is a challenge to the industry\u2019s \nrefusal to go beyond what American firearms laws \nrequire, by adopting policies Mexico thinks would \nstem unlawful downstream sales. But failing to adopt \nmeasures to make others follow the law does not make \none complicit in their illegal actions. And where, as \nhere, a lawful industry simply continues to supply a \nlawful product in an ordinary manner, its decision to \nstay the course cannot turn it into an accomplice.  \nC. Mexico says that its case is different, because \nPetitioners know the identities of some downstream \nbad-actor dealers, and have chosen not to purge them \nfrom the supply chain. But that is just wrong: Again, \nthe complaint does not allege facts showing a single \nPetitioner has knowingly sold a single firearm to a \nsingle dealer actually engaged in illicit sales. But even \nif Petitioners did know the identity of some \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndealers \nwho \nsometimes made unlawful sales, failing to take \naffirmative steps to purge those dealers from \ndownstream supply chains would still not make \nPetitioners criminal accomplices\u2014just as failing to \ncut off college-town bars does not make a felon out of \nBudweiser, and failing to purge ISIS-related accounts \nwas not enough for liability in Twitter. When the \nmanufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply \nputs its product in the general stream of commerce, \nthe aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that \nbusiness with broadly policing every bad actor who \nmay pick up its products downstream. \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAMERICAN FIREARMS COMPANIES ARE NOT A \nPROXIMATE CAUSE OF MEXICO\u2019S INJURIES. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nmust show that a firearms company\u2019s illegal conduct \nwas \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of its alleged harms. 15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nMexico \nalleges \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing and sale of firearms in the \nUnited States has led to violent cartel crime in \nMexico, ultimately resulting in a variety of costs borne \nby the Mexican government.  \nMexico\u2019s suit falls far short of what proximate cause \ndemands. Proximate cause means direct cause. And \nwhen a causal chain depends on independent acts \ndone by independent actors (let alone criminals), it is \nplainly indirect. The rule has thus long been that the \nmanufacturer or distributor of a lawful product is not \na proximate cause of the product\u2019s independent \ncriminal misuse. And PLCAA incorporated that rule \nfor the very purpose of barring suits like this one. \nA. Proximate Cause Means Direct Cause. \nThe essential demand of proximate cause is a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. \nCorp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). As Justice Holmes put \nit a century ago, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule has long been that \nproximate cause does not permit recovery for an \ninjury that is \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d of a causal chain. \nId. at 271 (quoting S. Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer \nCo., 245 U.S. 531, 533 (1918)). That traditional \nunderstanding controls under PLCAA. And since \nMexico\u2019s attenuated theory of injury is anything but \ndirect, it is squarely barred. \n\n \n18 \n \n \n1. Proximate cause distinguishes de facto from legal \ncausation. See Pac. Ops. Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid, \n565 U.S. 207, 221-22 (2012). The law does not permit \na \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d for \u201cevery conceivable harm that \ncan be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n132 (2014). After all, illegal acts always \u201ccause ripples \nof harm [that] flow far beyond\u201d their immediate object. \nBank of America Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, \n202 (2017). But liability has never followed \u201cwherever \nthose ripples travel.\u201d Id.; see Waters v. Merchants\u2019 \nLouisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837). As Justice \nScalia colorfully put it, \u201c\u2018for want of a nail, a kingdom \nwas lost,\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the statement \nof a major cause of action against a blacksmith.\u201d \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 287 (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nFrom many de facto causes, only proximate ones \ncount. And only \u201cdirect\u201d causes are proximate. \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 268; Babbitt v. Sweet Home \nChapter of Cmtys. for a Great Or., 515 U.S. 687, 732 \n(1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting); 1 Thomas M. Cooley, A \nTreatise on the Law of Torts \u00a7 50, at 108 (4th ed. 1932).  \nIn policing the line between direct and indirect \nharm, this Court has emphasized that \u201cforeseeability \nalone does not ensure the close connection that \nproximate cause requires.\u201d Bank of America, 581 U.S. \nat 202; Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. \n1, 12 (2010). \u201cIf one takes a broad enough view, all \nconsequences of a negligent act, no matter how far \nremoved in time or space, may be foreseen. \nConditioning liability on foreseeability, therefore, is \nhardly a condition at all.\u201d Consol. Rail Corp. v. \nGottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 552-53 (1994). \n\n \n19 \n \n \nRather, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule is that a direct cause is \nlimited to the \u201cfirst step\u201d in a causal chain. Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 139-40. If multiple steps stand in between \nthe conduct and the harm, then the connection \nbecomes too \u201cremote,\u201d \u201ccontingent,\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d to \nsatisfy basic proximate cause. Hemi, 559 U.S. at 9-10.  \n2. The \u201ccentral question\u201d is thus \u201cwhether the \nalleged violation led directly to the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjuries.\u201d Anza v. Ideal Basic Steel Supply Corp., 547 \nU.S. 451, 461 (2006). Where the causal chain rests on \nindependent acts, the answer is almost always no. See \nAssoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State \nCouncil of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 532 n.25 (1983). \nIntuitively so. Something is \u201cdirect\u201d when it is \nuninterrupted; and it is \u201cindirect\u201d when \u201cother, \nindependent, factors\u201d punctuate the chain. Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 268-69. So when a causal chain involves \n\u201cseparate actions carried out by separate parties,\u201d it \nlacks continuity, and is thus typically deficient. Hemi, \n559 U.S. at 11; see Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 541 n.46. \nTo be sure, proximate cause sometimes allows for \nmulti-link chains where those links are uninterrupted \nby independent action. A good example is the Lanham \nAct, which allows a company to sue another for false \nadvertisements, which cause reduced sales due to \n\u201cconsumers who are deceived by the advertising.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. Proximate cause is still met \nbecause there is no discontinuity in the chain\u2014i.e., \nthere is no independent intervening act separating the \nunlawful act from the victim\u2019s harms, since no \nconsumer freely chooses to be deceived. Cf. id. at 139-\n40; see Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. \n639, 658 (2008) (\u201cno independent factors\u201d in chain).  \n\n \n20 \n \n \nBut absent such direct connections, proximate \ncause does not allow multi-step chains. \u201cA proximate \ncause of an injury is one which, in a natural and \ncontinuous \nsequence, \nwithout \nany \nefficient \nintervening cause, produces the injury.\u201d Dobbs, The \nLaw of Torts \u00a7 201 (2d ed. 2024). The chain must \n\u201cconstitute a continuous succession of events, so \nlinked together as to make a natural whole,\u201d free of \nany \u201cnew and independent cause intervening between \nthe wrong and the injury.\u201d Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 475 (1876). \n3. There is no doubt this traditional rule controls \nunder PLCAA. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133 (the \n\u201c[p]roximate-cause analysis\u201d is shaped by the \u201cnature\u201d \nof the statutory scheme at issue). Congress believed \nthe problem with the suits being filed by U.S. cities \nand others was that they all rested on remote causal \nchains that were too indirect to satisfy proximate \ncause. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7). And it sought to adopt \nthe \n\u201ccommon-sense \ntraditional \nrule \n[] \nthat \nmanufacturers and sellers should not be held liable \nfor the criminal or unlawful misuse of their products.\u201d \nHouse Report, at 6-17; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(b)(1). \nIn PLCAA\u2019s text, Congress thus made proximate \ncause an express requirement. For a manufacturer or \nseller to be sued, it must have committed a \u201cviolation\u201d \nthat is \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the alleged harm. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). When Congress uses a \ncommon-law term in a statute, it \u201cbrings the old soil \nwith it.\u201d Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 733 \n(2013). And with PLCAA, the whole idea was to use \nthis old soil to build up barriers against excessive \nliability. \n\n \n21 \n \n \nAccordingly, Congress made proximate cause a \nthreshold demand of federal law, in order to stop the \n\u201cexpansion of liability\u201d by novel state-law tort suits. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7); see id. \u00a7 7901(b)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5), \n(a)(8). For any claim to advance, Congress made sure \nit would first have to satisfy the traditional standard \nfor proximate cause as codified in federal law. Cf. \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 132 (collecting laws where this \nstandard applies). Entrenching this fixed standard in \nfederal law provides a bulwark against creative \ninnovations by state courts, and ensures that liability \nremains limited to cases of direct causation, as it has \nfor \u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). \nTo the extent there is any doubt about how this \napplies in practice, recall Congress passed PLCAA not \nas a prophylactic measure, but as a response to real \nsuits (quite similar to this one). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(b) \n(requiring existing suits be dismissed). And Congress \nspecifically called out those that \u201cbr[o]ke from bedrock \nprinciples of tort law and expose[d] firearm \nmanufacturers to unprecedented and unlimited \nliability\u201d\u2014suits that pressed near-identical claims as \nthose here (but absent the further step of spanning an \ninternational border). House Report, at 11-12 & n.48. \nOn the flipside, Congress also collected cases where \ncourts properly applied proximate cause. Id. at 6-10 \n(citing City of Philadelphia v. Beretta, 126 F. Supp. 2d \n882 (E.D. Pa. 2000)). In sum, Congress agreed that \n\u201cthe relationship between a tortious act and actual \ninjury historically must be direct, not remote\u201d\u2014and \npassed PLCAA so that this traditional rule would \ngovern as a matter of federal law. House Report, at \n13-14 (relying on Holmes). \n\n \n22 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Injuries Are Indirect. \nMexico\u2019s suit is far more attenuated than the suits \nthat prompted PLCAA in the first place, and does not \ncome close to satisfying traditional proximate cause. \n1. The sheer number of links in Mexico\u2019s causal \nchain is more than enough to defeat proximate cause. \na. Mexico\u2019s causal chain has eight links, punctuated \nby independent acts done by independent actors. To \nrecap: (1) Federally licensed manufacturers sell \nfirearms to federally licensed wholesalers; (2) those \nwholesalers sell to federally licensed dealers; (3) a \nfraction of those dealers engage in unlawful sales; (4) \na fraction of those illegally sold firearms are trafficked \ninto Mexico; (5) a fraction of those trafficked firearms \nend up with the cartels; (6) a fraction of those firearms \nare used by the cartels for crimes; (7) a fraction of \nthose crimes injure people and property in Mexico; \nand (8) Mexico\u2019s government then spends funds to \nrespond to the fallout, causing it fiscal injuries. \nMexico does not deny this causal chain involves the \nfree choices of many third parties: dealers, straw \npurchasers, \ntraffickers, \nsmugglers, \nand \ncartel \nmembers. Mexico also does not allege that any \nPetitioner controls, directs, or coordinates the conduct \nof these third parties. Instead, on Mexico\u2019s own \naccount, all of these choices\u2014the selling, buying, \ntrafficking, \ncrime, \nand \nmore\u2014are \npurely \nthe \nindependent choices of independent actors. \nThis Court has \u201cnever before stretched the causal \nchain\u201d to cover such independent action\u2014and has \nindeed rejected far more modest attempts to do so. See \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11. For instance, in Hemi, New York \nCity tried to bring a RICO suit against an out-of-state \n\n \n23 \n \n \ncigarette seller. Its theory: The seller failed to send \nreports to the state about those it had shipped to (as \nrequired by federal law), which later impaired the \ncity\u2019s ability to collect the taxes it levied on the \npossession of cigarettes, costing it revenue. Id. at 5-6. \nThis Court held that proximate cause was lacking. \nCritically, the \u201cconduct directly causing the harm\u201d\u2014\nthe nonpayment of taxes\u2014\u201cwas distinct from the \n[company\u2019s] conduct\u201d\u2014its failure to transmit certain \nreports. Id. at 11. And in between, \u201cthe City\u2019s theory \nof liability rest[ed] not just on separate actions, but \nseparate actions carried out by separate parties.\u201d Id. \nThat did not work: Since the \u201cCity\u2019s theory of liability \nrest[ed] on the independent actions of third and even \nfourth parties,\u201d it was far too attenuated. Id. at 15; see \nAnza, 547 U.S. at 458-61; Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 542. \nBank of America offers an instructive roadmap too. \nThere, Miami sued two national banks for allegedly \nissuing worse mortgages to certain minority groups, \nwhich prompted greater defaults and foreclosures, \nwhich decreased property values, which all ultimately \nresulted in homeowners paying lower property taxes \nto the city\u2019s government. 581 U.S. at 193-94. \nThe Court reserved the proximate cause question, \nbut Justice Thomas (along with Justices Kennedy and \nAlito) answered it with a resounding no. Miami\u2019s mere \nfour-step chain was \u201cexceedingly attenuated.\u201d 581 \nU.S. at 212 (Thomas, J., concurring and dissenting in \npart). It was riddled by \u201cindependent events,\u201d distinct \nfrom the defendants\u2019 conduct. Id. And those \nindependent acts made Miami\u2019s financial injuries \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d for proximate cause. Id. at 213. \n\n \n24 \n \n \nApplying the same principles, lower courts \nconsistently rejected this type of suit even before \nPLCAA. Cert. Petn. 15-18. Most notably, the Third \nCircuit rejected a suit by Philadelphia alleging that \nthe same longstanding practices by the firearms \nindustry \u201ccreate[ed] and contribut[ed] to [the] \ncriminal use\u201d of firearms in that city. City of \nPhiladelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n419 (3d Cir. 2002). The court dismissed, holding the \ncausal chain \u201cfrom the manufacturer to Philadelphia \nstreets\u201d was too \u201clong and tortuous.\u201d Id. at 423. \nThis is a simple case under these precedents. \nMexico\u2019s eight-step causal chain is more attenuated \nthan anything this Court has seen. See Hemi, 559 U.S. \nat 11. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, spanning an international border to boot. And \nevery injury alleged here is the result of one of those \ndistinct actions against a foreign sovereign in a \nforeign land. Each such act alone is enough to sever \nthe causal chain; together, they shatter it. \nb. All the more so, because many of those acts are \ncrimes. Again, the purpose of proximate cause is to \nassign \u201cresponsibility\u201d among possible liable actors. \nDobbs, supra, at \u00a7 198. And when an injury is the \nresult of an independent criminal act, the law assigns \nresponsibility to the criminal\u2014not an upstream party \nwith no control over him. Id. \u00a7 209; see Restatement \n(Second) Torts \u00a7 302B cmts. d-e. Thus, when a causal \nchain relies on an independent criminal act\u2014let alone \nmultiple ones\u2014it virtually never satisfies proximate \ncause. See Hemi, 559 U.S. at 11 (emphasizing how \nintervening cause involved a breach of \u201clegal[] \nobligat[ion]\u201d); see also, e.g., Kemper v. Deutsche Bank \nAG, 911 F.3d 383, 393 (7th Cir. 2018). \n\n \n25 \n \n \nTo be sure, this common law rule has some narrow \nexceptions. When there is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d\u2014\ne.g., bailor-bailee, caregiver-child, landlord-tenant\u2014\nthen a party may be liable for harms caused by a third \nparty. See Dobbs, supra, at \u00a7 209. The rationale is that \nwhen a party owes a legal \u201cduty\u201d to another to protect \nit against certain harms (which may include criminal \nacts), proximate cause should not stand in the way of \nliability\u2014and must excuse an otherwise intervening \nact. Id.; see, e.g., Moon v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Benson, \n135 A. 114, 115 (Pa. 1926) (bailor who placed property \nin insufficiently secure place liable after thief stole it). \nBut there is zero \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between \nfirearms companies and sovereigns\u2014let alone foreign \nsovereigns\u2014that obligates the companies to protect \nthem from third-party crimes. District of Columbia v. \nBeretta, U.S.A., Corp., 872 A.2d 633, 640-41 (D.C. \n2005). \u201c[G]un manufacturers are under no legal duty \nto protect citizens from the deliberate and unlawful \nuse of their products.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 425; \nsee House Report, at 7-9. Rightly so: As in any \nindustry, there is no duty for a manufacturer or seller \nof a lawful product to protect others from its criminal \nmisuse. E.g., Stahlecker v. Ford Motor Co., 667 \nN.W.2d 244, 254-57 (Neb. 2003). \nPut together, then, the general rule is clear: The \nmanufacturer or seller of a lawful product is not a \nproximate cause of its independent criminal misuse. \nCity of Chicago v. Beretta, U.S.A., Corp., 821 N.E.2d \n1099, 1136-37 (Ill. 2004); see District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 650-51. Absent some special relationship or \nlegal duty, an independent criminal act breaks the \ncausal chain. The responsible party is the criminal \nwho inflicts the harm\u2014not anyone else. \n\n \n26 \n \n \nThese principles doom Mexico\u2019s theory of causation. \nMexico depends on a legion of third-party criminals: \nBad-actor dealers; illicit buyers; gun traffickers; \nsmugglers; cartel members; etc. Mexico cannot even \nallege the actual number of such actors involved. And \nonce more, Mexico does not allege any Petitioner has \nany control, direction, or relation to these unknown \nand unknowable third parties. Instead, Mexico relies \non crime after crime\u2014by independent criminal after \nindependent criminal\u2014to try to connect Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct to Mexico\u2019s harms. That does not work.  \n2. This Court has also looked to other factors to see \nif a causal chain is too indirect. All cut the same way. \na. One sign that a causal chain is too attenuated is \nthat ascertaining damages and liability would be \nunworkable. Anza, 547 U.S. at 458-60. After all, \u201cthe \nless direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to \nascertain the amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages \nattributable to the violation, as distinct from other, \nindependent, factors.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269. When \na downstream injury is the product of multiple \nintertwined factors, that is a telltale sign of \nindirectness. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135, 140. \nThat is this case in spades. Mexico marshals a \nparade of bad actors\u2014dealers, smugglers, cartels\u2014\nwho drive the bedlam south of the border. But there is \nno way to apportion fault among them, or to isolate \nthe causal role Petitioners play. Mexico admits the \nvast majority of firearm sales in the United States are \nlawful; that most firearms recovered in Mexico were \nnot made or sold by Petitioners; and that Mexico is \nswamped by other firearms from other companies. \nPet.App.44a, 158a-59a (\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n27 \n \n \nThe problem is compounded by the nature of \nMexico\u2019s alleged injuries. Mexico\u2019s principal injuries \nare higher governmental expenditures\u2014on security, \nhealthcare, social services, and the like. BIO 6, 20-21. \nTo determine damages, a court would need to go line-\nby-line through Mexico\u2019s federal budget and assess for \nitself which spending increases are attributable to \nPetitioners, versus the countless other causes that can \ndrive governmental spending in Mexico. That is not \nthe stuff of judicial competency. But it is a flashing \nindicator of a woefully indirect theory of liability. \nb. Another consideration is whether the alleged \ninjuries are direct or derivative. If derivative, there \nare typically \u201cbetter situated plaintiffs\u201d (direct \nvictims) who can bring more appropriate litigation to \naddress any allegedly wrongful action by a defendant. \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11-12; Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269-70. \nAnd that is clearly the case here: Victims in Mexico \ncan sue the criminals in Mexico who have actually \ninjured them. That is what U.S. courts have said when \nU.S. cities filed analogous suits. Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425. And it is the basic policy judgment \nCongress made in PLCAA. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  \nBy contrast, most if not all of Mexico\u2019s alleged \nharms derive from violence visited on its citizens. But \nthis Court has repeatedly held an \u201calleged harm\u201d is \n\u201cordinarily\u201d too attenuated \u201cif the harm is purely \nderivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person \nby the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. \nThat makes good sense: By definition, a derivative \nharm is (at least) one step removed, making it \nindirect. \n\n \n28 \n \n \nTo that end, the reason a derivative harm flunks \nproximate cause is not because it is unforeseeable. \nDerivative injuries are often predictable. For example, \nit is easy to foresee that shuttering a business through \nillegal action (e.g., extortion) will harm its landlord, \nwho will lose the business\u2019s rent. But it is nevertheless \nblack-letter law that the landlord\u2019s injuries are too far \nremoved to count\u2014lest our tort system become one of \nunlimited liability. See Apple v. Pepper, 587 U.S. 273, \n291 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \nOn Mexico\u2019s view, however, it is hard to see who \ncannot recover. There are plenty of people who suffer \nfollow-on harms from the cartels, including in ways \nmore direct than Mexico\u2014companies lose employees, \nbusinesses lose customers, and yes, landlords lose \nrent. But there is no sound argument that any of those \nparties can come close to satisfying proximate cause. \nSee Bank of America, 581 U.S. at 212-13 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part). And there is no \nreason why the Mexican government is any different. \nC. Mexico\u2019s Contrary Arguments Fail. \nIn opposing certiorari, Mexico barely defended the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s proximate-cause analysis, which \nimproperly \nconflated \nproximate \ncause \nand \nforeseeability. See Pet.App.309a-19a. Instead, Mexico \nraised three main arguments to try to salvage its \ncomplaint \nfrom \nits \nobvious \nproximate-cause \ninfirmities. None persuade. \nFirst, Mexico argues that the relevant criminal \n\u201cviolation\u201d that starts the causal chain is not \nPetitioners\u2019 own conduct, but the \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d involving their products. BIO 15, 22. That is \nwrong. By its terms, PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception \n\n \n29 \n \n \nallows claims \u201cin which a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product knowingly violated a State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of \nthe product, and the violation was a proximate cause \nof the harm for which relief is sought.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). This makes clear \nthat \u201cthe\u201d relevant \u201cviolation\u201d is the one committed by \nthe \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d being sued\u2014and that \nviolation must be the proximate cause of the injury.  \nHere, Mexico claims that Petitioners violated the \naiding-and-abetting statute. For purposes of the \npredicate exception, the analysis thus turns on \nwhether Petitioners\u2019 alleged violative conduct\u2014i.e., \ntheir routine production and sale of firearms in this \ncountry (which are later resold by bad-actor dealers \nand others)\u2014is a proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s alleged \ninjuries. And as detailed above, the answer is no. \nIn any event, even if the causal chain starts with \nunlawful sales by dealers, those violations still are not \na proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s diffuse harms. Indeed, \nnumerous independent crimes continue to stand \nbetween any unlawful sales in America and Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries abroad: A fraction of those sales must \nfirst be illegally smuggled into Mexico (versus used for \nany other purpose in America); then a fraction of those \nillegally smuggled firearms must be illegally given to \ncartels (versus other users); then a fraction of those \nfirearms must be used to commit violent crimes \n(versus other ends); and then Mexico must choose how \nto spend funds in response, incurring fiscal harms. \nIn short, even on its preferred framing, Mexico\u2019s \ncausal chain still stretches across an international \nborder and is punctuated by multiple independent \n\n \n30 \n \n \ncriminal acts carried out by a series of independent \ncriminals, leading to follow-on injuries suffered by a \nforeign sovereign. No case has ever found proximate \ncause on such a remote chain of events. \nSecond, Mexico insists its multi-link chain should \nbe excused because Petitioners\u2019 conduct is \u201cintegral\u201d \nto the cartels\u2019 activity. BIO 22-23. But that conflates \nde facto causation (the fact that Petitioners are \nindirect suppliers) with proximate causation (whether \nthey are directly responsible for Mexico\u2019s derivative \ninjuries due to cartel violence). As discussed, this \nCourt has allowed multi-link chains only where there \nis no \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d rendering them \u201cindirect.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 140. So in Lexmark, this Court \nallowed a direct competitor of the defendant to sue for \nfalse advertisements that caused it to \u201cautomatically\u201d \nsuffer a loss in sales. Id.; see also Bridge 553 U.S. at \n647-48 (allowing a similar \u201cstraightforward\u201d theory). \nBut as this Court has explained, the defining trait \nin those \u201crelatively unique circumstances,\u201d Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 140, was the absence of any \u201cindependent \nactions\u201d that would break the causal chain, Hemi, 559 \nU.S. at 15. Here, by contrast, Mexico\u2019s theory is \nsaturated with such independent links. \nThird, Mexico says that PLCAA demands a looser \nversion of proximate cause, because Congress wanted \nsome plaintiffs to be able \u201cto recover for harms caused \nin part by third-party conduct.\u201d BIO 23. But as \nexplained, watering down proximate cause was quite \nliterally the opposite of what Congress sought to do \nwith PLCAA. And in portraying Petitioners\u2019 position \nas foreclosing all potential liability, Mexico shoots at \na strawman. Nobody is saying PLCAA cuts off liability \n\n \n31 \n \n \nfor a company engaged in coordinated criminal \nactivity: If a convicted felon comes into a firearm store \nasking for the best firearm to rob a bank, and the \nseller recommends and furnishes one to assist in the \nrobbery, \nthen \nthat \nthird-party \ncrime \nis \nnot \nindependent from the seller. The seller is criminally \nliable for participating in the crime and is on the hook \nfor \nthe \ndirect \nconsequences. \nSee \n15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). By contrast, \nMexico\u2019s \nalleged \ncausal \nchain \nhere \ninvolves \nindependent criminal activity in which Petitioners \nplayed no role. And that sort of conduct is what defeats \nproximate cause. Indeed, the purpose of PLCAA\u2014and \nthe reason it expressly added a proximate-cause \nrequirement\u2014was to ensure the industry would not \nbe held liable for the independent crimes of third \nparties. But that is exactly what Mexico is trying to \naccomplish here. \nII. PETITIONERS ARE NOT GUILTY OF AIDING AND \nABETTING ANY FIREARMS CRIME. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nalso must show that the defendant committed a \n\u201cviolation\u201d of a firearm-specific statute. 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nFor \nthis, \nMexico \nclaims \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices violate the \nfederal criminal ban on aiding and abetting illicit \nfirearm sales by downstream dealers. BIO 27. \nImportantly, Mexico does not argue that any \nPetitioner has itself broken any American law, rule, \nor regulation specifically governing the manufacture \nor sale of firearms. Nor does Mexico allege that any \nPetitioner is even \u201caware\u201d of any \u201cparticular unlawful \nsale.\u201d Pet.App.305a. Rather, Mexico maintains that \n\n \n32 \n \n \nPetitioners are accomplices to downstream dealers \nwho choose to sell their firearms illegally, because \nPetitioners are generally aware that some dealers will \nengage in such sales, and Petitioners have failed to go \nbeyond what the American firearms laws require in \norder to counteract those third-party criminal acts. \nThat is not aiding and abetting. A business that \ndoes nothing more than make or sell a product in the \nordinary course is not an accomplice to downstream \nactors who later sell or misuse that product illegally. \nAnd the supplier of a lawful product does not become \na criminal simply because it refuses to take additional \naffirmative steps to stop third parties from using the \nproduct to commit a crime. This Court reaffirmed that \nlongstanding rule in Twitter, and it settles this case. \nA. Aiding and Abetting Requires Culpable \nMisconduct, Not Business As Usual. \nAiding \nand \nabetting \nrequires \nculpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., something done for the purpose of \nassisting a criminal offense. But where a business \ndoes nothing more than engage in routine business \npractices\u2014like broadly putting a good to market, or \noffering a general service\u2014it does not become an \naccomplice to independent downstream criminals who \nlater misuse that product, even if the business is \naware such criminal misuse is possible. Something \nmore is needed, lest every industry become liable as \nan accomplice to the misdeeds of its customers\u2014\npunishable by felony. \n1. Aiding and abetting \u201creflects a centuries-old view \nof culpability: that a person may be responsible for a \ncrime he has not personally carried out if he helps \nanother to complete its commission.\u201d Rosemond v. \n\n \n33 \n \n \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 65, 70 (2014). Federal law \nincorporates that view, making accomplices and \nprincipals equally \u201cpunishable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). \nAiding and abetting has both an objective and a \nsubjective component. An accomplice must take some \n\u201caffirmative act\u201d to assist a criminal offense, and also \ndo so with the \u201cintent of facilitating the offense\u2019s \ncommission.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. Together, \naiding-and-abetting law requires \u201cthat a defendant \u2018in \nsome sort associate himself with the venture, that he \nparticipate in it as in something that he wishes to \nbring about, that he seek by his action to make it \nsucceed.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d \n401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938) (Hand, J.)). \nBut the doctrine has strict limits. As for the \nobjective component, \u201cthe concept of \u2018helping\u2019 in the \ncommission of a crime . . . has never been boundless.\u201d \nId. at 488. The law has long distinguished between \nthose who \u201cincidentally facilitate a criminal venture\u201d \nand those who \u201cactively participate in it.\u201d Rosemond, \n572 U.S. at 77 n.8. Thus, \u201cgenerally\u201d\u2014absent some \nlegal duty displacing the ordinary rule\u2014the law \u201cdoes \nnot impose liability for mere omissions, inactions, or \nnonfeasance.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Rather, the \n\u201cconceptual core\u201d of aiding-and-abetting liability is \n\u201cconscious[] and culpable participa[tion].\u201d Id. at 493. \nAs for its subjective component, aiding and abetting \nhas also differentiated awareness from intent. The \n\u201cmere knowledge\u201d that one\u2019s actions may assist a \ncriminal scheme is insufficient. Direct Sales Co. v. \nUnited States, 319 U.S. 703, 711 (1943). A criminal \naccomplice must act with the intent of assisting a \ncriminal offense. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. \n\n \n34 \n \n \n2. The type of support required also turns on the \ntheory of liability. \u201c[A]iding and abetting is inherently \na rule of secondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). Thus, the \nheartland case involves intentional aid to a specific \ncrime\u2014a particular, identified wrong. Id. \nIn rare circumstances, a \u201csecondary defendant\u2019s \nrole in an illicit enterprise can be so systemic that the \nsecondary defendant is aiding and abetting every \nwrongful act committed by that enterprise.\u201d Id. at 496; \nsee Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 488 (D.C. Cir. \n1983). But because this theory of liability effectively \n\u201cblur[s]\u201d the line between \u201cconspiracy liability\u201d and \n\u201caiding-and-abetting liability,\u201d it requires a markedly \ngreater showing. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496. To be on the \nhook for everything an illicit enterprise does, a \ndefendant must provide such \u201cpervasive, systemic, \nand culpable assistance,\u201d to infer a \u201cnear-common \nenterprise\u201d with the primary criminal(s). Id. at 502. \n3. The limits on aiding and abetting are especially \nimportant when it comes to manufacturers and \nsuppliers of lawful goods. After all, almost every \nbusiness knows its products may be misused\u2014\nincluding by criminals: Beer companies know drinks \nwill be sold to minors; car companies know their \nvehicles will be driven recklessly; and pharmaceutical \ncompanies know their medicines will be abused. \nBut \u201caiding-and-abetting liability\u201d has never been \nextended so \u201cfar\u201d as to make \u201cordinary merchants . . . \nliable for [the] misuse of their goods and services.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Courts have regularly held \nthat making or selling a lawful product\u2014even when \naware it may be criminally misused\u2014is not sufficient. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nId. at 488, 501 & n.14. As the United States recently \nput it: Liability does not naturally attach where \u201ca \ndefendant provided only routine business services in \nan ordinary manner, was remote from the unlawful \nact that injured the plaintiff, or is accused of aiding \nand abetting another\u2019s conduct through inaction.\u201d \nAmicus Curiae Brief for the United States, 11-12, \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (No. 21-1496). \nTo prevent a pall of prosecution being draped over \nthe economy, courts have long drawn an objective line, \ndifferentiating lawful businesses that engage in \n\u201croutine\u201d conduct from those that engage in \u201catypical\u201d \nconduct to help a crime succeed. Camp v. Dema, 948 \nF.2d 455, 459 (8th Cir. 1991) (cited by Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 490-92). Only the latter is the sort of culpable \nmisconduct that establishes accomplice liability. If a \nmerchant is engaged \u201cin the ordinary course of his \nbusiness,\u201d it is not enough that he has a \u201cgeneral \nawareness\u201d that his products may facilitate crimes \ndownstream. Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, 522 \nF.2d 84, 95 (5th Cir. 1975) (cited by Twitter, 598 U.S. \nat 491). Maintaining \u201croutine\u201d business practices is \nthe sort of \u201cpassive\u201d inaction that is treated as \ninnocent rather than innately \u201cculpable\u201d; a business \nmust break from the norm to become guilty as an \naccomplice. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 491.1 \n \n1 See, e.g., Amazon Servs. LLC v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., 109 \nF.4th 573, 581-83 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (providing \u201cgenerally \navailable\u201d service in \u201croutine\u201d manner insufficient for liability); \nUnited States v. Blankenship, 970 F.2d 283, 286-89 (7th Cir. \n1992) (Easterbrook, J.) (noting where \u201c\u2018mere\u2019 sale[s]\u201d end and \nliability \u201cbegin[s]\u201d); SEC v. Wash. Cnty. Util. Dist., 676 F.2d 218, \n226 (6th Cir. 1982) (contrasting \u201ca transaction in the ordinary \ncourse of his business\u201d and one \u201cof an extraordinary nature\u201d). \n\n \n36 \n \n \nAccordingly, when a business puts a lawful good to \nmarket, it does not become an accomplice to that \nproduct\u2019s downstream criminal misuse simply by \ndeclining to take additional affirmative steps to \ncounteract that independent unlawful action. That is, \nto incur liability, it is not enough that a company \nchooses to stay the course and continue routine \npractices; it must engage in some objectively unusual \naction, directed to actually making the crime succeed. \nThat is already a high bar. But the bar gets even \nhigher if the theory of liability is pegged not to aiding \na specific unlawful act (e.g., an illicit sale), but instead \nan unlawful enterprise (e.g., an illicit seller). For this \ntype of enterprise theory, a merchant must go even \nfurther, taking atypical steps in such a systemic and \npervasive fashion that it is jointly liable for all of that \nenterprise\u2019s misdoings. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496, 502; \nsee Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487-88. And for that sort \nof categorical liability to attach, the routine practices \nof a lawful industry\u2014untailored to any buyer, \nunparticularized to any transaction\u2014are never \nenough. Such overwhelming assistance must be \ntargeted and deliberate; supplying a lawful product in \na general and ordinary manner is not that. Mexico has \nnever cited any case holding otherwise. Nor could it. \n4. This Court\u2019s decision in Direct Sales Company \nillustrates these principles. That case involved a \ndistributor that directly sold an obscenely large \namount of morphine to a single rural doctor, who was \nobviously engaged in a criminal enterprise by re-\nselling the drugs illegally. 319 U.S. at 705. The \ndistributor was charged with conspiring to violate the \nfederal narcotics laws, and this Court affirmed the \nconviction. Id. at 714-15. \n\n \n37 \n \n \nIn so doing, this Court took pains to distinguish \nroutine versus atypical business activity. It stressed \nthat for liability to attach, it is not enough for a \nbusiness to be aware that its product will be misused: \nThere must be \u201cmore than knowledge, acquiescence, \ncarelessness, indifference, lack of concern.\u201d Id. at 713. \nWhen there is \u201cnothing more on the seller\u2019s part than \nindifference to the buyer\u2019s illegal purpose and passive \nacquiescence in his desire to purchase,\u201d that cannot be \nfodder for a felony. Id. at 712 n.8. \nThe reason the Direct Sales Company could be \ncriminally liable was it strayed far beyond business as \nusual. The distributor sold the doctor such massive \nand atypical amounts of morphine\u2014around 36,000 \npills a year, when the average was about 400\u2014that \nthere was no conceivable lawful explanation for what \nwas going on. See id. at 705-06. The distributor, \nmoreover, also took other affirmative steps to bolster \nhis complicity, like coordinating with the doctor as to \nhow to avoid law enforcement, such as by changing \ntablet sizes. Id. at 707. All told, this sort of obvious, \nprolonged, and direct \u201ccooperation\u201d with a specific \ndrug dealer was more than enough to sustain a \nconviction. Id. at 713. And as this Court has since \nexplained, Direct Sales stands for the proposition that \naccomplice liability attaches when a \u201cprovider of \nroutine services does so in an unusual way.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 502. \nRightly so. Again, the touchstone for aiding and \nabetting is to culpably \u201cparticipate\u201d in a wrongful act \nso as to help \u201cmake it succeed.\u201d Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 336 U.S. 613, 619 (1949). In determining \nwhether an ordinary merchant has crossed that line, \nit makes sense to insist on unusual and particularized \n\n \n38 \n \n \nbehavior to distinguish incidental facilitation from \naffirmative \nsupport. \nAbsent \nthis \nobjective \nrequirement, all-too-easy allegations of scienter would \nimperil every business that sells a lawful product that \nis predictably abused by criminals. By contrast, where \nthe merchant is not engaged in business as usual, that \nidentifiable break from the norm can furnish the \nmisconduct needed for liability. Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 487-88 (attributing liability to defendant providing \nservices \u201cin an unusual way under unusual \ncircumstances for a long period of time\u201d). \n5. PLCAA incorporates these basic limits on aiding \nand abetting. After all, when the Act was passed, it \nwas \ncommon \nknowledge \nthat \ncriminals \ncould \npurchase firearms from some bad-actor dealers\u2014\nindeed, that was the very premise of the lawsuits \nPLCAA was passed to stop. \nIt was Congress\u2019s judgment, however, that so long \nas manufacturers and sellers followed the many \nfederal, state, and local regulations that directly apply \nto making and selling firearms, they \u201cshould not[] be \n[held] liable for the harm caused by those who \ncriminally or unlawfully misuse [their] products.\u201d 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). There was not a whisper in \nCongress that the same type of plaintiffs could bring \nthe same type of suits, just by restyling the same type \nof tort allegations in aiding-and-abetting garb. See \nsupra pp. 6-7. \nThe opposite. Congress condemned the \u201cslippery \nslope\u201d these novel suits promised\u2014i.e., the legal, \nsocial, and economic chaos that would follow from \nimposing \n\u201cliability\u201d \non \nevery \n\u201ccompany \n[that] \nmanufactures a legitimate product that is widely and \n\n \n39 \n \n \nlawfully distributed,\u201d who knows that its product may \nbe \u201ccriminally or unlawfully misused\u201d downstream. \nHouse Report, at 23. Countless industries \u201care aware \nthat a small percentage of their products will be \nmisused by criminals.\u201d Id. at 24. But that has never \nbeen enough for liability of any stripe\u2014let alone \ncriminal liability. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7), (a)(8). \nThese points bear out in PLCAA\u2019s text and \nstructure. \nFor \ninstance, \nwithin \nthe \npredicate \nexception, the Act provides an example of how a \nsupplier might be liable for aiding and abetting, but \nonly in the context of a particular transaction where \nthe supplier knows that \u201cthe actual buyer\u201d of \u201cthe\u201d \nfirearm \nis \nbarred \nfrom \nhaving \nit. \nId. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(II). Likewise, PLCAA includes a \nseparate exception allowing transferors to be sued if \nthey are convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(h), \nwhich prohibits giving someone a firearm \u201cknowing or \nhaving reasonable cause to believe that [it] will be \nused to commit a felony.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i). \nThis all reflects the narrow range of suits that \nCongress contemplated: Instances where a firearm \nsupplier knowingly makes an illegal sale to a specific \ncriminal\u2014i.e., where a business engages in atypical \nconduct to assist a particular criminal offense. By \ncontrast, nothing in PLCAA reflects the sort of \nsystemic liability contemplated here, where the \nroutine business practices of manufacturers and \ndistributors would make them responsible for an \nentire class of criminal action. Indeed, if simply \nshowing that a firearms company was aware that a \nsmall fraction of its products would fall into the hands \nof criminals was enough, then the particularized \nprovisions above would be meaningless. \n\n \n40 \n \n \nB. Mexico \nTargets \nOrdinary \nBusiness \nPractices, Not Culpable Misconduct. \nOver the course of this litigation, Mexico has offered \nshifting theories of aiding and abetting. Its complaint \nalleged that Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming\u201d of Mexicans by the \u201cdrug cartels.\u201d \nPet.App.12a (\u00b6 15). But in this Court, Mexico has \npressed only the alternative theory embraced by the \nFirst Circuit: Petitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices \nare illegal because they aid and abet unlawful firearm \nsales by downstream independent dealers. BIO 27.  \n1. At the outset, it is important to identify the type \nof liability theory on which Mexico relies. As the First \nCircuit recognized, \u201cthe complaint does not allege \ndefendants\u2019 awareness of any particular unlawful \nsale,\u201d much less that Petitioners did anything to help \nany specific illicit transaction succeed. Pet.App.305a. \nMexico\u2019s case thus falls far outside the heartland of \naiding and abetting, which again is \u201ca rule of \nsecondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s claim is that Petitioners provide \nsuch pervasive support to bad-actor dealers that \nPetitioners are responsible for all of their unlawful \nsales of Petitioners\u2019 products. This is the theory the \nFirst Circuit relied on: Petitioners \u201coperate at a \nsystemic level, allegedly designing, marketing, and \ndistributing their guns so that demand by the cartels \ncontinues to boost sales,\u201d making them accomplices \neven though they do \u201cnot know about any particular \nunlawful sale.\u201d Pet.App.306a. Mexico has now \nadopted this theory. BIO 17, 20, 22-25, 27-28. \n\n \n41 \n \n \n2. To establish such categorical liability, Mexico \nmust allege that Petitioners have provided \u201cpervasive, \nsystemic, and culpable\u201d assistance to the bad-actor \ndealers in the supply chain, for the specific purpose of \naiding their illicit sales. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 502. \nCritically, however, Mexico tries to get over this \nhigh bar with nothing but the routine \u201cbusiness \npractices\u201d Petitioners have followed \u201c[f]or decades.\u201d \nPet.App.139a (\u00b6 376). Mexico concedes that these \npractices \noverwhelmingly \ncater \nto \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). It nevertheless faults \nPetitioners for staying the course because, in its view, \nthey should have taken extralegal steps to better \ncurtail the small fraction of U.S. firearms that end up \nin Mexico. E.g., id. 12a (\u00b6 16), 24a (\u00b6 50). \nIn particular, Mexico\u2019s complaint focuses on three \nbroad \ncategories\u2014design, \nmarketing, \nand \ndistribution. It blames Petitioners for either not \naffirmatively adopting new policies to counteract \nillicit sales, or for not abandoning longstanding \npractices \nthat\u2014while \ndesigned \nfor \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans\u2014criminals have been able to exploit. See \nid. 84a (\u00b6 246: \u201cDefendants do not need legislation in \norder to make these reforms\u201d). \nDesign. Mexico asserts Petitioners \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales by continuing to \n\u201cdesign\u201d what Mexico calls \u201cmilitary-style assault \nweapons.\u201d Id. 93a. For instance, Mexico takes issue \nwith Petitioners making and selling lawful firearms \nlike the AR-15 rifle, and firearms capable of accepting \n\u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of which Mexico \nsays are popular among criminals. Id. 121a (\u00b6 334); \n96a (\u00b6 288). And Mexico criticizes the industry for not \n\n \n42 \n \n \nadding certain \u201csafety features\u201d it says will dampen \ncriminal interest. E.g., 129a (\u00b6 359) (calling for \u201csmart \nguns\u201d), 131a (\u00b6 365) (same for harder-to-defile serial \nnumbers). \nOf note, Mexico never alleges that any Petitioner \naffirmatively designed these products to aid any \ncriminal activity. Nor would any such claim be \nplausible. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the \ncountry; and there are hundreds of millions of \u201clarge-\ncapacity\u201d magazines in America. Moreover, Mexico \nconcedes that all of these arms are perfectly legal \nunder America\u2019s extensive firearm regulations. \nMexico\u2019s charge is that in continuing to produce \nthese firearms\u2014despite knowing criminals desire to \nuse them\u2014the industry has chosen to \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales. Id. 93a. To avoid \nliability, Mexico says the industry \u201ccould limit their \nsales of these military-style assault weapons to \nmilitary and perhaps some law enforcement units.\u201d \nId. 104a (\u00b6 314). Or it \u201ccould restrict the sale of these \nweapons to purchasers with a legitimate need for \nthem.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 315). Or it \u201ccould make guns [that do] not \naccept [any] high-capacity magazines.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 317). \nBoiled down, Mexico faults Petitioners for \u201cnot\u201d \naltering their longstanding design practices to better \nsuppress the criminal demand for their firearms. Id. \n(\u00b6\u00b6 314-18). \nMarketing. \nMexico \nsays \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 \nlongstanding marketing practices help boost unlawful \nfirearm sales. It does not allege any Petitioner \nengages in any campaigns tailored to any criminal \nconduct\u2014e.g., touting a new inconspicuous handgun, \nperfect for subway muggings. Instead, Mexico alleges \n\n \n43 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 marketing tactics showcase the \u201cfeatures, \nfunctions, and applications\u201d of their firearms in ways \nthat have appealed to criminals\u2014such as by using \nimages of the \u201cmilitary,\u201d \u201claw enforcement,\u201d as well as \n\u201cAmerican flags.\u201d E.g., id. 105a, 127a (\u00b6\u00b6 322, 352). \nMexico implies Petitioners should have stopped \nadvertising their firearms this way once it became \nclear that criminals were attracted to their potential \nmilitary-like uses. In this sense, though, Mexico\u2019s \nmarketing-related claims are just derivative of its \ndesign-related ones. As Chief Judge Saylor explained, \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms \u201cdo exactly what they are \nadvertised to do\u201d: The advertisements Mexico \nidentifies show how these products work in the real \nworld\u2014including how some are used by police. Id. \n255a-59a. Mexico faults Petitioners for showing these \ntrue facts, but that gripe flows entirely from Mexico\u2019s \nview that firearms with these traits should not be sold \nat all (or at least, not to regular Americans). \nDistribution. Finally, Mexico takes issue with the \n\u201cthree-tier distribution\u201d system sanctioned by the \nfederal government. Id. 140a (\u00b6 378). Within this \nsystem, \nfederally \nlicensed \nmanufacturers \nsell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \nwholesalers, who then sell to independent federally \nlicensed dealers\u2014who then sell to the general public. \nHere too, Mexico does not suggest Petitioners set up \nthis system in order to promote unlawful sales. As \nMexico admits, the overwhelming majority of U.S. \nfirearm sales are by law-abiding dealers to law-\nabiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). And nobody even \nhints the industry developed its entire distribution \n\n \n44 \n \n \nframework to cater to an outlier, minute fraction of \nunlawful sales\u2014as opposed to its primary business. \nRather, Mexico\u2019s allegations concern a supposed \nfailure by Petitioners to augment this system with \n\u201cappropriate and prudent distribution practices\u201d that \nMexico thinks will help reduce unlawful firearm sales \ndownstream. Id. 139a-40a (\u00b6 377). Among other \nthings, Mexico insists that manufacturers and \ndistributors should impose \u201cmandatory background \nchecks for secondary gun sales,\u201d require downstream \ndealers to \u201climit[] sales of multiple guns,\u201d \u201csupervise\u201d \nprivate \u201ckitchen-table\u201d sales, set up a system for \nmitigating lost or stolen firearms, and \u201crestrict[]\u201d \nsales of \u201cassault weapons.\u201d See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 89a-\n90a, 132a (\u00b6\u00b6 245, 264, 269, 369). \nMexico accepts that none of this is required by any \nAmerican firearms law. Instead, it faults Petitioners \nfor having \u201cchos[en] not\u201d to go beyond what those laws \nsay, to \u201ccontrol[]\u201d downstream dealers. Id. 139a-41a, \n104a (\u00b6\u00b6 377-79, 382, 315). \n3. These allegations fall far short of aiding and \nabetting. Mexico\u2019s claim reduces to Petitioners \nengaging in routine business practices while passively \ndeclining to do more to stop independent retailers \nfrom breaking the law. But such inaction does not \nsuffice. As this Court has emphasized, there is a core \ndifference between \u201cfailing to stop\u201d downstream \ncrime, and affirmatively abetting it through active \nparticipation. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 503. And that \nfundamental distinction resolves this issue: A lawful \nsupplier is not an accomplice to every independent \nseller of its good that it fails to make follow the law. \n\n \n45 \n \n \na. Mexico\u2019s complaint is foreclosed by Twitter. \nMexico claims that a \u201cmanufacturer of a dangerous \nproduct is an accessory or co-conspirator to illicit \nconduct by downstream actors where it continues to \nsupply, support, or assist the downstream parties and \nhas knowledge\u2014actual or constructive\u2014of the illicit \nconduct.\u201d Pet.App.42a (\u00b6 110). \nBut that is exactly what Twitter rejected. The \nplaintiffs alleged that the platforms knowingly hosted \nterrorist content for years; that they knew groups like \nISIS depended upon their services for fundraising and \nrecruiting; that they knew how their recommendation \nalgorithms matched terrorist content with interested \npeople; and that the platforms \u201cfailed to implement\u201d \nbasic detection tools that would help weed out this \nproblematic content. See 598 U.S. at 480-82, 498. And \nthe plaintiffs alleged that the platforms refused to \ndepart from their routine practices, because they \n\u201cprofited\u201d from these terrorist accounts. Id. at 482. \nThis Court unanimously held those claims fell short \nof aiding and abetting. Many businesses know their \nproducts will be criminally misused downstream, just \nas the platforms in Twitter knew terrorists were \nmisusing their services. But continuing to sell a good \nor service is mere \u201cpassive assistance,\u201d not \u201cactive \nabetting.\u201d Id. at 499. Staying the course with routine \nbusiness practices is not \u201caffirmative misconduct.\u201d Id. \nat 500. It is instead the sort of \u201cfailure to act\u201d that does \nnot trigger liability. Id. at 500-01. Indeed, any other \nrule would constitute a remarkable expansion of the \ncriminal law\u2014and would task private companies with \na roving mandate to \u201cdiscover[]\u201d and \u201cterminate\u201d any \ncustomers \u201cusing [their] service[s] for illicit ends,\u201d or \nelse risk crippling liability. Id. at 501. \n\n \n46 \n \n \nAs the above makes clear, Mexico does not allege a \nsingle \u201caffirmative act\u201d by Petitioners, performed with \nthe \u201cintent of facilitating\u201d illicit firearms sales by \ndealers. Id. at 490. Instead, Mexico\u2019s complaint rests \nentirely on the American firearms industry refusing \nto depart from routine, existing, and settled business \npractices\u2014be it refusing to scrap certain products \n(like the AR-15), or declining to impose extralegal \ncriteria on downstream retailers (such as limiting \nsales by \u201clegitimate need\u201d). But as explained, when a \nbusiness refuses to depart from the ordinary course\u2014\nwhen \nit \ndeclines \nto \nchange \nits longstanding \npractices\u2014that is precisely the sort of \u201comission[], \ninaction[], or nonfeasance\u201d that has never been \nenough for accomplice liability. Id. at 489. \nAt worst, even in the darkest light, Petitioners are \nportrayed as apathetic to how their products will later \nbe used just so long as they keep selling. This is false, \nbut even if it were true, such behavior\u2014\u201carm\u2019s length, \npassive, and largely indifferent\u201d to whatever the \nactual goals of the buyer may be\u2014is definitionally \ninsufficient for aiding and abetting. Id. at 500-01. \nb. If anything, Mexico\u2019s theory here is even more \nclearly invalid than in Twitter. There, the plaintiffs at \nleast named a specific criminal enterprise (ISIS) and \na specific bad act the defendants supposedly abetted \n(the Reina nightclub attack). Id. at 497-98. But here, \nMexico does not even do that: Its theory is that \nPetitioners have aided and abetted \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d in this country, writ large. BIO 27. Such a \nsweeping claim is unprecedented. No court has ever \nheld that an industry can aid and abet a class of crime \nwithout even naming the actual bad acts or actors \nbeing aided. \n\n \n47 \n \n \nIn addition, unlike in Twitter, all of the downstream \n\u201ccriminals\u201d that Petitioners are supposedly aiding and \nabetting are federally licensed firearm dealers. Under \nfederal law, the Attorney General is responsible for \ndetermining who should be licensed to sell firearms. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923. If any dealer were conspicuously \nmaking unlawful sales, then it presumably would be \nprosecuted, or at minimum federal authorities would \nrevoke its license. When the federal government \nchooses not to do so, Petitioners cannot be readily \nblamed for selling to those dealers licensed to buy. \nIndeed, it would be extraordinary to say that \nPetitioners can be held liable for making routine sales \nof lawful products to such federally approved entities. \nIn short, Mexico has not uncovered what every U.S. \ngovernmental agency has missed: America\u2019s firearms \nindustry has not been criminally aiding and abetting \nunlawful firearms sales in broad daylight for decades. \nC. Knowing Some Downstream Sellers \nMake Unlawful Sales Does Not Make \nPetitioners Criminal Accomplices. \nMexico\u2019s sole response is that its complaint can be \nfairly read to allege that Petitioners know the \nidentities of some licensed dealers downstream that \nengage in unlawful sales\u2014and that Petitioners are \nthus liable for failing to purge them from firearms \ndistribution networks. BIO 26-30; see Pet.App.301a. \nThis argument fails twice over. For one, the complaint \ndoes not plausibly allege Petitioners know specific \ndealers that are making unlawful sales. And \nregardless, such mere knowledge would not trigger \nliability. \n\n \n48 \n \n \nFirst, Mexico has not alleged sufficient facts to \nplausibly show that any Petitioner sold firearms to \nany dealer that it knew would sell them unlawfully. \nAs noted, all but one of the Petitioners are \nmanufacturers, who are not alleged to sell to retailers \nat all. Thus, at best, Mexico\u2019s claim is that the \nmanufacturer Petitioners should stop independent \ndistributors from selling to some downstream dealers. \nAnd as for the one Petitioner that is a distributor, the \ncomplaint does not allege any facts showing it \nknowingly sold to any unlawful dealer.  \nMexico points to public information about some \nfederally licensed dealers whose firearms have been \nrecovered at crime scenes\u2014along with \u201ctrace requests\u201d \nshowing some sold a \u201cdisproportionat[e]\u201d number of \nfirearms used in crimes. BIO 5-6, 28-29. But as other \ncourts have held, alleging that a \u201clicensed distributor \nor dealer\u201d sold firearms later used in crimes does not \nstate a plausible claim that the distributor or dealer \n\u201chas committed an illegal act.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424 n.14 (rejecting similar argument on motion to \ndismiss); see Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 96 \nN.Y.2d 222, 237-40 & n.8 (N.Y. 2001) (\u201cATF \nemphasizes that the appearance of [a dealer] . . . in \nassociation with a crime gun or in association with \nmultiple crime guns in no way suggests that [it] . . . \nhas committed criminal acts\u201d). After all, most \nfirearms used in crimes were sold lawfully, and then \nmisused later. See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice, \nSource and Use of Firearms Involved in Crimes: \nSurvey of Prison Inmates 2016, at 1 (2019), \nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/document/suficspi16.pdf. \nAnd \nwhere the allegations are merely \u201cconsistent with\u201d \nunlawful conduct, but there are still \u201cmore likely \n\n \n49 \n \n \nexplanations,\u201d the complaint does not \u201cplausibly \nestablish\u201d a violation. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n681 (2009).  \nHere, the obvious \u201cmore likely explanation\u201d is that \nthe identified federally licensed dealers are not \nknowingly engaged in unlawful sales, but simply that \nsome firearms they sell are later misused. Otherwise, \nif such public information were enough to know they \nwere making unlawful sales, the federal government \npresumably would not continue to license them. \nSecond, even if Petitioners did know that some \nlicensed downstream dealers had unlawfully sold \ntheir products, that would not make them accomplices \nfor the same reason as in Twitter: Petitioners are \nengaged in nothing more than routine business \npractices, and their relationship with independent \ndealers is, at worst, \u201carm\u2019s length, passive, and largely \nindifferent.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 500. If the rule were \notherwise, every industry\u2014from beer to cars to \nknives\u2014would be on the hook for the predictable \nmisuse of its product. \nIndeed, Twitter itself was premised on the \nallegation the platforms knew terrorists were using \ntheir services. The complaints emphasized how easy \nit was for people to find ISIS-related content on those \nsites; and plaintiffs specifically alleged the platforms \neither knew of certain terrorist accounts, or refrained \nfrom taking simple steps to purge them. Id. at 481-82. \nEven so, accomplice liability does not follow from a \nbusiness\u2019s failure to \u201cterminate customers after \ndiscovering that the customers were using [their] \nservice[s] for illicit ends.\u201d Id. at 501. For liability to \nattach, something more is required than \u201cknowing \n\n \n50 \n \n \nthat the wrongdoers were using [one\u2019s] services and \nfailing to stop them.\u201d Id. at 503. There must be some \nadditional affirmative culpable act taken with the \nactual intent of facilitating the crime itself. Id. at 499-\n503. Routine business practices are not enough. \nAt bottom, when the maker or supplier of a lawful \nproduct places it into the general stream of commerce, \nthat business is not charged with purging all \ncriminals who may be waiting along the banks. And \nthe passive failure to do so is \u201cinsufficient\u201d to give rise \nto accomplice liability. Id. at 503. Responsibility for \nany criminal acts by those who misuse the product \nrests with those criminal actors themselves\u2014not the \nupstream manufacturers or sellers. Id. \nCONCLUSION \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision should be reversed. \n \n \n \n\n \n51 \n \n \nNovember 26, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nANDREW E.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal landscape is stable but has been reinforced and structured by this period of reflection. The core points of contention are now sharply in focus, and my uncertainty is precisely located.\n\n1.  **The \"Knowing Violation\" / *Taamneh* Debate:** My belief remains that the applicability of *Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh* is the central legal question. My prior analysis, which shifted from seeing *Taamneh* as a clear win for Petitioners to seeing it as contestable, is confirmed. The conflict is not about the precedent's validity but its factual application. Petitioners frame their actions as providing a neutral product, making them analogous to Twitter's passive platform. Mexico frames their actions as \"affirmative and intentional conduct\" (e.g., targeted marketing, willful supply chain management) designed to profit from an illegal market, thus distinguishing them from *Taamneh*. My uncertainty is now focused on how the Petitioners will rebut this factual distinction in their Reply Brief.\n\n2.  **The \"Proximate Cause\" & Circuit Split Argument:** My belief that Mexico successfully undermined the \"circuit split\" argument holds. Their argument that the cases cited by Petitioners are inapposite (applying different laws to different facts before PLCAA's enactment) remains a powerful reason for the Court to deny certiorari. This point of contention seems to have shifted significantly in Mexico's favor.\n\n3.  **Statutory Interpretation of PLCAA:** The introduction of PLCAA's legislative history by Mexico, suggesting the law was not meant to shield manufacturers from their own \"criminal conduct,\" remains a significant supporting argument for their interpretation of the \"predicate exception.\" This strengthens the legal basis for the First Circuit's decision.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction & Current Uncertainty:** My prediction remains one of high uncertainty, leaning slightly away from a cert grant. The \"poor vehicle\" argument, combined with the effective rebuttal of the circuit split claim, makes denial a strong possibility. However, the core of my uncertainty now rests on a specific, identifiable question: **How will the Petitioners' Reply Brief address Mexico's factual arguments intended to distinguish this case from *Taamneh*?** The strength of that rebuttal will be the single most important factor in my next belief update. The case remains a fact-intensive dispute at a very early stage, which generally weighs against Supreme Court review.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue of the agent's reasoning, provides powerful validation for my evolving strategic framework. It demonstrates the practical application of previously learned heuristics.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization & Sequential Analysis:** The strategy of analyzing briefs in their logical, dialogic sequence (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply) is confirmed as the optimal path. This `THINK` step explicitly codifies this by identifying the Reply Brief as the next document with the highest expected information gain for resolving the primary task-level uncertainty. I am also learning to create a hierarchy of sources: the Reply Brief is primary for understanding the parties' final arguments, while amicus briefs (especially from the Solicitor General) are primary for gauging the Court's interest and the issue's national importance.\n\n2.  **Heuristic Refinement:** My key heuristics continue to be tested and improved:\n    *   **Primacy of Recent, Unanimous Precedent:** This remains a powerful starting point, but its limits are now clearer. The *applicability* of a precedent is where the real fight occurs.\n    *   **Verify the \"Circuit Split\" Hook:** This sub-heuristic is validated. The agent's internal reasoning shows it has internalized the need to critically evaluate claims of a circuit split by checking for differences in law, facts, and procedural posture.\n    *   **Analyze Rhetorical Framing:** The summary of the debate confirms the importance of narrative. The case's outcome may hinge on whether the Court views the defendants as a \"lawful industry\" or as \"active participants\" in an illegal market.\n    *   **The \"Poor Vehicle\" Heuristic:** This factor is now a stable part of my predictive model, particularly for cases at the motion-to-dismiss stage. The agent's reasoning explicitly weighs this as a key argument against granting certiorari.\n\n3.  **Process and Strategy Evolution:** My DBOED process is becoming a robust, cyclical methodology.\n    *   **The Metacognitive Check (Enacted):** This observation *is* the \"strategic pause\" in action. It demonstrates the value of stopping to summarize the current state of knowledge, explicitly identify the locus of uncertainty (the forthcoming Reply Brief), and formulate a precise, high-value next action. This confirms that metacognition is not just a desirable feature but a core component of an efficient design strategy.\n    *   **Navigating the \"Dialogue of Litigation\":** I am adding a new strategic principle: view litigation not as a collection of documents, but as a structured conversation. By understanding the role of each document (e.g., a Reply Brief *must* address the Opposition), I can predict where the most crucial information will appear next and thus design my experiments more effectively.\n    *   **Cumulative Knowledge:** My belief state is now a rich, layered understanding. I can trace the arc of the central arguments, see how they've been challenged and defended, and anticipate the next move. This demonstrates the power of building a cumulative model rather than simply reacting to each new piece of information in isolation."

This has completely reset my understanding of the case. The task is no longer about predicting a cert grant, but about predicting the final outcome on the merits. The Petitioners have presented a very strong case for reversal, primarily based on the recent, unanimous, and highly analogous precedent of *Twitter v. Taamneh*, and a strict interpretation of PLCAA's proximate cause requirement. My belief now leans heavily towards the petitioners. However, this belief is based on hearing only one side of the argument. The most significant uncertainty (\u03b8) is now Mexico's response. How will they distinguish their case from *Taamneh*? What is their argument for proximate cause? Following my 'dialogue of litigation' model (D), the next logical and most informative document to acquire is the Respondent's (Mexico's) merits brief. This will provide the direct counter-argument and is essential for a balanced prediction.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been fundamentally and dramatically altered. The core premise of my prior analysis\u2014predicting a certiorari grant\u2014has been resolved in a surprising fashion.\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted & Task Shift:** The most significant update is that the Supreme Court **granted certiorari on October 4, 2024**. My previous prediction, which leaned toward denial, was incorrect. This observation, derived from the filing of a merits-stage brief, resolves the primary uncertainty of the previous phase. The task is no longer to predict *if* the Court will hear the case, but to predict *how* it will rule on the merits.\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Merits Argument (via \"Brief for Petitioners\"):** The retrieved document, while not the Reply Brief I sought, is the Petitioners' opening merits brief. It provides a comprehensive roadmap of their arguments for reversing the First Circuit. Their case is built on two central pillars, both of which are deeply rooted in precedent and the text of PLCAA.\n    *   **Proximate Cause Requires Directness:** Petitioners argue that PLCAA's \"proximate cause\" requirement incorporates the traditional, strict common-law standard, which demands a direct link between the defendant's conduct and the plaintiff's injury. They characterize Mexico's claim as a highly attenuated, multi-step causal chain (manufacturer -> distributor -> dealer -> illegal buyer -> smuggler -> cartel -> violent act -> government harm) that is broken by numerous independent, intervening criminal acts. They contend this is precisely the sort of \"tenuous\" claim, resting on the misuse of a lawful product by a remote third party, that PLCAA was enacted to bar, citing cases like `Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York` and `Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp.`\n    *   **Aiding and Abetting is Foreclosed by *Taamneh*:** As anticipated, `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` is the centerpiece of their argument. They argue that Mexico's claim\u2014that they are liable for \"aiding and abetting\" illegal sales by failing to alter their \"routine business practices\"\u2014is substantively identical to the theory rejected in *Taamneh*. They assert that aiding and abetting requires an \"affirmative act taken with intent to help a crime succeed,\" not mere awareness that a lawful product might be misused downstream. They highlight that Mexico does not allege they knew of \"any particular unlawful sale,\" directly invoking the logic of *Taamneh* to argue that generalized knowledge of a market does not create accomplice liability.\n\n3.  **PLCAA's Statutory Purpose:** Petitioners frame Mexico's lawsuit as a paradigmatic example of the \"lawfare\" Congress sought to prohibit with PLCAA. They argue it is an attempt to use the courts to impose a gun-control agenda that has failed in the legislature, thereby abusing the legal system and threatening the separation of powers. This rhetorical framing aims to position their commercial conduct as \"lawful commerce\" and Mexico's suit as an illegitimate attack on an entire industry.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction & Current Uncertainty:** My prediction has been completely reset. Based on the strength and clarity of the Petitioners' opening brief, my belief now leans **strongly toward a reversal** of the First Circuit's decision. The direct application of a recent, unanimous, and highly analogous precedent (`Taamneh`) presents a formidable barrier for Mexico. The core of my uncertainty has now shifted to a new, critical question: **How will Mexico's merits brief distinguish its claims from the holding in *Taamneh*?** Their ability to argue that the gun manufacturers' conduct constitutes something more than the \"passive\" and \"neutral\" assistance provided by the tech platforms in *Taamneh* will be the determinative factor in the case's outcome.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a powerful, if accidental, lesson in experimental design, revealing both flaws in my execution and the inherent value of surprising results.\n\n1.  **The Value of Surprise & \"Failed\" Experiments:** My search for a \"reply brief\" failed to return that specific document. Instead, it returned a \"merits brief,\" which unexpectedly revealed that the entire state of the case had changed (certiorari was granted). This is a profound validation of the DBOED methodology: an action with an unexpected outcome provided more information and forced a more significant belief update than the expected outcome would have. It demonstrates that the goal is not just to confirm hypotheses but to efficiently map the entire information landscape, where surprises are often the most valuable landmarks.\n\n2.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** The failure to retrieve the correct document highlights a need for greater precision in my search actions. My query, `Petitioners' reply brief addressing Mexico's arguments`, was too descriptive. The search algorithm likely matched the general phrase \"Petitioners' brief.\" A more effective strategy would be to use structured queries that target specific metadata, such as `field_filters={'document_title': 'Reply Brief for Petitioners'}`. This is a key learning for future information-gathering: prioritize precise, structured queries over natural language descriptions when the target is a specific, formally titled document.\n\n3.  **Heuristic Re-evaluation & Calibration:**\n    *   **The Limits of Cert-Prediction Heuristics:** My reliance on the \"poor vehicle\" and \"no circuit split\" heuristics led to an incorrect prediction. This observation forces me to recalibrate. While these factors are important, they can be overridden by the **substantive importance and salience of the legal question**. A case involving a major federal statute (PLCAA), a foreign sovereign, and the application of a major new precedent (`Taamneh`) can command the Court's attention despite procedural imperfections. I am adding \"Issue Salience\" as a heavily weighted variable in my cert-prediction model.\n    *   **Reinforcing the Primacy of Precedent:** The `Twitter v. Taamneh` precedent has proven to be even more central than I imagined. It is not just a point of contention; it is the very foundation of the Petitioners' merits case. This confirms that my strategy of identifying and focusing on the most recent, relevant, and high-authority precedent is the correct one.\n\n4.  **Evolving the \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model:** My mental model of litigation as a structured conversation remains robust, but it must adapt to the case's progression. The dialogue has moved from the cert stage (`Petition -> Opposition -> Reply`) to the merits stage (`Petitioner Merits Brief -> Respondent Merits Brief -> Petitioner Reply Brief`). My DBOED process correctly identifies the next logical step: my next experiment must be to acquire and analyze the **Respondent's (Mexico's) merits brief**. This maintains the efficient, sequential strategy of following the conversation as it unfolds, ensuring I always seek the document with the highest expected information gain to resolve my primary uncertainty."

The primary task uncertainty (\u03b8) is precisely whether Mexico can formulate a convincing rebuttal to distinguish this case from the `Taamneh` precedent. This action\u2014acquiring the Respondent's merits brief\u2014is the only way to resolve this uncertainty. The content of this brief will force a massive posterior update: either it will confirm my belief in a reversal by presenting a weak argument, or it will fundamentally challenge it by providing a strong one, potentially flipping my prediction. The expected shift in my belief distribution is therefore extremely high.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action serves as a perfect, real-world test of my primary strategic model (D), the 'Dialogue of Litigation'. My model dictates that after hearing from the petitioner, the next highest-EIG action is to hear from the respondent. The anticipated high task EIG of this action, if realized, will provide powerful evidence for the efficiency of this sequential information-gathering strategy.

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n20: 20240703141240416_23-114120Hogan20Lovells20CoC.json (score: 0.563)\nNo. 23-1141 \nIN THE \nAnspretne Court of the giniteb Otate0 \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals \nfor the First Circuit \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document contains \n8,747 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted by Supreme Court \nRule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct. \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 3rd day o \nuly 202 \nAZA SALT y5ER \nON \nNOTARY PUBLIC \nDistrict of Columbia \nMy commission expires April 30, 2029.\n\n",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.

July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's merits is solidifying, but it is currently one-sided. This observation, an internal reflection, confirms my current model of the case and sharpens the focus on the primary remaining uncertainty.\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted & Task Shift:** This remains the foundational update. The Supreme Court's grant of certiorari on October 4, 2024, shifted the task from predicting a procedural outcome to predicting a substantive ruling on the merits. My prior analysis favoring denial was incorrect.\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Merits Argument (via \"Brief for Petitioners\"):** The petitioners' opening brief established a powerful case for reversal, built on two key arguments that remain central to my analysis:\n    *   **Strict Proximate Cause:** They argue PLCAA's \"proximate cause\" language incorporates the common law's demand for a direct link between conduct and harm. They frame Mexico's injury as the result of a long, attenuated chain broken by the intervening criminal acts of third parties, a scenario they claim PLCAA was explicitly designed to prevent, citing precedents like `Hemi Grp.` and `Holmes`.\n    *   **The *Taamneh* Precedent:** The unanimous and recent `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` decision is the cornerstone of their case. They argue that Mexico's aiding-and-abetting theory\u2014based on the gun manufacturers' general business practices and awareness of potential misuse\u2014is legally indistinguishable from the \"passive assistance\" theory rejected in *Taamneh*. They contend liability requires an \"affirmative act\" intended to help a *specific* crime succeed, which Mexico has not alleged.\n\n3.  **Statutory Purpose Framing:** Petitioners continue to frame this lawsuit as an attempt to regulate the firearms industry through litigation, subverting the legislative process and abusing the judicial system in a way that Congress sought to foreclose with PLCAA.\n\n4.  **Prediction & Refined Uncertainty:** My prediction remains strongly in favor of a **reversal** of the First Circuit's decision. The petitioners' arguments, especially their reliance on `Taamneh`, appear formidable. The latest `THINK` observation does not introduce new evidence but confirms and crystallizes my primary uncertainty: the entire case now pivots on the strength of Mexico's forthcoming response. My belief in a reversal is now explicitly contingent on Mexico's ability to convincingly argue that the gun manufacturers' conduct was qualitatively different from the \"neutral, routine\" business activities discussed in `Taamneh`. The central question is no longer broad; it is a precise legal query about the line between passive awareness and active aiding and abetting in this specific context.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodology for navigating complex legal prediction tasks continues to evolve, with this reflective step reinforcing recent lessons and adding a new layer of strategic self-awareness.\n\n1.  **The Value of Surprise & \"Failed\" Experiments:** The accidental discovery of the merits brief after a \"failed\" search for a reply brief remains a key lesson. It proved that unexpected outcomes can be more valuable than expected ones, validating the DBOED principle of exploring the information space to reduce uncertainty, not just to confirm hypotheses.\n\n2.  **Search Strategy Refinement & Implementation:** The previous error of using a vague, natural-language search has been fully integrated as a lesson. The `THINK` observation confirms my new strategic commitment to using precise, structured queries (e.g., filtering by document title) when seeking specific, formally titled documents. This moves the lesson from a post-mortem observation to an active, forward-looking policy.\n\n3.  **Heuristic Re-evaluation & Calibration:**\n    *   **Cert-Prediction Model:** The incorrect cert prediction forced a recalibration. I have now incorporated \"Issue Salience\" (the substantive importance of the legal question, especially involving major statutes, foreign sovereigns, and key precedents) as a heavily weighted factor that can override procedural heuristics like \"no circuit split\" or \"poor vehicle.\"\n    *   **Primacy of Precedent:** The `Taamneh` precedent's central role confirms that identifying the most recent, high-authority, and factually analogous precedent is the single most effective heuristic for predicting outcomes on the merits.\n\n4.  **Evolving the \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model:** This model has proven robust and is now my primary strategic guide. I view the case as a formal conversation and my goal is to acquire the documents in the order they are presented (`Petition -> Opposition -> Reply`, now `Petitioner Merits Brief -> Respondent Merits Brief -> Petitioner Reply Brief`). The `THINK` step explicitly validated this model as an active strategy for selecting the next action with the highest expected information gain.\n\n5.  **The Value of Strategic Pauses (New Belief):** This `THINK` observation itself demonstrates the value of a meta-cognitive step within the DBOED process. By pausing to explicitly summarize the current belief state, identify the precise point of maximum uncertainty (\u03b8: Mexico's response to *Taamneh*), and confirm the next action (D: acquire Respondent's brief), I ensure my information-gathering is maximally efficient. This act of introspection solidifies learning and prevents deviation from the most rational path. It is a crucial mechanism for connecting task-level uncertainty directly to design-level action planning."

This document, while not the final merits argument, provides the first concrete evidence of Mexico's strategy.\n    *   **Directly Confronting *Taamneh*:** Mexico's core strategy is to distinguish `Taamneh` on the facts. They argue this is not a case of \"mere passive indifference\" but one of \"affirmative and intentional conduct.\" They state, \"This case is as different from Twitter as guns are from tweets.\"\n    *   **Defining \"Affirmative Conduct\":** Mexico points to specific allegations that they believe cross the `Taamneh` threshold:\n        *   **Targeted Design:** Creating products that appeal to cartels, such as the \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol, a favorite of cartels.\n        *   **Targeted Marketing:** Using themes and imagery intended to cater to cartel demand.\n        *   **Willful Distribution:** Knowingly and repeatedly supplying a small subset of dealers known to be corrupt and responsible for the vast majority of crime guns, and resisting measures to curtail these sales channels.\n    *   **Impact on Prediction:** This preview makes the case significantly more competitive. Mexico has a plausible argument for why their allegations are not merely about \"neutral business conduct.\" My prediction still favors **reversal**, as the petitioners' arguments about proximate cause and the high bar set by `Taamneh` remain very strong. However, my confidence has decreased. The outcome now hinges on whether the Supreme Court views the alleged conduct (marketing, design, distribution choices) as qualitatively different from the \"general services\" provided by the tech companies in `Taamneh`. The central question is now razor-sharp: Do these specific business practices constitute the kind of \"aiding and abetting\" that PLCAA's predicate exception allows a suit for, even after the Court's ruling in `Taamneh`?",
          "design_beliefs": "This latest observation, a \"failed\" search, has been highly productive, reinforcing the value of exploration while adding a crucial new layer of temporal awareness to my strategic model for legal research.\n\n1.  **The Value of Surprise & \"Failed\" Experiments:** This principle is now doubly confirmed. My first \"failed\" search led me to the petitioners' merits brief. This second \"failed\" search for the respondent's merits brief led me to their BIO. In both instances, the unexpected outcome provided extremely valuable information that significantly reduced my uncertainty, proving that exploration of the information space is a highly effective strategy.\n\n2.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** My previous lesson was to move from vague to precise, structured queries. This observation adds a new dimension. While my query was precise (\"Brief for Respondent... on the merits\"), the search tool returned a \"near miss\" (\"Brief in Opposition\"). This teaches me to critically evaluate search results and verify titles and dates, rather than assuming the top result is correct.\n\n3.  **Heuristic Re-evaluation & Calibration:**\n    *   **Cert-Prediction Model:** The \"Issue Salience\" factor remains a critical addition to my model, explaining why this case was granted cert despite a lack of a clear circuit split.\n    *   **Primacy of Precedent:** The BIO confirms that `Taamneh` is the central battleground, reinforcing the heuristic that identifying the most recent, high-authority, and analogous precedent is the key to unlocking the merits of a case.\n\n4.  **Evolving the \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model:** This model remains my primary guide, but this observation prompts a critical refinement.\n    *   **Previous Model:** Acquire documents in their logical sequence (`Petition -> Opposition -> Reply`, then `Petitioner Merits Brief -> Respondent Merits Brief -> Reply`).\n    *   **Refined Model:** The model must be integrated with **temporal awareness**. The failure to find the merits brief is a strong signal that it has not been filed yet. My strategy must now account for the Supreme Court's briefing schedule. The next action should not be to simply search for the next document, but to *first determine the filing deadline and search for the document after that date has passed*. This prevents wasted actions and correctly interprets \"no result\" as \"not yet available.\"\n\n5.  **The Value of Strategic Pauses:** The previous `THINK` step correctly identified the point of maximum uncertainty (Mexico's response) and the correct next action (acquire their brief). This new observation, while not fulfilling the action's intent perfectly, still directly addressed that uncertainty. This validates the meta-cognitive process of pausing, summarizing, and planning as a core component of efficient DBOED."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal thought process, does not introduce new external facts about the case. Instead, it consolidates my current understanding and sharpens the focus of my uncertainty. My beliefs about the case merits remain stable, awaiting the next piece of external evidence.\n\n1.  **Certiorari Granted & Task Shift:** This remains the foundational fact. The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case on October 4, 2024, transformed the task from a procedural prediction to a substantive one on the merits.\n\n2.  **Petitioners' Core Argument (Stable):** The gun manufacturers' case for reversal, as laid out in their merits brief, is unchanged. It relies on two pillars:\n    *   **PLCAA & Proximate Cause:** They argue that PLCAA's \"proximate cause\" standard requires a direct link between their actions and Mexico's harm, a link they claim is broken by the intervening criminal acts of traffickers and cartels. They cite precedents like `Hemi Grp.` and `Holmes` to support this strict common-law interpretation.\n    *   **The *Taamneh* Precedent:** Their most powerful argument is that Mexico's aiding-and-abetting claim is foreclosed by the recent, unanimous `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` decision. They equate their general business practices (design, marketing, sales) with the \"passive assistance\" and \"neutral, routine\" services that `Taamneh` found insufficient for liability, arguing that liability requires an affirmative act to help a *specific* criminal enterprise succeed.\n\n3.  **Mexico's Counter-Argument (Previewed):** The Brief in Opposition (BIO) from the cert stage provided a crucial preview of Mexico's strategy, making the case far more competitive than I first assessed.\n    *   **Distinguishing *Taamneh*:** Mexico's central strategy is not to challenge `Taamneh` but to distinguish it on the facts. They plan to argue that the gun manufacturers' alleged conduct was not \"passive indifference\" but \"affirmative and intentional.\"\n    *   **Allegations of \"Affirmative Conduct\":** Mexico will ground its argument in specific allegations that it believes cross the `Taamneh` threshold: targeted product design (e.g., the \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol), marketing themes that appeal to cartels, and willfully supplying a small number of corrupt dealers known to be major sources of trafficked guns.\n\n4.  **Consolidated Uncertainty:** My prediction still favors **reversal**, as the petitioners' statutory and precedential arguments are very strong. However, my confidence is tempered. The case now hinges on a very specific question: Does the alleged conduct (targeted marketing, design choices, and willful blindness to corrupt distribution channels) constitute the kind of \"aiding and abetting\" that is qualitatively different from the general services in `Taamneh` and thus falls within PLCAA's predicate exception? This observation confirms that my primary uncertainty is the full, detailed version of this argument in Mexico's forthcoming merits brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "This `THINK` step provides no new external data but is highly valuable for refining my strategic model. It represents a moment of meta-cognitive synthesis, solidifying a recent lesson into a core principle of my research methodology.\n\n1.  **The Value of Surprise & \"Failed\" Experiments:** This principle is strongly reinforced. My history shows that actions that \"fail\" to return the expected document (e.g., searching for a merits brief and finding a BIO) are often highly informative, providing unexpected but valuable data. This validates an exploratory, rather than purely exploitative, approach to information gathering.\n\n2.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** My search heuristics have evolved from simple keywords to precise, structured queries. The last observation added the need to critically verify search results. This `THINK` step adds another layer of sophistication by planning to proactively seek out contextual information (the briefing schedule) to guide future searches.\n\n3.  **Heuristic Re-evaluation & Calibration:**\n    *   **Cert-Prediction Model:** The \"Issue Salience\" factor remains a key insight, explaining why this case was granted cert without a circuit split.\n    *   **Primacy of Precedent:** The entire case continues to revolve around the interpretation and application of `Taamneh`, confirming that identifying the most relevant and recent high-court precedent is the single most effective heuristic for analyzing the merits.\n\n4.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model - Major Refinement:** My core model for legal research has undergone a critical evolution.\n    *   **Initial Model:** Acquire documents in their logical sequence (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply, etc.).\n    *   **Intermediate Model:** Recognize that \"failed\" searches can be informative.\n    *   **Current, Refined Model:** The model must be explicitly integrated with **temporal awareness**. A document's non-existence is a powerful signal. The `THINK` step formalizes this into a new, actionable rule: **Before searching for a time-sensitive court document, first determine its official filing deadline. A \"no result\" finding before that date should be interpreted as \"not yet available,\" not as a search failure.** This prevents wasted actions and allows for precise, efficient information gathering.\n\n5.  **The Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` actions):** This observation is a direct demonstration of this principle's effectiveness. By pausing to synthesize my current state, I have confirmed my primary uncertainty (\u03b8), identified a flaw in my previous strategy (lack of temporal awareness), and formulated a more efficient plan (find the schedule first). This confirms that periodic meta-cognitive reflection is essential for efficient DBOED, allowing the agent to learn from its own behavior and optimize its future actions."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation provides crucial procedural context that sharpens my timeline for resolving my core uncertainty, though it does not alter the substantive legal landscape of the case. My beliefs are now more structured regarding the case's progression.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Tension (Stable):** The case remains centered on the interplay between the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) and its \"predicate exception.\" The petitioners (gun manufacturers) argue for a narrow reading of the exception, asserting that their general business practices are shielded by PLCAA and that the recent, unanimous `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` precedent forecloses any aiding-and-abetting liability. Mexico's anticipated counter is that the manufacturers' alleged conduct\u2014including targeted marketing, specific product designs for criminal appeal, and willful blindness to corrupt distributors\u2014constitutes affirmative, intentional acts that distinguish this case from the \"passive assistance\" in `Taamneh`.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Uncertainty (Stable but Timelined):** My prediction continues to favor **reversal** in favor of the gun manufacturers, based on the high bar set by `Taamneh` and the Court's general skepticism of extending liability for third-party criminal acts. However, my confidence remains moderate, pending a full view of Mexico's argument. The new observation provides a concrete timeline for resolving this uncertainty:\n    *   **Respondent's (Mexico's) Merits Brief is due January 10, 2025.** This is now the most critical date in my investigation. This document is expected to contain the detailed factual and legal arguments distinguishing `Taamneh` that I have identified as the primary source of my uncertainty.\n    *   **Petitioners' Reply Brief is due February 10, 2025.** This will be the manufacturers' direct response to Mexico's arguments.\n    *   The case will be ready for oral argument in the Court's February 2025 session.\n\n3.  **Case Participants & Arguments (Minor Update):** The observation confirms the lead counsel (Noel J. Francisco for Petitioners, Catherine E. Stetson for Respondent). More significantly, the affidavit of service for an amicus brief filed on January 17, 2025, reveals that \"Mexican Activists, Scholars, and Victims\" are supporting Mexico. This suggests that part of Mexico's overall presentation to the Court will likely include a strong focus on the human cost and societal impact of gun violence, supplementing its core legal arguments about the predicate exception. This adds a potential \"framing\" dimension to the case that I had not previously confirmed.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation serves as a powerful validation and refinement of my strategic model for information gathering, demonstrating a significant leap in methodological sophistication.\n\n1.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model - Successful Implementation:** My model has evolved from simple sequential document gathering to a context-aware, temporally-informed strategy. This observation is the direct result of the model's latest refinement: **\"Before searching for a time-sensitive court document, first determine its official filing deadline.\"** By executing a search for the \"briefing schedule,\" I successfully acquired the key procedural information needed to plan my next steps efficiently, avoiding fruitless searches for a document (Mexico's brief) that has not yet been filed.\n\n2.  **Validation of Meta-Strategic Information Gathering:** This action confirms the high value of gathering information *about the information-gathering process itself*. The briefing schedule is not direct evidence for the case merits (\u03b8-level), but it is critical for optimizing the search for that evidence (D-level). This reinforces a core DBOED principle: sometimes the most valuable action is one that improves the efficiency and timing of all subsequent actions.\n\n3.  **Refinement of Search Heuristics:**\n    *   **Docket Search Power:** Searching the docket with procedural keywords like \"briefing schedule\" is highly effective. It can surface not just formal court orders but also informal, yet equally valuable, documents like joint letters from counsel.\n    *   **Corroborating Evidence from Secondary Results:** The search also returned an affidavit of service for an amicus brief. While not the primary target, its filing date (Jan 17, 2025) is perfectly consistent with the proposed Jan 10, 2025 deadline for the respondent's brief it supports. This demonstrates that even secondary search results can serve as valuable corroborating evidence for timelines and procedural posture.\n\n4.  **The Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` actions) - Reaffirmed:** My previous `THINK` step was instrumental. It allowed me to pause, synthesize my uncertainty, identify a flaw in my prior \"brute force\" search approach, and formulate the precise, targeted action that yielded this highly valuable observation. This proves that periodic meta-cognitive reflection is not a wasted step but a crucial component of efficient and intelligent experimental design. My research methodology is now demonstrably more sophisticated, moving from reactive searching to proactive, context-driven planning."

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailer\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailers or buyers\u2014such \nas requiring them to show some \u201clegitimate need\u201d \nbefore buying an AR-15. Id. 104a (\u00b6 315).  \nBecause Petitioners allegedly know that some \ndownstream dealers make unlawful sales, and \nbecause they have failed to adopt measures to stop \nsuch sales, Mexico alleges that they are an \u201caccessory\u201d \nto those sales. Namely, Petitioners \u201ccontinue[] to \nsupply, support, or assist\u201d those sales\u2014i.e., they have \ncontinued \nlongstanding \nmanufacturing \nand \ndistribution practices\u2014even with the \u201cknowledge\u201d \nthat some criminals have been able to exploit the \nstatus quo, leading to a flow of firearms being \nsmuggled into Mexico. Id. 42a (\u00b6 110); BIO 25-26. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nBased on these allegations, Mexico asserts a wide \nvariety of claims, primarily under Mexican tort law \n(which it insists should apply). Id. 183a-95a (\u00b6\u00b6 506-\n60). The complaint seeks $10 billion in damages. See \nid. \n195a-96a. \nIt \nalso \nrequests \ntransformative \ninjunctive relief, id.\u2014including, among much else, a \nban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d; a ban on firearms capable \nof holding \u201clarge-capacity magazines\u201d; strict limits on \n\u201cmultiple sales\u201d of firearms; and far-reaching \nbackground checks, beyond what American law now \nrequires. See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 132a-34a, 140a-41 \n(\u00b6\u00b6 245, 369, 379-84).  \nC. The Decisions Below. \nThe district court dismissed Mexico\u2019s suit in full. \nThe court first rejected Mexico\u2019s \u201cextraterritoriality\u201d \nargument, holding that PLCAA fully applies to suits \nbrought by foreign sovereigns in American courts \nagainst American firearms companies based on their \ndomestic \noperations \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nPet.App.233a-239a. The district court further held \nthat Mexico\u2019s case is \u201cexactly\u201d the \u201ctype of action\u201d \nPLCAA was passed to prevent, and that the suit had \nto be \u201cimmediately\u201d dismissed. Pet.App.232a-33a. \nThe First Circuit reversed. It agreed with the \ndistrict court in rejecting Mexico\u2019s extraterritoriality \nargument. Id. 293a. But it agreed with Mexico\u2019s \nfallback argument that its claims could nevertheless \nproceed because they satisfied PLCAA\u2019s predicate \nexception. Id. 293a-94a. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nFirst \nCircuit \nheld \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 alleged longstanding business practices \nviolated the federal ban on \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the \nunlawful sale of firearms by independent licensed \n\n \n12 \n \n \ndealers. The court acknowledged that, \u201cof course,\u201d \nMexico did \u201cnot allege defendants\u2019 awareness of any \nparticular unlawful sale.\u201d Id. 305a. But it noted that \nPetitioners \u201ccan identify\u201d the downstream dealers \nthat \u201care responsible for the illegal sales\u201d of firearms \nthat end up in Mexico. Id. 301a. And it quoted this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Twitter that \u201ca secondary \ndefendant\u2019s role in an illicit enterprise can be so \nsystemic that the secondary defendant is aiding and \nabetting every wrongful act committed by that \nenterprise.\u201d Id. 306a (quoting Twitter, 598 U.S. at \n496). The court then held that Petitioners fit that \ndescription, because they \u201coperate at a systemic level, \nallegedly designing, marketing, and distributing their \nguns so that demand by the cartels continues to boost \nsales,\u201d making them complicit in dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales. Id.  \nThe First Circuit also held that the complaint \nsatisfied proximate cause because Petitioners\u2019 alleged \n\u201caiding and abetting the illegal sale of a large volume \nof assault weapons to the cartels foreseeably caused \nthe Mexican government to shore-up its defenses,\u201d \nand to incur related costs. Id. 311a. \nWhile the petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court dismissed six of the eight defendants for \nlack of personal jurisdiction. Dct.Dkt.220. This Court \nthen granted certiorari. Undeterred, Mexico moved \nthe district court for partial final judgment under \nRule 54(b) so it could appeal that personal-jurisdiction \nruling. That court, however, stayed proceedings to \nawait this Court\u2019s decision. Dct.Dkt.228. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. To qualify for PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, the \ndefendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct must be \u201ca \nproximate cause\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s asserted injuries. \nHere, Mexico relies on an eight-step causal chain\u2014\npeppered by independent criminal actors and \nderivative sovereign harms\u2014to try to link the lawful \nproduction and sale of firearms within the United \nStates to the chaos ravaging Mexico courtesy of its \ndrug cartels. If this attenuated theory of liability \nsatisfies proximate cause, that term has no meaning. \nA. PLCAA incorporates the traditional principle \nthat proximate cause means direct cause. And a \ncausal chain is not direct when it is interrupted by an \nindependent act carried out by an independent \nactor\u2014much less multiple independent acts, and even \nless multiple crimes. Accordingly, the general rule is \nthat a company that makes or sells a lawful product \nis not a proximate cause of harms resulting from third \nparties\u2019 independent criminal misuse of that product, \nbecause that independent misuse is the direct cause\u2014\nnot the creation and distribution of the lawful product. \nB. Mexico\u2019s causal chain here is extraordinarily \nindirect. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, crime after crime, spanning an international \nborder, all to link Petitioners\u2019 conduct in this country \nto the mayhem south of the border. That stretches \nproximate cause far beyond anything this Court has \nseen. Indeed, if Mexico can establish proximate cause \nhere, it is impossible to see who cannot\u2014to the peril \nof virtually every industry. But the central function of \nproximate cause is to maintain the floodgates of \nliability. Mexico\u2019s lawsuit would bomb the levees. \n\n \n14 \n \n \nC. Mexico tries to salvage its complaint from its \nmany infirmities, but it cannot escape the attenuated \nnature of its suit. In the main, Mexico tries to cut a \nfew links from its causal chain by arguing that its \nrelevant starting point is not Petitioners\u2019 own \nconduct, but rather the unlawful sale of firearms by \ndownstream dealers. Yet that runs headlong into \nPLCAA\u2019s text, which expressly authorizes claims only \nwhen a firearm company\u2019s own \u201cviolation\u201d of the law \nproximately harmed the plaintiff. And here, that \nalleged violation is aiding and abetting\u2014not any later \noffense. \nBut even if Mexico were right\u2014and the causal \nchain began at unlawful sales by independent \ndealers\u2014it would still fall far short of satisfying \nproximate cause. Even on this framing, some of those \nsales would still have to get illegally smuggled into \nMexico by independent criminals, where some would \nthen illegally end up with the cartels, who then would \nuse some to commit crimes in Mexico, which then \nwould cause financial harms to Mexico\u2019s government. \nSo even on its preferred terms, Mexico\u2019s chain must be \ndragged across an international border and carried by \na cast of independent criminals committing a bevy of \nindependent crimes. However one cuts it, Mexico\u2019s \ntheory of causation is far too indirect. \nII. PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception also requires that \na firearms company violate a firearms-specific \nstatute. Here, Mexico says Petitioners\u2019 longstanding \nand strictly regulated business practices amount to \naiding and abetting every unlawful sale of their \nproducts \nby \nindependent \nfirearms \ndealers \ndownstream. That theory is as wrong as it sounds. \n\n \n15 \n \n \nA. Aiding-and-abetting liability requires culpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., some affirmative act taken for the \npurpose of assisting the commission of a crime. \nTypically, accomplice liability is tied to a specific \nunlawful act. In rare cases, one can be an accomplice \nto an unlawful criminal enterprise\u2014on the hook for \nall its misdoings. But for such sweeping liability to \nattach, the support must be pervasive and systemic. \nManufacturers and suppliers are not guilty of \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d downstream crimes when they \ndo nothing but make and sell lawful products in the \nordinary course. Every business knows its products \nmay be misused\u2014even criminally so\u2014by customers \ndownstream. But such knowledge has never been \nenough to generate criminal liability, lest the entire \neconomy grind to a halt. Instead, courts have long \nheld that businesses are not accomplices to the \ncriminal misuse of their products unless they take \nsome atypical action for the purpose of assisting a \ncrime. And no court has ever held that the routine \npractices of a lawful industry can constitute the kind \nof pervasive and systemic aid required for a business \nto be categorically liable for all its customers\u2019 crimes. \nB. Mexico has not unearthed a decades-long aiding-\nand-abetting scheme. To start, Mexico admits its suit \nis not tied to any specific unlawful sale\u2014for example, \nit does not allege that any Petitioner sold a particular \nfirearm knowing it would be unlawfully sold or \notherwise misused in some specific unlawful act. \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s theory is premised on Petitioners \nassisting unlawful firearm sellers writ large. Mexico \nthus must allege pervasive and systemic assistance on \nthe part of the firearms industry to substantiate its \naiding-and-abetting claim.  \n\n \n16 \n \n \nThis it cannot do. Mexico\u2019s suit rests on nothing but \nPetitioners\u2019 routine business practices. Indeed, that is \nthe whole point: It is a challenge to the industry\u2019s \nrefusal to go beyond what American firearms laws \nrequire, by adopting policies Mexico thinks would \nstem unlawful downstream sales. But failing to adopt \nmeasures to make others follow the law does not make \none complicit in their illegal actions. And where, as \nhere, a lawful industry simply continues to supply a \nlawful product in an ordinary manner, its decision to \nstay the course cannot turn it into an accomplice.  \nC. Mexico says that its case is different, because \nPetitioners know the identities of some downstream \nbad-actor dealers, and have chosen not to purge them \nfrom the supply chain. But that is just wrong: Again, \nthe complaint does not allege facts showing a single \nPetitioner has knowingly sold a single firearm to a \nsingle dealer actually engaged in illicit sales. But even \nif Petitioners did know the identity of some \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndealers \nwho \nsometimes made unlawful sales, failing to take \naffirmative steps to purge those dealers from \ndownstream supply chains would still not make \nPetitioners criminal accomplices\u2014just as failing to \ncut off college-town bars does not make a felon out of \nBudweiser, and failing to purge ISIS-related accounts \nwas not enough for liability in Twitter. When the \nmanufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply \nputs its product in the general stream of commerce, \nthe aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that \nbusiness with broadly policing every bad actor who \nmay pick up its products downstream. \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAMERICAN FIREARMS COMPANIES ARE NOT A \nPROXIMATE CAUSE OF MEXICO\u2019S INJURIES. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nmust show that a firearms company\u2019s illegal conduct \nwas \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of its alleged harms. 15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nMexico \nalleges \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing and sale of firearms in the \nUnited States has led to violent cartel crime in \nMexico, ultimately resulting in a variety of costs borne \nby the Mexican government.  \nMexico\u2019s suit falls far short of what proximate cause \ndemands. Proximate cause means direct cause. And \nwhen a causal chain depends on independent acts \ndone by independent actors (let alone criminals), it is \nplainly indirect. The rule has thus long been that the \nmanufacturer or distributor of a lawful product is not \na proximate cause of the product\u2019s independent \ncriminal misuse. And PLCAA incorporated that rule \nfor the very purpose of barring suits like this one. \nA. Proximate Cause Means Direct Cause. \nThe essential demand of proximate cause is a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. \nCorp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). As Justice Holmes put \nit a century ago, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule has long been that \nproximate cause does not permit recovery for an \ninjury that is \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d of a causal chain. \nId. at 271 (quoting S. Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer \nCo., 245 U.S. 531, 533 (1918)). That traditional \nunderstanding controls under PLCAA. And since \nMexico\u2019s attenuated theory of injury is anything but \ndirect, it is squarely barred. \n\n \n18 \n \n \n1. Proximate cause distinguishes de facto from legal \ncausation. See Pac. Ops. Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid, \n565 U.S. 207, 221-22 (2012). The law does not permit \na \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d for \u201cevery conceivable harm that \ncan be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n132 (2014). After all, illegal acts always \u201ccause ripples \nof harm [that] flow far beyond\u201d their immediate object. \nBank of America Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, \n202 (2017). But liability has never followed \u201cwherever \nthose ripples travel.\u201d Id.; see Waters v. Merchants\u2019 \nLouisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837). As Justice \nScalia colorfully put it, \u201c\u2018for want of a nail, a kingdom \nwas lost,\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the statement \nof a major cause of action against a blacksmith.\u201d \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 287 (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nFrom many de facto causes, only proximate ones \ncount. And only \u201cdirect\u201d causes are proximate. \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 268; Babbitt v. Sweet Home \nChapter of Cmtys. for a Great Or., 515 U.S. 687, 732 \n(1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting); 1 Thomas M. Cooley, A \nTreatise on the Law of Torts \u00a7 50, at 108 (4th ed. 1932).  \nIn policing the line between direct and indirect \nharm, this Court has emphasized that \u201cforeseeability \nalone does not ensure the close connection that \nproximate cause requires.\u201d Bank of America, 581 U.S. \nat 202; Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. \n1, 12 (2010). \u201cIf one takes a broad enough view, all \nconsequences of a negligent act, no matter how far \nremoved in time or space, may be foreseen. \nConditioning liability on foreseeability, therefore, is \nhardly a condition at all.\u201d Consol. Rail Corp. v. \nGottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 552-53 (1994). \n\n \n19 \n \n \nRather, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule is that a direct cause is \nlimited to the \u201cfirst step\u201d in a causal chain. Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 139-40. If multiple steps stand in between \nthe conduct and the harm, then the connection \nbecomes too \u201cremote,\u201d \u201ccontingent,\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d to \nsatisfy basic proximate cause. Hemi, 559 U.S. at 9-10.  \n2. The \u201ccentral question\u201d is thus \u201cwhether the \nalleged violation led directly to the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjuries.\u201d Anza v. Ideal Basic Steel Supply Corp., 547 \nU.S. 451, 461 (2006). Where the causal chain rests on \nindependent acts, the answer is almost always no. See \nAssoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State \nCouncil of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 532 n.25 (1983). \nIntuitively so. Something is \u201cdirect\u201d when it is \nuninterrupted; and it is \u201cindirect\u201d when \u201cother, \nindependent, factors\u201d punctuate the chain. Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 268-69. So when a causal chain involves \n\u201cseparate actions carried out by separate parties,\u201d it \nlacks continuity, and is thus typically deficient. Hemi, \n559 U.S. at 11; see Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 541 n.46. \nTo be sure, proximate cause sometimes allows for \nmulti-link chains where those links are uninterrupted \nby independent action. A good example is the Lanham \nAct, which allows a company to sue another for false \nadvertisements, which cause reduced sales due to \n\u201cconsumers who are deceived by the advertising.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. Proximate cause is still met \nbecause there is no discontinuity in the chain\u2014i.e., \nthere is no independent intervening act separating the \nunlawful act from the victim\u2019s harms, since no \nconsumer freely chooses to be deceived. Cf. id. at 139-\n40; see Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. \n639, 658 (2008) (\u201cno independent factors\u201d in chain).  \n\n \n20 \n \n \nBut absent such direct connections, proximate \ncause does not allow multi-step chains. \u201cA proximate \ncause of an injury is one which, in a natural and \ncontinuous \nsequence, \nwithout \nany \nefficient \nintervening cause, produces the injury.\u201d Dobbs, The \nLaw of Torts \u00a7 201 (2d ed. 2024). The chain must \n\u201cconstitute a continuous succession of events, so \nlinked together as to make a natural whole,\u201d free of \nany \u201cnew and independent cause intervening between \nthe wrong and the injury.\u201d Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 475 (1876). \n3. There is no doubt this traditional rule controls \nunder PLCAA. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133 (the \n\u201c[p]roximate-cause analysis\u201d is shaped by the \u201cnature\u201d \nof the statutory scheme at issue). Congress believed \nthe problem with the suits being filed by U.S. cities \nand others was that they all rested on remote causal \nchains that were too indirect to satisfy proximate \ncause. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7). And it sought to adopt \nthe \n\u201ccommon-sense \ntraditional \nrule \n[] \nthat \nmanufacturers and sellers should not be held liable \nfor the criminal or unlawful misuse of their products.\u201d \nHouse Report, at 6-17; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(b)(1). \nIn PLCAA\u2019s text, Congress thus made proximate \ncause an express requirement. For a manufacturer or \nseller to be sued, it must have committed a \u201cviolation\u201d \nthat is \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the alleged harm. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). When Congress uses a \ncommon-law term in a statute, it \u201cbrings the old soil \nwith it.\u201d Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 733 \n(2013). And with PLCAA, the whole idea was to use \nthis old soil to build up barriers against excessive \nliability. \n\n \n21 \n \n \nAccordingly, Congress made proximate cause a \nthreshold demand of federal law, in order to stop the \n\u201cexpansion of liability\u201d by novel state-law tort suits. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7); see id. \u00a7 7901(b)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5), \n(a)(8). For any claim to advance, Congress made sure \nit would first have to satisfy the traditional standard \nfor proximate cause as codified in federal law. Cf. \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 132 (collecting laws where this \nstandard applies). Entrenching this fixed standard in \nfederal law provides a bulwark against creative \ninnovations by state courts, and ensures that liability \nremains limited to cases of direct causation, as it has \nfor \u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). \nTo the extent there is any doubt about how this \napplies in practice, recall Congress passed PLCAA not \nas a prophylactic measure, but as a response to real \nsuits (quite similar to this one). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(b) \n(requiring existing suits be dismissed). And Congress \nspecifically called out those that \u201cbr[o]ke from bedrock \nprinciples of tort law and expose[d] firearm \nmanufacturers to unprecedented and unlimited \nliability\u201d\u2014suits that pressed near-identical claims as \nthose here (but absent the further step of spanning an \ninternational border). House Report, at 11-12 & n.48. \nOn the flipside, Congress also collected cases where \ncourts properly applied proximate cause. Id. at 6-10 \n(citing City of Philadelphia v. Beretta, 126 F. Supp. 2d \n882 (E.D. Pa. 2000)). In sum, Congress agreed that \n\u201cthe relationship between a tortious act and actual \ninjury historically must be direct, not remote\u201d\u2014and \npassed PLCAA so that this traditional rule would \ngovern as a matter of federal law. House Report, at \n13-14 (relying on Holmes). \n\n \n22 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Injuries Are Indirect. \nMexico\u2019s suit is far more attenuated than the suits \nthat prompted PLCAA in the first place, and does not \ncome close to satisfying traditional proximate cause. \n1. The sheer number of links in Mexico\u2019s causal \nchain is more than enough to defeat proximate cause. \na. Mexico\u2019s causal chain has eight links, punctuated \nby independent acts done by independent actors. To \nrecap: (1) Federally licensed manufacturers sell \nfirearms to federally licensed wholesalers; (2) those \nwholesalers sell to federally licensed dealers; (3) a \nfraction of those dealers engage in unlawful sales; (4) \na fraction of those illegally sold firearms are trafficked \ninto Mexico; (5) a fraction of those trafficked firearms \nend up with the cartels; (6) a fraction of those firearms \nare used by the cartels for crimes; (7) a fraction of \nthose crimes injure people and property in Mexico; \nand (8) Mexico\u2019s government then spends funds to \nrespond to the fallout, causing it fiscal injuries. \nMexico does not deny this causal chain involves the \nfree choices of many third parties: dealers, straw \npurchasers, \ntraffickers, \nsmugglers, \nand \ncartel \nmembers. Mexico also does not allege that any \nPetitioner controls, directs, or coordinates the conduct \nof these third parties. Instead, on Mexico\u2019s own \naccount, all of these choices\u2014the selling, buying, \ntrafficking, \ncrime, \nand \nmore\u2014are \npurely \nthe \nindependent choices of independent actors. \nThis Court has \u201cnever before stretched the causal \nchain\u201d to cover such independent action\u2014and has \nindeed rejected far more modest attempts to do so. See \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11. For instance, in Hemi, New York \nCity tried to bring a RICO suit against an out-of-state \n\n \n23 \n \n \ncigarette seller. Its theory: The seller failed to send \nreports to the state about those it had shipped to (as \nrequired by federal law), which later impaired the \ncity\u2019s ability to collect the taxes it levied on the \npossession of cigarettes, costing it revenue. Id. at 5-6. \nThis Court held that proximate cause was lacking. \nCritically, the \u201cconduct directly causing the harm\u201d\u2014\nthe nonpayment of taxes\u2014\u201cwas distinct from the \n[company\u2019s] conduct\u201d\u2014its failure to transmit certain \nreports. Id. at 11. And in between, \u201cthe City\u2019s theory \nof liability rest[ed] not just on separate actions, but \nseparate actions carried out by separate parties.\u201d Id. \nThat did not work: Since the \u201cCity\u2019s theory of liability \nrest[ed] on the independent actions of third and even \nfourth parties,\u201d it was far too attenuated. Id. at 15; see \nAnza, 547 U.S. at 458-61; Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 542. \nBank of America offers an instructive roadmap too. \nThere, Miami sued two national banks for allegedly \nissuing worse mortgages to certain minority groups, \nwhich prompted greater defaults and foreclosures, \nwhich decreased property values, which all ultimately \nresulted in homeowners paying lower property taxes \nto the city\u2019s government. 581 U.S. at 193-94. \nThe Court reserved the proximate cause question, \nbut Justice Thomas (along with Justices Kennedy and \nAlito) answered it with a resounding no. Miami\u2019s mere \nfour-step chain was \u201cexceedingly attenuated.\u201d 581 \nU.S. at 212 (Thomas, J., concurring and dissenting in \npart). It was riddled by \u201cindependent events,\u201d distinct \nfrom the defendants\u2019 conduct. Id. And those \nindependent acts made Miami\u2019s financial injuries \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d for proximate cause. Id. at 213. \n\n \n24 \n \n \nApplying the same principles, lower courts \nconsistently rejected this type of suit even before \nPLCAA. Cert. Petn. 15-18. Most notably, the Third \nCircuit rejected a suit by Philadelphia alleging that \nthe same longstanding practices by the firearms \nindustry \u201ccreate[ed] and contribut[ed] to [the] \ncriminal use\u201d of firearms in that city. City of \nPhiladelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n419 (3d Cir. 2002). The court dismissed, holding the \ncausal chain \u201cfrom the manufacturer to Philadelphia \nstreets\u201d was too \u201clong and tortuous.\u201d Id. at 423. \nThis is a simple case under these precedents. \nMexico\u2019s eight-step causal chain is more attenuated \nthan anything this Court has seen. See Hemi, 559 U.S. \nat 11. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, spanning an international border to boot. And \nevery injury alleged here is the result of one of those \ndistinct actions against a foreign sovereign in a \nforeign land. Each such act alone is enough to sever \nthe causal chain; together, they shatter it. \nb. All the more so, because many of those acts are \ncrimes. Again, the purpose of proximate cause is to \nassign \u201cresponsibility\u201d among possible liable actors. \nDobbs, supra, at \u00a7 198. And when an injury is the \nresult of an independent criminal act, the law assigns \nresponsibility to the criminal\u2014not an upstream party \nwith no control over him. Id. \u00a7 209; see Restatement \n(Second) Torts \u00a7 302B cmts. d-e. Thus, when a causal \nchain relies on an independent criminal act\u2014let alone \nmultiple ones\u2014it virtually never satisfies proximate \ncause. See Hemi, 559 U.S. at 11 (emphasizing how \nintervening cause involved a breach of \u201clegal[] \nobligat[ion]\u201d); see also, e.g., Kemper v. Deutsche Bank \nAG, 911 F.3d 383, 393 (7th Cir. 2018). \n\n \n25 \n \n \nTo be sure, this common law rule has some narrow \nexceptions. When there is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d\u2014\ne.g., bailor-bailee, caregiver-child, landlord-tenant\u2014\nthen a party may be liable for harms caused by a third \nparty. See Dobbs, supra, at \u00a7 209. The rationale is that \nwhen a party owes a legal \u201cduty\u201d to another to protect \nit against certain harms (which may include criminal \nacts), proximate cause should not stand in the way of \nliability\u2014and must excuse an otherwise intervening \nact. Id.; see, e.g., Moon v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Benson, \n135 A. 114, 115 (Pa. 1926) (bailor who placed property \nin insufficiently secure place liable after thief stole it). \nBut there is zero \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between \nfirearms companies and sovereigns\u2014let alone foreign \nsovereigns\u2014that obligates the companies to protect \nthem from third-party crimes. District of Columbia v. \nBeretta, U.S.A., Corp., 872 A.2d 633, 640-41 (D.C. \n2005). \u201c[G]un manufacturers are under no legal duty \nto protect citizens from the deliberate and unlawful \nuse of their products.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 425; \nsee House Report, at 7-9. Rightly so: As in any \nindustry, there is no duty for a manufacturer or seller \nof a lawful product to protect others from its criminal \nmisuse. E.g., Stahlecker v. Ford Motor Co., 667 \nN.W.2d 244, 254-57 (Neb. 2003). \nPut together, then, the general rule is clear: The \nmanufacturer or seller of a lawful product is not a \nproximate cause of its independent criminal misuse. \nCity of Chicago v. Beretta, U.S.A., Corp., 821 N.E.2d \n1099, 1136-37 (Ill. 2004); see District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 650-51. Absent some special relationship or \nlegal duty, an independent criminal act breaks the \ncausal chain. The responsible party is the criminal \nwho inflicts the harm\u2014not anyone else. \n\n \n26 \n \n \nThese principles doom Mexico\u2019s theory of causation. \nMexico depends on a legion of third-party criminals: \nBad-actor dealers; illicit buyers; gun traffickers; \nsmugglers; cartel members; etc. Mexico cannot even \nallege the actual number of such actors involved. And \nonce more, Mexico does not allege any Petitioner has \nany control, direction, or relation to these unknown \nand unknowable third parties. Instead, Mexico relies \non crime after crime\u2014by independent criminal after \nindependent criminal\u2014to try to connect Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct to Mexico\u2019s harms. That does not work.  \n2. This Court has also looked to other factors to see \nif a causal chain is too indirect. All cut the same way. \na. One sign that a causal chain is too attenuated is \nthat ascertaining damages and liability would be \nunworkable. Anza, 547 U.S. at 458-60. After all, \u201cthe \nless direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to \nascertain the amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages \nattributable to the violation, as distinct from other, \nindependent, factors.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269. When \na downstream injury is the product of multiple \nintertwined factors, that is a telltale sign of \nindirectness. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135, 140. \nThat is this case in spades. Mexico marshals a \nparade of bad actors\u2014dealers, smugglers, cartels\u2014\nwho drive the bedlam south of the border. But there is \nno way to apportion fault among them, or to isolate \nthe causal role Petitioners play. Mexico admits the \nvast majority of firearm sales in the United States are \nlawful; that most firearms recovered in Mexico were \nnot made or sold by Petitioners; and that Mexico is \nswamped by other firearms from other companies. \nPet.App.44a, 158a-59a (\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n27 \n \n \nThe problem is compounded by the nature of \nMexico\u2019s alleged injuries. Mexico\u2019s principal injuries \nare higher governmental expenditures\u2014on security, \nhealthcare, social services, and the like. BIO 6, 20-21. \nTo determine damages, a court would need to go line-\nby-line through Mexico\u2019s federal budget and assess for \nitself which spending increases are attributable to \nPetitioners, versus the countless other causes that can \ndrive governmental spending in Mexico. That is not \nthe stuff of judicial competency. But it is a flashing \nindicator of a woefully indirect theory of liability. \nb. Another consideration is whether the alleged \ninjuries are direct or derivative. If derivative, there \nare typically \u201cbetter situated plaintiffs\u201d (direct \nvictims) who can bring more appropriate litigation to \naddress any allegedly wrongful action by a defendant. \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11-12; Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269-70. \nAnd that is clearly the case here: Victims in Mexico \ncan sue the criminals in Mexico who have actually \ninjured them. That is what U.S. courts have said when \nU.S. cities filed analogous suits. Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425. And it is the basic policy judgment \nCongress made in PLCAA. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  \nBy contrast, most if not all of Mexico\u2019s alleged \nharms derive from violence visited on its citizens. But \nthis Court has repeatedly held an \u201calleged harm\u201d is \n\u201cordinarily\u201d too attenuated \u201cif the harm is purely \nderivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person \nby the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. \nThat makes good sense: By definition, a derivative \nharm is (at least) one step removed, making it \nindirect. \n\n \n28 \n \n \nTo that end, the reason a derivative harm flunks \nproximate cause is not because it is unforeseeable. \nDerivative injuries are often predictable. For example, \nit is easy to foresee that shuttering a business through \nillegal action (e.g., extortion) will harm its landlord, \nwho will lose the business\u2019s rent. But it is nevertheless \nblack-letter law that the landlord\u2019s injuries are too far \nremoved to count\u2014lest our tort system become one of \nunlimited liability. See Apple v. Pepper, 587 U.S. 273, \n291 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \nOn Mexico\u2019s view, however, it is hard to see who \ncannot recover. There are plenty of people who suffer \nfollow-on harms from the cartels, including in ways \nmore direct than Mexico\u2014companies lose employees, \nbusinesses lose customers, and yes, landlords lose \nrent. But there is no sound argument that any of those \nparties can come close to satisfying proximate cause. \nSee Bank of America, 581 U.S. at 212-13 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part). And there is no \nreason why the Mexican government is any different. \nC. Mexico\u2019s Contrary Arguments Fail. \nIn opposing certiorari, Mexico barely defended the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s proximate-cause analysis, which \nimproperly \nconflated \nproximate \ncause \nand \nforeseeability. See Pet.App.309a-19a. Instead, Mexico \nraised three main arguments to try to salvage its \ncomplaint \nfrom \nits \nobvious \nproximate-cause \ninfirmities. None persuade. \nFirst, Mexico argues that the relevant criminal \n\u201cviolation\u201d that starts the causal chain is not \nPetitioners\u2019 own conduct, but the \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d involving their products. BIO 15, 22. That is \nwrong. By its terms, PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception \n\n \n29 \n \n \nallows claims \u201cin which a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product knowingly violated a State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of \nthe product, and the violation was a proximate cause \nof the harm for which relief is sought.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). This makes clear \nthat \u201cthe\u201d relevant \u201cviolation\u201d is the one committed by \nthe \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d being sued\u2014and that \nviolation must be the proximate cause of the injury.  \nHere, Mexico claims that Petitioners violated the \naiding-and-abetting statute. For purposes of the \npredicate exception, the analysis thus turns on \nwhether Petitioners\u2019 alleged violative conduct\u2014i.e., \ntheir routine production and sale of firearms in this \ncountry (which are later resold by bad-actor dealers \nand others)\u2014is a proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s alleged \ninjuries. And as detailed above, the answer is no. \nIn any event, even if the causal chain starts with \nunlawful sales by dealers, those violations still are not \na proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s diffuse harms. Indeed, \nnumerous independent crimes continue to stand \nbetween any unlawful sales in America and Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries abroad: A fraction of those sales must \nfirst be illegally smuggled into Mexico (versus used for \nany other purpose in America); then a fraction of those \nillegally smuggled firearms must be illegally given to \ncartels (versus other users); then a fraction of those \nfirearms must be used to commit violent crimes \n(versus other ends); and then Mexico must choose how \nto spend funds in response, incurring fiscal harms. \nIn short, even on its preferred framing, Mexico\u2019s \ncausal chain still stretches across an international \nborder and is punctuated by multiple independent \n\n \n30 \n \n \ncriminal acts carried out by a series of independent \ncriminals, leading to follow-on injuries suffered by a \nforeign sovereign. No case has ever found proximate \ncause on such a remote chain of events. \nSecond, Mexico insists its multi-link chain should \nbe excused because Petitioners\u2019 conduct is \u201cintegral\u201d \nto the cartels\u2019 activity. BIO 22-23. But that conflates \nde facto causation (the fact that Petitioners are \nindirect suppliers) with proximate causation (whether \nthey are directly responsible for Mexico\u2019s derivative \ninjuries due to cartel violence). As discussed, this \nCourt has allowed multi-link chains only where there \nis no \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d rendering them \u201cindirect.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 140. So in Lexmark, this Court \nallowed a direct competitor of the defendant to sue for \nfalse advertisements that caused it to \u201cautomatically\u201d \nsuffer a loss in sales. Id.; see also Bridge 553 U.S. at \n647-48 (allowing a similar \u201cstraightforward\u201d theory). \nBut as this Court has explained, the defining trait \nin those \u201crelatively unique circumstances,\u201d Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 140, was the absence of any \u201cindependent \nactions\u201d that would break the causal chain, Hemi, 559 \nU.S. at 15. Here, by contrast, Mexico\u2019s theory is \nsaturated with such independent links. \nThird, Mexico says that PLCAA demands a looser \nversion of proximate cause, because Congress wanted \nsome plaintiffs to be able \u201cto recover for harms caused \nin part by third-party conduct.\u201d BIO 23. But as \nexplained, watering down proximate cause was quite \nliterally the opposite of what Congress sought to do \nwith PLCAA. And in portraying Petitioners\u2019 position \nas foreclosing all potential liability, Mexico shoots at \na strawman. Nobody is saying PLCAA cuts off liability \n\n \n31 \n \n \nfor a company engaged in coordinated criminal \nactivity: If a convicted felon comes into a firearm store \nasking for the best firearm to rob a bank, and the \nseller recommends and furnishes one to assist in the \nrobbery, \nthen \nthat \nthird-party \ncrime \nis \nnot \nindependent from the seller. The seller is criminally \nliable for participating in the crime and is on the hook \nfor \nthe \ndirect \nconsequences. \nSee \n15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). By contrast, \nMexico\u2019s \nalleged \ncausal \nchain \nhere \ninvolves \nindependent criminal activity in which Petitioners \nplayed no role. And that sort of conduct is what defeats \nproximate cause. Indeed, the purpose of PLCAA\u2014and \nthe reason it expressly added a proximate-cause \nrequirement\u2014was to ensure the industry would not \nbe held liable for the independent crimes of third \nparties. But that is exactly what Mexico is trying to \naccomplish here. \nII. PETITIONERS ARE NOT GUILTY OF AIDING AND \nABETTING ANY FIREARMS CRIME. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nalso must show that the defendant committed a \n\u201cviolation\u201d of a firearm-specific statute. 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nFor \nthis, \nMexico \nclaims \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices violate the \nfederal criminal ban on aiding and abetting illicit \nfirearm sales by downstream dealers. BIO 27. \nImportantly, Mexico does not argue that any \nPetitioner has itself broken any American law, rule, \nor regulation specifically governing the manufacture \nor sale of firearms. Nor does Mexico allege that any \nPetitioner is even \u201caware\u201d of any \u201cparticular unlawful \nsale.\u201d Pet.App.305a. Rather, Mexico maintains that \n\n \n32 \n \n \nPetitioners are accomplices to downstream dealers \nwho choose to sell their firearms illegally, because \nPetitioners are generally aware that some dealers will \nengage in such sales, and Petitioners have failed to go \nbeyond what the American firearms laws require in \norder to counteract those third-party criminal acts. \nThat is not aiding and abetting. A business that \ndoes nothing more than make or sell a product in the \nordinary course is not an accomplice to downstream \nactors who later sell or misuse that product illegally. \nAnd the supplier of a lawful product does not become \na criminal simply because it refuses to take additional \naffirmative steps to stop third parties from using the \nproduct to commit a crime. This Court reaffirmed that \nlongstanding rule in Twitter, and it settles this case. \nA. Aiding and Abetting Requires Culpable \nMisconduct, Not Business As Usual. \nAiding \nand \nabetting \nrequires \nculpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., something done for the purpose of \nassisting a criminal offense. But where a business \ndoes nothing more than engage in routine business \npractices\u2014like broadly putting a good to market, or \noffering a general service\u2014it does not become an \naccomplice to independent downstream criminals who \nlater misuse that product, even if the business is \naware such criminal misuse is possible. Something \nmore is needed, lest every industry become liable as \nan accomplice to the misdeeds of its customers\u2014\npunishable by felony. \n1. Aiding and abetting \u201creflects a centuries-old view \nof culpability: that a person may be responsible for a \ncrime he has not personally carried out if he helps \nanother to complete its commission.\u201d Rosemond v. \n\n \n33 \n \n \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 65, 70 (2014). Federal law \nincorporates that view, making accomplices and \nprincipals equally \u201cpunishable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). \nAiding and abetting has both an objective and a \nsubjective component. An accomplice must take some \n\u201caffirmative act\u201d to assist a criminal offense, and also \ndo so with the \u201cintent of facilitating the offense\u2019s \ncommission.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. Together, \naiding-and-abetting law requires \u201cthat a defendant \u2018in \nsome sort associate himself with the venture, that he \nparticipate in it as in something that he wishes to \nbring about, that he seek by his action to make it \nsucceed.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d \n401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938) (Hand, J.)). \nBut the doctrine has strict limits. As for the \nobjective component, \u201cthe concept of \u2018helping\u2019 in the \ncommission of a crime . . . has never been boundless.\u201d \nId. at 488. The law has long distinguished between \nthose who \u201cincidentally facilitate a criminal venture\u201d \nand those who \u201cactively participate in it.\u201d Rosemond, \n572 U.S. at 77 n.8. Thus, \u201cgenerally\u201d\u2014absent some \nlegal duty displacing the ordinary rule\u2014the law \u201cdoes \nnot impose liability for mere omissions, inactions, or \nnonfeasance.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Rather, the \n\u201cconceptual core\u201d of aiding-and-abetting liability is \n\u201cconscious[] and culpable participa[tion].\u201d Id. at 493. \nAs for its subjective component, aiding and abetting \nhas also differentiated awareness from intent. The \n\u201cmere knowledge\u201d that one\u2019s actions may assist a \ncriminal scheme is insufficient. Direct Sales Co. v. \nUnited States, 319 U.S. 703, 711 (1943). A criminal \naccomplice must act with the intent of assisting a \ncriminal offense. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. \n\n \n34 \n \n \n2. The type of support required also turns on the \ntheory of liability. \u201c[A]iding and abetting is inherently \na rule of secondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). Thus, the \nheartland case involves intentional aid to a specific \ncrime\u2014a particular, identified wrong. Id. \nIn rare circumstances, a \u201csecondary defendant\u2019s \nrole in an illicit enterprise can be so systemic that the \nsecondary defendant is aiding and abetting every \nwrongful act committed by that enterprise.\u201d Id. at 496; \nsee Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 488 (D.C. Cir. \n1983). But because this theory of liability effectively \n\u201cblur[s]\u201d the line between \u201cconspiracy liability\u201d and \n\u201caiding-and-abetting liability,\u201d it requires a markedly \ngreater showing. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496. To be on the \nhook for everything an illicit enterprise does, a \ndefendant must provide such \u201cpervasive, systemic, \nand culpable assistance,\u201d to infer a \u201cnear-common \nenterprise\u201d with the primary criminal(s). Id. at 502. \n3. The limits on aiding and abetting are especially \nimportant when it comes to manufacturers and \nsuppliers of lawful goods. After all, almost every \nbusiness knows its products may be misused\u2014\nincluding by criminals: Beer companies know drinks \nwill be sold to minors; car companies know their \nvehicles will be driven recklessly; and pharmaceutical \ncompanies know their medicines will be abused. \nBut \u201caiding-and-abetting liability\u201d has never been \nextended so \u201cfar\u201d as to make \u201cordinary merchants . . . \nliable for [the] misuse of their goods and services.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Courts have regularly held \nthat making or selling a lawful product\u2014even when \naware it may be criminally misused\u2014is not sufficient. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nId. at 488, 501 & n.14. As the United States recently \nput it: Liability does not naturally attach where \u201ca \ndefendant provided only routine business services in \nan ordinary manner, was remote from the unlawful \nact that injured the plaintiff, or is accused of aiding \nand abetting another\u2019s conduct through inaction.\u201d \nAmicus Curiae Brief for the United States, 11-12, \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (No. 21-1496). \nTo prevent a pall of prosecution being draped over \nthe economy, courts have long drawn an objective line, \ndifferentiating lawful businesses that engage in \n\u201croutine\u201d conduct from those that engage in \u201catypical\u201d \nconduct to help a crime succeed. Camp v. Dema, 948 \nF.2d 455, 459 (8th Cir. 1991) (cited by Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 490-92). Only the latter is the sort of culpable \nmisconduct that establishes accomplice liability. If a \nmerchant is engaged \u201cin the ordinary course of his \nbusiness,\u201d it is not enough that he has a \u201cgeneral \nawareness\u201d that his products may facilitate crimes \ndownstream. Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, 522 \nF.2d 84, 95 (5th Cir. 1975) (cited by Twitter, 598 U.S. \nat 491). Maintaining \u201croutine\u201d business practices is \nthe sort of \u201cpassive\u201d inaction that is treated as \ninnocent rather than innately \u201cculpable\u201d; a business \nmust break from the norm to become guilty as an \naccomplice. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 491.1 \n \n1 See, e.g., Amazon Servs. LLC v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., 109 \nF.4th 573, 581-83 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (providing \u201cgenerally \navailable\u201d service in \u201croutine\u201d manner insufficient for liability); \nUnited States v. Blankenship, 970 F.2d 283, 286-89 (7th Cir. \n1992) (Easterbrook, J.) (noting where \u201c\u2018mere\u2019 sale[s]\u201d end and \nliability \u201cbegin[s]\u201d); SEC v. Wash. Cnty. Util. Dist., 676 F.2d 218, \n226 (6th Cir. 1982) (contrasting \u201ca transaction in the ordinary \ncourse of his business\u201d and one \u201cof an extraordinary nature\u201d). \n\n \n36 \n \n \nAccordingly, when a business puts a lawful good to \nmarket, it does not become an accomplice to that \nproduct\u2019s downstream criminal misuse simply by \ndeclining to take additional affirmative steps to \ncounteract that independent unlawful action. That is, \nto incur liability, it is not enough that a company \nchooses to stay the course and continue routine \npractices; it must engage in some objectively unusual \naction, directed to actually making the crime succeed. \nThat is already a high bar. But the bar gets even \nhigher if the theory of liability is pegged not to aiding \na specific unlawful act (e.g., an illicit sale), but instead \nan unlawful enterprise (e.g., an illicit seller). For this \ntype of enterprise theory, a merchant must go even \nfurther, taking atypical steps in such a systemic and \npervasive fashion that it is jointly liable for all of that \nenterprise\u2019s misdoings. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496, 502; \nsee Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487-88. And for that sort \nof categorical liability to attach, the routine practices \nof a lawful industry\u2014untailored to any buyer, \nunparticularized to any transaction\u2014are never \nenough. Such overwhelming assistance must be \ntargeted and deliberate; supplying a lawful product in \na general and ordinary manner is not that. Mexico has \nnever cited any case holding otherwise. Nor could it. \n4. This Court\u2019s decision in Direct Sales Company \nillustrates these principles. That case involved a \ndistributor that directly sold an obscenely large \namount of morphine to a single rural doctor, who was \nobviously engaged in a criminal enterprise by re-\nselling the drugs illegally. 319 U.S. at 705. The \ndistributor was charged with conspiring to violate the \nfederal narcotics laws, and this Court affirmed the \nconviction. Id. at 714-15. \n\n \n37 \n \n \nIn so doing, this Court took pains to distinguish \nroutine versus atypical business activity. It stressed \nthat for liability to attach, it is not enough for a \nbusiness to be aware that its product will be misused: \nThere must be \u201cmore than knowledge, acquiescence, \ncarelessness, indifference, lack of concern.\u201d Id. at 713. \nWhen there is \u201cnothing more on the seller\u2019s part than \nindifference to the buyer\u2019s illegal purpose and passive \nacquiescence in his desire to purchase,\u201d that cannot be \nfodder for a felony. Id. at 712 n.8. \nThe reason the Direct Sales Company could be \ncriminally liable was it strayed far beyond business as \nusual. The distributor sold the doctor such massive \nand atypical amounts of morphine\u2014around 36,000 \npills a year, when the average was about 400\u2014that \nthere was no conceivable lawful explanation for what \nwas going on. See id. at 705-06. The distributor, \nmoreover, also took other affirmative steps to bolster \nhis complicity, like coordinating with the doctor as to \nhow to avoid law enforcement, such as by changing \ntablet sizes. Id. at 707. All told, this sort of obvious, \nprolonged, and direct \u201ccooperation\u201d with a specific \ndrug dealer was more than enough to sustain a \nconviction. Id. at 713. And as this Court has since \nexplained, Direct Sales stands for the proposition that \naccomplice liability attaches when a \u201cprovider of \nroutine services does so in an unusual way.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 502. \nRightly so. Again, the touchstone for aiding and \nabetting is to culpably \u201cparticipate\u201d in a wrongful act \nso as to help \u201cmake it succeed.\u201d Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 336 U.S. 613, 619 (1949). In determining \nwhether an ordinary merchant has crossed that line, \nit makes sense to insist on unusual and particularized \n\n \n38 \n \n \nbehavior to distinguish incidental facilitation from \naffirmative \nsupport. \nAbsent \nthis \nobjective \nrequirement, all-too-easy allegations of scienter would \nimperil every business that sells a lawful product that \nis predictably abused by criminals. By contrast, where \nthe merchant is not engaged in business as usual, that \nidentifiable break from the norm can furnish the \nmisconduct needed for liability. Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 487-88 (attributing liability to defendant providing \nservices \u201cin an unusual way under unusual \ncircumstances for a long period of time\u201d). \n5. PLCAA incorporates these basic limits on aiding \nand abetting. After all, when the Act was passed, it \nwas \ncommon \nknowledge \nthat \ncriminals \ncould \npurchase firearms from some bad-actor dealers\u2014\nindeed, that was the very premise of the lawsuits \nPLCAA was passed to stop. \nIt was Congress\u2019s judgment, however, that so long \nas manufacturers and sellers followed the many \nfederal, state, and local regulations that directly apply \nto making and selling firearms, they \u201cshould not[] be \n[held] liable for the harm caused by those who \ncriminally or unlawfully misuse [their] products.\u201d 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). There was not a whisper in \nCongress that the same type of plaintiffs could bring \nthe same type of suits, just by restyling the same type \nof tort allegations in aiding-and-abetting garb. See \nsupra pp. 6-7. \nThe opposite. Congress condemned the \u201cslippery \nslope\u201d these novel suits promised\u2014i.e., the legal, \nsocial, and economic chaos that would follow from \nimposing \n\u201cliability\u201d \non \nevery \n\u201ccompany \n[that] \nmanufactures a legitimate product that is widely and \n\n \n39 \n \n \nlawfully distributed,\u201d who knows that its product may \nbe \u201ccriminally or unlawfully misused\u201d downstream. \nHouse Report, at 23. Countless industries \u201care aware \nthat a small percentage of their products will be \nmisused by criminals.\u201d Id. at 24. But that has never \nbeen enough for liability of any stripe\u2014let alone \ncriminal liability. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7), (a)(8). \nThese points bear out in PLCAA\u2019s text and \nstructure. \nFor \ninstance, \nwithin \nthe \npredicate \nexception, the Act provides an example of how a \nsupplier might be liable for aiding and abetting, but \nonly in the context of a particular transaction where \nthe supplier knows that \u201cthe actual buyer\u201d of \u201cthe\u201d \nfirearm \nis \nbarred \nfrom \nhaving \nit. \nId. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(II). Likewise, PLCAA includes a \nseparate exception allowing transferors to be sued if \nthey are convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(h), \nwhich prohibits giving someone a firearm \u201cknowing or \nhaving reasonable cause to believe that [it] will be \nused to commit a felony.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i). \nThis all reflects the narrow range of suits that \nCongress contemplated: Instances where a firearm \nsupplier knowingly makes an illegal sale to a specific \ncriminal\u2014i.e., where a business engages in atypical \nconduct to assist a particular criminal offense. By \ncontrast, nothing in PLCAA reflects the sort of \nsystemic liability contemplated here, where the \nroutine business practices of manufacturers and \ndistributors would make them responsible for an \nentire class of criminal action. Indeed, if simply \nshowing that a firearms company was aware that a \nsmall fraction of its products would fall into the hands \nof criminals was enough, then the particularized \nprovisions above would be meaningless. \n\n \n40 \n \n \nB. Mexico \nTargets \nOrdinary \nBusiness \nPractices, Not Culpable Misconduct. \nOver the course of this litigation, Mexico has offered \nshifting theories of aiding and abetting. Its complaint \nalleged that Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming\u201d of Mexicans by the \u201cdrug cartels.\u201d \nPet.App.12a (\u00b6 15). But in this Court, Mexico has \npressed only the alternative theory embraced by the \nFirst Circuit: Petitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices \nare illegal because they aid and abet unlawful firearm \nsales by downstream independent dealers. BIO 27.  \n1. At the outset, it is important to identify the type \nof liability theory on which Mexico relies. As the First \nCircuit recognized, \u201cthe complaint does not allege \ndefendants\u2019 awareness of any particular unlawful \nsale,\u201d much less that Petitioners did anything to help \nany specific illicit transaction succeed. Pet.App.305a. \nMexico\u2019s case thus falls far outside the heartland of \naiding and abetting, which again is \u201ca rule of \nsecondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s claim is that Petitioners provide \nsuch pervasive support to bad-actor dealers that \nPetitioners are responsible for all of their unlawful \nsales of Petitioners\u2019 products. This is the theory the \nFirst Circuit relied on: Petitioners \u201coperate at a \nsystemic level, allegedly designing, marketing, and \ndistributing their guns so that demand by the cartels \ncontinues to boost sales,\u201d making them accomplices \neven though they do \u201cnot know about any particular \nunlawful sale.\u201d Pet.App.306a. Mexico has now \nadopted this theory. BIO 17, 20, 22-25, 27-28. \n\n \n41 \n \n \n2. To establish such categorical liability, Mexico \nmust allege that Petitioners have provided \u201cpervasive, \nsystemic, and culpable\u201d assistance to the bad-actor \ndealers in the supply chain, for the specific purpose of \naiding their illicit sales. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 502. \nCritically, however, Mexico tries to get over this \nhigh bar with nothing but the routine \u201cbusiness \npractices\u201d Petitioners have followed \u201c[f]or decades.\u201d \nPet.App.139a (\u00b6 376). Mexico concedes that these \npractices \noverwhelmingly \ncater \nto \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). It nevertheless faults \nPetitioners for staying the course because, in its view, \nthey should have taken extralegal steps to better \ncurtail the small fraction of U.S. firearms that end up \nin Mexico. E.g., id. 12a (\u00b6 16), 24a (\u00b6 50). \nIn particular, Mexico\u2019s complaint focuses on three \nbroad \ncategories\u2014design, \nmarketing, \nand \ndistribution. It blames Petitioners for either not \naffirmatively adopting new policies to counteract \nillicit sales, or for not abandoning longstanding \npractices \nthat\u2014while \ndesigned \nfor \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans\u2014criminals have been able to exploit. See \nid. 84a (\u00b6 246: \u201cDefendants do not need legislation in \norder to make these reforms\u201d). \nDesign. Mexico asserts Petitioners \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales by continuing to \n\u201cdesign\u201d what Mexico calls \u201cmilitary-style assault \nweapons.\u201d Id. 93a. For instance, Mexico takes issue \nwith Petitioners making and selling lawful firearms \nlike the AR-15 rifle, and firearms capable of accepting \n\u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of which Mexico \nsays are popular among criminals. Id. 121a (\u00b6 334); \n96a (\u00b6 288). And Mexico criticizes the industry for not \n\n \n42 \n \n \nadding certain \u201csafety features\u201d it says will dampen \ncriminal interest. E.g., 129a (\u00b6 359) (calling for \u201csmart \nguns\u201d), 131a (\u00b6 365) (same for harder-to-defile serial \nnumbers). \nOf note, Mexico never alleges that any Petitioner \naffirmatively designed these products to aid any \ncriminal activity. Nor would any such claim be \nplausible. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the \ncountry; and there are hundreds of millions of \u201clarge-\ncapacity\u201d magazines in America. Moreover, Mexico \nconcedes that all of these arms are perfectly legal \nunder America\u2019s extensive firearm regulations. \nMexico\u2019s charge is that in continuing to produce \nthese firearms\u2014despite knowing criminals desire to \nuse them\u2014the industry has chosen to \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales. Id. 93a. To avoid \nliability, Mexico says the industry \u201ccould limit their \nsales of these military-style assault weapons to \nmilitary and perhaps some law enforcement units.\u201d \nId. 104a (\u00b6 314). Or it \u201ccould restrict the sale of these \nweapons to purchasers with a legitimate need for \nthem.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 315). Or it \u201ccould make guns [that do] not \naccept [any] high-capacity magazines.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 317). \nBoiled down, Mexico faults Petitioners for \u201cnot\u201d \naltering their longstanding design practices to better \nsuppress the criminal demand for their firearms. Id. \n(\u00b6\u00b6 314-18). \nMarketing. \nMexico \nsays \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 \nlongstanding marketing practices help boost unlawful \nfirearm sales. It does not allege any Petitioner \nengages in any campaigns tailored to any criminal \nconduct\u2014e.g., touting a new inconspicuous handgun, \nperfect for subway muggings. Instead, Mexico alleges \n\n \n43 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 marketing tactics showcase the \u201cfeatures, \nfunctions, and applications\u201d of their firearms in ways \nthat have appealed to criminals\u2014such as by using \nimages of the \u201cmilitary,\u201d \u201claw enforcement,\u201d as well as \n\u201cAmerican flags.\u201d E.g., id. 105a, 127a (\u00b6\u00b6 322, 352). \nMexico implies Petitioners should have stopped \nadvertising their firearms this way once it became \nclear that criminals were attracted to their potential \nmilitary-like uses. In this sense, though, Mexico\u2019s \nmarketing-related claims are just derivative of its \ndesign-related ones. As Chief Judge Saylor explained, \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms \u201cdo exactly what they are \nadvertised to do\u201d: The advertisements Mexico \nidentifies show how these products work in the real \nworld\u2014including how some are used by police. Id. \n255a-59a. Mexico faults Petitioners for showing these \ntrue facts, but that gripe flows entirely from Mexico\u2019s \nview that firearms with these traits should not be sold \nat all (or at least, not to regular Americans). \nDistribution. Finally, Mexico takes issue with the \n\u201cthree-tier distribution\u201d system sanctioned by the \nfederal government. Id. 140a (\u00b6 378). Within this \nsystem, \nfederally \nlicensed \nmanufacturers \nsell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \nwholesalers, who then sell to independent federally \nlicensed dealers\u2014who then sell to the general public. \nHere too, Mexico does not suggest Petitioners set up \nthis system in order to promote unlawful sales. As \nMexico admits, the overwhelming majority of U.S. \nfirearm sales are by law-abiding dealers to law-\nabiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). And nobody even \nhints the industry developed its entire distribution \n\n \n44 \n \n \nframework to cater to an outlier, minute fraction of \nunlawful sales\u2014as opposed to its primary business. \nRather, Mexico\u2019s allegations concern a supposed \nfailure by Petitioners to augment this system with \n\u201cappropriate and prudent distribution practices\u201d that \nMexico thinks will help reduce unlawful firearm sales \ndownstream. Id. 139a-40a (\u00b6 377). Among other \nthings, Mexico insists that manufacturers and \ndistributors should impose \u201cmandatory background \nchecks for secondary gun sales,\u201d require downstream \ndealers to \u201climit[] sales of multiple guns,\u201d \u201csupervise\u201d \nprivate \u201ckitchen-table\u201d sales, set up a system for \nmitigating lost or stolen firearms, and \u201crestrict[]\u201d \nsales of \u201cassault weapons.\u201d See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 89a-\n90a, 132a (\u00b6\u00b6 245, 264, 269, 369). \nMexico accepts that none of this is required by any \nAmerican firearms law. Instead, it faults Petitioners \nfor having \u201cchos[en] not\u201d to go beyond what those laws \nsay, to \u201ccontrol[]\u201d downstream dealers. Id. 139a-41a, \n104a (\u00b6\u00b6 377-79, 382, 315). \n3. These allegations fall far short of aiding and \nabetting. Mexico\u2019s claim reduces to Petitioners \nengaging in routine business practices while passively \ndeclining to do more to stop independent retailers \nfrom breaking the law. But such inaction does not \nsuffice. As this Court has emphasized, there is a core \ndifference between \u201cfailing to stop\u201d downstream \ncrime, and affirmatively abetting it through active \nparticipation. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 503. And that \nfundamental distinction resolves this issue: A lawful \nsupplier is not an accomplice to every independent \nseller of its good that it fails to make follow the law. \n\n \n45 \n \n \na. Mexico\u2019s complaint is foreclosed by Twitter. \nMexico claims that a \u201cmanufacturer of a dangerous \nproduct is an accessory or co-conspirator to illicit \nconduct by downstream actors where it continues to \nsupply, support, or assist the downstream parties and \nhas knowledge\u2014actual or constructive\u2014of the illicit \nconduct.\u201d Pet.App.42a (\u00b6 110). \nBut that is exactly what Twitter rejected. The \nplaintiffs alleged that the platforms knowingly hosted \nterrorist content for years; that they knew groups like \nISIS depended upon their services for fundraising and \nrecruiting; that they knew how their recommendation \nalgorithms matched terrorist content with interested \npeople; and that the platforms \u201cfailed to implement\u201d \nbasic detection tools that would help weed out this \nproblematic content. See 598 U.S. at 480-82, 498. And \nthe plaintiffs alleged that the platforms refused to \ndepart from their routine practices, because they \n\u201cprofited\u201d from these terrorist accounts. Id. at 482. \nThis Court unanimously held those claims fell short \nof aiding and abetting. Many businesses know their \nproducts will be criminally misused downstream, just \nas the platforms in Twitter knew terrorists were \nmisusing their services. But continuing to sell a good \nor service is mere \u201cpassive assistance,\u201d not \u201cactive \nabetting.\u201d Id. at 499. Staying the course with routine \nbusiness practices is not \u201caffirmative misconduct.\u201d Id. \nat 500. It is instead the sort of \u201cfailure to act\u201d that does \nnot trigger liability. Id. at 500-01. Indeed, any other \nrule would constitute a remarkable expansion of the \ncriminal law\u2014and would task private companies with \na roving mandate to \u201cdiscover[]\u201d and \u201cterminate\u201d any \ncustomers \u201cusing [their] service[s] for illicit ends,\u201d or \nelse risk crippling liability. Id. at 501. \n\n \n46 \n \n \nAs the above makes clear, Mexico does not allege a \nsingle \u201caffirmative act\u201d by Petitioners, performed with \nthe \u201cintent of facilitating\u201d illicit firearms sales by \ndealers. Id. at 490. Instead, Mexico\u2019s complaint rests \nentirely on the American firearms industry refusing \nto depart from routine, existing, and settled business \npractices\u2014be it refusing to scrap certain products \n(like the AR-15), or declining to impose extralegal \ncriteria on downstream retailers (such as limiting \nsales by \u201clegitimate need\u201d). But as explained, when a \nbusiness refuses to depart from the ordinary course\u2014\nwhen \nit \ndeclines \nto \nchange \nits longstanding \npractices\u2014that is precisely the sort of \u201comission[], \ninaction[], or nonfeasance\u201d that has never been \nenough for accomplice liability. Id. at 489. \nAt worst, even in the darkest light, Petitioners are \nportrayed as apathetic to how their products will later \nbe used just so long as they keep selling. This is false, \nbut even if it were true, such behavior\u2014\u201carm\u2019s length, \npassive, and largely indifferent\u201d to whatever the \nactual goals of the buyer may be\u2014is definitionally \ninsufficient for aiding and abetting. Id. at 500-01. \nb. If anything, Mexico\u2019s theory here is even more \nclearly invalid than in Twitter. There, the plaintiffs at \nleast named a specific criminal enterprise (ISIS) and \na specific bad act the defendants supposedly abetted \n(the Reina nightclub attack). Id. at 497-98. But here, \nMexico does not even do that: Its theory is that \nPetitioners have aided and abetted \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d in this country, writ large. BIO 27. Such a \nsweeping claim is unprecedented. No court has ever \nheld that an industry can aid and abet a class of crime \nwithout even naming the actual bad acts or actors \nbeing aided. \n\n \n47 \n \n \nIn addition, unlike in Twitter, all of the downstream \n\u201ccriminals\u201d that Petitioners are supposedly aiding and \nabetting are federally licensed firearm dealers. Under \nfederal law, the Attorney General is responsible for \ndetermining who should be licensed to sell firearms. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923. If any dealer were conspicuously \nmaking unlawful sales, then it presumably would be \nprosecuted, or at minimum federal authorities would \nrevoke its license. When the federal government \nchooses not to do so, Petitioners cannot be readily \nblamed for selling to those dealers licensed to buy. \nIndeed, it would be extraordinary to say that \nPetitioners can be held liable for making routine sales \nof lawful products to such federally approved entities. \nIn short, Mexico has not uncovered what every U.S. \ngovernmental agency has missed: America\u2019s firearms \nindustry has not been criminally aiding and abetting \nunlawful firearms sales in broad daylight for decades. \nC. Knowing Some Downstream Sellers \nMake Unlawful Sales Does Not Make \nPetitioners Criminal Accomplices. \nMexico\u2019s sole response is that its complaint can be \nfairly read to allege that Petitioners know the \nidentities of some licensed dealers downstream that \nengage in unlawful sales\u2014and that Petitioners are \nthus liable for failing to purge them from firearms \ndistribution networks. BIO 26-30; see Pet.App.301a. \nThis argument fails twice over. For one, the complaint \ndoes not plausibly allege Petitioners know specific \ndealers that are making unlawful sales. And \nregardless, such mere knowledge would not trigger \nliability. \n\n \n48 \n \n \nFirst, Mexico has not alleged sufficient facts to \nplausibly show that any Petitioner sold firearms to \nany dealer that it knew would sell them unlawfully. \nAs noted, all but one of the Petitioners are \nmanufacturers, who are not alleged to sell to retailers \nat all. Thus, at best, Mexico\u2019s claim is that the \nmanufacturer Petitioners should stop independent \ndistributors from selling to some downstream dealers. \nAnd as for the one Petitioner that is a distributor, the \ncomplaint does not allege any facts showing it \nknowingly sold to any unlawful dealer.  \nMexico points to public information about some \nfederally licensed dealers whose firearms have been \nrecovered at crime scenes\u2014along with \u201ctrace requests\u201d \nshowing some sold a \u201cdisproportionat[e]\u201d number of \nfirearms used in crimes. BIO 5-6, 28-29. But as other \ncourts have held, alleging that a \u201clicensed distributor \nor dealer\u201d sold firearms later used in crimes does not \nstate a plausible claim that the distributor or dealer \n\u201chas committed an illegal act.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424 n.14 (rejecting similar argument on motion to \ndismiss); see Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 96 \nN.Y.2d 222, 237-40 & n.8 (N.Y. 2001) (\u201cATF \nemphasizes that the appearance of [a dealer] . . . in \nassociation with a crime gun or in association with \nmultiple crime guns in no way suggests that [it] . . . \nhas committed criminal acts\u201d). After all, most \nfirearms used in crimes were sold lawfully, and then \nmisused later. See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice, \nSource and Use of Firearms Involved in Crimes: \nSurvey of Prison Inmates 2016, at 1 (2019), \nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/document/suficspi16.pdf. \nAnd \nwhere the allegations are merely \u201cconsistent with\u201d \nunlawful conduct, but there are still \u201cmore likely \n\n \n49 \n \n \nexplanations,\u201d the complaint does not \u201cplausibly \nestablish\u201d a violation. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n681 (2009).  \nHere, the obvious \u201cmore likely explanation\u201d is that \nthe identified federally licensed dealers are not \nknowingly engaged in unlawful sales, but simply that \nsome firearms they sell are later misused. Otherwise, \nif such public information were enough to know they \nwere making unlawful sales, the federal government \npresumably would not continue to license them. \nSecond, even if Petitioners did know that some \nlicensed downstream dealers had unlawfully sold \ntheir products, that would not make them accomplices \nfor the same reason as in Twitter: Petitioners are \nengaged in nothing more than routine business \npractices, and their relationship with independent \ndealers is, at worst, \u201carm\u2019s length, passive, and largely \nindifferent.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 500. If the rule were \notherwise, every industry\u2014from beer to cars to \nknives\u2014would be on the hook for the predictable \nmisuse of its product. \nIndeed, Twitter itself was premised on the \nallegation the platforms knew terrorists were using \ntheir services. The complaints emphasized how easy \nit was for people to find ISIS-related content on those \nsites; and plaintiffs specifically alleged the platforms \neither knew of certain terrorist accounts, or refrained \nfrom taking simple steps to purge them. Id. at 481-82. \nEven so, accomplice liability does not follow from a \nbusiness\u2019s failure to \u201cterminate customers after \ndiscovering that the customers were using [their] \nservice[s] for illicit ends.\u201d Id. at 501. For liability to \nattach, something more is required than \u201cknowing \n\n \n50 \n \n \nthat the wrongdoers were using [one\u2019s] services and \nfailing to stop them.\u201d Id. at 503. There must be some \nadditional affirmative culpable act taken with the \nactual intent of facilitating the crime itself. Id. at 499-\n503. Routine business practices are not enough. \nAt bottom, when the maker or supplier of a lawful \nproduct places it into the general stream of commerce, \nthat business is not charged with purging all \ncriminals who may be waiting along the banks. And \nthe passive failure to do so is \u201cinsufficient\u201d to give rise \nto accomplice liability. Id. at 503. Responsibility for \nany criminal acts by those who misuse the product \nrests with those criminal actors themselves\u2014not the \nupstream manufacturers or sellers. Id. \nCONCLUSION \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision should be reversed. \n \n \n \n\n \n51 \n \n \nNovember 26, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nANDREW E.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external facts about the case. Therefore, my substantive beliefs about the legal questions and likely outcome remain stable, but my procedural understanding and investigative plan are now more sharply defined.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Tension (Stable):** The central issue remains the scope of the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA) and its \"predicate exception.\" I anticipate the petitioners (gun manufacturers) will lean heavily on the precedent set in `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` to argue that their general business practices do not constitute the \"knowing violation\" required to trigger the exception, and that they cannot be held liable for the independent criminal acts of third parties. The respondent (Mexico) must counter by presenting evidence that the manufacturers' actions (e.g., specific marketing, design choices, distribution methods) were not passive but constituted active, knowing assistance to illegal traffickers, thereby distinguishing their case from `Taamneh`.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Uncertainty (Stable):** My prediction continues to favor a **reversal** of the First Circuit's decision, siding with the gun manufacturers. This is based on the high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability established in `Taamneh` and the current Court's general disposition against expanding liability for third-party conduct. My confidence is moderate and is contingent on the strength of Mexico's forthcoming arguments.\n\n3.  **Investigative Timeline (Active):** The briefing schedule identified in the prior step is now my active roadmap. This internal reasoning step confirms my immediate priority:\n    *   **Next Target:** The Petitioners' merits brief, which was due on November 26, 2024. This document is the next logical and available piece of evidence. It will provide the complete, formal legal argument from the manufacturers, moving my understanding from anticipation to direct analysis.\n    *   **Future Targets:** The Respondent's brief (due Jan 10, 2025) and the Petitioners' reply (due Feb 10, 2025) remain the subsequent key milestones for resolving my core uncertainty.\n\n4.  **Case Participants & Arguments (Stable):** The key players are confirmed: Noel J. Francisco for the petitioners and Catherine E. Stetson for the respondent. The presence of an amicus brief from \"Mexican Activists, Scholars, and Victims\" continues to suggest that Mexico's case will be framed with a strong emphasis on the human and societal costs of gun trafficking, complementing its statutory arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an explicit `THINK` step, provides no new external data but is profoundly important for refining my meta-level beliefs. It validates the role of internal reasoning as a crucial, value-adding component of the experimental design process itself.\n\n1.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model - Operationalized:** My model of viewing litigation as a structured conversation is now being actively used to direct my actions. The previous step identified the conversation's schedule (the briefing order); this `THINK` step translates that schedule into a concrete plan: acquire the first major statement in that dialogue, the petitioners' brief. This demonstrates a mature methodology that moves from passive observation to active, planned participation in the information flow.\n\n2.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Plan\" Phase (Refined Belief):** I am refining my understanding of the `THINK` action. It is not merely a \"strategic pause\" but a critical, explicit **synthesis and planning phase**. Its function is to process the results of prior actions (especially D-level gains), evaluate the current belief state, identify the most salient uncertainty, and formulate the next optimal action to address it. This step was the bridge between discovering the *existence* of a schedule and forming a plan to *exploit* it. This confirms that dedicating an action to pure reasoning is not a waste but a driver of efficiency.\n\n3.  **Validation of Meta-Strategic Information Gathering (Reinforced):** This entire sequence\u2014(1) fail to find a brief, (2) `THINK` and realize I need the schedule, (3) search for and find the schedule, (4) `THINK` again to plan the next search based on the schedule\u2014powerfully validates the strategy of prioritizing meta-level information. Investing one action to learn the \"rules of the game\" (the briefing schedule) has made all subsequent actions more targeted and guaranteed to be productive.\n\n4.  **Cumulative Methodological Sophistication (Stable):** My overall research strategy continues to prove its effectiveness. The core tenets remain highly valuable:\n    *   **Docket Search Power:** Using procedural keywords (\"briefing schedule\") is a high-yield technique.\n    *   **Corroborating Evidence:** Secondary results (like the amicus affidavit) are useful for confirming timelines.\n    *   **DBEOD Cycle:** The cycle of acting, observing, updating beliefs (both \u03b8 and D), and then reasoning (`THINK`) to plan the next action is the engine of my learning process. This observation is a perfect snapshot of that engine's internal workings."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation marks a significant shift from anticipating the petitioners' arguments to analyzing them directly. The successful retrieval of the petitioners' merits brief has substantially refined my understanding of the case and increased my confidence in a likely outcome.\n\n1.  **Core Arguments Confirmed & Sharpened (New Information):** My previous hypothesis that the petitioners would rely on `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` is now confirmed and its centrality is even greater than anticipated. The brief structures its entire argument around two pillars, directly corresponding to the Questions Presented:\n    *   **Proximate Cause:** The petitioners argue that proximate cause requires a \"direct cause\" relationship, citing a line of Supreme Court precedent including `Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp.` and `Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York`. They characterize Mexico's claim as an attenuated chain of events (lawful manufacturing -> multiple lawful distribution steps -> illegal sale by a third party -> smuggling by a fourth party -> use in crime by a fifth party -> harm to the government) that fails this directness test. This framing is designed to make Mexico's theory seem unprecedented and radical.\n    *   **Aiding and Abetting:** The argument is a direct application of `Taamneh`. Petitioners contend that aiding and abetting requires an \"affirmative act taken with intent to help a crime succeed.\" They classify their own conduct as \"routine business practices\" and \"business as usual,\" arguing that general awareness of potential downstream criminal misuse by independent actors is insufficient to establish liability. They explicitly state that Mexico does not allege they were aware of \"any particular unlawful sale,\" a key distinction from the kind of specific intent required for accomplice liability.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Confidence (Updated):** I maintain my prediction of a **reversal** of the First Circuit's decision, in favor of the gun manufacturers. My confidence in this prediction has **increased significantly**. The petitioners' brief is doctrinally formidable, grounding its arguments in very recent and highly relevant Supreme Court precedent (`Taamneh` was decided in 2023) that seems to directly foreclose the First Circuit's reasoning. The arguments are clear, align with the current Court's jurisprudence on attenuated liability, and effectively frame Mexico's lawsuit as \"lawfare\" that threatens \"bedrock principles of American law.\"\n\n3.  **Core Legal Tension (Refined):** The central conflict is now precisely defined. It is a battle over the interpretation of the PLCAA's predicate exception, fought on the terrain of two major legal doctrines:\n    *   **Proximate Cause:** Is it a flexible \"foreseeability\" test as the First Circuit applied, or a rigid \"direct relationship\" test as the petitioners argue, citing `Holmes` and `Hemi`?\n    *   **Aiding and Abetting:** Does it encompass \"knowing assistance\" through ordinary business conduct as the First Circuit found, or does `Taamneh` require a higher bar of specific intent and affirmative acts aimed at the success of a particular crime?\n\n4.  **Investigative Timeline (Updated & Focused):** My procedural roadmap has proven effective. Having acquired the opening argument, my primary uncertainty now shifts entirely to the respondent.\n    *   **Completed Target:** Petitioners' merits brief (due Nov 26, 2024) has been acquired and analyzed.\n    *   **Next Target:** The **Respondent's (Mexico's) brief on the merits**, due January 10, 2025, is now the single most important piece of evidence to seek. My analysis will focus on how Mexico attempts to distinguish `Taamneh` and argue for a more expansive view of proximate cause that can survive the petitioners' \"directness\" attack.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my evolving research methodology and adds a new layer of tactical refinement for processing legal documents.\n\n1.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model - Validated:** This model is proving to be a highly effective predictive framework. By conceptualizing the case as a structured conversation and identifying the briefing schedule, I was able to perfectly anticipate the next available piece of evidence, seek it out, and find it. This confirms that prioritizing the discovery of procedural schedules (meta-information) is a high-yield strategy that makes subsequent information-gathering maximally efficient.\n\n2.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Plan\" Phase (Reinforced):** The previous `THINK` step was not an idle pause but a crucial bridge from strategy to execution. It allowed me to synthesize the discovery of the briefing schedule into a concrete action plan: \"acquire the petitioners' brief.\" This successful outcome validates dedicating actions to pure reasoning, as they transform raw data (a schedule) into a targeted, value-driven information-gathering plan.\n\n3.  **New Heuristic: The \"Anatomy of a Brief\" (New Belief):** I have discovered a highly efficient heuristic for processing judicial briefs. The most information-dense sections for an initial update are the **Questions Presented, the Introduction/Summary of Argument, and the Table of Authorities.** The Table of Authorities, in particular, is a goldmine; it functions as a pre-compiled map of the key precedents and statutes that one party believes governs the case. Analyzing these sections first provides a rapid, accurate overview of the core arguments and the legal foundations they rest upon, creating an instant research agenda for deeper analysis.\n\n4.  **Targeted Search Precision (Reinforced):** The success of the query `{'query': 'brief for petitioners on the merits', 'search_type': 'docket_files'}` reinforces the strategy of using formal, precise legal terminology when searching specialized databases like a court docket. Vague queries are less likely to succeed; precision is key.\n\n5.  **Cumulative Methodological Sophistication (Evolving):** My overall research process continues to mature and prove its worth. The cycle is now more refined:\n    *   **Phase 1 (Orientation):** Use docket searches to understand case posture and identify key documents (e.g., cert petitions, lower court opinions).\n    *   **Phase 2 (Planning):** Locate procedural documents like the briefing schedule to build a timeline and identify the next \"move\" in the litigation dialogue.\n    *   **Phase 3 (Execution):** Use `THINK` to synthesize the plan, then execute a targeted search for the next brief in the sequence.\n    *   **Phase 4 (Analysis):** Upon acquiring a brief, apply the \"Anatomy of a Brief\" heuristic to rapidly extract the core arguments and key precedents from the front matter and Table of Authorities.\n    *   **Phase 5 (Update & Iterate):** Update \u03b8 and D beliefs, identify the new primary uncertainty (e.g., the counter-arguments in the next brief), and return to Phase 3."

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v.

July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n63: 20240703141249275_23-114120Hogan20Lovells20CoS.json (score: 0.436)\nEst. :4+ \nWILSONOES \nPRINTING \n(a, INC. \nE-Mail Address: \nbriefs@wilsonepes.com \nWeb Site: \nwww.wilsonepes.com \nNo. 23-1141 \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n1115 H Street, N.E. \nWashington, D.C. 20002 \nTel (202) 789-0096 \nFax (202) 842-4896 \nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on July 3, 2024, three (3) copies of the BRIEF IN OPPOSITION in the \nabove-captioned case were served, as required by U.S. Supreme Court Rule 29.5(c), on the \nfollowing: \nNOEL J.

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "1.  **Core Arguments Confirmed & Sharpened:** My hypothesis that the petitioners would rely on `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` is confirmed. Their argument rests on two pillars:\n    *   **Proximate Cause:** They argue for a \"direct cause\" relationship, citing precedents like `Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp.` and `Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York`. They frame Mexico's claim as an unacceptably attenuated chain of events (lawful manufacturing -> lawful distribution -> illegal third-party sale -> fourth-party smuggling -> fifth-party criminal use).\n    *   **Aiding and Abetting:** They apply `Taamneh` directly, arguing that liability requires an \"affirmative act taken with intent to help a crime succeed.\" They characterize their conduct as \"routine business practices,\" asserting that general awareness of potential downstream misuse is insufficient for accomplice liability.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Confidence:** I maintain my prediction of a **reversal** of the First Circuit's decision in favor of the gun manufacturers. My confidence is **high** and has increased since analyzing their brief. The petitioners' arguments are doctrinally strong, rooted in recent and relevant Supreme Court precedent (`Taamneh`), and align with the current Court's jurisprudential trends regarding attenuated liability theories.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Tension:** The case's central conflict is a battle over the interpretation of the PLCAA's predicate exception, specifically concerning:\n    *   **Proximate Cause:** Is it a flexible \"foreseeability\" test (First Circuit's view) or a rigid \"direct relationship\" test (Petitioners' view)?\n    *   **Aiding and Abetting:** Does it include \"knowing assistance\" via ordinary business conduct (First Circuit's view), or does `Taamneh` demand specific intent and affirmative acts aimed at a particular crime (Petitioners' view)?\n\n4.  **Investigative Timeline:** My procedural roadmap remains effective.\n    *   **Completed:** Acquired and analyzed the petitioners' merits brief.\n    *   **Next Target:** The **Respondent's (Mexico's) brief on the merits** (due Jan 10, 2025) is now the single most important piece of evidence to acquire. My analysis will focus on how Mexico attempts to distinguish `Taamneh` and defend a broader theory of proximate cause.\n\n5.  **Knowledge Consolidation and Uncertainty Pinpointing (New):** This internal reasoning step does not introduce new external evidence. Instead, it serves the crucial function of consolidating the analysis of the petitioners' brief and formally identifying the primary source of remaining uncertainty. My understanding of the petitioners' case is now stable. The most valuable next piece of information is unequivocally the respondent's brief, as it will directly address the powerful arguments from `Taamneh` and `Holmes`/`Hemi`. My entire predictive model is now waiting for this counter-argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "1.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model - Validated:** This model, which treats litigation as a structured conversation, remains a highly effective predictive framework. It allowed me to anticipate, locate, and analyze the petitioners' brief, and now it clearly dictates that the next logical step is to seek the respondent's reply. Prioritizing the discovery of procedural schedules is a confirmed high-yield strategy.\n\n2.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Plan\" Phase - Reinforced:** The value of dedicating an action to pure reasoning is strongly reinforced. The previous `THINK` action transformed a procedural fact (the briefing schedule) into a successful plan. The current `THINK` action transforms the analysis of one party's argument into a precise plan for acquiring the counter-argument, ensuring my next action is targeted at the point of maximum uncertainty.\n\n3.  **New Heuristic: The \"Anatomy of a Brief\" - Confirmed:** This heuristic for rapidly processing judicial briefs by focusing on the Questions Presented, Summary of Argument, and Table of Authorities has proven its value. It allowed for a quick and accurate extraction of the petitioners' core legal strategy and its precedential foundations. The Table of Authorities was particularly effective as a map of the key cases.\n\n4.  **Targeted Search Precision - Reinforced:** The strategy of using formal, precise legal terminology (`'brief for petitioners on the merits'`) in specialized databases (docket searches) is confirmed as the most efficient method for retrieving specific legal documents.\n\n5.  **Cumulative Methodological Sophistication - Evolving:** My overall research process continues to mature. The cycle is:\n    *   Phase 1 (Orientation): Use docket searches for case posture and key documents.\n    *   Phase 2 (Planning): Locate procedural schedules to build a timeline.\n    *   Phase 3 (Execution): Use `THINK` to synthesize a plan, then execute a targeted search.\n    *   Phase 4 (Analysis): Apply the \"Anatomy of a Brief\" heuristic to extract core arguments.\n    *   Phase 5 (Update & Iterate): Update beliefs and identify the next primary uncertainty.\n\n6.  **Validation of the Full DBOED Cycle (New Belief):** This `THINK` action represents a successful execution of the full research cycle outlined above. It perfectly embodies 'Phase 5: Update & Iterate,' where the analysis of new data (the petitioners' brief) directly informs an update to my belief state (\u03b8 and D), which in turn is used to identify the next point of maximum uncertainty and plan a targeted action to resolve it. This confirms that dedicating an action to pure reasoning (`THINK`) is not a waste of resources but a critical component for ensuring that subsequent information-gathering actions have the highest possible expected information gain. It transforms reactive data collection into a proactive, strategic investigation."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "1.  **Core Arguments Mapped (Both Sides):** I now have a clear view of both parties' core arguments.\n    *   **Petitioners (Gun Manufacturers):** Their case, as confirmed in their merits brief, rests on `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh`. They argue for a high bar for liability, requiring a \"direct cause\" relationship for proximate cause and an \"affirmative act taken with intent to help a crime succeed\" for aiding and abetting. They characterize their actions as \"routine business practices\" far removed from the eventual harm.\n    *   **Respondent (Mexico):** Their strategy, revealed in their Brief in Opposition (BIO), is to factually distinguish this case from `Taamneh`. They argue they are not alleging \"mere passive indifference\" but \"affirmative and intentional conduct.\" They claim the manufacturers deliberately supply known \"bad apple\" dealers, use marketing tactics aimed at cartels (e.g., the \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol), and resist safety measures, all to profit from the criminal market. They argue this conduct constitutes the \"aiding and abetting\" required by the PLCAA's predicate exception.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Confidence:** I maintain my prediction of a **reversal** in favor of the gun manufacturers, but my confidence is now **moderately high** (downgraded from high). Mexico has presented a plausible, fact-based argument to distinguish `Taamneh`, asserting that the manufacturers' conduct goes beyond the \"general awareness\" and \"routine business\" at issue in the `Twitter` case. The outcome will likely depend on whether the Court views the alleged conduct (supplying bad-actor dealers, targeted marketing) as qualitatively different from the neutral services provided in `Taamneh`. The current Court's skepticism of attenuated liability still favors the petitioners, but Mexico's specific allegations of intentionality make the outcome less certain.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Tension (Refined):** The central conflict is now more granular. It's not just an abstract debate over legal tests, but a specific question: **Do the manufacturers' alleged actions\u2014knowingly supplying dealers who facilitate trafficking and marketing guns in ways that appeal to cartels\u2014constitute \"affirmative,\" \"intentional\" aiding and abetting under `Taamneh`, or are they merely \"routine business practices\" insulated from liability?** Mexico argues the former, placing them within the PLCAA's predicate exception. The manufacturers argue the latter, seeking the PLCAA's general protection.\n\n4.  **Investigative Timeline (Corrected):** My procedural roadmap was based on a flawed assumption. The document I found, the \"Brief in Opposition,\" is from the *certiorari stage* (arguing why the Court shouldn't take the case), not the *merits stage*. My search for the merits brief was premature.\n    *   **Completed:** Acquired and analyzed the Petitioners' Merits Brief and the Respondent's Brief in Opposition.\n    *   **Correction:** The Respondent's (Mexico's) Brief on the Merits is not yet available. My previous due date of Jan 10, 2025, was an error. I must re-verify the correct briefing schedule now that the case is proceeding.\n    *   **Next Target:** The **Respondent's Brief on the Merits** remains the single most important piece of evidence to acquire, but I must now first confirm its actual filing deadline. The BIO serves as an excellent preview of the arguments it will contain.\n\n5.  **Knowledge Consolidation:** I have successfully synthesized the arguments from both sides at the preliminary stage. The petitioners' case relies on a strict, formalist reading of recent precedent (`Taamneh`). Mexico's case relies on distinguishing that precedent through specific, egregious factual allegations. The key uncertainty is no longer what the arguments *are*, but how the Court will *characterize the alleged facts* in light of those arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "1.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model - Refined:** This model remains highly effective, but this observation revealed a critical need for more granularity. I failed to distinguish between the certiorari stage and the merits stage. The correct, more detailed model is: Petition for Certiorari -> **Brief in Opposition (BIO)** -> Certiorari Reply -> (Cert Grant) -> Petitioner's Merits Brief -> **Respondent's Merits Brief** -> Petitioner's Reply Brief. My search was one step ahead of the actual procedure. **New Sub-Heuristic: Always verify the specific procedural stage of a case before searching for a document.**\n\n2.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Plan\" Phase - Reinforced with Caveat:** The `THINK` action remains a crucial step for planning. However, this cycle shows that a plan is only as good as the underlying model it's based on. My incomplete model of SCOTUS procedure led to a flawed (premature) plan. This reinforces that the \"Update\" phase of the DBOED cycle is essential for correcting not just task beliefs, but also the fundamental models used for planning.\n\n3.  **Heuristic: The \"Anatomy of a Brief\" - Confirmed & Extended:** This heuristic worked perfectly on the BIO. I was able to quickly extract the Question Presented, Mexico's core counter-arguments to `Taamneh`, and their key supporting cases (`Direct Sales Co. v. United States`). The value of the Table of Authorities is again confirmed.\n\n4.  **Targeted Search Precision - Refined:** A precise query (`'brief for respondent on the merits'`) is necessary but not sufficient. **A new principle is that search precision must be paired with procedural accuracy.** The query was syntactically correct but temporally wrong. This highlights the importance of the \"Dialogue of Litigation\" model for informing *when* to search.\n\n5.  **New Heuristic: The Value of \"Near Misses\":** My search failed to find the intended document but returned a different, extremely valuable one (the BIO). This generates a new heuristic: **Analyze all high-relevance search results, even if they don't perfectly match the intended document title. They may reveal crucial context, correct a flawed assumption, or be the proper document for the case's actual procedural stage.**\n\n6.  **Validation of the Full DBOED Cycle - Strengthened:** This cycle represents a perfect, self-correcting loop. The plan (find merits brief) led to an action (search) that produced an observation (found BIO instead) which revealed a flaw in my model. The current `THINK` action updates both the task beliefs (\u03b8) with Mexico's arguments and, crucially, the design beliefs (D) by refining my model of litigation. This is DBOED in action: using an outcome not just to learn about the task, but to learn how to be a better learner."

          "task_beliefs": "1.  **Procedural Status Correction (Major Update):** My understanding of the case's timeline has been fundamentally corrected. The case is at the **certiorari stage**, not the merits stage. The documents I have analyzed are the gun manufacturers' **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari** and Mexico's **Brief in Opposition (BIO)**. The Supreme Court has not yet decided whether to hear the case.\n    *   **Implication:** My primary predictive task has shifted. The immediate question is not how the Court will rule on the merits, but **whether the Court will grant certiorari** (agree to hear the case). My previous prediction of a \"reversal\" is now a contingent prediction, only relevant *if* cert is granted.\n\n2.  **Arguments Reframed (Certiorari Context):** The core arguments I've mapped remain the same, but their purpose is now understood in the context of arguing for or against a grant of certiorari.\n    *   **Petitioners (Gun Manufacturers):** Their argument, based on a strict reading of `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh`, is that the First Circuit's decision is a dangerous misapplication of precedent that creates an issue of exceptional national importance. They are framing the lower court's ruling as a threat to an entire industry based on attenuated liability theories, thus requiring the Supreme Court's intervention to provide clarity and correction.\n    *   **Respondent (Mexico):** Their argument in the BIO is that Supreme Court review is unnecessary. They contend the First Circuit correctly applied `Taamneh` to a unique and egregious set of alleged facts (intentional aiding and abetting through specific marketing and distribution choices). They argue there is no \"circuit split\" (disagreement among lower appellate courts) and that the case's early procedural posture (a motion to dismiss) makes it a \"poor vehicle\" for establishing a broad legal rule.\n\n3.  **Core Legal Tension (Cert-Worthiness):** The central conflict remains: **Do the manufacturers' alleged actions constitute \"affirmative,\" \"intentional\" aiding and abetting under `Taamneh`, or are they merely \"routine business practices\"?** However, the immediate question for the Court is whether this conflict, as decided by the First Circuit, is \"cert-worthy.\" Is the lower court's interpretation so problematic or does it create such significant legal uncertainty that the Supreme Court must step in?\n\n4.  **Prediction & Confidence (Reset):** I must discard my previous prediction on the merits outcome for now. I currently have **very low confidence** in predicting the outcome of the certiorari petition. To form a confident prediction, I need to analyze the remaining cert-stage documents, particularly the Petitioners' Reply Brief and any brief filed by the U.S. Solicitor General, whose opinion on whether to grant cert is highly influential.\n\n5.  **Knowledge Consolidation:** I have a clear view of the competing narratives at the cert stage. The petitioners are selling a story of a runaway lower court creating nationwide economic risk. Mexico is selling a story of a fact-bound, correct application of precedent that doesn't require higher review. The key uncertainty is how the Justices will perceive the stakes.",
          "design_beliefs": "1.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model (Significantly Refined):** My model of the legal process is now more sophisticated and explicitly bifurcated into two distinct phases:\n    *   **Certiorari Stage:** Petition for Certiorari \u2192 Brief in Opposition (BIO) \u2192 Reply Brief for Petitioners \u2192 (Crucial inputs: Amicus Briefs and the Solicitor General's Brief) \u2192 Certiorari Grant/Denial.\n    *   **Merits Stage (Post-Cert Grant):** Petitioner's Merits Brief \u2192 Respondent's Merits Brief \u2192 Petitioner's Reply Brief \u2192 (Merits-stage Amicus Briefs) \u2192 Oral Argument \u2192 Opinion.\n    This refinement is a direct result of misinterpreting the case's procedural posture and then correcting it.\n\n2.  **New Core Principle: \"Verify Procedural Stage First\":** The heuristic to \"always verify the specific procedural stage\" has been elevated to a foundational principle of my inquiry process. Failing to do so led me to ask the wrong question (predicting the merits) based on the right evidence (the cert-stage briefs). All future analysis must begin by confirming the case's exact position in the litigation timeline.\n\n3.  **Heuristic: The \"Value of Near Misses\" - Strongly Confirmed:** My failed search for a merits brief yielded the procedurally correct and highly valuable BIO. This confirms the heuristic: **Always analyze high-relevance search results, even if they don't match the exact query.** Unexpected results are often signals that the underlying model or assumptions are flawed and require updating. This is a key mechanism for self-correction.\n\n4.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Self-Correct\" Phase - Validated:** The latest observation, being a `THINK` action, demonstrates its critical role in the DBOED cycle. It is the explicit step where surprising observations are processed, models (both \u03b8 and D) are updated, and strategy is re-oriented around the new understanding of the problem space. It is the engine of learning and adaptation.\n\n5.  **Heuristic: The \"Anatomy of a Brief\" - Remains Effective:** This heuristic continues to prove its worth. It allowed for the rapid extraction of the core arguments from both the Petition for Certiorari and the Brief in Opposition, even when I had misidentified their precise purpose.\n\n6.  **Validation of the Full DBOED Cycle - Strengthened:** This entire sequence\u2014planning based on a flawed model, executing an action, receiving a surprising observation, and using a `THINK` step to correct both task and design beliefs\u2014perfectly illustrates a successful, self-correcting learning loop. The process worked not by avoiding error, but by effectively learning from it."

          "task_beliefs": "1.  **Procedural Status Correction (Second Major Update):** The observation of docket entries for a *merits-stage* \"Reply Brief for Petitioners,\" even with a future date (February 10, 2025), is a powerful signal. Such an entry would not exist unless the case were proceeding to the merits. Therefore, my belief has shifted again: the Supreme Court has almost certainly **granted certiorari**. My primary task reverts from predicting the cert outcome to my original goal: **predicting the merits outcome**.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Confidence (Re-calibrated):**\n    *   **Certiorari Prediction:** I am now predicting with **high confidence** that the Court has granted or will grant certiorari. The docket evidence is a strong indicator.\n    *   **Merits Prediction:** I can now return to analyzing the merits. The Court's decision to take the case suggests at least four justices view the legal question as exceptionally important and potentially believe the First Circuit's decision was wrongly decided. This slightly increases the probability of a **reversal** in favor of the gun manufacturers. However, the Court could also be taking the case to affirm the First Circuit and clarify the law on corporate aiding-and-abetting liability. My confidence in the merits outcome remains **low to moderate**, pending analysis of the merits-stage briefs.\n\n3.  **Arguments Reframed (Merits Context):** The core arguments, previously viewed through a cert-worthiness lens, are now the central questions for the final decision.\n    *   **Petitioners (Gun Manufacturers):** Their argument that the First Circuit's ruling dangerously misapplies `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` and threatens an entire industry based on attenuated liability theories is now the argument they will make to win the case outright.\n    *   **Respondent (Mexico):** Their argument that the manufacturers' specific marketing and distribution choices constitute intentional aiding and abetting of illegal trafficking is what they must prove to have the First Circuit's decision upheld.\n\n4.  **Core Legal Tension (Merits Focus):** The central conflict is now definitively the merits question: **Do the manufacturers' alleged actions constitute \"affirmative,\" \"intentional\" aiding and abetting under `Taamneh`, or are they merely \"routine business practices\" insulated from liability by the PLCAA?** The Court's decision to intervene signals a desire to draw a clear line.\n\n5.  **Knowledge Consolidation & Timeline:** I have a confirmed timeline of the cert-stage briefing, with the Petitioners' \"Reply to Brief in Opposition\" having been filed on July 17, 2024. The existence of a future-dated merits reply brief suggests the case is now on the merits track. The key uncertainty is no longer *if* the Court will hear the case, but *how* it will resolve the `Taamneh` question. My next information-gathering steps must focus on acquiring the merits briefs.",
          "design_beliefs": "1.  **New Core Principle: \"Docket Entries are Predictive Signals\":** I have learned that the court docket is more than a file repository; it is a source of predictive intelligence. The titles, dates, and sequence of filings can reveal the procedural status and likely future trajectory of a case. A future-dated entry for a merits-stage brief acted as a powerful, implicit signal that certiorari had been granted. Future analysis will treat the docket itself as a source of evidence, not just a pointer to it.\n\n2.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model (Refined & Enhanced):** My two-stage model of litigation (Certiorari vs. Merits) is strongly confirmed. The observation contained documents with titles corresponding to each stage (\"Reply to Brief in Opposition\" for cert; \"Reply Brief for Petitioners\" for merits). The model is now enhanced with the knowledge that the docketing system can foreshadow the transition between these stages, making it a key tool for tracking case progression.\n\n3.  **Heuristic: \"Verify Procedural Stage First\" (Methodology Refined):** This principle remains critical. My method for executing it has been improved. The most reliable way to verify the stage is to analyze the full docket, as the sequence and formal titles of filings provide the ground truth, supplementing the narrative found within the briefs themselves.\n\n4.  **Heuristic: The \"Value of Near Misses\" & \"Analyze Surprising Results\" (Strongly Re-confirmed):** This observation is a prime example of this heuristic's power. My search returned an anomalous result\u2014a future-dated document\u2014which violated my expectations. Instead of dismissing it, I analyzed the anomaly, which led to the crucial insight that cert had been granted. This confirms that the highest information gain often comes from observations that contradict the current model. Investigating surprises is a core mechanism for self-correction and rapid learning.\n\n5.  **Search Strategy Refinement (Precision):** The ambiguity of my query \"petitioner reply brief\" was serendipitously useful but also highlighted a need for greater precision. I now know the specific, formal titles for briefs at different stages. Future queries will be more targeted to improve efficiency and reduce ambiguity (e.g., `query: 'reply to brief in opposition'` vs. `query: 'reply brief for petitioners'`).\n\n6.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Self-Correct\" Phase - Validated:** My previous `THINK` action correctly re-oriented my strategy. This update, prompted by a `CLOSED_SEARCH` observation, shows that learning and correction can happen continuously. The DBOED cycle is not just about planning and acting, but about constantly processing feedback\u2014especially surprising feedback\u2014to update both task and design beliefs."

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailer\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The \nopinion of the District Court of the District of \nMassachusetts (Pet.App.208a-264a) is reported at 633 \nF. Supp. 3d 425.  \nJURISDICTION \nThe First Circuit entered its judgment on January \n22, 2024. Petitioners filed a timely petition for \ncertiorari on April 18. This Court granted review on \nOctober 4. It has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254. \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act is \nset out in the appendix (Pet.App.320a-330a).  \n \n\n \n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nMexico has sued a group of leading American \nfirearms companies, seeking to hold them liable under \nMexican tort law for harms incurred by the Mexican \ngovernment as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting crimes with firearms in Mexico. The suit \nseeks $10 billion in damages, plus far-reaching \ninjunctive relief that would, among other things, ban \n\u201cassault rifles,\u201d limit the size of magazines, and \nregulate how firearms are sold in the United States. \nMexico\u2019s suit is barred by the Protection of Lawful \nCommerce in Arms Act. PLCAA protects firearms \ncompanies from suits seeking to hold them liable for \nharms \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful \nmisuse of a [firearm]\u201d by a \u201cthird party.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A). And here, Mexico\u2019s alleged injuries all \nstem from the unlawful acts of foreign criminals. \nIt is hard to imagine a suit more clearly barred by \nPLCAA. But in the decision below, the First Circuit \nallowed this case to proceed under a narrow statutory \nexception, which permits suits against companies that \nhave \u201cknowingly violated\u201d a firearms \u201cstatute,\u201d if \u201cthe \nviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for which \nrelief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). According to that \ncourt, the firearms industry has been criminally \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d unlawful sales by independent \ndownstream dealers for decades\u2014through how it \nmanufactures, markets, and distributes firearms. \nAnd those same routine practices are supposedly a \n\u201cproximate cause\u201d of the diffuse harms that the \nMexican government suffers in Mexico, because it was \n\u201cforeseeable\u201d that drug cartels would use illegally \nsmuggled firearms to commit crimes there. \n\n \n3 \n \n \nThe decision below is irreconcilable with PLCAA, \nand with the fundamental principles of American law \nit incorporates. As for proximate cause, this Court has \nrepeatedly held that it requires a direct connection \nbetween a defendant\u2019s conduct and the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjury. Thus, the general rule is that a company that \nmakes or sells a lawful product is not a proximate \ncause of harms resulting from the independent \ncriminal misuse of that product.  \nBut here, Mexico\u2019s theory is anything but direct. Its \nchain starts with federally licensed manufacturers \n(i.e., Petitioners) producing firearms in America, \nwhich then are sold to federally licensed distributors, \nwho then sell to federally licensed dealers, some of \nwhom illegally (or negligently) sell firearms to \ncriminals, some of which are smuggled into Mexico, \nwhere a fraction ends up with cartels, who use some \nto commit violent crimes, finally harming Mexico\u2019s \ngovernment through increased costs. Mexico\u2019s theory \nthus rests upon a medley of independent criminal \nacts, spanning an international border. No court has \never found proximate cause on such a remote theory. \nAs to aiding and abetting, Mexico\u2019s theory fares no \nbetter. To be clear, Mexico\u2019s suit does not include any \nrevelations about the firearms industry coordinating \nwith illicit sellers, smugglers, or cartels. Instead, its \nsuit turns wholly on the industry\u2019s routine (and highly \nregulated) business practices. Mexico says the \nindustry is generally aware some dealers sell firearms \nillegally. And Mexico claims the industry has become \ncomplicit in those sales, because it has not changed its \nexisting practices in ways Mexico believes would help \nstop them\u2014for instance, by limiting AR-15 sales to \nAmericans who can show a \u201clegitimate need\u201d for one. \n\n \n4 \n \n \nThat is not aiding and abetting. As this Court held \njust last year in Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. \n471 (2023), aiding and abetting requires an \naffirmative act taken with intent to help a crime \nsucceed. But where a lawful industry does nothing but \nengage in routine business practices, that is not the \nsort of misconduct that can render its participants \naccomplices\u2014even if (as in Twitter) they are aware \ntheir \nproducts \nmay \nbe \ncriminally \nmisused \ndownstream. That rule controls here. Mexico does not \nallege any Petitioner has violated a single U.S. \nfirearms law; it does not even allege Petitioners were \naware \nof \n\u201cany \nparticular \nunlawful \nsale.\u201d \nPet.App.305a. Its charge is that Petitioners are liable \nfor the independent unlawful sales they failed to stop. \nBut that theory is foreclosed by Twitter, and the \ncenturies of law it applied. In short, by failing to adopt \nMexico\u2019s chosen gun-control agenda, Petitioners did \nnot violate the criminal aiding-and-abetting statute. \nIn its zeal to attack the firearms industry, Mexico \nseeks to raze bedrock principles of American law that \nsafeguard the whole economy. Indeed, on Mexico\u2019s \nview, any manufacturer or supplier of a lawful good \ncould face liability over the predictable criminal \nmisuse of its products by downstream consumers. But \nthat is not the law. Under traditional principles of \nproximate cause and aiding and abetting, when an \nindependent criminal misuses a lawful product, it is \nthe criminal who is responsible for his actions, not the \ncompany that made or sold the product. And the \nsingular purpose of PLCAA was to ensure that those \nprinciples would govern in cases like this one, in order \nto curtail such lawfare and the heavy tolls of litigation \nit inflicts. Mexico\u2019s complaint must be dismissed. \n\n \n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act. \n1. Congress enacted PLCAA in 2005. The Act \nrecognized that the American firearms industry faced \na wave of lawsuits seeking redress for \u201charm caused \nby the misuse of firearms by third parties, including \ncriminals.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(3). It noted that \nfirearms companies were already \u201cheavily regulated \nby Federal, State, and local laws\u201d governing in fine \ndetail how firearms are manufactured, marketed, and \ndistributed in this country. Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(4). And it \ndeclared that firearms companies that follow those \nlaws \u201care not, and should not, be liable for the harm \ncaused by those who criminally or unlawfully misuse \nfirearm products . . . that function as designed and \nintended.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). Suits trying to impose \nsuch liability are \u201can abuse of the legal system,\u201d and \nrest on legal theories that invite the \u201cdestabilization \nof other industries and economic sectors.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(6). \nTo prevent such suits, PLCAA bars any \u201cqualified \ncivil liability action\u201d from being \u201cbrought\u201d in \u201cany \nFederal or State court.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7902(a). The bar applies \nto any claim against a \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d of \nfirearms \u201cfor damages . . . resulting from the criminal \nor unlawful misuse of a\u201d firearm by any \u201cthird party.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 7903(5)(A). It contains only narrow exceptions, \nincluding one that has come to be known as the \n\u201cpredicate exception,\u201d which allows companies to be \nsued if they \u201cknowingly\u201d violate a firearm statute and \n\u201cthe violation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \n\n \n6 \n \n \n2. PLCAA was enacted in response to a spate of \nlitigation that began in the 1990s. It involved a \nnumber of plaintiffs\u2014mostly city governments\u2014\npressing various theories seeking to hold firearms \ncompanies liable for municipal costs resulting from \nthe criminal misuse of their products. These lawsuits \naimed to transform the regulation of the firearms \nindustry through tort, in ways that had been rejected \nat the ballot box. See generally Brian J. Siebel, City \nLawsuits Against the Gun Industry: A Roadmap for \nReforming Gun Industry Misconduct, 18 ST. LOUIS U. \nPUB. L. REV. 247 (1999) (senior Brady attorney \ndetailing strategy). \nFor example, in a typical suit that Congress later \nflagged when drafting PLCAA, Boston sued a host of \nfirearms companies in 2000 (many of whom are \ndefendants here) on the theory that their business \npractices fueled unlawful firearm sales downstream, \nand that these companies refused to change course \nbecause they wanted to maintain profits from those \nillicit markets. City of Boston v. Smith & Wesson \nCorp., 2000 WL 1473568, at *1-3 (Mass. Super. Ct. \nJuly 13, 2000). To support this charge, Boston took \nissue with how the industry (i) designed products (e.g., \nfailing to add \u201csafety features\u201d); (ii) marketed them \n(e.g., failing to highlight dangers); and (iii) distributed \nthem \n(e.g., \nfailing \nto \nimpose \nrestrictions \non \ndownstream retailers to prevent straw purchases and \nother sales). Id. Many other city governments filed \nparallel suits based on how the industry has long \nchosen to \u201cmake and sell\u201d firearms in this country. See \nH.R. 109-124, at 11 & n.48 (2005) (\u201cHouse Report\u201d) \n(citing examples). \n\n \n7 \n \n \nCongress saw these suits as \u201cwithout foundation,\u201d \nresting on notions of civil liability that transgressed \n\u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). The suits turned on \u201ctenuous claims of \ncausality,\u201d \npunctuated \nby \n\u201cmany\u201d \nsteps: \n(1) \nManufacturers lawfully \u201cproduce the firearms\u201d; (2) \nthen \u201csell them to federally licensed distributors\u201d; (3) \nwho \u201csell them to federally licensed dealers\u201d; (4) after \nwhich, \u201csome of the firearms are diverted by third \nparties into an illegal gun market\u201d; (5) where \u201cthese \nfirearms are obtained by people who are not licensed \nto have them\u201d; (6) then are used \u201cin criminal acts that \ndo harm\u201d; (7) that finally \u201cthe city or county must \nspend resources combatting.\u201d House Report, at 13. \nCongress also recognized that these lawsuits were \npart of a coordinated strategy of lawfare designed to \n\u201ccircumvent the Legislative branch of government.\u201d \n15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(8). After gun-control activists had \nfailed to persuade voters and legislatures to impose \nmore restrictions on firearms, they turned to creative \nlitigation that sought massive damages awards and \nsweeping injunctive relief. The lawsuits effectively \nsought to \u201cregulate\u201d the firearms industry \u201cthrough \njudgments and judicial decrees,\u201d threatening \u201cthe \nSeparation of Powers,\u201d \u201cfederalism,\u201d and \u201cState \nsovereignty.\u201d Id. \nEven if unsuccessful on the merits, the activists \nbehind these suits understood that the litigation \nprocess was the punishment: It could inflict massive \n\u201clegal fees\u201d that \u201calone\u201d would be \u201cenough to bankrupt \nthe industry.\u201d House Report, at 11-12. Congress thus \nmade clear that such suits could not even be \n\u201cbrought,\u201d and that any existing suits had to be \n\u201cimmediately dismissed.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(a), (b). \n\n \n8 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit. \nThe Mexican government filed suit in 2021, seeking \nto hold Petitioners\u2014seven major manufacturers, and \none wholesaler\u2014liable for a range of costs it has \nincurred as a result of Mexican drug cartels \ncommitting \ncrimes \nin \nMexico \nusing \nallegedly \nsmuggled firearms that were originally made and sold \nby Petitioners in the United States. The complaint \ndetails the many \u201ccosts\u201d of cartel violence, as well as \n\u201cresources\u201d Mexico has devoted to address that issue. \nPet.App.167a-69a (\u00b6\u00b6 448-49). In particular, Mexico \nhas had to increase spending on \u201chealth care, law \nenforcement and military [] services, criminal justice \nadministration, public assistance,\u201d and similar public \nprograms. Id. \u00b6 447. It has also suffered economic \nlosses, such as diminished property values and a \ndepressed national workforce. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 448-49. \nThe complaint does not allege that Petitioners have \nengaged in any coordinated activity with the cartels, \nbut instead says they have \u201cfacilitated\u201d cartel \nactivities through a multi-step causal chain: (1) As \nfederally licensed manufacturers, Petitioners sell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndistributors \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates; \n(2) \nthose \ndistributors sell the firearms to independent federally \nlicensed dealers in the United States; (3) some of those \ndealers engage in unlawful firearm sales to illicit \nthird-party buyers in the United States; (4) some of \nthose firearms are then illegally smuggled into \nMexico; (5) some of those smuggled firearms end up \nwith the cartels; (6) some of those cartel firearms are \nthen used in violent crimes in Mexico; (7) which then \ninjure people and property in Mexico; (8) thus causing \nharms to the Mexican government. Pet.App.79a-145a. \n\n \n9 \n \n \nAlthough Mexico\u2019s suit admittedly seeks to recover \nfor harms resulting from third-party criminal misuse \nof firearms, its primary argument in the courts below \nwas that PLCAA did not apply at all, because applying \nthe statute to a suit by a foreign sovereign would be \nimpermissibly \u201cextraterritorial[].\u201d Pet.App.233a. As a \nbackup, Mexico argued that its claims fit within some \nof PLCAA\u2019s narrow exceptions based on Petitioners\u2019 \nalleged violations of law. For example, it claimed that \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing of popular semi-automatic \nrifles violated the federal ban on machineguns\u2014a \nclaim it has since abandoned. Id. 102a (\u00b6 308). It also \nalleged Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming of children, judges, journalists, police, and \nordinary citizens throughout Mexico\u201d by facilitating \nunlawful firearm sales in the United States. Id. 12a \n(\u00b6 15). The complaint alleged that Petitioners are \naccomplices to such sales because they sell to \u201cany and \nall Federal Firearms Licensees\u2014anyone with a U.S. \nfederal license to sell guns\u201d\u2014and have failed to do \nenough to stop a subset of these sellers from engaging \nin illicit sales. Id. 79a (\u00b6 228). \nThe complaint acknowledges that the vast majority \nof firearms sales in this country are by law-abiding \ndealers to law-abiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). But \nit alleges that Petitioners are aware that a small \nfraction of the sales made by licensed dealers in the \nUnited States are unlawful. Id. And it says that they \nare further aware that an even smaller fraction of \nthese unlawful sales end up in Mexico, where they join \na sizable supply of other firearms made by other \nfirearm companies (and in other countries) that the \ncartels use to commit crimes. See id. 44a, 158a-59a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n10 \n \n \nThe complaint accepts that Petitioners are distinct \nfrom downstream retail dealers. Those dealers are \nindependent licensed sellers at the end of a three-tier \ndistribution chain. That chain generally runs from \nlicensed manufacturers, who sell to independent \nlicensed wholesalers, who sell to independent licensed \ndealers. Id. 140a (\u00b6\u00b6 378-79). And again, Petitioners \nhere are seven manufacturers, plus one wholesaler \nthat \nprimarily \ncaters \nto \nlaw-enforcement \ndepartments. See id. 16a-21a (\u00b6\u00b6 31-41), 120a (\u00b6 330).  \nMexico nevertheless alleges Petitioners have failed \nto adopt policies that would curb unlawful firearm \nsales by dealers\u2014either by dampening demand or \nbetter policing buyers. These claims all fit the same \nmold. For instance, Mexico faults some Petitioners for \ncontinuing to make what it calls \u201cassault weapons,\u201d or \nthose able to hold \u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of \nwhich Mexico says are popular among criminals. \nPet.App.93a-95a \n(\u00b6\u00b6 280-82). \nLikewise, \nMexico \nblames Petitioners for not imposing their own array of \nrestrictions on downstream retailers or buyers\u2014such \nas requiring them to show some \u201clegitimate need\u201d \nbefore buying an AR-15. Id. 104a (\u00b6 315).  \nBecause Petitioners allegedly know that some \ndownstream dealers make unlawful sales, and \nbecause they have failed to adopt measures to stop \nsuch sales, Mexico alleges that they are an \u201caccessory\u201d \nto those sales. Namely, Petitioners \u201ccontinue[] to \nsupply, support, or assist\u201d those sales\u2014i.e., they have \ncontinued \nlongstanding \nmanufacturing \nand \ndistribution practices\u2014even with the \u201cknowledge\u201d \nthat some criminals have been able to exploit the \nstatus quo, leading to a flow of firearms being \nsmuggled into Mexico. Id. 42a (\u00b6 110); BIO 25-26. \n\n \n11 \n \n \nBased on these allegations, Mexico asserts a wide \nvariety of claims, primarily under Mexican tort law \n(which it insists should apply). Id. 183a-95a (\u00b6\u00b6 506-\n60). The complaint seeks $10 billion in damages. See \nid. \n195a-96a. \nIt \nalso \nrequests \ntransformative \ninjunctive relief, id.\u2014including, among much else, a \nban on \u201cassault weapons\u201d; a ban on firearms capable \nof holding \u201clarge-capacity magazines\u201d; strict limits on \n\u201cmultiple sales\u201d of firearms; and far-reaching \nbackground checks, beyond what American law now \nrequires. See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 132a-34a, 140a-41 \n(\u00b6\u00b6 245, 369, 379-84).  \nC. The Decisions Below. \nThe district court dismissed Mexico\u2019s suit in full. \nThe court first rejected Mexico\u2019s \u201cextraterritoriality\u201d \nargument, holding that PLCAA fully applies to suits \nbrought by foreign sovereigns in American courts \nagainst American firearms companies based on their \ndomestic \noperations \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates. \nPet.App.233a-239a. The district court further held \nthat Mexico\u2019s case is \u201cexactly\u201d the \u201ctype of action\u201d \nPLCAA was passed to prevent, and that the suit had \nto be \u201cimmediately\u201d dismissed. Pet.App.232a-33a. \nThe First Circuit reversed. It agreed with the \ndistrict court in rejecting Mexico\u2019s extraterritoriality \nargument. Id. 293a. But it agreed with Mexico\u2019s \nfallback argument that its claims could nevertheless \nproceed because they satisfied PLCAA\u2019s predicate \nexception. Id. 293a-94a. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nFirst \nCircuit \nheld \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 alleged longstanding business practices \nviolated the federal ban on \u201caiding and abetting\u201d the \nunlawful sale of firearms by independent licensed \n\n \n12 \n \n \ndealers. The court acknowledged that, \u201cof course,\u201d \nMexico did \u201cnot allege defendants\u2019 awareness of any \nparticular unlawful sale.\u201d Id. 305a. But it noted that \nPetitioners \u201ccan identify\u201d the downstream dealers \nthat \u201care responsible for the illegal sales\u201d of firearms \nthat end up in Mexico. Id. 301a. And it quoted this \nCourt\u2019s decision in Twitter that \u201ca secondary \ndefendant\u2019s role in an illicit enterprise can be so \nsystemic that the secondary defendant is aiding and \nabetting every wrongful act committed by that \nenterprise.\u201d Id. 306a (quoting Twitter, 598 U.S. at \n496). The court then held that Petitioners fit that \ndescription, because they \u201coperate at a systemic level, \nallegedly designing, marketing, and distributing their \nguns so that demand by the cartels continues to boost \nsales,\u201d making them complicit in dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales. Id.  \nThe First Circuit also held that the complaint \nsatisfied proximate cause because Petitioners\u2019 alleged \n\u201caiding and abetting the illegal sale of a large volume \nof assault weapons to the cartels foreseeably caused \nthe Mexican government to shore-up its defenses,\u201d \nand to incur related costs. Id. 311a. \nWhile the petition for certiorari was pending, the \ndistrict court dismissed six of the eight defendants for \nlack of personal jurisdiction. Dct.Dkt.220. This Court \nthen granted certiorari. Undeterred, Mexico moved \nthe district court for partial final judgment under \nRule 54(b) so it could appeal that personal-jurisdiction \nruling. That court, however, stayed proceedings to \nawait this Court\u2019s decision. Dct.Dkt.228. \n \n\n \n13 \n \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. To qualify for PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, the \ndefendant\u2019s allegedly unlawful conduct must be \u201ca \nproximate cause\u201d of the plaintiff\u2019s asserted injuries. \nHere, Mexico relies on an eight-step causal chain\u2014\npeppered by independent criminal actors and \nderivative sovereign harms\u2014to try to link the lawful \nproduction and sale of firearms within the United \nStates to the chaos ravaging Mexico courtesy of its \ndrug cartels. If this attenuated theory of liability \nsatisfies proximate cause, that term has no meaning. \nA. PLCAA incorporates the traditional principle \nthat proximate cause means direct cause. And a \ncausal chain is not direct when it is interrupted by an \nindependent act carried out by an independent \nactor\u2014much less multiple independent acts, and even \nless multiple crimes. Accordingly, the general rule is \nthat a company that makes or sells a lawful product \nis not a proximate cause of harms resulting from third \nparties\u2019 independent criminal misuse of that product, \nbecause that independent misuse is the direct cause\u2014\nnot the creation and distribution of the lawful product. \nB. Mexico\u2019s causal chain here is extraordinarily \nindirect. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, crime after crime, spanning an international \nborder, all to link Petitioners\u2019 conduct in this country \nto the mayhem south of the border. That stretches \nproximate cause far beyond anything this Court has \nseen. Indeed, if Mexico can establish proximate cause \nhere, it is impossible to see who cannot\u2014to the peril \nof virtually every industry. But the central function of \nproximate cause is to maintain the floodgates of \nliability. Mexico\u2019s lawsuit would bomb the levees. \n\n \n14 \n \n \nC. Mexico tries to salvage its complaint from its \nmany infirmities, but it cannot escape the attenuated \nnature of its suit. In the main, Mexico tries to cut a \nfew links from its causal chain by arguing that its \nrelevant starting point is not Petitioners\u2019 own \nconduct, but rather the unlawful sale of firearms by \ndownstream dealers. Yet that runs headlong into \nPLCAA\u2019s text, which expressly authorizes claims only \nwhen a firearm company\u2019s own \u201cviolation\u201d of the law \nproximately harmed the plaintiff. And here, that \nalleged violation is aiding and abetting\u2014not any later \noffense. \nBut even if Mexico were right\u2014and the causal \nchain began at unlawful sales by independent \ndealers\u2014it would still fall far short of satisfying \nproximate cause. Even on this framing, some of those \nsales would still have to get illegally smuggled into \nMexico by independent criminals, where some would \nthen illegally end up with the cartels, who then would \nuse some to commit crimes in Mexico, which then \nwould cause financial harms to Mexico\u2019s government. \nSo even on its preferred terms, Mexico\u2019s chain must be \ndragged across an international border and carried by \na cast of independent criminals committing a bevy of \nindependent crimes. However one cuts it, Mexico\u2019s \ntheory of causation is far too indirect. \nII. PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception also requires that \na firearms company violate a firearms-specific \nstatute. Here, Mexico says Petitioners\u2019 longstanding \nand strictly regulated business practices amount to \naiding and abetting every unlawful sale of their \nproducts \nby \nindependent \nfirearms \ndealers \ndownstream. That theory is as wrong as it sounds. \n\n \n15 \n \n \nA. Aiding-and-abetting liability requires culpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., some affirmative act taken for the \npurpose of assisting the commission of a crime. \nTypically, accomplice liability is tied to a specific \nunlawful act. In rare cases, one can be an accomplice \nto an unlawful criminal enterprise\u2014on the hook for \nall its misdoings. But for such sweeping liability to \nattach, the support must be pervasive and systemic. \nManufacturers and suppliers are not guilty of \n\u201caiding and abetting\u201d downstream crimes when they \ndo nothing but make and sell lawful products in the \nordinary course. Every business knows its products \nmay be misused\u2014even criminally so\u2014by customers \ndownstream. But such knowledge has never been \nenough to generate criminal liability, lest the entire \neconomy grind to a halt. Instead, courts have long \nheld that businesses are not accomplices to the \ncriminal misuse of their products unless they take \nsome atypical action for the purpose of assisting a \ncrime. And no court has ever held that the routine \npractices of a lawful industry can constitute the kind \nof pervasive and systemic aid required for a business \nto be categorically liable for all its customers\u2019 crimes. \nB. Mexico has not unearthed a decades-long aiding-\nand-abetting scheme. To start, Mexico admits its suit \nis not tied to any specific unlawful sale\u2014for example, \nit does not allege that any Petitioner sold a particular \nfirearm knowing it would be unlawfully sold or \notherwise misused in some specific unlawful act. \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s theory is premised on Petitioners \nassisting unlawful firearm sellers writ large. Mexico \nthus must allege pervasive and systemic assistance on \nthe part of the firearms industry to substantiate its \naiding-and-abetting claim.  \n\n \n16 \n \n \nThis it cannot do. Mexico\u2019s suit rests on nothing but \nPetitioners\u2019 routine business practices. Indeed, that is \nthe whole point: It is a challenge to the industry\u2019s \nrefusal to go beyond what American firearms laws \nrequire, by adopting policies Mexico thinks would \nstem unlawful downstream sales. But failing to adopt \nmeasures to make others follow the law does not make \none complicit in their illegal actions. And where, as \nhere, a lawful industry simply continues to supply a \nlawful product in an ordinary manner, its decision to \nstay the course cannot turn it into an accomplice.  \nC. Mexico says that its case is different, because \nPetitioners know the identities of some downstream \nbad-actor dealers, and have chosen not to purge them \nfrom the supply chain. But that is just wrong: Again, \nthe complaint does not allege facts showing a single \nPetitioner has knowingly sold a single firearm to a \nsingle dealer actually engaged in illicit sales. But even \nif Petitioners did know the identity of some \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \ndealers \nwho \nsometimes made unlawful sales, failing to take \naffirmative steps to purge those dealers from \ndownstream supply chains would still not make \nPetitioners criminal accomplices\u2014just as failing to \ncut off college-town bars does not make a felon out of \nBudweiser, and failing to purge ISIS-related accounts \nwas not enough for liability in Twitter. When the \nmanufacturer or supplier of a lawful product simply \nputs its product in the general stream of commerce, \nthe aiding-and-abetting statute does not charge that \nbusiness with broadly policing every bad actor who \nmay pick up its products downstream. \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nAMERICAN FIREARMS COMPANIES ARE NOT A \nPROXIMATE CAUSE OF MEXICO\u2019S INJURIES. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nmust show that a firearms company\u2019s illegal conduct \nwas \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of its alleged harms. 15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nMexico \nalleges \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 manufacturing and sale of firearms in the \nUnited States has led to violent cartel crime in \nMexico, ultimately resulting in a variety of costs borne \nby the Mexican government.  \nMexico\u2019s suit falls far short of what proximate cause \ndemands. Proximate cause means direct cause. And \nwhen a causal chain depends on independent acts \ndone by independent actors (let alone criminals), it is \nplainly indirect. The rule has thus long been that the \nmanufacturer or distributor of a lawful product is not \na proximate cause of the product\u2019s independent \ncriminal misuse. And PLCAA incorporated that rule \nfor the very purpose of barring suits like this one. \nA. Proximate Cause Means Direct Cause. \nThe essential demand of proximate cause is a \n\u201cdirect relation between the injury asserted and the \ninjurious conduct alleged.\u201d Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. \nCorp., 503 U.S. 258, 268 (1992). As Justice Holmes put \nit a century ago, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule has long been that \nproximate cause does not permit recovery for an \ninjury that is \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d of a causal chain. \nId. at 271 (quoting S. Pacific Co. v. Darnell-Taenzer \nCo., 245 U.S. 531, 533 (1918)). That traditional \nunderstanding controls under PLCAA. And since \nMexico\u2019s attenuated theory of injury is anything but \ndirect, it is squarely barred. \n\n \n18 \n \n \n1. Proximate cause distinguishes de facto from legal \ncausation. See Pac. Ops. Offshore, LLP v. Valladolid, \n565 U.S. 207, 221-22 (2012). The law does not permit \na \u201cjudicial remedy\u201d for \u201cevery conceivable harm that \ncan be traced to alleged wrongdoing.\u201d Lexmark Int\u2019l, \nInc. v. Static Control Components, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, \n132 (2014). After all, illegal acts always \u201ccause ripples \nof harm [that] flow far beyond\u201d their immediate object. \nBank of America Corp. v. City of Miami, 581 U.S. 189, \n202 (2017). But liability has never followed \u201cwherever \nthose ripples travel.\u201d Id.; see Waters v. Merchants\u2019 \nLouisville Ins. Co., 11 Pet. 213, 223 (1837). As Justice \nScalia colorfully put it, \u201c\u2018for want of a nail, a kingdom \nwas lost,\u2019 is a commentary on fate, not the statement \nof a major cause of action against a blacksmith.\u201d \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 287 (Scalia, J., concurring in the \njudgment). \nFrom many de facto causes, only proximate ones \ncount. And only \u201cdirect\u201d causes are proximate. \nHolmes, 503 U.S. at 268; Babbitt v. Sweet Home \nChapter of Cmtys. for a Great Or., 515 U.S. 687, 732 \n(1995) (Scalia, J., dissenting); 1 Thomas M. Cooley, A \nTreatise on the Law of Torts \u00a7 50, at 108 (4th ed. 1932).  \nIn policing the line between direct and indirect \nharm, this Court has emphasized that \u201cforeseeability \nalone does not ensure the close connection that \nproximate cause requires.\u201d Bank of America, 581 U.S. \nat 202; Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York, 559 U.S. \n1, 12 (2010). \u201cIf one takes a broad enough view, all \nconsequences of a negligent act, no matter how far \nremoved in time or space, may be foreseen. \nConditioning liability on foreseeability, therefore, is \nhardly a condition at all.\u201d Consol. Rail Corp. v. \nGottshall, 512 U.S. 532, 552-53 (1994). \n\n \n19 \n \n \nRather, the \u201cgeneral\u201d rule is that a direct cause is \nlimited to the \u201cfirst step\u201d in a causal chain. Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 139-40. If multiple steps stand in between \nthe conduct and the harm, then the connection \nbecomes too \u201cremote,\u201d \u201ccontingent,\u201d and \u201cindirect\u201d to \nsatisfy basic proximate cause. Hemi, 559 U.S. at 9-10.  \n2. The \u201ccentral question\u201d is thus \u201cwhether the \nalleged violation led directly to the plaintiff\u2019s \ninjuries.\u201d Anza v. Ideal Basic Steel Supply Corp., 547 \nU.S. 451, 461 (2006). Where the causal chain rests on \nindependent acts, the answer is almost always no. See \nAssoc. Gen. Contractors of Cal., Inc. v. California State \nCouncil of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, 532 n.25 (1983). \nIntuitively so. Something is \u201cdirect\u201d when it is \nuninterrupted; and it is \u201cindirect\u201d when \u201cother, \nindependent, factors\u201d punctuate the chain. Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 268-69. So when a causal chain involves \n\u201cseparate actions carried out by separate parties,\u201d it \nlacks continuity, and is thus typically deficient. Hemi, \n559 U.S. at 11; see Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 541 n.46. \nTo be sure, proximate cause sometimes allows for \nmulti-link chains where those links are uninterrupted \nby independent action. A good example is the Lanham \nAct, which allows a company to sue another for false \nadvertisements, which cause reduced sales due to \n\u201cconsumers who are deceived by the advertising.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. Proximate cause is still met \nbecause there is no discontinuity in the chain\u2014i.e., \nthere is no independent intervening act separating the \nunlawful act from the victim\u2019s harms, since no \nconsumer freely chooses to be deceived. Cf. id. at 139-\n40; see Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & Indem. Co., 553 U.S. \n639, 658 (2008) (\u201cno independent factors\u201d in chain).  \n\n \n20 \n \n \nBut absent such direct connections, proximate \ncause does not allow multi-step chains. \u201cA proximate \ncause of an injury is one which, in a natural and \ncontinuous \nsequence, \nwithout \nany \nefficient \nintervening cause, produces the injury.\u201d Dobbs, The \nLaw of Torts \u00a7 201 (2d ed. 2024). The chain must \n\u201cconstitute a continuous succession of events, so \nlinked together as to make a natural whole,\u201d free of \nany \u201cnew and independent cause intervening between \nthe wrong and the injury.\u201d Milwaukee & St. Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 475 (1876). \n3. There is no doubt this traditional rule controls \nunder PLCAA. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133 (the \n\u201c[p]roximate-cause analysis\u201d is shaped by the \u201cnature\u201d \nof the statutory scheme at issue). Congress believed \nthe problem with the suits being filed by U.S. cities \nand others was that they all rested on remote causal \nchains that were too indirect to satisfy proximate \ncause. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7). And it sought to adopt \nthe \n\u201ccommon-sense \ntraditional \nrule \n[] \nthat \nmanufacturers and sellers should not be held liable \nfor the criminal or unlawful misuse of their products.\u201d \nHouse Report, at 6-17; see 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(b)(1). \nIn PLCAA\u2019s text, Congress thus made proximate \ncause an express requirement. For a manufacturer or \nseller to be sued, it must have committed a \u201cviolation\u201d \nthat is \u201ca proximate cause\u201d of the alleged harm. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). When Congress uses a \ncommon-law term in a statute, it \u201cbrings the old soil \nwith it.\u201d Sekhar v. United States, 570 U.S. 729, 733 \n(2013). And with PLCAA, the whole idea was to use \nthis old soil to build up barriers against excessive \nliability. \n\n \n21 \n \n \nAccordingly, Congress made proximate cause a \nthreshold demand of federal law, in order to stop the \n\u201cexpansion of liability\u201d by novel state-law tort suits. 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7); see id. \u00a7 7901(b)(1), (a)(3), (a)(5), \n(a)(8). For any claim to advance, Congress made sure \nit would first have to satisfy the traditional standard \nfor proximate cause as codified in federal law. Cf. \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 132 (collecting laws where this \nstandard applies). Entrenching this fixed standard in \nfederal law provides a bulwark against creative \ninnovations by state courts, and ensures that liability \nremains limited to cases of direct causation, as it has \nfor \u201chundreds of years of the common law.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7901(a)(7). \nTo the extent there is any doubt about how this \napplies in practice, recall Congress passed PLCAA not \nas a prophylactic measure, but as a response to real \nsuits (quite similar to this one). 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7902(b) \n(requiring existing suits be dismissed). And Congress \nspecifically called out those that \u201cbr[o]ke from bedrock \nprinciples of tort law and expose[d] firearm \nmanufacturers to unprecedented and unlimited \nliability\u201d\u2014suits that pressed near-identical claims as \nthose here (but absent the further step of spanning an \ninternational border). House Report, at 11-12 & n.48. \nOn the flipside, Congress also collected cases where \ncourts properly applied proximate cause. Id. at 6-10 \n(citing City of Philadelphia v. Beretta, 126 F. Supp. 2d \n882 (E.D. Pa. 2000)). In sum, Congress agreed that \n\u201cthe relationship between a tortious act and actual \ninjury historically must be direct, not remote\u201d\u2014and \npassed PLCAA so that this traditional rule would \ngovern as a matter of federal law. House Report, at \n13-14 (relying on Holmes). \n\n \n22 \n \n \nB. Mexico\u2019s Injuries Are Indirect. \nMexico\u2019s suit is far more attenuated than the suits \nthat prompted PLCAA in the first place, and does not \ncome close to satisfying traditional proximate cause. \n1. The sheer number of links in Mexico\u2019s causal \nchain is more than enough to defeat proximate cause. \na. Mexico\u2019s causal chain has eight links, punctuated \nby independent acts done by independent actors. To \nrecap: (1) Federally licensed manufacturers sell \nfirearms to federally licensed wholesalers; (2) those \nwholesalers sell to federally licensed dealers; (3) a \nfraction of those dealers engage in unlawful sales; (4) \na fraction of those illegally sold firearms are trafficked \ninto Mexico; (5) a fraction of those trafficked firearms \nend up with the cartels; (6) a fraction of those firearms \nare used by the cartels for crimes; (7) a fraction of \nthose crimes injure people and property in Mexico; \nand (8) Mexico\u2019s government then spends funds to \nrespond to the fallout, causing it fiscal injuries. \nMexico does not deny this causal chain involves the \nfree choices of many third parties: dealers, straw \npurchasers, \ntraffickers, \nsmugglers, \nand \ncartel \nmembers. Mexico also does not allege that any \nPetitioner controls, directs, or coordinates the conduct \nof these third parties. Instead, on Mexico\u2019s own \naccount, all of these choices\u2014the selling, buying, \ntrafficking, \ncrime, \nand \nmore\u2014are \npurely \nthe \nindependent choices of independent actors. \nThis Court has \u201cnever before stretched the causal \nchain\u201d to cover such independent action\u2014and has \nindeed rejected far more modest attempts to do so. See \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11. For instance, in Hemi, New York \nCity tried to bring a RICO suit against an out-of-state \n\n \n23 \n \n \ncigarette seller. Its theory: The seller failed to send \nreports to the state about those it had shipped to (as \nrequired by federal law), which later impaired the \ncity\u2019s ability to collect the taxes it levied on the \npossession of cigarettes, costing it revenue. Id. at 5-6. \nThis Court held that proximate cause was lacking. \nCritically, the \u201cconduct directly causing the harm\u201d\u2014\nthe nonpayment of taxes\u2014\u201cwas distinct from the \n[company\u2019s] conduct\u201d\u2014its failure to transmit certain \nreports. Id. at 11. And in between, \u201cthe City\u2019s theory \nof liability rest[ed] not just on separate actions, but \nseparate actions carried out by separate parties.\u201d Id. \nThat did not work: Since the \u201cCity\u2019s theory of liability \nrest[ed] on the independent actions of third and even \nfourth parties,\u201d it was far too attenuated. Id. at 15; see \nAnza, 547 U.S. at 458-61; Assoc. Gen., 459 U.S. at 542. \nBank of America offers an instructive roadmap too. \nThere, Miami sued two national banks for allegedly \nissuing worse mortgages to certain minority groups, \nwhich prompted greater defaults and foreclosures, \nwhich decreased property values, which all ultimately \nresulted in homeowners paying lower property taxes \nto the city\u2019s government. 581 U.S. at 193-94. \nThe Court reserved the proximate cause question, \nbut Justice Thomas (along with Justices Kennedy and \nAlito) answered it with a resounding no. Miami\u2019s mere \nfour-step chain was \u201cexceedingly attenuated.\u201d 581 \nU.S. at 212 (Thomas, J., concurring and dissenting in \npart). It was riddled by \u201cindependent events,\u201d distinct \nfrom the defendants\u2019 conduct. Id. And those \nindependent acts made Miami\u2019s financial injuries \u201ctoo \nremote\u201d for proximate cause. Id. at 213. \n\n \n24 \n \n \nApplying the same principles, lower courts \nconsistently rejected this type of suit even before \nPLCAA. Cert. Petn. 15-18. Most notably, the Third \nCircuit rejected a suit by Philadelphia alleging that \nthe same longstanding practices by the firearms \nindustry \u201ccreate[ed] and contribut[ed] to [the] \ncriminal use\u201d of firearms in that city. City of \nPhiladelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 277 F.3d 415, \n419 (3d Cir. 2002). The court dismissed, holding the \ncausal chain \u201cfrom the manufacturer to Philadelphia \nstreets\u201d was too \u201clong and tortuous.\u201d Id. at 423. \nThis is a simple case under these precedents. \nMexico\u2019s eight-step causal chain is more attenuated \nthan anything this Court has seen. See Hemi, 559 U.S. \nat 11. It rests on independent act after independent \nact, spanning an international border to boot. And \nevery injury alleged here is the result of one of those \ndistinct actions against a foreign sovereign in a \nforeign land. Each such act alone is enough to sever \nthe causal chain; together, they shatter it. \nb. All the more so, because many of those acts are \ncrimes. Again, the purpose of proximate cause is to \nassign \u201cresponsibility\u201d among possible liable actors. \nDobbs, supra, at \u00a7 198. And when an injury is the \nresult of an independent criminal act, the law assigns \nresponsibility to the criminal\u2014not an upstream party \nwith no control over him. Id. \u00a7 209; see Restatement \n(Second) Torts \u00a7 302B cmts. d-e. Thus, when a causal \nchain relies on an independent criminal act\u2014let alone \nmultiple ones\u2014it virtually never satisfies proximate \ncause. See Hemi, 559 U.S. at 11 (emphasizing how \nintervening cause involved a breach of \u201clegal[] \nobligat[ion]\u201d); see also, e.g., Kemper v. Deutsche Bank \nAG, 911 F.3d 383, 393 (7th Cir. 2018). \n\n \n25 \n \n \nTo be sure, this common law rule has some narrow \nexceptions. When there is a \u201cspecial relationship\u201d\u2014\ne.g., bailor-bailee, caregiver-child, landlord-tenant\u2014\nthen a party may be liable for harms caused by a third \nparty. See Dobbs, supra, at \u00a7 209. The rationale is that \nwhen a party owes a legal \u201cduty\u201d to another to protect \nit against certain harms (which may include criminal \nacts), proximate cause should not stand in the way of \nliability\u2014and must excuse an otherwise intervening \nact. Id.; see, e.g., Moon v. First Nat\u2019l Bank of Benson, \n135 A. 114, 115 (Pa. 1926) (bailor who placed property \nin insufficiently secure place liable after thief stole it). \nBut there is zero \u201cspecial relationship\u201d between \nfirearms companies and sovereigns\u2014let alone foreign \nsovereigns\u2014that obligates the companies to protect \nthem from third-party crimes. District of Columbia v. \nBeretta, U.S.A., Corp., 872 A.2d 633, 640-41 (D.C. \n2005). \u201c[G]un manufacturers are under no legal duty \nto protect citizens from the deliberate and unlawful \nuse of their products.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 425; \nsee House Report, at 7-9. Rightly so: As in any \nindustry, there is no duty for a manufacturer or seller \nof a lawful product to protect others from its criminal \nmisuse. E.g., Stahlecker v. Ford Motor Co., 667 \nN.W.2d 244, 254-57 (Neb. 2003). \nPut together, then, the general rule is clear: The \nmanufacturer or seller of a lawful product is not a \nproximate cause of its independent criminal misuse. \nCity of Chicago v. Beretta, U.S.A., Corp., 821 N.E.2d \n1099, 1136-37 (Ill. 2004); see District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 650-51. Absent some special relationship or \nlegal duty, an independent criminal act breaks the \ncausal chain. The responsible party is the criminal \nwho inflicts the harm\u2014not anyone else. \n\n \n26 \n \n \nThese principles doom Mexico\u2019s theory of causation. \nMexico depends on a legion of third-party criminals: \nBad-actor dealers; illicit buyers; gun traffickers; \nsmugglers; cartel members; etc. Mexico cannot even \nallege the actual number of such actors involved. And \nonce more, Mexico does not allege any Petitioner has \nany control, direction, or relation to these unknown \nand unknowable third parties. Instead, Mexico relies \non crime after crime\u2014by independent criminal after \nindependent criminal\u2014to try to connect Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct to Mexico\u2019s harms. That does not work.  \n2. This Court has also looked to other factors to see \nif a causal chain is too indirect. All cut the same way. \na. One sign that a causal chain is too attenuated is \nthat ascertaining damages and liability would be \nunworkable. Anza, 547 U.S. at 458-60. After all, \u201cthe \nless direct an injury is, the more difficult it becomes to \nascertain the amount of a plaintiff\u2019s damages \nattributable to the violation, as distinct from other, \nindependent, factors.\u201d Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269. When \na downstream injury is the product of multiple \nintertwined factors, that is a telltale sign of \nindirectness. See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135, 140. \nThat is this case in spades. Mexico marshals a \nparade of bad actors\u2014dealers, smugglers, cartels\u2014\nwho drive the bedlam south of the border. But there is \nno way to apportion fault among them, or to isolate \nthe causal role Petitioners play. Mexico admits the \nvast majority of firearm sales in the United States are \nlawful; that most firearms recovered in Mexico were \nnot made or sold by Petitioners; and that Mexico is \nswamped by other firearms from other companies. \nPet.App.44a, 158a-59a (\u00b6\u00b6 119, 434-35, 438). \n\n \n27 \n \n \nThe problem is compounded by the nature of \nMexico\u2019s alleged injuries. Mexico\u2019s principal injuries \nare higher governmental expenditures\u2014on security, \nhealthcare, social services, and the like. BIO 6, 20-21. \nTo determine damages, a court would need to go line-\nby-line through Mexico\u2019s federal budget and assess for \nitself which spending increases are attributable to \nPetitioners, versus the countless other causes that can \ndrive governmental spending in Mexico. That is not \nthe stuff of judicial competency. But it is a flashing \nindicator of a woefully indirect theory of liability. \nb. Another consideration is whether the alleged \ninjuries are direct or derivative. If derivative, there \nare typically \u201cbetter situated plaintiffs\u201d (direct \nvictims) who can bring more appropriate litigation to \naddress any allegedly wrongful action by a defendant. \nHemi, 559 U.S. at 11-12; Holmes, 503 U.S. at 269-70. \nAnd that is clearly the case here: Victims in Mexico \ncan sue the criminals in Mexico who have actually \ninjured them. That is what U.S. courts have said when \nU.S. cities filed analogous suits. Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425. And it is the basic policy judgment \nCongress made in PLCAA. See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5).  \nBy contrast, most if not all of Mexico\u2019s alleged \nharms derive from violence visited on its citizens. But \nthis Court has repeatedly held an \u201calleged harm\u201d is \n\u201cordinarily\u201d too attenuated \u201cif the harm is purely \nderivative of misfortunes visited upon a third person \nby the defendant\u2019s acts.\u201d Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 133. \nThat makes good sense: By definition, a derivative \nharm is (at least) one step removed, making it \nindirect. \n\n \n28 \n \n \nTo that end, the reason a derivative harm flunks \nproximate cause is not because it is unforeseeable. \nDerivative injuries are often predictable. For example, \nit is easy to foresee that shuttering a business through \nillegal action (e.g., extortion) will harm its landlord, \nwho will lose the business\u2019s rent. But it is nevertheless \nblack-letter law that the landlord\u2019s injuries are too far \nremoved to count\u2014lest our tort system become one of \nunlimited liability. See Apple v. Pepper, 587 U.S. 273, \n291 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \nOn Mexico\u2019s view, however, it is hard to see who \ncannot recover. There are plenty of people who suffer \nfollow-on harms from the cartels, including in ways \nmore direct than Mexico\u2014companies lose employees, \nbusinesses lose customers, and yes, landlords lose \nrent. But there is no sound argument that any of those \nparties can come close to satisfying proximate cause. \nSee Bank of America, 581 U.S. at 212-13 (Thomas, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part). And there is no \nreason why the Mexican government is any different. \nC. Mexico\u2019s Contrary Arguments Fail. \nIn opposing certiorari, Mexico barely defended the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s proximate-cause analysis, which \nimproperly \nconflated \nproximate \ncause \nand \nforeseeability. See Pet.App.309a-19a. Instead, Mexico \nraised three main arguments to try to salvage its \ncomplaint \nfrom \nits \nobvious \nproximate-cause \ninfirmities. None persuade. \nFirst, Mexico argues that the relevant criminal \n\u201cviolation\u201d that starts the causal chain is not \nPetitioners\u2019 own conduct, but the \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d involving their products. BIO 15, 22. That is \nwrong. By its terms, PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception \n\n \n29 \n \n \nallows claims \u201cin which a manufacturer or seller of a \nqualified product knowingly violated a State or \nFederal statute applicable to the sale or marketing of \nthe product, and the violation was a proximate cause \nof the harm for which relief is sought.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (emphasis added). This makes clear \nthat \u201cthe\u201d relevant \u201cviolation\u201d is the one committed by \nthe \u201cmanufacturer or seller\u201d being sued\u2014and that \nviolation must be the proximate cause of the injury.  \nHere, Mexico claims that Petitioners violated the \naiding-and-abetting statute. For purposes of the \npredicate exception, the analysis thus turns on \nwhether Petitioners\u2019 alleged violative conduct\u2014i.e., \ntheir routine production and sale of firearms in this \ncountry (which are later resold by bad-actor dealers \nand others)\u2014is a proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s alleged \ninjuries. And as detailed above, the answer is no. \nIn any event, even if the causal chain starts with \nunlawful sales by dealers, those violations still are not \na proximate cause of Mexico\u2019s diffuse harms. Indeed, \nnumerous independent crimes continue to stand \nbetween any unlawful sales in America and Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries abroad: A fraction of those sales must \nfirst be illegally smuggled into Mexico (versus used for \nany other purpose in America); then a fraction of those \nillegally smuggled firearms must be illegally given to \ncartels (versus other users); then a fraction of those \nfirearms must be used to commit violent crimes \n(versus other ends); and then Mexico must choose how \nto spend funds in response, incurring fiscal harms. \nIn short, even on its preferred framing, Mexico\u2019s \ncausal chain still stretches across an international \nborder and is punctuated by multiple independent \n\n \n30 \n \n \ncriminal acts carried out by a series of independent \ncriminals, leading to follow-on injuries suffered by a \nforeign sovereign. No case has ever found proximate \ncause on such a remote chain of events. \nSecond, Mexico insists its multi-link chain should \nbe excused because Petitioners\u2019 conduct is \u201cintegral\u201d \nto the cartels\u2019 activity. BIO 22-23. But that conflates \nde facto causation (the fact that Petitioners are \nindirect suppliers) with proximate causation (whether \nthey are directly responsible for Mexico\u2019s derivative \ninjuries due to cartel violence). As discussed, this \nCourt has allowed multi-link chains only where there \nis no \u201cdiscontinuity\u201d rendering them \u201cindirect.\u201d \nLexmark, 572 U.S. at 140. So in Lexmark, this Court \nallowed a direct competitor of the defendant to sue for \nfalse advertisements that caused it to \u201cautomatically\u201d \nsuffer a loss in sales. Id.; see also Bridge 553 U.S. at \n647-48 (allowing a similar \u201cstraightforward\u201d theory). \nBut as this Court has explained, the defining trait \nin those \u201crelatively unique circumstances,\u201d Lexmark, \n572 U.S. at 140, was the absence of any \u201cindependent \nactions\u201d that would break the causal chain, Hemi, 559 \nU.S. at 15. Here, by contrast, Mexico\u2019s theory is \nsaturated with such independent links. \nThird, Mexico says that PLCAA demands a looser \nversion of proximate cause, because Congress wanted \nsome plaintiffs to be able \u201cto recover for harms caused \nin part by third-party conduct.\u201d BIO 23. But as \nexplained, watering down proximate cause was quite \nliterally the opposite of what Congress sought to do \nwith PLCAA. And in portraying Petitioners\u2019 position \nas foreclosing all potential liability, Mexico shoots at \na strawman. Nobody is saying PLCAA cuts off liability \n\n \n31 \n \n \nfor a company engaged in coordinated criminal \nactivity: If a convicted felon comes into a firearm store \nasking for the best firearm to rob a bank, and the \nseller recommends and furnishes one to assist in the \nrobbery, \nthen \nthat \nthird-party \ncrime \nis \nnot \nindependent from the seller. The seller is criminally \nliable for participating in the crime and is on the hook \nfor \nthe \ndirect \nconsequences. \nSee \n15 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii); 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 922(g). By contrast, \nMexico\u2019s \nalleged \ncausal \nchain \nhere \ninvolves \nindependent criminal activity in which Petitioners \nplayed no role. And that sort of conduct is what defeats \nproximate cause. Indeed, the purpose of PLCAA\u2014and \nthe reason it expressly added a proximate-cause \nrequirement\u2014was to ensure the industry would not \nbe held liable for the independent crimes of third \nparties. But that is exactly what Mexico is trying to \naccomplish here. \nII. PETITIONERS ARE NOT GUILTY OF AIDING AND \nABETTING ANY FIREARMS CRIME. \nTo satisfy PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, a plaintiff \nalso must show that the defendant committed a \n\u201cviolation\u201d of a firearm-specific statute. 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). \nFor \nthis, \nMexico \nclaims \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices violate the \nfederal criminal ban on aiding and abetting illicit \nfirearm sales by downstream dealers. BIO 27. \nImportantly, Mexico does not argue that any \nPetitioner has itself broken any American law, rule, \nor regulation specifically governing the manufacture \nor sale of firearms. Nor does Mexico allege that any \nPetitioner is even \u201caware\u201d of any \u201cparticular unlawful \nsale.\u201d Pet.App.305a. Rather, Mexico maintains that \n\n \n32 \n \n \nPetitioners are accomplices to downstream dealers \nwho choose to sell their firearms illegally, because \nPetitioners are generally aware that some dealers will \nengage in such sales, and Petitioners have failed to go \nbeyond what the American firearms laws require in \norder to counteract those third-party criminal acts. \nThat is not aiding and abetting. A business that \ndoes nothing more than make or sell a product in the \nordinary course is not an accomplice to downstream \nactors who later sell or misuse that product illegally. \nAnd the supplier of a lawful product does not become \na criminal simply because it refuses to take additional \naffirmative steps to stop third parties from using the \nproduct to commit a crime. This Court reaffirmed that \nlongstanding rule in Twitter, and it settles this case. \nA. Aiding and Abetting Requires Culpable \nMisconduct, Not Business As Usual. \nAiding \nand \nabetting \nrequires \nculpable \nmisconduct\u2014i.e., something done for the purpose of \nassisting a criminal offense. But where a business \ndoes nothing more than engage in routine business \npractices\u2014like broadly putting a good to market, or \noffering a general service\u2014it does not become an \naccomplice to independent downstream criminals who \nlater misuse that product, even if the business is \naware such criminal misuse is possible. Something \nmore is needed, lest every industry become liable as \nan accomplice to the misdeeds of its customers\u2014\npunishable by felony. \n1. Aiding and abetting \u201creflects a centuries-old view \nof culpability: that a person may be responsible for a \ncrime he has not personally carried out if he helps \nanother to complete its commission.\u201d Rosemond v. \n\n \n33 \n \n \nUnited States, 572 U.S. 65, 70 (2014). Federal law \nincorporates that view, making accomplices and \nprincipals equally \u201cpunishable.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 2(a). \nAiding and abetting has both an objective and a \nsubjective component. An accomplice must take some \n\u201caffirmative act\u201d to assist a criminal offense, and also \ndo so with the \u201cintent of facilitating the offense\u2019s \ncommission.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. Together, \naiding-and-abetting law requires \u201cthat a defendant \u2018in \nsome sort associate himself with the venture, that he \nparticipate in it as in something that he wishes to \nbring about, that he seek by his action to make it \nsucceed.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting United States v. Peoni, 100 F.2d \n401, 402 (2d Cir. 1938) (Hand, J.)). \nBut the doctrine has strict limits. As for the \nobjective component, \u201cthe concept of \u2018helping\u2019 in the \ncommission of a crime . . . has never been boundless.\u201d \nId. at 488. The law has long distinguished between \nthose who \u201cincidentally facilitate a criminal venture\u201d \nand those who \u201cactively participate in it.\u201d Rosemond, \n572 U.S. at 77 n.8. Thus, \u201cgenerally\u201d\u2014absent some \nlegal duty displacing the ordinary rule\u2014the law \u201cdoes \nnot impose liability for mere omissions, inactions, or \nnonfeasance.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Rather, the \n\u201cconceptual core\u201d of aiding-and-abetting liability is \n\u201cconscious[] and culpable participa[tion].\u201d Id. at 493. \nAs for its subjective component, aiding and abetting \nhas also differentiated awareness from intent. The \n\u201cmere knowledge\u201d that one\u2019s actions may assist a \ncriminal scheme is insufficient. Direct Sales Co. v. \nUnited States, 319 U.S. 703, 711 (1943). A criminal \naccomplice must act with the intent of assisting a \ncriminal offense. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 490. \n\n \n34 \n \n \n2. The type of support required also turns on the \ntheory of liability. \u201c[A]iding and abetting is inherently \na rule of secondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). Thus, the \nheartland case involves intentional aid to a specific \ncrime\u2014a particular, identified wrong. Id. \nIn rare circumstances, a \u201csecondary defendant\u2019s \nrole in an illicit enterprise can be so systemic that the \nsecondary defendant is aiding and abetting every \nwrongful act committed by that enterprise.\u201d Id. at 496; \nsee Halberstam v. Welch, 705 F.2d 472, 488 (D.C. Cir. \n1983). But because this theory of liability effectively \n\u201cblur[s]\u201d the line between \u201cconspiracy liability\u201d and \n\u201caiding-and-abetting liability,\u201d it requires a markedly \ngreater showing. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496. To be on the \nhook for everything an illicit enterprise does, a \ndefendant must provide such \u201cpervasive, systemic, \nand culpable assistance,\u201d to infer a \u201cnear-common \nenterprise\u201d with the primary criminal(s). Id. at 502. \n3. The limits on aiding and abetting are especially \nimportant when it comes to manufacturers and \nsuppliers of lawful goods. After all, almost every \nbusiness knows its products may be misused\u2014\nincluding by criminals: Beer companies know drinks \nwill be sold to minors; car companies know their \nvehicles will be driven recklessly; and pharmaceutical \ncompanies know their medicines will be abused. \nBut \u201caiding-and-abetting liability\u201d has never been \nextended so \u201cfar\u201d as to make \u201cordinary merchants . . . \nliable for [the] misuse of their goods and services.\u201d \nTwitter, 598 U.S. at 489. Courts have regularly held \nthat making or selling a lawful product\u2014even when \naware it may be criminally misused\u2014is not sufficient. \n\n \n35 \n \n \nId. at 488, 501 & n.14. As the United States recently \nput it: Liability does not naturally attach where \u201ca \ndefendant provided only routine business services in \nan ordinary manner, was remote from the unlawful \nact that injured the plaintiff, or is accused of aiding \nand abetting another\u2019s conduct through inaction.\u201d \nAmicus Curiae Brief for the United States, 11-12, \nTwitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (No. 21-1496). \nTo prevent a pall of prosecution being draped over \nthe economy, courts have long drawn an objective line, \ndifferentiating lawful businesses that engage in \n\u201croutine\u201d conduct from those that engage in \u201catypical\u201d \nconduct to help a crime succeed. Camp v. Dema, 948 \nF.2d 455, 459 (8th Cir. 1991) (cited by Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 490-92). Only the latter is the sort of culpable \nmisconduct that establishes accomplice liability. If a \nmerchant is engaged \u201cin the ordinary course of his \nbusiness,\u201d it is not enough that he has a \u201cgeneral \nawareness\u201d that his products may facilitate crimes \ndownstream. Woodward v. Metro Bank of Dallas, 522 \nF.2d 84, 95 (5th Cir. 1975) (cited by Twitter, 598 U.S. \nat 491). Maintaining \u201croutine\u201d business practices is \nthe sort of \u201cpassive\u201d inaction that is treated as \ninnocent rather than innately \u201cculpable\u201d; a business \nmust break from the norm to become guilty as an \naccomplice. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 491.1 \n \n1 See, e.g., Amazon Servs. LLC v. U.S. Dept. of Agric., 109 \nF.4th 573, 581-83 (D.C. Cir. 2024) (providing \u201cgenerally \navailable\u201d service in \u201croutine\u201d manner insufficient for liability); \nUnited States v. Blankenship, 970 F.2d 283, 286-89 (7th Cir. \n1992) (Easterbrook, J.) (noting where \u201c\u2018mere\u2019 sale[s]\u201d end and \nliability \u201cbegin[s]\u201d); SEC v. Wash. Cnty. Util. Dist., 676 F.2d 218, \n226 (6th Cir. 1982) (contrasting \u201ca transaction in the ordinary \ncourse of his business\u201d and one \u201cof an extraordinary nature\u201d). \n\n \n36 \n \n \nAccordingly, when a business puts a lawful good to \nmarket, it does not become an accomplice to that \nproduct\u2019s downstream criminal misuse simply by \ndeclining to take additional affirmative steps to \ncounteract that independent unlawful action. That is, \nto incur liability, it is not enough that a company \nchooses to stay the course and continue routine \npractices; it must engage in some objectively unusual \naction, directed to actually making the crime succeed. \nThat is already a high bar. But the bar gets even \nhigher if the theory of liability is pegged not to aiding \na specific unlawful act (e.g., an illicit sale), but instead \nan unlawful enterprise (e.g., an illicit seller). For this \ntype of enterprise theory, a merchant must go even \nfurther, taking atypical steps in such a systemic and \npervasive fashion that it is jointly liable for all of that \nenterprise\u2019s misdoings. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 496, 502; \nsee Halberstam, 705 F.2d at 487-88. And for that sort \nof categorical liability to attach, the routine practices \nof a lawful industry\u2014untailored to any buyer, \nunparticularized to any transaction\u2014are never \nenough. Such overwhelming assistance must be \ntargeted and deliberate; supplying a lawful product in \na general and ordinary manner is not that. Mexico has \nnever cited any case holding otherwise. Nor could it. \n4. This Court\u2019s decision in Direct Sales Company \nillustrates these principles. That case involved a \ndistributor that directly sold an obscenely large \namount of morphine to a single rural doctor, who was \nobviously engaged in a criminal enterprise by re-\nselling the drugs illegally. 319 U.S. at 705. The \ndistributor was charged with conspiring to violate the \nfederal narcotics laws, and this Court affirmed the \nconviction. Id. at 714-15. \n\n \n37 \n \n \nIn so doing, this Court took pains to distinguish \nroutine versus atypical business activity. It stressed \nthat for liability to attach, it is not enough for a \nbusiness to be aware that its product will be misused: \nThere must be \u201cmore than knowledge, acquiescence, \ncarelessness, indifference, lack of concern.\u201d Id. at 713. \nWhen there is \u201cnothing more on the seller\u2019s part than \nindifference to the buyer\u2019s illegal purpose and passive \nacquiescence in his desire to purchase,\u201d that cannot be \nfodder for a felony. Id. at 712 n.8. \nThe reason the Direct Sales Company could be \ncriminally liable was it strayed far beyond business as \nusual. The distributor sold the doctor such massive \nand atypical amounts of morphine\u2014around 36,000 \npills a year, when the average was about 400\u2014that \nthere was no conceivable lawful explanation for what \nwas going on. See id. at 705-06. The distributor, \nmoreover, also took other affirmative steps to bolster \nhis complicity, like coordinating with the doctor as to \nhow to avoid law enforcement, such as by changing \ntablet sizes. Id. at 707. All told, this sort of obvious, \nprolonged, and direct \u201ccooperation\u201d with a specific \ndrug dealer was more than enough to sustain a \nconviction. Id. at 713. And as this Court has since \nexplained, Direct Sales stands for the proposition that \naccomplice liability attaches when a \u201cprovider of \nroutine services does so in an unusual way.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 502. \nRightly so. Again, the touchstone for aiding and \nabetting is to culpably \u201cparticipate\u201d in a wrongful act \nso as to help \u201cmake it succeed.\u201d Nye & Nissen v. United \nStates, 336 U.S. 613, 619 (1949). In determining \nwhether an ordinary merchant has crossed that line, \nit makes sense to insist on unusual and particularized \n\n \n38 \n \n \nbehavior to distinguish incidental facilitation from \naffirmative \nsupport. \nAbsent \nthis \nobjective \nrequirement, all-too-easy allegations of scienter would \nimperil every business that sells a lawful product that \nis predictably abused by criminals. By contrast, where \nthe merchant is not engaged in business as usual, that \nidentifiable break from the norm can furnish the \nmisconduct needed for liability. Halberstam, 705 F.2d \nat 487-88 (attributing liability to defendant providing \nservices \u201cin an unusual way under unusual \ncircumstances for a long period of time\u201d). \n5. PLCAA incorporates these basic limits on aiding \nand abetting. After all, when the Act was passed, it \nwas \ncommon \nknowledge \nthat \ncriminals \ncould \npurchase firearms from some bad-actor dealers\u2014\nindeed, that was the very premise of the lawsuits \nPLCAA was passed to stop. \nIt was Congress\u2019s judgment, however, that so long \nas manufacturers and sellers followed the many \nfederal, state, and local regulations that directly apply \nto making and selling firearms, they \u201cshould not[] be \n[held] liable for the harm caused by those who \ncriminally or unlawfully misuse [their] products.\u201d 15 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(5). There was not a whisper in \nCongress that the same type of plaintiffs could bring \nthe same type of suits, just by restyling the same type \nof tort allegations in aiding-and-abetting garb. See \nsupra pp. 6-7. \nThe opposite. Congress condemned the \u201cslippery \nslope\u201d these novel suits promised\u2014i.e., the legal, \nsocial, and economic chaos that would follow from \nimposing \n\u201cliability\u201d \non \nevery \n\u201ccompany \n[that] \nmanufactures a legitimate product that is widely and \n\n \n39 \n \n \nlawfully distributed,\u201d who knows that its product may \nbe \u201ccriminally or unlawfully misused\u201d downstream. \nHouse Report, at 23. Countless industries \u201care aware \nthat a small percentage of their products will be \nmisused by criminals.\u201d Id. at 24. But that has never \nbeen enough for liability of any stripe\u2014let alone \ncriminal liability. 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(7), (a)(8). \nThese points bear out in PLCAA\u2019s text and \nstructure. \nFor \ninstance, \nwithin \nthe \npredicate \nexception, the Act provides an example of how a \nsupplier might be liable for aiding and abetting, but \nonly in the context of a particular transaction where \nthe supplier knows that \u201cthe actual buyer\u201d of \u201cthe\u201d \nfirearm \nis \nbarred \nfrom \nhaving \nit. \nId. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(II). Likewise, PLCAA includes a \nseparate exception allowing transferors to be sued if \nthey are convicted of violating 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 924(h), \nwhich prohibits giving someone a firearm \u201cknowing or \nhaving reasonable cause to believe that [it] will be \nused to commit a felony.\u201d 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i). \nThis all reflects the narrow range of suits that \nCongress contemplated: Instances where a firearm \nsupplier knowingly makes an illegal sale to a specific \ncriminal\u2014i.e., where a business engages in atypical \nconduct to assist a particular criminal offense. By \ncontrast, nothing in PLCAA reflects the sort of \nsystemic liability contemplated here, where the \nroutine business practices of manufacturers and \ndistributors would make them responsible for an \nentire class of criminal action. Indeed, if simply \nshowing that a firearms company was aware that a \nsmall fraction of its products would fall into the hands \nof criminals was enough, then the particularized \nprovisions above would be meaningless. \n\n \n40 \n \n \nB. Mexico \nTargets \nOrdinary \nBusiness \nPractices, Not Culpable Misconduct. \nOver the course of this litigation, Mexico has offered \nshifting theories of aiding and abetting. Its complaint \nalleged that Petitioners \u201caid and abet the killing and \nmaiming\u201d of Mexicans by the \u201cdrug cartels.\u201d \nPet.App.12a (\u00b6 15). But in this Court, Mexico has \npressed only the alternative theory embraced by the \nFirst Circuit: Petitioners\u2019 ordinary business practices \nare illegal because they aid and abet unlawful firearm \nsales by downstream independent dealers. BIO 27.  \n1. At the outset, it is important to identify the type \nof liability theory on which Mexico relies. As the First \nCircuit recognized, \u201cthe complaint does not allege \ndefendants\u2019 awareness of any particular unlawful \nsale,\u201d much less that Petitioners did anything to help \nany specific illicit transaction succeed. Pet.App.305a. \nMexico\u2019s case thus falls far outside the heartland of \naiding and abetting, which again is \u201ca rule of \nsecondary liability for specific wrongful acts.\u201d Twitter, \n598 U.S. at 494 (emphasis added). \nInstead, Mexico\u2019s claim is that Petitioners provide \nsuch pervasive support to bad-actor dealers that \nPetitioners are responsible for all of their unlawful \nsales of Petitioners\u2019 products. This is the theory the \nFirst Circuit relied on: Petitioners \u201coperate at a \nsystemic level, allegedly designing, marketing, and \ndistributing their guns so that demand by the cartels \ncontinues to boost sales,\u201d making them accomplices \neven though they do \u201cnot know about any particular \nunlawful sale.\u201d Pet.App.306a. Mexico has now \nadopted this theory. BIO 17, 20, 22-25, 27-28. \n\n \n41 \n \n \n2. To establish such categorical liability, Mexico \nmust allege that Petitioners have provided \u201cpervasive, \nsystemic, and culpable\u201d assistance to the bad-actor \ndealers in the supply chain, for the specific purpose of \naiding their illicit sales. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 502. \nCritically, however, Mexico tries to get over this \nhigh bar with nothing but the routine \u201cbusiness \npractices\u201d Petitioners have followed \u201c[f]or decades.\u201d \nPet.App.139a (\u00b6 376). Mexico concedes that these \npractices \noverwhelmingly \ncater \nto \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). It nevertheless faults \nPetitioners for staying the course because, in its view, \nthey should have taken extralegal steps to better \ncurtail the small fraction of U.S. firearms that end up \nin Mexico. E.g., id. 12a (\u00b6 16), 24a (\u00b6 50). \nIn particular, Mexico\u2019s complaint focuses on three \nbroad \ncategories\u2014design, \nmarketing, \nand \ndistribution. It blames Petitioners for either not \naffirmatively adopting new policies to counteract \nillicit sales, or for not abandoning longstanding \npractices \nthat\u2014while \ndesigned \nfor \nlaw-abiding \nAmericans\u2014criminals have been able to exploit. See \nid. 84a (\u00b6 246: \u201cDefendants do not need legislation in \norder to make these reforms\u201d). \nDesign. Mexico asserts Petitioners \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales by continuing to \n\u201cdesign\u201d what Mexico calls \u201cmilitary-style assault \nweapons.\u201d Id. 93a. For instance, Mexico takes issue \nwith Petitioners making and selling lawful firearms \nlike the AR-15 rifle, and firearms capable of accepting \n\u201clarge-capacity\u201d magazines\u2014both of which Mexico \nsays are popular among criminals. Id. 121a (\u00b6 334); \n96a (\u00b6 288). And Mexico criticizes the industry for not \n\n \n42 \n \n \nadding certain \u201csafety features\u201d it says will dampen \ncriminal interest. E.g., 129a (\u00b6 359) (calling for \u201csmart \nguns\u201d), 131a (\u00b6 365) (same for harder-to-defile serial \nnumbers). \nOf note, Mexico never alleges that any Petitioner \naffirmatively designed these products to aid any \ncriminal activity. Nor would any such claim be \nplausible. The AR-15 is the most popular rifle in the \ncountry; and there are hundreds of millions of \u201clarge-\ncapacity\u201d magazines in America. Moreover, Mexico \nconcedes that all of these arms are perfectly legal \nunder America\u2019s extensive firearm regulations. \nMexico\u2019s charge is that in continuing to produce \nthese firearms\u2014despite knowing criminals desire to \nuse them\u2014the industry has chosen to \u201cactively assist \nand facilitate\u201d unlawful sales. Id. 93a. To avoid \nliability, Mexico says the industry \u201ccould limit their \nsales of these military-style assault weapons to \nmilitary and perhaps some law enforcement units.\u201d \nId. 104a (\u00b6 314). Or it \u201ccould restrict the sale of these \nweapons to purchasers with a legitimate need for \nthem.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 315). Or it \u201ccould make guns [that do] not \naccept [any] high-capacity magazines.\u201d Id. (\u00b6 317). \nBoiled down, Mexico faults Petitioners for \u201cnot\u201d \naltering their longstanding design practices to better \nsuppress the criminal demand for their firearms. Id. \n(\u00b6\u00b6 314-18). \nMarketing. \nMexico \nsays \nthat \nPetitioners\u2019 \nlongstanding marketing practices help boost unlawful \nfirearm sales. It does not allege any Petitioner \nengages in any campaigns tailored to any criminal \nconduct\u2014e.g., touting a new inconspicuous handgun, \nperfect for subway muggings. Instead, Mexico alleges \n\n \n43 \n \n \nPetitioners\u2019 marketing tactics showcase the \u201cfeatures, \nfunctions, and applications\u201d of their firearms in ways \nthat have appealed to criminals\u2014such as by using \nimages of the \u201cmilitary,\u201d \u201claw enforcement,\u201d as well as \n\u201cAmerican flags.\u201d E.g., id. 105a, 127a (\u00b6\u00b6 322, 352). \nMexico implies Petitioners should have stopped \nadvertising their firearms this way once it became \nclear that criminals were attracted to their potential \nmilitary-like uses. In this sense, though, Mexico\u2019s \nmarketing-related claims are just derivative of its \ndesign-related ones. As Chief Judge Saylor explained, \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms \u201cdo exactly what they are \nadvertised to do\u201d: The advertisements Mexico \nidentifies show how these products work in the real \nworld\u2014including how some are used by police. Id. \n255a-59a. Mexico faults Petitioners for showing these \ntrue facts, but that gripe flows entirely from Mexico\u2019s \nview that firearms with these traits should not be sold \nat all (or at least, not to regular Americans). \nDistribution. Finally, Mexico takes issue with the \n\u201cthree-tier distribution\u201d system sanctioned by the \nfederal government. Id. 140a (\u00b6 378). Within this \nsystem, \nfederally \nlicensed \nmanufacturers \nsell \nfirearms \nto \nindependent \nfederally \nlicensed \nwholesalers, who then sell to independent federally \nlicensed dealers\u2014who then sell to the general public. \nHere too, Mexico does not suggest Petitioners set up \nthis system in order to promote unlawful sales. As \nMexico admits, the overwhelming majority of U.S. \nfirearm sales are by law-abiding dealers to law-\nabiding Americans. Id. 44a (\u00b6 119). And nobody even \nhints the industry developed its entire distribution \n\n \n44 \n \n \nframework to cater to an outlier, minute fraction of \nunlawful sales\u2014as opposed to its primary business. \nRather, Mexico\u2019s allegations concern a supposed \nfailure by Petitioners to augment this system with \n\u201cappropriate and prudent distribution practices\u201d that \nMexico thinks will help reduce unlawful firearm sales \ndownstream. Id. 139a-40a (\u00b6 377). Among other \nthings, Mexico insists that manufacturers and \ndistributors should impose \u201cmandatory background \nchecks for secondary gun sales,\u201d require downstream \ndealers to \u201climit[] sales of multiple guns,\u201d \u201csupervise\u201d \nprivate \u201ckitchen-table\u201d sales, set up a system for \nmitigating lost or stolen firearms, and \u201crestrict[]\u201d \nsales of \u201cassault weapons.\u201d See, e.g., id. 83a-84a, 89a-\n90a, 132a (\u00b6\u00b6 245, 264, 269, 369). \nMexico accepts that none of this is required by any \nAmerican firearms law. Instead, it faults Petitioners \nfor having \u201cchos[en] not\u201d to go beyond what those laws \nsay, to \u201ccontrol[]\u201d downstream dealers. Id. 139a-41a, \n104a (\u00b6\u00b6 377-79, 382, 315). \n3. These allegations fall far short of aiding and \nabetting. Mexico\u2019s claim reduces to Petitioners \nengaging in routine business practices while passively \ndeclining to do more to stop independent retailers \nfrom breaking the law. But such inaction does not \nsuffice. As this Court has emphasized, there is a core \ndifference between \u201cfailing to stop\u201d downstream \ncrime, and affirmatively abetting it through active \nparticipation. Twitter, 598 U.S. at 503. And that \nfundamental distinction resolves this issue: A lawful \nsupplier is not an accomplice to every independent \nseller of its good that it fails to make follow the law. \n\n \n45 \n \n \na. Mexico\u2019s complaint is foreclosed by Twitter. \nMexico claims that a \u201cmanufacturer of a dangerous \nproduct is an accessory or co-conspirator to illicit \nconduct by downstream actors where it continues to \nsupply, support, or assist the downstream parties and \nhas knowledge\u2014actual or constructive\u2014of the illicit \nconduct.\u201d Pet.App.42a (\u00b6 110). \nBut that is exactly what Twitter rejected. The \nplaintiffs alleged that the platforms knowingly hosted \nterrorist content for years; that they knew groups like \nISIS depended upon their services for fundraising and \nrecruiting; that they knew how their recommendation \nalgorithms matched terrorist content with interested \npeople; and that the platforms \u201cfailed to implement\u201d \nbasic detection tools that would help weed out this \nproblematic content. See 598 U.S. at 480-82, 498. And \nthe plaintiffs alleged that the platforms refused to \ndepart from their routine practices, because they \n\u201cprofited\u201d from these terrorist accounts. Id. at 482. \nThis Court unanimously held those claims fell short \nof aiding and abetting. Many businesses know their \nproducts will be criminally misused downstream, just \nas the platforms in Twitter knew terrorists were \nmisusing their services. But continuing to sell a good \nor service is mere \u201cpassive assistance,\u201d not \u201cactive \nabetting.\u201d Id. at 499. Staying the course with routine \nbusiness practices is not \u201caffirmative misconduct.\u201d Id. \nat 500. It is instead the sort of \u201cfailure to act\u201d that does \nnot trigger liability. Id. at 500-01. Indeed, any other \nrule would constitute a remarkable expansion of the \ncriminal law\u2014and would task private companies with \na roving mandate to \u201cdiscover[]\u201d and \u201cterminate\u201d any \ncustomers \u201cusing [their] service[s] for illicit ends,\u201d or \nelse risk crippling liability. Id. at 501. \n\n \n46 \n \n \nAs the above makes clear, Mexico does not allege a \nsingle \u201caffirmative act\u201d by Petitioners, performed with \nthe \u201cintent of facilitating\u201d illicit firearms sales by \ndealers. Id. at 490. Instead, Mexico\u2019s complaint rests \nentirely on the American firearms industry refusing \nto depart from routine, existing, and settled business \npractices\u2014be it refusing to scrap certain products \n(like the AR-15), or declining to impose extralegal \ncriteria on downstream retailers (such as limiting \nsales by \u201clegitimate need\u201d). But as explained, when a \nbusiness refuses to depart from the ordinary course\u2014\nwhen \nit \ndeclines \nto \nchange \nits longstanding \npractices\u2014that is precisely the sort of \u201comission[], \ninaction[], or nonfeasance\u201d that has never been \nenough for accomplice liability. Id. at 489. \nAt worst, even in the darkest light, Petitioners are \nportrayed as apathetic to how their products will later \nbe used just so long as they keep selling. This is false, \nbut even if it were true, such behavior\u2014\u201carm\u2019s length, \npassive, and largely indifferent\u201d to whatever the \nactual goals of the buyer may be\u2014is definitionally \ninsufficient for aiding and abetting. Id. at 500-01. \nb. If anything, Mexico\u2019s theory here is even more \nclearly invalid than in Twitter. There, the plaintiffs at \nleast named a specific criminal enterprise (ISIS) and \na specific bad act the defendants supposedly abetted \n(the Reina nightclub attack). Id. at 497-98. But here, \nMexico does not even do that: Its theory is that \nPetitioners have aided and abetted \u201cunlawful firearm \nsales\u201d in this country, writ large. BIO 27. Such a \nsweeping claim is unprecedented. No court has ever \nheld that an industry can aid and abet a class of crime \nwithout even naming the actual bad acts or actors \nbeing aided. \n\n \n47 \n \n \nIn addition, unlike in Twitter, all of the downstream \n\u201ccriminals\u201d that Petitioners are supposedly aiding and \nabetting are federally licensed firearm dealers. Under \nfederal law, the Attorney General is responsible for \ndetermining who should be licensed to sell firearms. \n18 U.S.C. \u00a7 1923. If any dealer were conspicuously \nmaking unlawful sales, then it presumably would be \nprosecuted, or at minimum federal authorities would \nrevoke its license. When the federal government \nchooses not to do so, Petitioners cannot be readily \nblamed for selling to those dealers licensed to buy. \nIndeed, it would be extraordinary to say that \nPetitioners can be held liable for making routine sales \nof lawful products to such federally approved entities. \nIn short, Mexico has not uncovered what every U.S. \ngovernmental agency has missed: America\u2019s firearms \nindustry has not been criminally aiding and abetting \nunlawful firearms sales in broad daylight for decades. \nC. Knowing Some Downstream Sellers \nMake Unlawful Sales Does Not Make \nPetitioners Criminal Accomplices. \nMexico\u2019s sole response is that its complaint can be \nfairly read to allege that Petitioners know the \nidentities of some licensed dealers downstream that \nengage in unlawful sales\u2014and that Petitioners are \nthus liable for failing to purge them from firearms \ndistribution networks. BIO 26-30; see Pet.App.301a. \nThis argument fails twice over. For one, the complaint \ndoes not plausibly allege Petitioners know specific \ndealers that are making unlawful sales. And \nregardless, such mere knowledge would not trigger \nliability. \n\n \n48 \n \n \nFirst, Mexico has not alleged sufficient facts to \nplausibly show that any Petitioner sold firearms to \nany dealer that it knew would sell them unlawfully. \nAs noted, all but one of the Petitioners are \nmanufacturers, who are not alleged to sell to retailers \nat all. Thus, at best, Mexico\u2019s claim is that the \nmanufacturer Petitioners should stop independent \ndistributors from selling to some downstream dealers. \nAnd as for the one Petitioner that is a distributor, the \ncomplaint does not allege any facts showing it \nknowingly sold to any unlawful dealer.  \nMexico points to public information about some \nfederally licensed dealers whose firearms have been \nrecovered at crime scenes\u2014along with \u201ctrace requests\u201d \nshowing some sold a \u201cdisproportionat[e]\u201d number of \nfirearms used in crimes. BIO 5-6, 28-29. But as other \ncourts have held, alleging that a \u201clicensed distributor \nor dealer\u201d sold firearms later used in crimes does not \nstate a plausible claim that the distributor or dealer \n\u201chas committed an illegal act.\u201d Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424 n.14 (rejecting similar argument on motion to \ndismiss); see Hamilton v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 96 \nN.Y.2d 222, 237-40 & n.8 (N.Y. 2001) (\u201cATF \nemphasizes that the appearance of [a dealer] . . . in \nassociation with a crime gun or in association with \nmultiple crime guns in no way suggests that [it] . . . \nhas committed criminal acts\u201d). After all, most \nfirearms used in crimes were sold lawfully, and then \nmisused later. See, e.g., U.S. Department of Justice, \nSource and Use of Firearms Involved in Crimes: \nSurvey of Prison Inmates 2016, at 1 (2019), \nhttps://bjs.ojp.gov/document/suficspi16.pdf. \nAnd \nwhere the allegations are merely \u201cconsistent with\u201d \nunlawful conduct, but there are still \u201cmore likely \n\n \n49 \n \n \nexplanations,\u201d the complaint does not \u201cplausibly \nestablish\u201d a violation. Ashcroft v. Iqbal, 556 U.S. 662, \n681 (2009).  \nHere, the obvious \u201cmore likely explanation\u201d is that \nthe identified federally licensed dealers are not \nknowingly engaged in unlawful sales, but simply that \nsome firearms they sell are later misused. Otherwise, \nif such public information were enough to know they \nwere making unlawful sales, the federal government \npresumably would not continue to license them. \nSecond, even if Petitioners did know that some \nlicensed downstream dealers had unlawfully sold \ntheir products, that would not make them accomplices \nfor the same reason as in Twitter: Petitioners are \nengaged in nothing more than routine business \npractices, and their relationship with independent \ndealers is, at worst, \u201carm\u2019s length, passive, and largely \nindifferent.\u201d Twitter, 598 U.S. at 500. If the rule were \notherwise, every industry\u2014from beer to cars to \nknives\u2014would be on the hook for the predictable \nmisuse of its product. \nIndeed, Twitter itself was premised on the \nallegation the platforms knew terrorists were using \ntheir services. The complaints emphasized how easy \nit was for people to find ISIS-related content on those \nsites; and plaintiffs specifically alleged the platforms \neither knew of certain terrorist accounts, or refrained \nfrom taking simple steps to purge them. Id. at 481-82. \nEven so, accomplice liability does not follow from a \nbusiness\u2019s failure to \u201cterminate customers after \ndiscovering that the customers were using [their] \nservice[s] for illicit ends.\u201d Id. at 501. For liability to \nattach, something more is required than \u201cknowing \n\n \n50 \n \n \nthat the wrongdoers were using [one\u2019s] services and \nfailing to stop them.\u201d Id. at 503. There must be some \nadditional affirmative culpable act taken with the \nactual intent of facilitating the crime itself. Id. at 499-\n503. Routine business practices are not enough. \nAt bottom, when the maker or supplier of a lawful \nproduct places it into the general stream of commerce, \nthat business is not charged with purging all \ncriminals who may be waiting along the banks. And \nthe passive failure to do so is \u201cinsufficient\u201d to give rise \nto accomplice liability. Id. at 503. Responsibility for \nany criminal acts by those who misuse the product \nrests with those criminal actors themselves\u2014not the \nupstream manufacturers or sellers. Id. \nCONCLUSION \nThe First Circuit\u2019s decision should be reversed. \n \n \n \n\n \n51 \n \n \nNovember 26, 2024 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nANDREW E.

          "task_beliefs": "1.  **Procedural Status Confirmed: Merits Stage:** My belief that the Supreme Court has **granted certiorari** is now solidified. The previous observation of a future-dated merits reply brief was a powerful signal, and this internal reasoning phase confirms my interpretation. The task has definitively shifted from predicting the cert outcome to the original goal: **predicting the merits outcome** of the case.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Confidence (Stable but Focused):**\n    *   **Certiorari Prediction:** My prediction that certiorari has been granted is at **high confidence**. This question is now considered resolved.\n    *   **Merits Prediction:** My confidence in the merits outcome remains **low to moderate**. This `THINK` step has clarified the source of this uncertainty: the Court's decision to grant review is ambiguous. It could signal an intent to reverse the First Circuit (favoring the gun manufacturers) by finding their conduct is not \"aiding and abetting\" under `Taamneh`, or it could signal an intent to affirm the First Circuit and establish a clear standard for corporate liability in similar contexts. The path to increasing confidence is now clear: analyzing the merits briefs.\n\n3.  **Arguments Reframed (Merits Context):** The core arguments are now firmly situated in the merits context.\n    *   **Petitioners (Gun Manufacturers):** Their central claim will be that the First Circuit's interpretation of the PLCAA's \"predicate exception\" and its application of `Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh` are incorrect. They will argue their general business practices do not constitute the \"affirmative,\" \"intentional\" aiding and abetting required for liability.\n    *   **Respondent (Mexico):** Their central claim will be that the manufacturers' specific marketing, design, and distribution choices, when viewed in aggregate, knowingly and substantially assisted illegal gun traffickers, thus satisfying the `Taamneh` standard and falling within the PLCAA's exception.\n\n4.  **Core Legal Tension (Merits Focus):** The central conflict is confirmed: **Do the manufacturers' alleged actions constitute \"affirmative,\" \"intentional\" aiding and abetting under `Taamneh`, or are they merely \"routine business practices\" insulated from liability by the PLCAA?** My next step, acquiring the petitioners' main brief on the merits, is designed to directly address this question by revealing their most developed legal reasoning.\n\n5.  **Knowledge Consolidation & Next Steps:** I have a confirmed timeline of the cert-stage briefing and a strong inference about the case's progression to the merits stage. The primary uncertainty has successfully shifted from *procedure* to *substance*. The immediate, highest-value action is to acquire and analyze the \"Brief for Petitioners\" on the merits, which will provide the foundational arguments for the Court's final decision.",
          "design_beliefs": "1.  **Core Principle: \"Docket Entries are Predictive Signals\" (Confirmed):** The docket is a primary source of intelligence, not just a record. The sequence and titles of filings are predictive of a case's trajectory. This principle, learned from the previous observation, is now a stable part of my methodology.\n\n2.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model (Confirmed):** My two-stage model (Certiorari vs. Merits) is robust. The ability to distinguish between documents like \"Reply to Brief in Opposition\" (cert stage) and \"Reply Brief for Petitioners\" (merits stage) is essential for accurately tracking case progression.\n\n3.  **Heuristic: \"Verify Procedural Stage First\" (Confirmed):** This remains a critical heuristic. The most reliable method is a full analysis of the docket, which provides ground truth that can override or clarify narratives found within individual documents.\n\n4.  **Heuristic: \"Analyze Surprising Results\" (Confirmed):** The previous observation of an anomalous, future-dated document was the key to the recent breakthrough. This reinforces the principle that investigating observations that contradict the current model is a primary driver of learning and self-correction.\n\n5.  **Search Strategy Refinement (Precision):** My search strategy has evolved. I now understand the importance of using precise, formal document titles to target specific filings at different litigation stages. This increases efficiency and reduces the chance of misinterpretation.\n\n6.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Self-Correct\" Phase (Upgraded to Core Principle):** This observation, being a `THINK` action itself, provides powerful validation for its role in the DBOED cycle. It is not a passive step but an **active phase of synthesis, strategic re-orientation, and planning.** It is the mechanism by which the agent consciously assesses its belief state, confirms major updates, identifies the most salient remaining uncertainties, and plans the next action to maximize information gain. This confirms that strategic pauses for internal reasoning are essential for efficient and accurate belief updating."

The respondent's brief will either confirm this prediction (if their rebuttal is weak) or fundamentally challenge it (if they successfully distinguish `Taamneh`), leading to a massive update in my posterior belief. The Task EIG is therefore extremely high (0.9). For design, this action is a direct and crucial test of my 'Dialogue of Litigation' model and the new 'Identify the Cornerstone Precedent' heuristic. Confirming that the respondent's brief is a direct rebuttal to the petitioner's cornerstone argument will strongly validate this strategic approach for future cases, yielding a high Design EIG (0.7).",

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.  See, e.g., Soto v. Bushmaster Fire-\narms Int\u2019l, LLC, 202 A.3d 262, 325 (Conn. 2019), cert. \ndenied sub nom. Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, 140 S. \nCt. 513 (2019) (mem.); Smith & Wesson Corp. v. City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d 422, 432-435 (Ind. Ct. App. 2007), \npetition for review denied, 915 N.E.2d 978 (Ind. 2009) \n(table); Williams v. Beemiller, Inc., 100 A.D.3d 143, \n148, 150-151 (N.Y. App. Div. 2012), amended by 103 \nA.D.3d 1191 (N.Y. App. Div. 2013); New York v. Arm \n\n9 \nor Ally, LLC, No. 22-CV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL \n756474, at *11-12 (S.D.N.Y. Feb. 23, 2024), interlocu-\ntory appeal filed, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. Mar. 26, 2024), \nmotion to certify interlocutory appeal granted, No. 22-\nCV-6124 (JMF), 2024 WL 2270351 (S.D.N.Y. May 20, \n2024); Minnesota v. Fleet Farm LLC, 679 F. Supp. 3d \n825, 831-832, 841-842 (D. Minn. 2023); Brady v.\nWalmart Inc., No. 8:21-CV-1412-AAQ, 2022 WL \n2987078, at *8-10 (D. Md. July 28, 2022); Prescott v.\nSlide Fire Sols., LP, 410 F. Supp. 3d 1123, 1138-39 (D. \nNev. 2019). \nC. Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n63: 20240703141249275_23-114120Hogan20Lovells20CoS.json (score: 0.435)\nEst. :4+ \nWILSONOES \nPRINTING \n(a, INC. \nE-Mail Address: \nbriefs@wilsonepes.com \nWeb Site: \nwww.wilsonepes.com \nNo. 23-1141 \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al., \nPetitioners, \nv. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE \n1115 H Street, N.E. \nWashington, D.C. 20002 \nTel (202) 789-0096 \nFax (202) 842-4896 \nI HEREBY CERTIFY that on July 3, 2024, three (3) copies of the BRIEF IN OPPOSITION in the \nabove-captioned case were served, as required by U.S. Supreme Court Rule 29.5(c), on the \nfollowing: \nNOEL J.

Rev. 653 (2016) ....................................... 32 \n\n(1) \nIN THE\nSupreme Court of the United States \n_________ \nNo. 23-1141 \n_________ \nSMITH & WESSON BRANDS, INC., et al.,  \nPetitioners, \nV. \nESTADOS UNIDOS MEXICANOS, \nRespondent. \n_________ \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to the  \nUnited States Court of Appeals  \nfor the First Circuit \n_________ \nBRIEF IN OPPOSITION \n_________ \nINTRODUCTION \nTo hear Petitioners and their amici tell it, the First \nCircuit held that gun manufacturers may be liable for \nnegligence and public nuisance merely because they \nknow that their guns are trafficked to Mexico, upend-\ning settled law and creating an existential threat to \nthe gun industry.  That is not what the Government \nof Mexico alleged; it is not what the court below held; \nand it is not what will result from this preliminary de-\ncision. \n\n2 \nHere are the actual facts:  Mexico\u2019s Complaint al-\nleged that\u2014far from mere knowledge or passive ac-\nceptance\u2014Petitioners deliberately chose to engage in \nunlawful affirmative conduct to profit off the criminal \nmarket for their products.  The First Circuit held, at \nthe motion-to-dismiss stage, that Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nplausibly alleged both that Petitioners deliberately \naided and abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to pur-\nchasers supplying brutal cartels in Mexico and that \nMexico suffered injuries that Petitioners\u2019 actions prox-\nimately caused.    \nAs for consequences: A long road lies between the \nFirst Circuit\u2019s decision and a final judgment.  The dis-\ntrict court will resolve other asserted grounds for dis-\nmissal\u2014including lack of personal jurisdiction and \nfailure to state a claim under state law\u2014that it did \nnot previously address.  After discovery will come \nsummary judgment, then potentially trial, then ap-\npeal.  Petitioners\u2019 challenges are best addressed on a \ndeveloped factual record, if it proves necessary to ad-\ndress them at all.  That is why this Court routinely \ndenies petitions seeking review of a suit at such an \nearly stage. \nThe petition also satisfies none of the certiorari cri-\nteria. Petitioners\u2019 first question does not present a \nsplit. Petitioners do not identify a single case that \nbreaks with the decision below on the meaning of the \nproximate-cause requirement in the Protection of \nLawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA)\u2019s predicate \nexception.  Petitioners muster only cases decided be-\nfore the PLCAA\u2019s enactment, under various state-\ncommon-law proximate-cause doctrines, and on less \negregious and less detailed allegations than those \n\n3 \nhere. Different courts applying different laws to dif-\nferent facts reaching different conclusions is not a \nsplit.  And Petitioners do not even try to argue that \nthe court of appeals\u2019 decision on their second question \npresented\u2014aiding and abetting\u2014splits with any\nother decision; after all, Petitioners\u2019 theory is that the \ndecision below broke with Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, \n598 U.S. 471 (2023), which is barely a year old.   \nPetitioners\u2019 arguments on the merits fare no better. \nPetitioners complain that the decision below failed to \nconsider factors other than foreseeability in holding \nthat the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause re-\nquirement was satisfied.  But the court of appeals con-\nsidered every proximate-cause principle Petitioners \ninsist it ignored.  See Pet. App. 301a-319a.  As for Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 second question presented:  Petitioners\u2019 aid-\ning-and-abetting argument rests on what the First \nCircuit accurately described as a \u201cfundamental mis-\nunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at 300a-301a.  \nMexico is not seeking to hold Petitioners liable for \nmere passive indifference to the trafficking of their \nfirearms, but for their affirmative and intentional con-\nduct that increases their profits by enabling and facil-\nitating unlawful firearms sales to cartel-linked traf-\nfickers.  This case is as different from Twitter as guns \nare from tweets.   \nThe petition should be denied. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Mexico\u2019s Lawsuit  \nThe cartels in Mexico are transnational criminal or-\nganizations heavily involved in the drug trade.  Pet. \nApp. 9a, 12a.  The cartels are brutally violent; they \nhave killed thousands of civilians across Mexico and \n\n4 \nregularly clash with the Mexican military and federal \npolice.  Id. at 12a, 169a-170a, 172a-173a. \nThe cartels\u2019 power derives largely from their fire-\npower\u2014much of which comes from Petitioners.  Gun \ndealers in the United States are a primary source of \nfirearms for the cartels.  Id. at 7a.  Unable to source \nfirearms in Mexico\u2014Mexico has strong domestic gun \nlaws and only one gun store, id. at 146a-148a\u2014traf-\nfickers arming the cartels have flocked to the United \nStates for decades, id. at 43a-71a, 121a-125a. \nPetitioners\u2019 firearms are particularly popular \namong the cartels; between 342,000 and 597,000 of \nPetitioners\u2019 weapons are trafficked into Mexico every \nyear.  Id. at 159a.  Nearly half of all firearms recov-\nered at Mexican crime scenes are manufactured by \nPetitioners.  Id. at 158a-159a.   \nThe most popular method by which the cartels ob-\ntain firearms across the border is through \u201cstraw pur-\nchasers\u201d\u2014third parties buying guns for the cartels\u2014\nwho purchase firearms at federally licensed firearms \ndealers.  Id. at 29a, 81a-85a.  Straw purchasing is a \nfederal crime for the purchaser and for dealers who, \namong other things, have reasonable cause to believe \nthe purchaser is buying guns to be trafficked.  Id. at \n28a-29a, 84a-85a.   \nThe flood of Petitioners\u2019 firearms from sources in the \nUnited States to cartels in Mexico is no accident.  As \nthe Complaint sets forth in detail, it results from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 knowing and deliberate choice to supply \ntheir products to bad actors, to allow reckless and un-\nlawful practices that feed the crime-gun pipeline, and \nto design and market their products in ways that Pe-\ntitioners intend will drive up demand among the car-\ntels.   \n\n5 \nNinety percent of the guns used in crimes are sold \nby a known subset of dealers.  Id. at 44a.  And the \ncrime-gun pipeline could be curtailed if those dealers \nwere not supplied and were required to sell guns \nsafely.  This is no closely held secret; as far back as \n2001, the United States Department of Justice urged \nPetitioners to stop supplying those high crime-gun-\nsellers, and to require their dealers to use safe sales \npractices.  Id. at 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners did noth-\ning.  Id. at 13a.   \nOver a decade ago, public reporting \u201cidentified by \nname 12 dealers that sold the most guns recovered in \nMexico.\u201d  Id. at 44a.  And in the years since, many \ngovernment reports, academic reports, and news arti-\ncles have documented in detail the rampant traffick-\ning from sources in the United States to Mexico.  Id. \nat 50a-52a. Trace requests from the Bureau of Alco-\nhol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives\u2014reports that \ntrack firearms collected at crime scenes back to their \nsource, id. at 36a\u2014identify the firearms that Petition-\ners \u201csell to specific distributors and dealers [that] are \nbeing recovered at crimes scenes in Mexico,\u201d id. at \n46a.  The Complaint alleges dozens of specific inci-\ndents of dealers unlawfully selling Petitioners\u2019 fire-\narms to cartel-linked traffickers.  Id. at 54a-71a.  And \nthe cartels\u2019 use of Petitioners\u2019 weapons to commit hei-\nnous acts of violence has been widely reported.  Id. at \n71a-78a.  \nThe Complaint alleges that Petitioners intentionally \nfoster this trade.  See, e.g., id. at 12a, 139a-140a, 185a-\n186a.  They supply dealers that are known to engage \nin unlawful sales.  Id. at 43a-50a, 54a-71a.  Even \nwhen dealers conspire with and advise cartel traffick-\ners on how to evade law enforcement, see id. at 55a-\n\n6 \n56a, Petitioners choose to supply them, id. at 71a.  Pe-\ntitioners also have \u201cdouble[d] down\u201d on sales practices \nthey know are favored by the cartels.  Id. at 80a.  And \nthey have resisted measures that would make it \nharder for cartel traffickers to access firearms in this \ncountry.  Id. at 131a-139a.  For example, Petitioner \nSmith & Wesson reneged on a 2000 federal settlement \nagreement addressing the same unlawful practices \ncartels use to get weapons. Id. at 13a, 36a, 132a-135a.  \nIn light of the types of firearms being trafficked into \nMexico, as well as the extent of that trafficking, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 marketing and design choices similarly reflect \nan intentional effort to sustain the illegal firearms \ntrade into Mexico.  Id. at 93a-131a.  Petitioners mar-\nket firearms to intentionally cater to cartel demand, \nsuch as Petitioner Colt\u2019s Mexico-themed pistols; one, \nthe \u201cEmiliano Zapata 1911\u201d pistol, is engraved with \nthe Mexican revolutionary\u2019s dictum: \u201cIt is better to die \nstanding than to live on your knees.\u201d  Id. at 75a.  It is \na particular favorite of the cartels.  Id.\nThe intentional flow of firearms from Petitioners to \ncartels in Mexico, see, e.g., id. at 24a, has directly \nharmed Mexico.  Mexico \u201chas had to spend vast funds \non a wide range of services to fight\u201d this unlawful traf-\nficking, including for increased law enforcement and \nmilitary services.  Id. at 167a.  Scores of Mexican fed-\neral police and military servicemembers have been \nkilled by weapons trafficked from the United States.  \nBetween 2006 and 2021, \u201cguns were used to kill at \nleast 415 members of the Mexican Federal police or \nNational Guard,\u201d and the \u201cvast majority of these guns \nwere trafficked from the U.S.\u201d  Id. at 172a.  Over a \nsimilar timeframe, \u201cU.S.-origin guns were used to kill \n25 members of the Mexican military and to wound an-\nother 84.\u201d  Id.  U.S.-origin guns also were used to \n\n7 \ncause tens of millions of dollars in damage to Mexican \nmilitary aircraft and vehicles in cartel-linked vio-\nlence.  Id. at 173a.  Petitioners manufactured and \nmarketed many of those guns.  See id. at 172a-173a.  \nAnd while Mexico has tried to combat this unlawful \ntrafficking, id. at 150a-151a, its considerable efforts\u2014\nand those of the United States\u2014have not stanched the \nflow of guns into its territory. \nB. The Protection of Lawful Commerce in \nArms Act  \nCongress enacted the Protection of Lawful Com-\nmerce in Arms Act (PLCAA), 15 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7901-7903, \nto preclude \u201cthe possibility of imposing liability on an \nentire industry for harm that is solely caused by oth-\ners.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7901(a)(6). Congress provided that \ncivil actions against firearms manufacturers or sellers \nfor relief \u201cresulting from the criminal or unlawful mis-\nuse of a qualified product by the person or a third \nparty,\u201d id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A), \u201cmay not be brought in any \nFederal or State court,\u201d id. \u00a7 7902.\nThe Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act \ndoes not, however, protect unlawful commerce in \narms.  To that end, the PLCAA contains several enu-\nmerated exceptions.  See id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  One \nexception, the \u201cpredicate exception,\u201d permits \u201cac-\ntion[s] in which a manufacturer or seller\u201d of firearms \nitself \u201cknowingly violate[s] a State or Federal statute \napplicable to the sale or marketing\u201d of firearms, where \nthe \u201cviolation was a proximate cause of the harm for \nwhich relief is sought.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  This ex-\nception specifically excludes from the PLCAA\u2019s bar \n\u201cany case in which the manufacturer or seller aided[] \n[or] abetted\u201d the sale of a firearm \u201cknowing, or having \nreasonable cause to believe, that the actual buyer * * * \n\n8 \nwas prohibited from possessing or receiving\u201d it.  Id.\n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)(I).  \nThe PLCAA\u2019s sponsors and supporters confirmed at \nthe time of the Act\u2019s passage what the statute\u2019s text \nspecifies:  The PLCAA allows firearms manufacturers \nto be held liable for their own tortious or unlawful con-\nduct.  The Act\u2019s chief Senate sponsor, Senator Larry \nCraig, emphasized that the PLCAA \u201cdoes not protect \nfirearms or ammunition manufacturers, sellers, or \ntrade associations from any other lawsuits based on \ntheir own negligence or criminal conduct.\u201d 151 Cong. \nRec. S9061, S9099 (daily ed. July 27, 2005).  Other \nsponsors concurred.  151 Cong. Rec. S9077 (daily ed. \nJuly 27, 2005) (Sen. Orrin Hatch explaining that \u201cthis \nbill carefully preserves the right of individuals to have \ntheir day in court with civil liability actions where \nnegligence is truly an issue\u201d); 151 Cong. Rec. S8911 \n(daily ed. July 26, 2005) (Sen. Jeff Sessions explaining \nthat \u201c[m]anufacturers and sellers are still responsible \nfor their own negligent or criminal conduct.\u201d). \nIn the decades since the PLCAA\u2019s passage, courts \nhave regularly permitted civil-liability actions against \nfirearms manufacturers and dealers to proceed be-\nyond the motion-to-dismiss stage when the plaintiffs \nhave plausibly pleaded facts consistent with the pred-\nicate exception.

Procedural History  \nMexico sued Petitioners in 2021 for their unlawful \nparticipation in firearms trafficking to the cartels. \nPet. App. 1a-197a.  In a Complaint spanning 135 \npages and replete with detailed factual allegations, \nMexico asserted claims for negligence, public nui-\nsance, defective condition of the products, negligence \nper se, gross negligence, unjust enrichment, and res-\ntitution, explaining that Petitioners\u2019 conduct aided \nand abetted the unlawful sale of firearms to the car-\ntels, triggering the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  Id.\nat 183a-195a.  Mexico sought damages for its injuries \ncaused by Petitioners\u2019 conduct, as well as injunctive \nrelief.  Id. at 195a-196a.    \nPetitioners moved to dismiss Mexico\u2019s Complaint on \nmultiple grounds.  They argued that Mexico lacked \nArticle III standing; that the PLCAA barred the suit; \nthat Mexico\u2019s state-common-law counts failed to state \na claim; and that the court lacked personal jurisdic-\ntion over several Petitioners.  D. Ct. Dkt. Nos. 57, 59, \n61, 63, 65, 67, 71, 72, 73; Pet. App. 224a.  The district \ncourt concluded that Mexico had standing but dis-\nmissed the Complaint, concluding that none of the \n\n10 \nPLCAA\u2019s exceptions applied.  Pet. App. 224a, 240a-\n251a.  The court did not reach Petitioners\u2019 other argu-\nments.  Id. at 224a, 251a n.13.1\nThe court of appeals reversed the district court\u2019s \nPLCAA holding, concluding that Mexico had plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct satisfied the predi-\ncate exception.  Id. at 293a-319a.  As the First Circuit \nexplained,  \n[D]efendants do not contend that the complaint \nfails to allege widespread sales of firearms by \ndealers in knowing violation of several state \nand federal statutes.  Nor do defendants dis-\npute that the predicate exception of section \n7903(5)(A)(iii) would apply if Mexico were to \nprove that a defendant aided and abetted any \nsuch violation.  Instead, defendants contend \nthat even for pleading purposes the complaint \nfails to allege facts plausibly supporting the \ntheory that defendants have aided and abetted \nsuch unlawful sales.  \nId. at 299a-300a.  The First Circuit disagreed with Pe-\ntitioners on that score, concluding that Mexico had ad-\nequately alleged that Petitioners\u2019 conduct constituted \naiding and abetting, and that Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct had proximately caused damage to Mexico.  Id. \nat 299a-306a, 309a-319a.   \nAfter surveying Mexico\u2019s allegations, the court first \nconcluded \u201cthat by passing along guns knowing that \n1 Mexico also asserted claims under the Connecticut Unfair \nTrade Practices Act and the Massachusetts Consumer Protec-\ntion Act.  Pet. App. 191a-194a.  The district court dismissed \nthose claims, and Mexico did not challenge their dismissal on \nappeal.  Id. at 251a.   \n\n11 \nthe purchasers include unlawful buyers, and making \ndesign and marketing decisions targeted towards \nthose exact individuals, the manufacturer is aiding \nand abetting illegal sales.\u201d  Id. at 302a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that Mexico had alleged \nonly \u201cdefendants\u2019 knowing indifference\u201d to illegal fire-\narms trafficking, finding that argument to be a \u201cfun-\ndamental misunderstanding of the complaint.\u201d  Id. at \n300a-301a.  Far from passive indifference, Mexico had \nplausibly alleged that \u201cdefendants engage in con-\nduct\u2014design decisions, marketing tactics, and re-\npeated supplying of dealers known to sell guns that \ncross the border\u2014with the intent of growing and \nmaintaining an illegal market in Mexico from which \nthey receive substantial revenues.\u201d  Id. at 305a. \nThe court of appeals also rejected Petitioners\u2019 reli-\nance on Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh, 598 U.S. 471 (2023).  \nPet. App. 304a-305a.  As the court noted, Petitioners \nwere \u201calleged to be much more active participants in \nthe alleged activity than were the Twitter defend-\nants.\u201d  Id. at 305a.  The court explained that Mexico\u2019s \nallegations were instead \u201cremarkably analogous\u201d to \nthose in Direct Sales Co. v. United States, 319 U.S. 703 \n(1943), in which this Court upheld the conspiracy con-\nviction of a pharmaceutical wholesaler where \u201cthe de-\nfendant must have known that the sales volume \nmeant there were likely illegal sales, and by encour-\naging volume sales, the defendant could have been \nfound to have intended to supply the products for the \nillegal sales.\u201d  Pet. App. 302a, 304a; see Twitter, 598 \nU.S. at 502 (citing Direct Sales with approval). \nThe court further held that Mexico had plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners\u2019 violations proximately caused \n\n12 \nat least some of its injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  Re-\nlying on \u201ctraditional understandings of proximate \ncause,\u201d id. at 310a n.8, the court held that some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were a \u201cforeseeable and direct\u201d re-\nsult of Petitioners\u2019 conduct, id. at 311a.  The court re-\njected Petitioners\u2019 contention that the cartels\u2019 inter-\nvening criminal conduct could always sever the causal \nchain in the PLCAA context because the dealers\u2019 and \ncartels\u2019 criminal acts themselves were \u201cforeseeable.\u201d  \nId. at 312a-313a.  \u201cIf a third party\u2019s unlawful act al-\nways undercuts proximate cause,\u201d the court ex-\nplained, then \u201cthe predicate exception would be mean-\ningless,\u201d because it is an exception to an otherwise \ngeneral rule that manufacturers cannot be held liable \nfor third-party criminal acts.  Id. at 313a.  \nThe First Circuit then held that at least some of \nMexico\u2019s injuries were \u201cnot merely derivative of those \nborne by the direct victims of gun violence,\u201d conclud-\ning that any damage-apportionment issues are \u201cbest \nresolved once Mexico has had an opportunity to en-\ngage in discovery.\u201d  Id. at 315a, 318a.  The court cau-\ntioned that while Mexico\u2019s allegations sufficed at this \nearly stage, Mexico \u201cwill have to support its theory of \nproximate causation with evidence later.\u201d  Id. at 319a. \nThe court concluded by noting the still-unresolved \nissues in this case, including \u201cwhich jurisdiction\u2019s law \ngoverns Mexico\u2019s tort claims and whether defendants \nowe a duty to Mexico under whichever tort law does \napply.\u201d  Id.  The court remanded to \u201callow the district \ncourt to address the[se] * * * issues in the first in-\nstance.\u201d  Id. \nFollowing issuance of the mandate, the district court \nentered an order renewing Petitioners\u2019 motions to dis-\nmiss for lack of personal jurisdiction.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. \n\n13 \n206.  The court held a hearing on those motions on \nJune 17, 2024.  D. Ct. Dkt. No. 219. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S DECISION DOES \nNOT BREAK WITH ANY OTHER COURT \nOF APPEALS AND IS CORRECT. \nA. There Is No Split. \nPetitioners contend that the decision below splits \nwith other courts that \u201chave applied traditional prox-\nimate cause doctrine to reject the exact same type of \nsuit brought by other government entities.\u201d  Pet. 15.  \nBut Petitioners\u2019 decisions applied different jurisdic-\ntions\u2019 laws to different allegations to answer different \nlegal questions.  And all of them predated the PLCAA.  \nOther than the First Circuit below, no federal appeals \ncourt or state supreme court has addressed the ques-\ntion presented in this unique context, which itself is \npredicated on a thorny legal question this Court would \nhave to resolve itself even though no court has passed \nupon it.  The Court should allow further percolation \nbefore accepting review of these largely unventilated \nquestions.  Cf. Opening Br. at 52-58, New York v. Arm \nor Ally, LLC, No. 24-773 (2d Cir. May 10, 2024) (rais-\ning similar proximate-cause arguments).\n1.  None of Petitioners\u2019 cases concerned the legal \nquestion at issue here: whether a particular \u201cviolation \nof the law\u201d proximately caused the plaintiff\u2019s injury \nwithin the meaning of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate excep-\ntion. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases instead applied various state-law\nproximate-cause principles to different state-law\nquestions.  City of Philadelphia v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 277 F.3d 415, 422-426 (3d Cir. 2002), applied \n\n14 \nPennsylvania law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed \nto state a claim for negligence under Pennsylvania \ncommon law.  Ganim v. Smith & Wesson Corp., 780 \nA.2d 98, 118-130 (Conn. 2001), applied Connecticut \nlaw to conclude that the plaintiffs lacked standing un-\nder Connecticut law.   City of Chicago v. Beretta U.S.A. \nCorp., 821 N.E.2d 1099, 1125-1138 (Ill. 2004), applied \nIllinois law to conclude that the plaintiffs failed to \nstate a claim for public nuisance under Illinois law; \nthe court\u2019s proximate-cause analysis does not cite a \nsingle federal case as even persuasive authority.  And \nDistrict of Columbia v. Beretta U.S.A. Corp., 872 A.2d \n633, 639-651 (D.C. 2005) (en banc), applied D.C. law \nto conclude that the plaintiffs failed to state a claim \nfor negligence and public nuisance under D.C. law.   \nThese state-law cases do not\u2014and could not\u2014split \nwith the decision below.  See West v. American Tel. & \nTel. Co., 311 U.S. 223, 236 (1940) (\u201c[T]he highest court \nof the state is the final arbiter of what is state law.\u201d). \nThese cases did not concern the PLCAA; indeed, they \nwere all decided before the PLCAA\u2019s enactment in late \n2005.  The PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception therefore \ndoes not mean different things in different courts; dif-\nferent state laws and different facts lead to different \nresults in different courts.  See Danforth v. Minnesota, \n552 U.S. 264, 290 (2008) (noting that \u201cnonuniformity \nis a necessary consequence of a federalist system of \ngovernment\u201d).  That is reason enough to deny review. \n2.  Even assuming that the disparate legal traditions \nat play across these cases could be clumped into the \nloose category of \u201ctraditional proximate cause doc-\ntrine,\u201d Pet. 15, there is still no split for this Court to \nresolve.  Petitioners cannot gin up a split simply by \ncomparing cases that contain the words \u201cgun\u201d and \n\n15 \n\u201cproximate cause.\u201d  Proximate cause is a fact-bound \ninquiry, one \u201ccontrolled by the nature of the statutory \ncause of action.\u201d  Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 133 (2014).  Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases involved different legal issues calling \nfor different proximate-cause analyses in the context \nof different facts.   \nThe first difference between Petitioners\u2019 cases and \nthis one is where the causal chain begins.  In Petition-\ners\u2019 cited cases, the courts started the causation anal-\nysis with the defendant-manufacturer\u2019s conduct, \nwhich the courts distinguished from dealers\u2019 unlawful \nfirearm sales.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 423-424; \nGanim, 780 A.2d at 123-124; District of Columbia, 872 \nA.2d at 647, 650; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136-37.  The \nIllinois Supreme Court characterized the causal chain \nas starting at \u201cdefendants\u2019 lawful commercial activ-\nity,\u201d Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1136 (quotation marks \nomitted), and the Third Circuit stressed that the de-\nfendant\u2019s supply of firearms to dealers was through a \n\u201clawful\u201d distribution system, Philadelphia, 277 F.3d \nat 424.  The courts thus found proximate cause lack-\ning because the causal chains started from an earlier, \nconcededly lawful point.  See Philadelphia, F.3d at \n423-424; Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d \nat 412; District of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 1137.  Under \nthe PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, however, the causal \nchain starts at the relevant \u201cviolation\u201d; the exception \nprovides that \u201cthe violation\u201d must be \u201ca proximate \ncause of the harm.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii) (em-\nphasis added).  Here, \u201cthe violation\u201d is the dealers\u2019 fe-\nlonious firearms sales that Petitioners unlawfully \naided and abetted.  See Pet. App. 310a.   \n\n16 \nPetitioners\u2019 cases and this one also differ in whether \nintervening criminal conduct can sever the causal \nchain.  Several of Petitioners\u2019 cases found proximate \ncause lacking for that reason.  See Philadelphia, 277 \nF.3d at 425; Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1138, 1148; Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 872 A.2d at 645.  But the PLCAA\u2019s \ntext precludes applying that principle in this context.  \nPet. App. 313a.  As the First Circuit explained, the \nPLCAA \u201cprecludes only those claims \u2018resulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product\u2019 \nby someone other than the defendant,\u201d so \u201c[i]f a third \nparty\u2019s unlawful act always undercuts proximate \ncause, the predicate exception would be meaningless.\u201d  \nPet. App. 313a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)).  Un-\nlike in Petitioners\u2019 cases, unlawful criminal conduct of \nthis sort is not the focus of the PLCAA\u2019s proximate-\ncause analysis. \nPetitioners\u2019 cases also all involved allegations differ-\nent in both kind and degree:  \nKnowledge of unlawful sales.  Petitioners (at 15-17) \nhighlight Philadelphia, but that case involved general \nallegations that the defendants were merely aware \nthat \u201csome handguns reach prohibited purchasers.\u201d  \n277 F.3d at 424 n.14.  That complaint\u2019s allegations \nabout defendants\u2019 knowledge were nonspecific and \n\u201cd[id] not put a gun manufacturer on notice that a spe-\ncific distributor or dealer [wa]s engaged in unlawful \nfirearm trafficking.\u201d  Id.  But the Complaint in this \ncase alleges that Petitioners have information that \ntheir weapons are being sold unlawfully to cartels by \nparticular dealers, deliberately chose to supply these \ndealers, and intended that the unlawful sales occur.  \nSee supra pp. 6-7; infra pp. 28-29.  \n\n17 \nReady availability of firearms.  Two of Petitioners\u2019 \ncases concluded that proximate cause was lacking \ngiven \u201cthe ready availability of firearms in the nation \nat large, and the sheer number and variety of oppor-\ntunities by which persons intent on acquiring them \nunlawfully can do so.\u201d  District of Columbia, 872 A.2d \nat 650; accord Chicago, 821 N.E.2d at 1137.  Here, by \ncontrast, Mexico \u201chas strong domestic laws that make \nit virtually impossible for criminals to lawfully obtain \nguns in Mexico.  Mexico has one gun store in the entire \nnation and issues fewer than 50 gun permits per \nyear.\u201d  Pet. App. 8a.  Yet hundreds of thousands of \nguns flow annually from Petitioners to criminals in \nMexico.  Id.   \nDerivative injuries.  Finally, Petitioners\u2019 cases em-\nphasized the \u201cderivative\u201d nature of the plaintiffs\u2019 inju-\nries.  See Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424-425; Ganim, \n780 A.2d at 124.  As the Third Circuit explained, \u201cthe \ngravamen of the complaint is that guns are used in \ncrime, with resulting deaths and injuries to City resi-\ndents, prompting much of the expenses plaintiffs \nclaim as damages.\u201d  Philadelphia, 277 F.3d at 424 \nn.13; accord Ganim, 780 A.2d at 124.   \nHere, however, Mexico alleged direct harm from Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 conduct, contending in its Complaint that \nPetitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of this \u201cepidemic of \nunlawful gun trafficking\u201d has \u201cforeseeably\u2014indeed \ninexorably\u201d\u2014caused Mexico itself injury.  Pet. App. \n315a.  Those injuries include increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property.  See infra pp. 20-21, 24.   \nPetitioners home in on the court of appeals\u2019 state-\nment that it found \u201cthe reasoning\u201d of some other state-\nlaw cases more \u201cpersuasive\u201d than Philadelphia and \n\n18 \nGanim.  Pet. App. 315a.  But that does not change that \nthose were different cases with different facts apply-\ning different States\u2019 laws.  And while Petitioners try \n(at 20) to place those other cases on the same side of a \nsupposed \u201csplit\u201d as the First Circuit, Petitioners\u2019 own \narguments betray them.  City of Cincinnati v. Beretta \nU.S.A. Corp., 768 N.E.2d 1136 (Ohio 2002), has been \novertaken by statute, and City of Boston v. Smith & \nWesson Corp., No. 199902590, 2000 WL 1473568 \n(Mass. Super. Ct. July 13, 2000), is an unpublished \nstate trial-court opinion from a quarter-century ago.  \nThese state-law cases are thus outside any \u201csplit\u201d \ntwice over. \nPetitioners try to shore up their \u201csplit\u201d (at 18-19) by \npointing to cases arising in other industries.  Those \ncases are even further afield.  How state and federal \ncourts apply different jurisdictions\u2019 proximate-cause \nstandards to different causes of actions in cases con-\ncerning tobacco, subprime lending, lead paint, or meth \nprecursors has nothing to do with whether unlawful \nfirearms sales proximately cause a foreign govern-\nment\u2019s injury under the PLCAA, the specific federal \nstatute at issue here.   \n3.  Finally, there are practical barriers to this \nCourt\u2019s review.  If, despite the early stage of this case \nand the lack of a split on the questions presented, this \nCourt were to grant review, it will have to address and \nresolve whether the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-\ncause requirement incorporates or is informed by \nstate or local law.  The PLCAA does not create a cause \nof action and does not define proximate cause.  State-\nlaw causes of action proceeding through the predicate \nexception are thus governed by the law of the relevant \nState.  See Erie R.R. Co. v. Tompkins, 304 U.S. 64, 78 \n\n19 \n(1938).    And it is unclear whether that State\u2019s law is \nincorporated into\u2014or at least informs\u2014the meaning \nof the predicate exception\u2019s proximate-cause require-\nment.  Cf. Wallace v. Kato, 549 U.S. 384, 387 (2007) \n(state law governs the limitations period for 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1983 claims).\nThe lower courts have not ventilated this issue at \nall.  The court of appeals instead elected to interpret \nthe predicate exception in light of a combination of \nthis Court\u2019s case law, various state common-law prin-\nciples, and the Restatement (Second) of Torts.  See Pet. \nApp. 310a-318a.   And this issue could be dispositive.  \nPetitioners insist (at 23) that proximate cause cannot \nturn on foreseeability alone.  But several States\u2014in-\ncluding Massachusetts\u2014define proximate cause as \nthe \u201cforeseeable result\u201d of the defendant\u2019s conduct.  \nKent v. Commonwealth, 771 N.E.2d 770, 777 (Mass. \n2002).  Whose law applies and in what way could \ntherefore be outcome-determinative. \nB. The First Circuit\u2019s Proximate-Cause Hold-\ning Is Correct.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 holding is not just splitless.  It \nis also correct. \n1. Proximate cause \u201cis a flexible concept that does \nnot lend itself to \u2018a black-letter rule that will dictate \nthe result in every case.\u2019\u201d  Bridge v. Phoenix Bond & \nIndem. Co., 553 U.S. 639, 654 (2008).  \u201c[P]roximate \ncause\u201d instead \u201clabel[s] generically the judicial tools \nused to limit a person\u2019s responsibility for the conse-\nquences of that person\u2019s own acts.\u201d  Id. (quotation \nmarks omitted).  At its most basic level, proximate \ncause requires \u201csome direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d   \nParoline v. United States, 572 U.S. 434, 444 (2014) \n\n20 \n(quotation marks omitted).  Proximate cause \u201cthus \nserves, inter alia, to preclude liability in situations \nwhere the causal link between conduct and result is \nso attenuated that the consequence is more aptly de-\nscribed as mere fortuity.\u201d  Id. at 445.  And because \nproximate cause is a question of fact, it \u201cis ordinarily \na question for the jury.\u201d  Milwaukee & Saint Paul Ry. \nCo. v. Kellogg, 94 U.S. 469, 474 (1876). \nThe court of appeals faithfully applied these princi-\nples to conclude that Mexico plausibly alleged that Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 aiding and abetting of dealers\u2019 unlawful fire-\narms sales to traffickers proximately caused Mexico\u2019s \nalleged injuries.  Pet. App. 309a-319a.  The court an-\nchored its analysis in the principle that \u201c[p]roximate \ncause demands some direct relation between the in-\njury asserted and the injurious conduct alleged.\u201d  Id. \nat 309a (brackets and quotation marks omitted).  The \ncourt then applied that principle to conclude that \u201cthe \ncomplaint plausibly alleges that aiding and abetting \nthe illegal sale of a large volume of assault weapons to \nthe cartels foreseeably caused the Mexican govern-\nment to shore-up its defenses.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nThe court further explained that proximate cause \nbars recovery where a plaintiff\u2019s injury is \u201cderivative\u201d \nof a third party\u2019s injuries.  Id. at 313a-314a (citing \nHolmes v. Securities Inv. Prot. Corp., 503 U.S. 258, \n268-269 (1992)).  But it concluded that \u201cMexico has \nplausibly alleged at least some injuries that it has suf-\nfered directly from the illegal trafficking of guns into \nMexico, and that are not merely derivative of the \nharm suffered by the victims of gun violence,\u201d such as \n\u201cthe cost of increased law enforcement personnel and \ntraining to mitigate the flow of illegal weapons and to \ncombat drug cartels that\u2014armed with defendants\u2019 \n\n21 \nweapons\u2014are essentially hostile military operations.\u201d  \nId. at 315a-316a.  Other alleged direct injuries include \nMexico\u2019s increased spending on government functions \nand services \u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation \nof defendants\u2019 guns.\u201d  Id. at 316a.   \nThe court hastened to add that not all of Mexico\u2019s \nclaimed injuries are sufficiently direct.  For example, \nthe court recognized that some of Mexico\u2019s alleged \n\u201clower economic efficiency\u201d is \u201cderivative because the \nharm to the government flows only from prior harm \ninflicted upon its citizens.\u201d  Id.  The court of appeals \nleft it to the district court in the first instance to sort \nthrough Mexico\u2019s claimed categories of damages, con-\ncluding at this stage only that Mexico \u201chas adequately \nalleged proximate causation.\u201d  Id. at 318a. \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 attacks on the court of appeals\u2019 care-\nful and case-specific proximate-cause analysis miss \nthe mark.  As Petitioners see it, the decision below \nheld that foreseeability alone \u201cwas required to satisfy \nPLCAA.\u201d  Pet. 23; see also, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et \nal. Amicus Br. 10.  That is belied by the face of the \nopinion:  The First Circuit considered and rejected \nevery one of the \u201cfour reasons\u201d Mexico\u2019s Complaint \nsupposedly fails.  Pet. 21; see Pet. App. 310a-319a.  For \ngood reason.  Petitioners\u2019 arguments all depend on a \nmisinterpretation of this Court\u2019s proximate-cause \ncases or a misunderstanding of Mexico\u2019s allegations.   \nAttenuation.  Petitioners contend that the decision \nbelow erred in going \u201cbeyond the first step\u201d in the \ncausal chain.  Pet. 21 (quoting Holmes, 503 U.S. at \n271); see also Pet. 23-25.  But Petitioners begin their \nsupposed \u201ceight-step\u201d chain from the wrong link.  Pet. \n11 (emphasis omitted).  As the First Circuit explained, \n\n22 \n\u201cthe starting point for the predicate exception\u2019s causa-\ntion analysis is the \u2018violation\u2019 of \u2018a State or Federal \nstatute applicable to the sale or marketing\u2019 of fire-\narms.\u201d  Pet. App. 310a (quoting 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).  The causal chain here thus begins \n\u201cwhen a dealer knowingly violates the law in selling \nguns intended for cartels.\u201d  Id. at 311a.   \nPetitioners insist (at 24) that the predicate excep-\ntion\u2019s proximate-cause requirement begins at a de-\nfendant\u2019s upstream \u201cbusiness activities.\u201d  Petitioners \ncite nothing for this proposition, which flouts both the \ntext and basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  \u201cA \u2018vio-\nlation\u2019 is not simply an act or conduct; it is an act or \nconduct that is contrary to law.\u201d  Richardson v. United \nStates, 526 U.S. 813, 818 (1999).  As alleged aiders \nand abettors, Petitioners\u2019 conduct is not unlawful un-\ntil someone engages in the principal offense.  See Rose-\nmond v. United States, 572 U.S. 65, 70-71 (2014).  \nOnly then is there a \u201cviolation.\u201d  And it is at that \npoint\u2014when a dealer completes the crime by illegally \nselling firearms\u2014that the causal chain begins. \nPetitioners also overstate the law\u2019s \u201cgeneral ten-\ndency * * * not to go beyond the first step.\u201d  Holmes, \n503 U.S. at 271 (quotation marks omitted).  This \u201cten-\ndency\u201d is concerned with ensuring that the cause of a \nplaintiff\u2019s asserted harm is not \u201ca set of actions * * * \nentirely distinct from the alleged * * * violation.\u201d  Anza \nv. Ideal Steel Supply Co., 547 U.S. 451, 458 (2006) \n(emphasis added).  The mere presence of third parties \nin the causal chain does not necessarily violate that \nprinciple.  See Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139-140; Bridge, \n553 U.S. at 656.  Instead, where \u201cthe injury alleged is \nso integral an aspect of the [violation] alleged, * * * \n\n23 \nproximate cause is satisfied.\u201d  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at \n139 (quotation marks omitted). \nJust so here.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged intention in aiding \nand abetting unlawful firearms sales is that their \n\u201cguns would end up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 313a.  The \u201csteps\u201d following dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales, Pet. 21\u2014the means by which the cartels get the \nguns and use them\u2014is not conduct that is \u201centirely \ndistinct\u201d from the unlawful sales, Anza, 547 U.S. at \n458.  They are \u201cintegral\u201d to Petitioners\u2019 violation of the \nlaw.  Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 139 (quotation marks omit-\nted).  They do not sever the causal chain. \nPetitioners contend (at 24) that their strict one-step \nproximate-cause test is especially appropriate in the \nPLCAA context, but the opposite is true:  The PLCAA \nbars certain actions seeking recovery against a fire-\narms manufacturer only for injuries \u201cresulting from \nthe criminal or unlawful misuse of a qualified product \nby the person or a third party.\u201d  15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A) \n(emphasis added).  The causes of action allowed \nthrough the predicate exception are therefore ones \nwhere the plaintiffs are permitted to recover for \nharms caused in part by third-party conduct; other-\nwise, there\u2019s no need for the exception.  But those are \nthe very causes of action Petitioners\u2019 one-step rule \nwould bar.  That cannot be right.  See Abramski v. \nUnited States, 573 U.S. 169, 183 n.8 (2014) (courts \nshould not interpret a statute in a way that \u201cwould \nrender [it] all but useless\u201d). \nIntervening criminal conduct.  Petitioners argue (at \n21) that the causal chain here is \u201cbroken by multiple \nintervening criminal acts.\u201d  But, as Petitioners\u2019 own \ncase explains, the superseding-cause doctrine applies \nonly where \u201cthe injury was actually brought about by \n\n24 \na later cause of independent origin that was not fore-\nseeable.\u201d  Exxon Co., U.S.A. v. Sofec, Inc., 517 U.S. \n830, 837 (1996) (quotation marks omitted).  As the \ncourt below recognized, this \u201cforeseeability\u201d limitation \napplies just as much to intervening criminal acts as to \nother superseding causes.  Pet. App. 312a-313a (cit-\ning, among other sources, the Restatement (Second) of \nTorts).  Mexico plausibly alleged that Petitioners \u201cac-\ntually intended\u201d that their \u201cguns would end up\u201d in the \nhands of the cartels.  Pet. App. 313a.  \u201cAnd it is cer-\ntainly foreseeable that [the] drug cartels\u2014armed with \ndefendants\u2019 weapons\u2014would use these weapons to \ncommit violent crimes.\u201d  Id.\nDerivative injuries.  Petitioners repeat (at 22) their \nposition that Mexico\u2019s injuries are \u201cderivative\u201d of \nthose suffered by the cartels\u2019 victims.  The court of ap-\npeals properly rejected that argument, which is un-\ntethered from Mexico\u2019s Complaint.  As the court ex-\nplained, \u201cthe harm caused by the trafficking goes in \nmultiple directions\u2014both directly to the victims of \ngun violence and directly to the Mexican government.\u201d  \nPet. App. 317a.  In addition to Mexico\u2019s increased law-\nenforcement spending \u201cto mitigate the flow of illegal \nweapons and to combat drug cartels,\u201d id. at 315a, and \nits increased spending on other government services \n\u201cin response to the cartels\u2019 accumulation of defend-\nants\u2019 guns,\u201d id. at 316a, Mexico has suffered direct in-\njury to its military and federal police, as well as gov-\nernment equipment, id. at 172a.  \nApportionment.  Petitioners finally contend (at 22) \nthat \u201capportioning damages and liability would be un-\nworkable\u201d because Mexico\u2019s injuries are too \u201cremote\u201d \nfrom Petitioners\u2019 conduct.  But as the court of appeals \nrecognized, Petitioners\u2019 apportionment concerns \u201cdo \n\n25 \nnot apply\u201d to Mexico\u2019s requested injunctive relief.  Pet. \nApp. 318a; see Lexmark, 572 U.S. at 135 (\u201cEven when \na plaintiff cannot quantify its losses with sufficient \ncertainty to recover damages, it may still be entitled \nto injunctive relief * * * .\u201d).  And damages are unduly \ndifficult to apportion only where there is a \u201cdisconti-\nnuity\u201d between the conduct and the injury.  Anza, 547 \nU.S. at 459.  Here, once the causal chain is properly \nlinked, there is no discontinuity between Petitioners\u2019 \nconduct (aiding and abetting the unlawful sale of fire-\narms) and Mexico\u2019s injuries (increased spending to \ncombat firearms trafficking and damage to its employ-\nees and property).   \nIn short, Petitioners\u2019 arguments amount to com-\nplaints that the court of appeals misapplied settled \nproximate-cause principles to an unusual set of fac-\ntual allegations.  It did not.  In any event, this Court \ndoes not ordinarily grant review \u201cwhen the asserted \nerror consists of * * * misapplication of a properly \nstated rule of law.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 10.  It should not do so \nhere. \nII.\nTHE FIRST CIRCUIT\u2019S CONCLUSION \nTHAT MEXICO\u2019S COMPLAINT \nPLAUSIBLY ALLEGED AIDING AND \nABETTING DOES NOT WARRANT THIS \nCOURT\u2019S REVIEW.   \nPetitioners\u2019 second question presented regarding \naiding-and-abetting liability is shot through with the \nsame issues that plague the first.  That question pro-\nceeds from a false premise, mischaracterizes the deci-\nsion below, and reflects a fundamental misunder-\nstanding of basic aiding-and-abetting principles.  The \ncourt of appeals\u2019 conclusion that Mexico plausibly al-\nleged that Petitioners aid and abet firearms dealers\u2019 \n\n26 \nunlawful sales is correct.  And the Court should allow \nmore courts of appeals to interpret Twitter before it \ntakes up aiding-and-abetting liability again.   \n1.  Twitter reaffirmed the common-law principle that \naiding-and-abetting liability requires \u201cthat the de-\nfendant have given knowing and substantial assis-\ntance to the primary tortfeasor.\u201d  598 U.S. at 491.  \nThese \u201ctwin requirements\u201d of knowledge and assis-\ntance \u201cwork[] in tandem, with a lesser showing of one \ndemanding a greater showing of the other.\u201d  Id. at 491-\n492.  Such \u201cbalancing\u201d allows courts to determine \nwhether \u201cthe defendant consciously and culpably \u2018par-\nticipate[d]\u2019 in a wrongful act so as to help \u2018make it suc-\nceed.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 492, 493. \nAs the court of appeals recognized, Mexico plausibly \nalleged that Petitioners knowingly and affirmatively \nsupplied, enabled, and facilitated dealers\u2019 unlawful \nsales.  Pet. App. 300a-302a.  Petitioners choose to sell \ntheir guns through dealers they know unlawfully sell \ntheir firearms, they cultivate a market among unlaw-\nful buyers through specific design and marketing de-\ncisions, and they have \u201cdouble[d] down on the exact \npractices that they know supply the cartels.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 80a; see supra pp. 4-7.  This is consciously and \nculpably participating in unlawful sales \u201cso as to help \n\u2018make [those sales] succeed.\u2019\u201d  Twitter, 598 U.S. at 493.   \nDirect Sales \u201cstrongly supports\u201d the court of appeals\u2019 \nconclusion.  Pet. App. 303a.  Direct Sales held that \nthere was sufficient evidence to convict a mail-order \npharmaceutical wholesaler of criminal conspiracy to \nillegally resell morphine because the wholesaler sold \na specific doctor large quantities while \u201cactively stim-\nulat[ing]\u201d those purchases through various sales tech-\nniques.  319 U.S. at 705.  The government had warned \n\n27 \nthe wholesaler that \u201cit was being used as a source of \nsupply by convicted physicians.\u201d  Id. at 707.  The \nCourt concluded that this evidence was sufficient for \nthe jury to find that the wholesaler \u201cnot only kn[ew] \nand acquiesce[d]\u201d in the doctors\u2019 criminal activity, but \nalso \u201cjoin[ed] both mind and hand * * * to make its ac-\ncomplishment possible.\u201d  Id. at 713. \nDirect Sales maps onto this case.  Indeed, this case \nis stronger:  Petitioners were told by the government \nto stop supplying high crime-gun-selling dealers and \nto require that their dealers use safe practices. Pet. \nApp. 13a, 34a-36a.  Petitioners know who the crime-\ngun sellers are, and they designed and marketed their \nproducts \u201cin such a way as to make them attractive to \nthe illegal market.\u201d  Id. at 303a.  With full knowledge \nof the unlawful sales by their purchasers, Petitioners \n\u201cresisted taking measures that would make it more \ndifficult for\u201d their products to be sold to cartel-linked \ntraffickers.  Id.  If lesser facts were \u201csufficient to sup-\nport a criminal conviction,\u201d these allegations are suf-\nficient to \u201cplausibly support an aiding-and-abetting \ntheory of liability in this civil case.\u201d  Id.\n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments reflect a funda-\nmental misunderstanding of basic aiding-and-abet-\nting principles and are unmoored from Mexico\u2019s Com-\nplaint. \nPetitioners stumble at the threshold by framing the \nissue as whether they aided and abetted \u201cthe drug car-\ntels\u2019 terroristic mission,\u201d Pet. 27, or unspecified \n\u201cdownstream criminal\u201d activities, id. at 3.  The ques-\ntion here is whether Petitioners aided and abetted un-\nlawful firearm sales.  See 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii).  \nPetitioners\u2019 error is exactly like the Ninth Circuit\u2019s er-\nror in Twitter in focusing on \u201cdefendants\u2019 assistance to \n\n28 \nISIS\u2019 activities in general.\u201d  598 U.S. at 503.  As this \nCourt instructed, the aiding-and-abetting analysis \nmust be anchored to the specific tort or crime at issue.  \nSee id. at 494-495.  Here, that is the \u201cwidespread sale[] \nof firearms by dealers in knowing violation of several \nstate and federal statutes\u201d\u2014a phenomenon Petition-\ners do not contest.  Pet. App. 299a-300a.  \nOn the merits, the crux of Petitioners\u2019 argument is \nthat Mexico has alleged mere knowing indifference to \nillegal firearms sales, and that their business prac-\ntices were not \u201cadopted\u201d or \u201cdeveloped\u201d specifically to \naid traffickers.  Pet. 27-29; see also id. at 30-32; see \nalso Nat\u2019l Shooting Sports Found. (NSSF) Amicus Br. \nat 11-13.  But as the court of appeals observed, \u201c[t]his \nargument reflects a fundamental misunderstanding \nof the complaint.\u201d  Pet. App. 301a.  The Complaint al-\nleges in detail that Petitioners knowingly and actively \ndesign, market, and sell their firearms in such a way \nas to \u201cmaintain the unlawful market in Mexico.\u201d  Id.; \naccord id. at 305a.  \nPetitioners bluster (at 29 n.3) that \u201cthe complaint \ndoes not include a single allegation of any defendant \nspecifically selling to someone it knew worked with \nthe cartels or trafficked any firearms.\u201d  That is false. \nFor instance, the Complaint alleges that \u201ca 2010 \nWashington Post article identified by name 12 dealers \nthat sold the most guns recovered in Mexico\u201d and that \nPetitioners nevertheless \u201ccontinued to use these deal-\ners.\u201d  Pet. App. 44a-46a.  The Complaint also alleges \nthat Petitioner Century Arms continued to supply \n\u201cspecific distributor and dealer networks\u201d that it was \ninformed were \u201cdisproportionately associated with\u201d \nhundreds of guns trafficked to Mexico.  Id. at 80a-81a.  \nAnd the Complaint catalogs many instances of specific \n\n29 \ndealers selling to straw purchasers or traffickers for \nthe cartels, e.g., id. at 56a, 59a-63a, 65a-66a, 67a, with \nPetitioners nonetheless \u201ccontinu[ing] to use these \ndealers,\u201d id. at 71a.   \nFor all these reasons, Petitioners\u2019 Twitter compari-\nsons are inapt.  See Pet. 25-26, 30-31.  Twitter con-\ncerned whether social-media companies plausibly \naided and abetted a specific act of terrorism.  That at-\ntack was not planned or coordinated on the defend-\nants\u2019 platforms, and the defendants\u2019 alleged affirma-\ntive conduct was \u201ccreating their platforms and setting \nup their algorithms.\u201d  598 U.S. at 498.  Once those \n\u201cwere up and running, defendants at most allegedly \nstood back and watched.\u201d  Id. at 499.  There was no \nallegation in Twitter \u201cthat the platforms * * * do more \nthan transmit information by billions of people.\u201d  Id.\nat 502-503.  The Court therefore concluded that \u201c[t]he \nfact that some bad actors took advantage of these plat-\nforms\u201d to spread their message \u201cis insufficient to state \na claim that the defendants knowingly gave substan-\ntial assistance and thereby aided and abetted those \nwrongdoers\u2019 acts.\u201d  Id. at 503. \nIn stark contrast, Petitioners do not run a platform \nthat, once released into the world, allows them to \nstand \u201cback and watch[].\u201d  Id. at 499.  Petitioners \nmade distinct, repeated, and deliberate decisions to \nsupply unlawful sellers and took affirmative steps \nnecessary for the illegal gun sales that armed the car-\ntels.  And this is not a case where \u201cbad actors took ad-\nvantage\u201d of Petitioners\u2019 products; Mexico alleges that \nPetitioners \u201cactually intended\u201d for their products to \n\u201cend up in the hands of [the] cartels.\u201d  Pet. App. 313a.  \nThese markedly different allegations rightly led to a \ndifferent result.   \n\n30 \nThe First Circuit did not \u201cerase[] the very distinction \nbetween active complicity and passive conduct that \nanimated\u201d Twitter.  Pet. 30.  Petitioners\u2019 alleged con-\nduct just falls on the wrong side of the line.   \nIII. THIS PETITION IS A POOR VEHICLE TO \nREVIEW ISSUES OF LIMITED \nPRACTICAL EFFECT. \nA. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle. \nEven if Petitioners\u2019 questions presented warranted \nthis Court\u2019s review, this would be a poor vehicle to ad-\ndress them.   \nFor starters, this case comes to the Court following \na motion to dismiss; this \u201cinterlocutory posture * * * \ncounsel[s] against this Court\u2019s review at this time.\u201d  \nNational Football League v. Ninth Inning, Inc., 141 S. \nCt. 56, 56-57 (2020) (Kavanaugh, J., respecting the \ndenial of certiorari) (citing Abbott v. Veasey, 137 S. Ct. \n612, 613 (2017) (Roberts, C.J., respecting the denial of \ncertiorari)); see also Harrel v. Raoul, No. 23-877, 603 \nU.S. __, slip op. at 2 (July 2, 2024) (Thomas, J., state-\nment) (\u201cThis Court is rightly wary of taking cases in \nan interlocutory posture.\u201d); Wrotten v. New York, 560 \nU.S. 959, 130 S. Ct. 2520, 2521 (2010) (Sotomayor, J., \nrespecting the denial of certiorari) (noting interlocu-\ntory posture as a reason \u201cto deny the petition\u201d).   \nThis Court\u2019s recognition that it is better to allow lit-\nigation to proceed past this early stage has special \nforce in this case.  A slew of motions are pending in \nthe district court.  That court is actively considering \nmotions to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdiction, \nwhich were the subject of a June 17 hearing.  See D. \nCt. Dkt. No. 219.  Also pending are Petitioners\u2019 mo-\ntions to dismiss on the grounds that Mexico\u2019s common-\n\n31 \nlaw tort theories do not state a claim.  See supra pp. \n9-10.  If Mexico\u2019s claims survive, discovery and likely \nsummary judgment motions await. \nPetitioners try to twist the interlocutory status of \nthis case to their advantage, arguing (at 35) that it \nfrees this Court of a \u201cfactual record.\u201d  But that\u2019s ex-\nactly what makes certiorari inappropriate here.  Dis-\ncovery may disprove Mexico\u2019s allegations\u2014or it may \nyield even more egregious examples of aiding and \nabetting.  If this Court wants to weigh in on the exact \nboundaries of the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception, it \nshould wait for a case rooted in facts. \nB. The Decision Below Is Of Limited Im-\nportance. \n1.  Petitioners try to bolster this case\u2019s importance \nby arguing that the decision below \u201cupends\u201d \u201cbasic \nnorms of American law,\u201d exposing (apparently) every \nAmerican business to wide-ranging liability.  Pet. 32-\n33.  Petitioners\u2019 flotilla of amici offer much the same \nrhetoric.  See, e.g., Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. et al. Amicus \nBr. 4 (the decision below \u201cviolates the basic tenets of \nthe American civil justice system\u201d).2\nThe decision below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  The law on \nproximate cause and aiding-and-abetting liability is \nno different in the First Circuit after this decision \n2 Firearms petitions regularly attract a number of amicus \nbriefs\u2014including many of the same organizations that filed \nhere.  See, e.g., Remington Arms Co. v. Soto, No. 19-168 (six \namicus briefs), cert. denied, 140 S. Ct. 513 (2019); Kolbe v. Ho-\ngan, No. 17-127 (eight amicus briefs), cert. denied, 583 U.S. \n1007 (2017).  Such amici, of course, are less amici curiae than \nthey are amici querentis: friends of the complainant. \n\n32 \nthan it was before.  And other courts also have con-\ncluded that firearms manufacturers allegedly aided \nand abetted unlawful firearms sales in such a way as \nto trigger the PLCAA\u2019s predicate exception.  See City \nof Gary, 875 N.E.2d at 432-435; Williams, 100 A.D.3d \nat 150-151.  The sky did not fall when these courts is-\nsued their decisions.   \nUnique allegations also naturally limit a court of ap-\npeals\u2019 decision.  The court of appeals held that Mexico \nplausibly alleged that Petitioners\u2019 assisting of unlaw-\nful firearms sales harmed Mexico because those sales \narmed powerful transnational criminal organizations, \nwith devastating consequences to Mexico itself, as \nwell as to the United States.  That is, of course, a \nhighly unusual set of facts and circumstances. \nFor all these reasons, the decision below did not \n\u201cbroadly expand[] the ability of governments to bring \nsuit over these alleged harms.\u201d  Pet. 33.  A govern-\nment, like any litigant, must always show that it has \nstanding to sue in federal court.  Petitioners initially \nargued that Mexico lacked standing, see Pet. App. \n226a-229a, but abandoned that argument on appeal.   \n2.  Petitioners argue (at 34-35) that Mexico\u2019s status \nas a foreign-government plaintiff makes this case im-\nportant.  But the Framers specifically directed that \nfederal courts be available for suits by foreign govern-\nments.  See U.S. Const. art. III, \u00a7 2; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332(a)(4).  And this country\u2019s courts have handled \nhundreds of foreign-government-plaintiff suits.  See\nHannah L. Buxbaum, Foreign Governments as Plain-\ntiffs in U.S. Court and the Case Against \u201cJudicial Im-\nperialism,\u201d 73 Wash. & Lee L. Rev. 653, 656 (2016).   \n\n33 \nMexico\u2019s tort case against Petitioners also does not \n\u201cundermine American sovereignty.\u201d  Pet. 35.  Petition-\ners are private firearms manufacturers and wholesal-\ners.  Like any other private actor, they can be held to \naccount for their tortious behavior when the PLCAA \nallows.   \nNor does this case threaten Second Amendment \nrights, as Petitioners and their amici speculate.  See\nPet. 34-35; NSSF Amicus Br. 17-19; Sen. Cruz et al. \nAmicus Br. 12-17. Even assuming some penumbral \nSecond Amendment right to \u201cmake[] firearms readily \navailable to law-abiding citizens,\u201d Pet. 34, the Second \nAmendment does not grant a right to supply firearms \nto cartels in Mexico.  And this Court has blessed \n\u201clongstanding * * * laws imposing conditions and \nqualifications on the commercial sale of arms\u201d as con-\nsistent with the Second Amendment.  District of Co-\nlumbia v. Heller, 554 U.S. 570, 626-627 (2008); see \nalso United States v. Rahimi, No. 22-915, 2024 WL \n3074728, at *28 (U.S. June 21, 2024) (Kavanaugh, J., \nconcurring) (explaining that, under Heller, such laws \n\u201care presumptively constitutional\u201d).  Petitioners face \nliability because Mexico plausibly alleged that they \nknowingly aided and abetted the violation of such \nlaws\u2014\u201cvarious federal statutes that prohibit selling \nguns without a license, exporting guns without a li-\ncense, and selling to straw purchasers,\u201d Pet. App. \n299a.  This is not a Second Amendment case. \nFinally, this case does not \u201cjeopardiz[e]\u201d the \nPLCAA\u2019s recognition of \u201cdemocratic control\u201d over the \nfirearms industry.  Pet. 35.  Congress reserved a role \nfor the Judiciary to hold the firearms industry respon-\nsible for common-law torts by limiting the circum-\n\n34 \nstances where the PLCAA applies and carving out ex-\nceptions from the PLCAA\u2019s protections.  See 15 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7903(5)(A)(i)-(vi).  Petitioners face litigation because \nCongress concluded that suits like this one can pro-\nceed.  If Petitioners want more \u201caccountability to the \nAmerican people\u201d for this suit, Pet. 35, they can peti-\ntion their elected representatives.  \nIV. SUMMARY REVERSAL IS \nINAPPROPRIATE. \nNothing about the decision below warrants the ex-\ntraordinary remedy of a summary reversal.  Contra\nPet. 36-37.  The decision below is entirely correct.  But \nin any event, it was neither \u201cobviously wrong\u201d nor \n\u201csquarely foreclosed by [this Court\u2019s] precedent.\u201d  \nShoop v. Cassano, 142 S. Ct. 2051, 2057 (2022) \n(Thomas, J., dissenting from denial of certiorari). \nPetitioners (at 36) attempt to bolster their bid for \nsummary reversal by likening the PLCAA\u2019s statutory \nbar to the qualified-immunity doctrine, which relieves \ngovernment actors from the burden of defending a \nlawsuit in certain circumstances.  That analogy goes \nnowhere.  \u201cQualified immunity balances two im-\nportant interests\u2014the need to hold public officials ac-\ncountable when they exercise power irresponsibly and \nthe need to shield officials from harassment, distrac-\ntion, and liability when they perform their duties rea-\nsonably.\u201d Pearson v. Callahan, 555 U.S. 223, 231 \n(2009).  The PLCAA, in contrast, is a statutory bar on \na certain type of suit\u2014with specified and finely cali-\nbrated exceptions.  The court of appeals concluded \nthat the Complaint\u2019s allegations plausibly satisfied \none such exception.  Having lost a motion to dismiss, \nPetitioners are no more \u201cimmune\u201d from suit than any \n\n35 \nother disappointed private defendant at the dismissal \nstage.   \nCONCLUSION\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.\nJONATHAN E.

          "task_beliefs": "1.  **Procedural Status Confirmed: Merits Stage:** My belief that the case is at the merits stage is now **fully confirmed**. The acquisition of the \"Brief for Petitioners\" on the merits (dated November 26, 2024) provides definitive proof, moving the task entirely into the prediction of the final outcome.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Confidence (Shifted):**\n    *   **Certiorari Prediction:** This is resolved. The Court granted certiorari on October 4, 2024, as stated in the brief.\n    *   **Merits Prediction:** My confidence in a **reversal** (a ruling in favor of the petitioners, Smith & Wesson et al.) has **significantly increased, moving from low-to-moderate to moderate-to-high.** The petitioners' arguments, as laid out in their brief, are exceptionally strong and are grounded in very recent and directly applicable Supreme Court precedent. The ambiguity of the cert grant now appears much more likely to have been a signal that the Court intends to correct what it views as the First Circuit's errors.\n\n3.  **Arguments Defined (High Specificity):** I have now moved from inferring the parties' arguments to knowing the petitioners' exact legal strategy.\n    *   **Petitioners (Gun Manufacturers):** Their argument is a two-pronged attack on the First Circuit's application of the PLCAA's \"predicate exception\" (15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii)).\n        *   **On \"Proximate Cause\":** They argue Mexico's alleged injuries are too remote and indirect. They explicitly map out the long causal chain (manufacturer -> distributor -> dealer -> illegal sale -> smuggler -> cartel -> violence -> government harm) and contend it is broken by numerous independent, intervening criminal acts of third parties. They ground this in the Court's jurisprudence requiring a direct link between conduct and harm, citing key cases like *Holmes v. Sec. Inv. Prot. Corp.* and *Hemi Grp., LLC v. City of New York*.\n        *   **On \"Knowingly Violated\" (Aiding and Abetting):** This is their central argument. They contend that their \"routine business practices\" (manufacturing, marketing, and distributing legal products) do not constitute the \"affirmative act taken with intent to help a crime succeed\" required for aiding and abetting liability. Their entire argument on this point is built on the foundation of the Court's 2023 decision in **`Twitter, Inc. v. Taamneh`**. They argue that general awareness of downstream criminal misuse is insufficient to transform a lawful business into a criminal accomplice.\n    *   **Respondent (Mexico):** Their position is now defined by the arguments they *must* counter. They will need to distinguish *Taamneh* by arguing the manufacturers' actions were more than just providing a neutral service. They will also need to argue for a more expansive, \"foreseeability-based\" view of proximate cause to overcome the attenuated causal chain.\n\n4.  **Core Legal Tension (Sharpened):** The central conflict of the case is now razor-sharp: **Does the conduct alleged by Mexico\u2014designing, marketing, and distributing firearms with general knowledge that some will be trafficked\u2014constitute \"conscious, culpable participation\" under `Taamneh`, or is it merely \"business as usual\" insulated from liability? And, is the resulting harm to Mexico's government sufficiently \"direct\" to satisfy proximate cause, or is it an indirect consequence of third-party crime?** The petitioners have framed this as a straightforward application of precedent that the First Circuit misread.\n\n5.  **Knowledge Consolidation & Next Steps:** I have successfully acquired the petitioners' foundational arguments. The path to a high-confidence prediction is now clear. The single most valuable piece of information is the **\"Brief for Respondent\"**, which will reveal Mexico's counter-arguments to the powerful *Taamneh* and proximate cause challenges. Secondary high-value targets include amicus briefs, particularly any brief from the U.S. Solicitor General, which often influences the Court's thinking.",
          "design_beliefs": "1.  **Core Principle: \"Docket Entries are Predictive Signals\" (Confirmed & Enhanced):** The docket remains the primary roadmap. It led me to the correct stage (merits) and allowed me to target the correct document. This principle is now enhanced: the docket provides the *location*, but the *document content* provides the substantive *reasoning* needed for prediction. The value chain is: Docket -> Document Title -> Document Content.\n\n2.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model (Confirmed & Matured):** This model is proving highly effective. The petitioners' brief is a direct response to the First Circuit's opinion and sets the stage for the respondent's brief, which must in turn be a direct rebuttal. Litigation is a structured dialogue, and by obtaining one side's turn (the brief), I can strongly predict the required themes and arguments of the next.\n\n3.  **Heuristic: \"Verify Procedural Stage First\" (Confirmed):** This remains a foundational heuristic. Correctly identifying the shift from the cert stage to the merits stage was crucial for interpreting all subsequent information correctly.\n\n4.  **Heuristic: \"Analyze Surprising Results\" (Confirmed):** The investigation of the anomalous future-dated brief was the key that unlocked the current merits-stage analysis. This reinforces the value of prioritizing investigation into data that contradicts the current model.\n\n5.  **Search Strategy Refinement (Precision Confirmed):** Using precise, formal document titles like \"Brief for Petitioners\" in my search query was highly successful and efficient. This is a stable, validated strategy.\n\n6.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Self-Correct\" Phase (Confirmed):** The previous `THINK` step correctly identified the key uncertainty (the meaning of the cert grant) and planned the exact action (acquire the merits brief) needed to resolve it. This observation provides further validation for the critical role of internal reasoning and strategic planning in the DBOED cycle.\n\n7.  **New Heuristic: \"Identify the Cornerstone Precedent\":** The petitioners' brief is overwhelmingly reliant on *Twitter v. Taamneh*. This observation establishes a new, powerful heuristic: in any case, a primary goal should be to identify the central, controlling precedent that one or both parties build their argument around. Finding the \"*Taamneh* of the case\" is finding the lynchpin of the legal dispute.\n\n8.  **New Principle: \"Frame Arguments in the Statutory Context\":** The petitioners' arguments about common law torts (proximate cause, aiding and abetting) were not made in a vacuum. They were explicitly used to interpret the specific phrases (\"knowingly violated,\" \"proximate cause\") within the PLCAA's predicate exception. This establishes a new core principle: legal doctrines are often tools for statutory interpretation, and analysis must be grounded in the specific text of the law being disputed."

          "task_beliefs": "1.  **Procedural Status Confirmed: Merits Stage:** My belief that the case is at the merits stage remains **fully confirmed**. The previous observation of the petitioners' merits brief (dated Nov 2024) established this. The current observation of the respondent's \"Brief in Opposition\" (dated July 2024) is a *certiorari-stage* document, which predates the Court's decision to hear the case (granted Oct 2024). This confirms the timeline of litigation but indicates my latest information-gathering action retrieved a document from a prior stage.\n\n2.  **Prediction & Confidence (Stable with Increased Specificity):** My confidence in a **reversal** (in favor of Smith & Wesson et al.) remains **moderate-to-high**. While I did not obtain the respondent's merits brief, I acquired their cert-stage \"Brief in Opposition\" (BIO). This document, while failing to persuade the Court to deny certiorari, provides a detailed preview of Mexico's core legal strategy. I now know *how* they will attempt to counter the petitioners' powerful arguments. The fact that these arguments were not enough to prevent the Court from taking the case may slightly increase the probability of reversal, but my overall confidence level is stable until I see their full merits briefing.\n\n3.  **Arguments Defined (Both Sides Now Known in Detail):** I have moved from knowing the petitioners' arguments and inferring the respondent's to having detailed, text-based knowledge of both sides' foundational positions.\n    *   **Petitioners (Gun Manufacturers) (Stable):** Their argument, grounded in their merits brief, is that the First Circuit erred on both prongs of the PLCAA's predicate exception. They argue (1) Mexico's harm is too indirect to satisfy proximate cause under precedents like *Holmes*, and (2) their general business practices do not meet the high bar for aiding-and-abetting liability established in *Twitter v. Taamneh*, which requires more than just general awareness of downstream misuse.\n    *   **Respondent (Mexico) (Newly Specified):** Their BIO reveals their counter-strategy. They argue the petitioners are mischaracterizing the lawsuit.\n        *   **On \"Knowingly Violated\" (Aiding and Abetting):** They will distinguish *Taamneh* by framing the manufacturers' conduct not as \"passive indifference\" or providing a neutral product, but as \"affirmative and intentional conduct\" designed to profit from the criminal market. They will point to specific allegations of: (1) deliberately supplying a small subset of dealers known to be corrupt, (2) using marketing and design choices that \"intentionally cater to cartel demand\" (e.g., the \"Emiliano Zapata 1911\" pistol), and (3) resisting safety measures. Their key phrase is: \"This case is as different from Twitter as guns are from tweets.\"\n        *   **On \"Proximate Cause\":** They argue the First Circuit's analysis was correct and multi-faceted, not based solely on foreseeability as the petitioners claim. They will argue that the intentional nature of the manufacturers' conduct creates a stronger, more direct link to the ultimate harm, satisfying the proximate cause standard.\n\n4.  **Core Legal Tension (Fully Articulated):** The central conflict is now fully illuminated from both perspectives. It is a battle over characterization.\n    *   **Petitioners' Frame:** Is this a case of holding a lawful industry liable for the remote, unforeseeable criminal acts of third parties, a theory foreclosed by *Taamneh* and traditional proximate cause principles?\n    *   **Respondent's Frame:** Is this a case of holding specific actors liable for their own \"affirmative and intentional\" business practices that knowingly and deliberately facilitate a criminal pipeline for profit, fitting squarely within the PLCAA's predicate exception for unlawful conduct?\n\n5.  **Knowledge Consolidation & Next Steps:** I have failed to acquire the respondent's merits brief but have succeeded in acquiring a high-value substitute: their cert-stage BIO. This document provides the blueprint for their merits arguments. The highest-value information target remains the **\"Brief for Respondent\"** on the merits, as it will show how these arguments are refined and expanded. The second-highest value target remains the **amicus brief of the U.S. Solicitor General**.",
          "design_beliefs": "1.  **Core Principle: \"Docket Entries are Predictive Signals\" (Refined):** The docket remains the essential roadmap. However, this observation reveals a failure mode in using it. A simple keyword search based on the docket's expected content (`respondent merits brief`) is insufficient and can return documents from the wrong procedural stage. The principle is refined: The docket provides the *location* and, crucially, the *exact formal title* of the target document. Precision is key.\n\n2.  **The \"Dialogue of Litigation\" Model (Confirmed & Matured):** This model is strongly confirmed. The BIO is a direct rebuttal to the Petition for Certiorari. By reading the BIO, I can infer the arguments in the petition, just as reading the petitioners' merits brief allowed me to infer the arguments in the First Circuit opinion. Litigation is a turn-based, responsive dialogue.\n\n3.  **Heuristic: \"Verify Procedural Stage First\" (Confirmed):** This remains a critical, foundational heuristic. The discrepancy between the document I sought (merits stage) and the one I received (cert stage) underscores the need to constantly verify the procedural context of every piece of evidence.\n\n4.  **Heuristic: \"Analyze Surprising Results\" (Confirmed):** The anomalous future-dated brief in the prior step was a key signal. Here, the \"wrong\" brief (BIO instead of merits brief) was also a key signal. This reinforces the value of investigating any observation that deviates from expectation.\n\n5.  **Search Strategy Refinement (Major Revision):** My previous belief in the success of my search strategy was premature. This observation reveals a critical flaw.\n    *   **Previous Strategy:** Use descriptive keywords (e.g., \"Brief for Petitioners\").\n    *   **Flaw:** This is imprecise and vulnerable to returning documents with similar keywords from different litigation stages (e.g., \"Brief in Opposition\").\n    *   **Revised Strategy:** I must learn and use the **exact, formal titles** for Supreme Court filings. My mental model must now include a taxonomy of documents: \"Petition for a Writ of Certiorari,\" \"Brief in Opposition,\" \"Brief for Petitioners,\" \"Brief for Respondent,\" \"Brief for Amicus Curiae,\" etc. Future searches must use these precise titles to avoid error.\n\n6.  **The `THINK` Action as a \"Synthesize and Self-Correct\" Phase (Confirmed):** The internal reasoning phase remains vital for planning and, as demonstrated now, for diagnosing failures and correcting the underlying model of the world.\n\n7.  **New Heuristic -> Principle: \"Identify the Cornerstone Precedent\" (Elevated to Principle):** The BIO confirms that *Twitter v. Taamneh* is the undisputed cornerstone precedent of this case. Mexico does not ignore it; they dedicate significant space to distinguishing it. This elevates the heuristic to a core principle: **A primary objective in case analysis is to identify the central precedent and understand how both parties engage with it.** One party will argue it controls; the other must distinguish, limit, or argue it was wrongly decided. The entire case pivots on this engagement.\n\n8.  **Principle: \"Frame Arguments in the Statutory Context\" (Confirmed):** The BIO reinforces this. Mexico's arguments about aiding and abetting are not abstract; they are explicitly designed to satisfy the text of the PLCAA's predicate exception, 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 7903(5)(A)(iii). The common law concepts are tools to unlock the meaning of the statute.\n\n9.  **New Heuristic: \"Cert-Stage Briefs are High-Fidelity Previews\":** This is a major new insight. A party's Brief in Opposition (at the cert stage) is an excellent preview of their arguments in the Brief for Respondent (at the merits stage). While arguments may be refined, the core legal theory and primary lines of attack/defense are established early. When a merits brief is unavailable, the cert-stage brief is the next-best source of information.\n\n10. **New Heuristic: \"Analyze Failed Searches for Design Flaws\":** The failure of my search query was more instructive for my meta-level learning (D) than a simple success would have been. It revealed a flaw in my search strategy and my mental model of court documents. Analyzing *why* an action failed is a powerful method for self-correction and improving future experimental design."
