    "facts_of_the_case": "Karyn Stanley, a firefighter for the City of Sanford, Florida, retired due to Parkinson's disease in 2018 after serving for about 19 years. When she joined in 1999, the City's policy provided free health insurance until age 65 for employees retiring due to disability. However, in 2003, the City changed its plan, limiting the health insurance subsidy for disability retirees to 24 months post-retirement. Unaware of this change, Stanley filed suit in April 2020, shortly before her subsidy was set to expire, alleging violations of the Americans with Disabilities Act, Rehabilitation Act, Florida Civil Rights Act, Equal Protection Clause, and Florida Statutes section 112.0801. The district court dismissed or granted summary judgment on all claims in favor of the City, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirmed, relying on (and reaffirming) binding precedent within that circuit that \u201ca Title I plaintiff must \u2018hold[ ] or desire[ ]\u2019 an employment position with the defendant at the time of the defendant's allegedly wrongful act.\u201d",

The plan itself represents a significant gain in understanding how to approach this specific task.\n\nDesign EIG is moderate (0.4) because the reasoning explicitly articulates and validates a foundational, generalizable strategy (D) for SCOTUS prediction: 'A primary step is to identify a circuit split, as it's a key factor for cert grants and signals a contentious issue.' For an agent starting with no prior design beliefs, internalizing this as the first step is a significant gain in building a robust prediction methodology.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore high, as this single planning action efficiently sets the stage for massive information gain on both the specific case and general prediction strategies.",

The Supreme Court frequently grants certiorari to resolve such splits, and their existence is a powerful predictor of reversal. The petition for a writ of certiorari is the primary document where the petitioner must explicitly argue that a split exists, citing the conflicting cases from other circuits. Obtaining this document will almost certainly resolve my primary uncertainty and dramatically shift my posterior belief about the case's outcome. The information gain is maximal for the task.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): My current design belief is that identifying a circuit split via the cert petition is a critical strategy. Executing this action will provide direct, concrete evidence to validate and refine this heuristic. It will move this belief from a strong hypothesis to a proven, high-yield component of my predictive methodology. While it confirms an existing idea rather than generating a completely novel one, the process of observing *how* the petition frames the split provides crucial detail for refining the strategy for future cases. \n\nJoint EIG (1.8): The action is nearly perfect.

I now know that the petitioner, Karyn Stanley, is a former firefighter who retired due to a disability (Parkinson's disease). The dispute centers on post-employment health benefits. When she was hired, the policy provided lifetime benefits for disability retirees, but this was later changed to a 24-month subsidy. The core legal question presented to the Supreme Court is whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) allows former employees to sue for discrimination related to post-employment benefits, even if they no longer \"hold or desire\" a job with the employer. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit ruled against Stanley, adhering to its own precedent that a plaintiff must have a current or desired employment relationship to bring such a claim under Title I of the ADA. My uncertainty is now focused on the specific legal arguments the petitioner will make and, crucially, whether the Eleventh Circuit's rule conflicts with rulings from other federal circuit courts.",
          "design_beliefs": "I began with no knowledge of effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. The agent's initial reasoning provides a foundational and highly valuable heuristic. I have learned that a critical first step in analyzing a SCOTUS case is to acquire and examine the **petition for a writ of certiorari**. This document is a primary source of high-leverage information because it contains the petitioner's framing of the legal questions and their core arguments. More importantly, I've learned that a key factor influencing the Court's decision to hear a case\u2014and thus a key variable for predicting the outcome\u2014is the existence of a **circuit split**. A circuit split occurs when different federal courts of appeals have issued conflicting rulings on the same legal question. Identifying whether a split exists, and how the petitioner frames it, is a powerful initial strategy. This suggests that my information-gathering process should prioritize sources that clarify the landscape of lower court rulings on the issue at hand. The rationale for granting certiorari is not just a procedural step; it often illuminates the central legal conflict the Justices intend to resolve."

The central legal question for the Supreme Court is whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) protects former employees from discrimination regarding benefits earned during employment. The Eleventh Circuit ruled against her, citing its precedent that an ADA plaintiff must currently \"hold or desire\" a job. My previous belief update identified the petitioner's arguments and the existence of a circuit split as the most critical unknown variables. My recent attempt to acquire the petition for a writ of certiorari, which I believed would contain this information, failed. This null result does not change the known facts of the case, but it does confirm that I still lack the petitioner's specific framing of their legal arguments and their explicit claims about a circuit split.

This belief remains strong. However, the latest observation has provided a crucial lesson in the execution of this strategy. My initial, highly specific search for the petition failed, demonstrating that even a sound heuristic can be derailed by a brittle implementation. I have learned that a single, narrowly-filtered search query (`CLOSED_SEARCH` with specific `proceeding_title` and `link_name` filters) is not a reliable method for acquiring documents. This null result teaches me that my information-gathering process must be more robust and adaptive. A failed search is not a failure of the overall strategy but feedback on the specific tactic. My methodology must now evolve to include iterative searching: if a specific query fails, I should broaden the search terms (e.g., using \"petition\" instead of the full title), relax or remove filters, and potentially try different search types or sources. The reliability of an information-gathering *action* is distinct from the value of the targeted *information*. My strategy must account for potential failures in execution and include contingency plans for finding critical documents."

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are es\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are essential,\u201d but \nnothing more. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \n2. Title I\u2019s enforcement provision. To vindicate its \nsubstantive prohibition on disability-based discrimination, \nTitle I adopted what was, by the time the ADA became \nlaw, a proven remedial mechanism. Section 12117, entitled \n\u201cEnforcement,\u201d provides that the \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d available under Title VII may be invoked by \n\n- 9 - \n \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of\u201d Title I. Id. \u00a7 12117(a). Even \nbefore the ADA was enacted, retirees had used those \nremedies and procedures to enforce their rights under \nTitle VII with respect to post-employment benefits. See, \ne.g., Florida v. Long, 487 U.S. 223, 225 (1988); Norris, 463 \nU.S. at 1074; City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & Power \nv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 704 (1978).  \n3. The Fair Pay Act. Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanism has since been expanded through the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. See Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, \n123 Stat. 5 (2009). That Act clarifies that an unlawful \nemployment practice \u201coccurs\u201d\u2014and thus restarts the \ntime to sue\u2014when:  \n(1) the \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted,\u201d  \n(2) the person is \u201csubject to a discriminatory \ncompensation decision,\u201d or  \n(3) \u201cwhen an individual is affected by application of \na discriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis \nmeans \nthat \n\u201cevery \ndiscriminatory paycheck or other compensation resulting, \nin whole or in part, from an earlier discriminatory pay \ndecision or other practice\u201d is another occurrence for which \na person can seek redress. See H.R Rep. No. 110-237, at 3 \n(2007). \nB. \nFactual background \nIn 1999, after serving in the military, Karyn Stanley \nbegan her career as a firefighter for the City of Sanford, \nFlorida. Pet. App. 2a. In 2005, she was promoted to Fire \n\n- 10 - \n \nLieutenant. All told, Lt. Stanley served the City for almost \ntwo decades as a firefighter. Doc. 1 at 3.  \nWhen the City offered her the job, her employment \npackage included a \u201chealth insurance subsidy.\u201d Pet. App. \n3a. This benefit covered most of the cost of participating \nin the City\u2019s health-insurance plan. Id.; Doc. 1 at 5. So \nalthough Lt. Stanley\u2019s monthly health-insurance premium \nunder the City\u2019s health plan was approximately $1,300, the \nCity\u2019s subsidy covered $1,000 of that cost, requiring her to \npay only $300. The City told her that this benefit applied \nboth to current employees and to qualifying retirees until \nthey reached age sixty-five. Doc. 38-15 at 11. A retiree was \neligible regardless of whether she \u201cretire[d] with twenty-\nfive (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for disability \nreasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a.  \nThis health-insurance subsidy was an especially \nimportant benefit for firefighters like Lt. Stanley because \nthey have one of the \u201chighest rates of injuries and illnesses \nof all occupations.\u201d Bureau of Lab. Stats., Occupational \nOutlook Handbook, Firefighters, https://perma.cc/F8CP-\nUJL8. Indeed, for many critical public-service jobs that \ncome with lower salaries, post-employment benefits are a \nmajor draw for potential employees, representing an \nimportant part of the compensation for which they \nundertake (and stay in) their roles as police officers, \nfirefighters, or other first responders. See Bureau of Lab. \nStats., Employee Benefits, https://perma.cc/PLP6-7GHL. \nIn 2003, unbeknownst to Lt. Stanley, the City quietly \nchanged its subsidy policy to distinguish between \n\u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d retirees. Doc. 1 at 12. The new \npolicy changed the benefits eligibility for \u201call employees \nretiring as a result of full disability\u201d so that it would run \nonly \u201cuntil the disabled retiree receives Medicare benefits \n\n- 11 - \n \nor until 24 months have elapsed from the date of \nretirement, whichever comes first.\u201d Pet. App. 22a; Doc. \n38-11 at 4. By contrast, \u201cnormal retirees\u201d remained \neligible until age sixty-five. Doc. 39-16 at 13. So if a \nfirefighter is injured in the line of duty or develops a \ncareer-ending illness one year before she completes her \ntwenty-five years of service, the subsidy lasts for only \ntwenty-four months. \nThe City claimed that the new policy was a necessary \n\u201ccost cutting measure[].\u201d Doc. 38 at 7. But it never offered \nany justification for cutting costs associated with disabled \nemployees alone. The City\u2019s HR director had no \nexplanation, Doc. 39-4 at 10, 13\u201314, and it was unable to \nidentify any \u201cdata, mathematical calculations, [or] \ncorrespondence \u2026 upon which [it] based its decision\u201d to \nrescind benefits from disabled retirees and not \u201cnormal \nretirees.\u201d Doc. 39-16 at 5, 40. Indeed, city employees could \nnot even point to any \u201cfinancial estimates\u201d of \u201cthe cost of \ncontinuing the disability retirees[\u2019] [subsidy] longer than \n24 months\u201d before enacting the policy. Doc. 39-9 at 46. \nWhatever the reason for the change, the new policy \ndecimated Lt. Stanley\u2019s promised retirement benefits \nbecause her career as a firefighter was cut short by \nParkinson\u2019s disease. After nearly twenty years of service, \nLt. Stanley began to develop \u201cstiffness [and] rigidity \u2026 as \nwell as [a] loss of dexterity in her extremities.\u201d Doc. 38-4 \nat 3. In 2016, she was officially diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s. Pet. App. 2a. For a longtime firefighter like \nLt. Stanley, that diagnosis was tragic but not surprising. \nSome states have adopted a legal presumption that \nfirefighters who develop Parkinson\u2019s did so in the line of \nduty based on the frequency with which the disease afflicts \n\n- 12 - \n \nfirefighters. See N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law \u00a7 207-kkk (Consol.); \nInd. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-15-5.5.  \nFor two years after her diagnosis, Lt. Stanley \ncontinued to work as a lieutenant. Pet. App. 2a. But \neventually it became clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability was \npreventing her from meeting the physical demands of her \njob. Pet. App. 2a. In 2018, at the age of forty-seven, Lt. \nStanley took disability retirement with the City\u2019s \nagreement. Pet. App. 2a. \nAt that point, Lt. Stanley expected the employer she \nhad served for almost twenty years to stand by the \nbargain that it had struck with her when she was hired. \nThe City had explained her original benefits package \nwhen she first joined, and it had never told her about any \nchange in policy. Doc. 38-15 at 9. She had never received \nan updated human resources manual explaining that she \nwould no longer receive the retirement benefits she was \nexpecting. Doc. 38-15 at 9, 11. But just twenty-four months \nafter she retired, the City discontinued Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nhealth-insurance \nsubsidy, \nleaving \nher \nfinancially \nresponsible for all of her health insurance. Pet. App. 3a.  \nFor the past few years, Lt. Stanley has paid out of \npocket for the entire cost of the City\u2019s health-insurance \npolicy, which she relies on for her Parkinson\u2019s treatment. \nDoc 39-9 at 23; Doc. 38-15 at 11, 21. The cost to Lt. Stanley \nof covering the $1,000 monthly subsidy until she is sixty-\nfive\u2014if she is even able to do so\u2014would be more than \n$150,000. Doc. 1 at 6\u20137. Due to the high cost of the City\u2019s \nhealth-insurance premium without the subsidy, no other \ndisabled retirees have been able to stay on the City\u2019s \ninsurance after the loss of the subsidy. Doc. 39-9 at 25; see \nDoc. 39-16 at 3\u20134. Non-disabled retirees, however, \n\n- 13 - \n \ntypically remain on the City\u2019s health insurance until they \nbecome eligible for Medicare. Doc. 39-4 at 69. \nC. Procedural background \nLt. Stanley filed this lawsuit alleging that the City\u2019s \npolicy violated the ADA. Pet. App. 24a. The district court \ndismissed Lt. Stanley\u2019s Title I claim. The court found itself \nbound by circuit precedent holding that a \u201cdisabled \nformer employee\u201d like Lt. Stanley has \u201cno standing to \nsue\u201d over post-employment benefits under Title I because \nshe is \u201cno longer\u201d a qualified individual. Pet. App. 24a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It held that Lt. \nStanley, as a former employee, could not sue about \ndiscrimination in her benefits under the ADA because she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time that the City \nterminated her subsidy payments in 2020. Pet. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. The court emphasized that section 12111(8) defines \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d using the \u201cpresent tense\u201d words \n\u201c[c]an,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. Thus, it \nheld, a plaintiff \u201cmust desire or already have a job with the \ndefendant at the time the defendant commits the \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Id. And since Lt. Stanley was a \n\u201cretiree, not [an] employee,\u201d in 2020, she was not a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nThe panel further concluded that Lt. Stanley was not \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any other discrete moment in \nwhich discrimination could have occurred. Pet. App. 16a\u2013\n17a. The court announced that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcede[d]\u201d \nthat the City\u2019s change of the policy in 2003 could not \namount to actionable discrimination. Pet. App. 16a. And it \n\u201cagree[d]\u201d with Lt. Stanley\u2019s (alleged) concession that her \nclaim could not turn on the 2003 policy change because she \nwas \u201cnot yet disabled at that time.\u201d Id. Nor, the court \nreasoned, could Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim turn on the City\u2019s \n\n- 14 - \n \nactions in the period after she was diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s but before she retired because she (allegedly \nalso) \u201cconceded that \u2026 she was [not] impacted\u201d until after \nshe retired. Pet. App. 18a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The ADA permits former employees to sue over \npost-employment benefits.  \nThe who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision allows suit \nby \u201cany person alleging discrimination\u201d in violation of the \nAct who \u201cclaim[s] to be aggrieved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12117(a), \n2000e-5(f)(1). This language doesn\u2019t limit suits to \n\u201cemployees,\u201d \u201capplicants,\u201d or \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe what: The ADA targets discrimination not just in \nhiring \nand \nfiring \nbut \nalso \nin \n\u201cemployee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). By the time the \nADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \ninterpreted Title VII\u2019s parallel language as protecting \nretirement benefits.  \nThe when: The Fair Pay Act further clarifies that \nretirees may bring suit under the ADA when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis allows a plaintiff to challenge a decision to adopt a \ndiscriminatory benefits policy each time that she is \nadversely affected, even after her employment ends. So \neven if Ms. Stanley didn\u2019t feel the effects of the City\u2019s \npolicy until she retired, these provisions together make \nclear that her claim may proceed.  \nII. The court of appeals independently erred in holding \nthat the ADA protects only those who \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d \na job. Nothing in the ADA\u2019s text requires that result, \n\n- 15 - \n \nwhich would leave retirees unprotected against even the \nmost egregious discrimination. \nThe ADA doesn\u2019t require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a qualified individual. The definition \nasks if an individual \u201ccan perform the essential functions \nof the employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d In other words, it tests if you can do a job, not if \nyou have or want one.  \nThis makes sense given the definition\u2019s role in the \nstatutory scheme: It affords employers necessary, but \ncircumscribed, flexibility to restrict employment on the \nbasis of disability to preserve the functioning of a \nbusiness. It allows employers to screen out people who \ncan\u2019t perform core job functions, not to implement \ndiscriminatory policies unrelated to job performance.  \nThis understanding avoids treating key statutory \nterms \nas \nsurplusage. \nThe \nADA\u2019s \nreasonable-\naccommodation provision applies to a \u201cqualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). This tells us that the \nAct contemplates at least some qualified individuals who \nare neither applicants nor employees\u2014a category that \nwould not exist under the court of appeals\u2019 reading. \nCommon usage, grammar, and logic all show that the \ntext doesn\u2019t demand the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nConsider this rule: \u201cAn individual may not watch the \nmovie unless the individual silences the electronic devices \nthat such individual carries.\u201d If you come to the theater \nwithout a device, can you stay? Of course. The rule \nrequires patrons to turn off their devices only to the extent \nthat they have them. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \nworks the same way: It requires individuals to be able to \nperform essential job functions only to the extent they \nhold or desire jobs with such functions.  \n\n- 16 - \n \nEven granting that the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \ncould be read in a vacuum to support the Eleventh \nCircuit\u2019s view, ours is the better reading in the context of \nthe statute as a whole. Treating retirees as \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d allows the definition to fulfill its role in \nscreening out those who can\u2019t perform job functions, \nwithout turning it into an arbitrary license to discriminate. \nIt avoids rendering key language superfluous. It gives \nforce to the ADA\u2019s protections for retirement benefits. \nAnd it maintains congruity between the ADA and Title \nVII. In short, it is the reading that is far \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of\u201d the Act and the \u201cprimary \npurpose\u201d of the definition. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., \n519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).  \nARGUMENT \n \nBy allowing employers to discriminate against \ndisabled retirees with impunity\u2014in ways that would never \nbe tolerated for race, religion, sex, or national origin\u2014the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision frustrates Congress\u2019s plan for \na \u201ccomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). The decision is flawed in two key \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal:  \n \nFirst, it fundamentally misunderstands the ADA\u2019s \ntext and structure. The ADA allows \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d to sue, including retirees who are later \n\u201caffected by the application of\u201d discriminatory policies \nthat were \u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. That \ndescription fits the allegations in this case to a T.  \n \nSecond, it misreads the ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition as excluding retirees from the Act\u2019s protection. \nThe text doesn\u2019t compel that reading, and an \u201cinquiry into \ntext and context\u201d makes the statute\u2019s contrary meaning \n\n- 17 - \n \nclear. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024). \nReading the ADA to protect retirees makes sense of the \nscheme as a whole, harmonizes Title VII and the ADA, \navoids turning key provisions into surplusage, and escapes \nan outcome that puts the statute \u201cat war with itself.\u201d Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 472 (2023). \nI. \nThe ADA permits former employees to bring suit \nwith respect to post-employment benefits. \nThe ADA permits retirees to sue over their benefits. \nThis conclusion follows from the ADA\u2019s enforcement \nprovision, its coverage of post-employment benefits, and \nthe Fair Pay Act\u2019s clarification of when plaintiffs may sue \nover benefits. Together they make clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nsuit, which challenges a policy \u201cadopted\u201d while she was \nemployed, and to which she was \u201csubjected\u201d while \nworking for the City, may proceed. This Court therefore \nneed not even reach the court of appeals\u2019 erroneous \nholding that the Act only prohibits discrimination against \npeople who currently \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a job.  \nA. The who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision \nallows suit by \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d in violation of the Act. \nTo enforce the ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate,\u201d Martin, \n532 U.S. at 674\u201375, section 12117, titled \u201cEnforcement,\u201d \nprovides \u201cto any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of\u201d Title I the full range of \nremedies provided for in Title VII. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12117(a). \nNoticeably absent from this authority to sue is a \nrequirement that the plaintiff be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nInstead, \u201cany person\u201d who alleges a discriminatory act in \nviolation of the statute can invoke Title VII\u2019s remedial \nframework. And that framework contains no relevant \nlimitation either: It allows any \u201cperson claiming to be \n\n- 18 - \n \naggrieved\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(f)(1).  \nDespite its breadth, Title VII\u2019s remedial provision \ndoes have its limits: Only plaintiffs who assert an \u201cinterest \narguably sought to be protected by the statute\u201d may \ninvoke these remedies. Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, \nLP, 562 U.S. 170, 177\u201378 (2011). But this \u201czone-of-\ninterests\u201d test is \u201cnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \nBand \nof \nPottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224\u201325 (2012). It bars a \nplaintiff only if her asserted \u201cinterests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Thompson, 562 \nU.S. at 178; see also, e.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of \nMiami, 581 U.S. 189, 200 (2017) (holding that Miami could \nsue under the Fair Housing Act for financial injury \nincurred from discriminatory lending practices). Which is \nto say, this textual limitation cuts off only suits that are far \nafield from the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014for example, a \n\u201cshareholder\u201d suit against a corporation over its \u201cfiring \n[of] a valuable employee for racially discriminatory \nreasons.\u201d Thompson, 562 U.S. at 177. \nAssuming that the same zone-of-interest test applies, \nretirees in Lt. Stanley\u2019s shoes satisfy it. The ADA\u2019s \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d mandate to \u201celiminat[e]\u201d discrimination, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12101(b)(1), \naims \nnot \njust \nat \nthe \n\u201cpersist[ence]\u201d of discrimination in \u201cjobs,\u201d but also in the \ndistribution of \u201cbenefits,\u201d id. \u00a7 12101(a)(5). So there could \nbe no doubt that retirees\u2019 claims would fall within the Act\u2019s \nzone of interests. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (explaining \nthat, when a statute contains a \u201cdetailed statement of [its] \n\n- 19 - \n \npurposes,\u201d no \u201cguesswork\u201d is required to determine the \nzone of interests). It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone better \nsituated to bring this claim\u2014over her benefits stemming \nfrom her job\u2014than Lt. Stanley. \nB. The what: The ADA protects against \ndiscrimination with respect to post-\nemployment benefits. \nThe ADA\u2019s substantive prohibitions\u2014the what\u2014also \nreach claims from retirees. The ADA specifically guards \nagainst discrimination in post-employment benefits. It \ntargets not just discrimination in hiring and firing but also \nforbids \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By the \ntime the ADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \nmade clear that Title VII\u2019s parallel language protected \npost-employment benefits. See, e.g., Hishon, 467 U.S. at \n77; Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081.   \nThat\u2019s because \u201c[a] benefit need not accrue before a \nperson\u2019s employment is completed\u201d to be protected. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 77. What matters, instead, is that the \nbenefit is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship\u201d; if it is, it may not be \u201cdoled out in a \ndiscriminatory fashion.\u201d Id. at 75. That common-sense \nconclusion means that \u201c[t]here is no question\u201d that \n\u201cretirement benefits\u201d are protected. Norris, 463 U.S. at \n1079; see also Hishon, 467 U.S. at 77. In the twenty-five \nyears between Title VII\u2019s passage and the ADA\u2019s passage, \nthis Court repeatedly entertained Title VII claims about \npost-employment benefits. See Long, 487 U.S. at 225; \nNorris, 463 U.S. at 1074; Manhart, 435 U.S. at 705.  \n\n- 20 - \n \nWhen the ADA adopted Title VII\u2019s terminology, it \ncarried forward this settled meaning. \u201c[T]he enactment of \na new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text \nindicates \u2026 that the new provision has that same \nmeaning.\u201d Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortg. Corp., 580 U.S. 82, \n95 (2017). And the ADA\u2019s protection of post-employment \nbenefits is confirmed by other sections. For example, the \nADA prohibits employers from contracting with an \n\u201corganization providing fringe benefits\u201d in a way that \u201chas \nthe effect\u201d of discriminating on the basis of disability. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(2). \u201c[F]ringe benefits\u201d has a well-\naccepted meaning, and it encompasses post-employment \nbenefits. Howard Delivery Serv., Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. \nCo., 547 U.S. 651, 654 (2006); see also 135 Cong. Rec. \nS10712 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Sen. Harkin) \n(describing the hope that covered individuals would \u201clive \n[their] retirement years in dignity\u201d); Oversight Hearing \non H.R. 4498 before a Subcomm. of H. Comm. Educ. & \nLabor, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 54 (1988) (describing the \nADA\u2019s focus on protecting disabled Americans\u2019 \u201cbenefits \nfor \u2026 health and retirement\u201d). \nAdd that all together, and it is clear that a retiree in \nLt. Stanley\u2019s position has a right to sue. Whether or not \nsuch a retiree is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d when they \nexperience the effects of the discrimination, they are a \ndisabled employee claiming that their employer applied a \ndiscriminatory policy (which the ADA prohibits) to strip \nthem of their benefits (which the ADA protects).  \nIn fact, a benefits policy that facially discriminates \nagainst people with disabilities\u2014everyone in the company \nreceives a pension, except for people with disabilities\u2014\nnecessarily runs afoul of the ADA. It obviously \n\u201cdiscriminate[s] \u2026 on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\n- 21 - \n \n\u00a7 12112(a). And it does so with regard to \u201ccompensation,\u201d \nid., which is paid to people in exchange for their \n\u201cperform[ance of] the essential functions\u201d of an \n\u201cemployment position,\u201d id. \u00a7 12111(8).  \nIn other words, in understanding what the statute \nprotects, the \u201cqualified individual\u201d language is largely \nbeside the point in a case of this kind. As a general \nproposition, employers only pay \u201ccompensation\u201d to \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that\u201d they \u201chold[] or \ndesire[].\u201d Id. And we know from preexisting usage that \nsuch \u201ccompensation\u201d includes benefits employees receive \nafter retirement. So when employers discriminate \u201cin \nregard to \u2026 compensation,\u201d they necessarily do so \n\u201cagainst a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). And as the \nnext section explains, it is proper for an employee (or \nformer employee) to sue whenever such a discriminatory \ncompensation policy affects them\u2014including when they \nreceive their benefits only after retiring. \nC. The when: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nand Title I\u2019s enforcement provision taken \ntogether mean that retirees can sue over post-\nemployment benefits. \nIt is clear, then, that retirees are among the \u201cany \nperson[s]\u201d \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d who can invoke \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement mechanism. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. So \ntoo is it clear that their retirement benefits are \n\u201ccompensation\u201d protected by the Act. Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which Title I \nincorporates, brings Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim across the finish \nline: It allows retirees to bring suit when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \n\n- 22 - \n \n1. Before the Fair Pay Act, those seeking to challenge \ndiscriminatory \npolicies \naffecting \npost-employment \nbenefits faced a challenge: Like Lt. Stanley, they may not \nhave learned about their discriminatory benefits policies \nuntil they were affected after retiring. That could be years \nafter the policies were adopted. Because such a claim \ncould have been characterized as merely seeking redress \nfor the \u201cadverse effects resulting from the past \ndiscrimination,\u201d it could well have been barred by the \nstatute of limitations. Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 628 (2007). \nThe Fair Pay Act resolved this dilemma. It provides \nthat an unlawful employment practice occurs with respect \nto discrimination in compensation: \n[1] when a discriminatory compensation decision \nor other practice is adopted, [2] when an individual \nbecomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, or [3] when an \nindividual is affected by application of a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). This provision applies to the \nADA through its incorporation of Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanisms. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThe Fair Pay Act thus makes clear that a claim under \nthe ADA is timely if the plaintiff sues when she \u201cbecomes \nsubject to\u201d or \u201cis affected by\u201d discrimination that occurred \nduring her tenure. This is true even if the plaintiff doesn\u2019t \nreceive the benefit in question until after her employment \nhas concluded. As a result, the Act permits a plaintiff to \nchallenge an employer\u2019s earlier decision to adopt a \n\n- 23 - \n \ndiscriminatory benefits policy when she is adversely \naffected, either by receiving a reduced benefit or by being \ndenied the benefit entirely. \nCrucially, the Fair Pay Act allows a plaintiff\u2019s claim to \naccrue or re-accrue even after the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nhas concluded. As long as the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject \nto\u201d or \u201cis affected by application of\u201d the employer\u2019s earlier \ndiscriminatory decision after leaving her job, the \nemployer\u2019s liability will accrue or re-accrue then. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), (B). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view \nthat a former employee is no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d because she neither \u201cholds\u201d nor \u201cdesires\u201d a job \nhas no bearing on this analysis. 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The \nFair Pay Act doesn\u2019t treat each discrete payment (or \nnonpayment) as a new discriminatory act that must \nindependently satisfy all of the ADA\u2019s elements. Rather, \nit allows a claim to accrue based on the past discriminatory \ndecision when the plaintiff is affected by that decision. \nThe Fair Pay Act eliminates any doubt about a \npotential mismatch between Congress\u2019s intent to broadly \nprohibit disability-based discrimination in retirement \nbenefits and the ADA\u2019s text. It ensures that plaintiffs can \ntimely enforce the settled rule that \u201cclassification of \nemployees on the basis of [disability] is no more \npermissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than \nat the pay-in stage.\u201d Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081. And it \nreinforces what the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose \nalready make clear: Former employees are protected \nfrom discrimination as to post-employment benefits.  \n2. When Lt. Stanley began her career as a firefighter, \nthe City promised to continue paying her health-insurance \nsubsidy until the age of 65 so long as she \u201cretire[d] with \ntwenty-five (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for \n\n- 24 - \n \ndisability reasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a. That \nretirement subsidy was, without a doubt, part of her \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and thus protected by Title I. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112; see supra 19\u201321. Four years later, and while Lt. \nStanley was still working as a firefighter, the City changed \nits policy to distinguish between \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d \nretirees. Doc. 1 at 12; see also Doc. 39-16 at 27\u201328. The \nlatter were still eligible for the full retirement benefit, but \nthe former would now receive only two years of the health \ncare subsidy (or less, if they qualified for Medicare \nbenefits). Pet. App. 22a. \nLt. Stanley was, of course, employed by the City in \n2003 when this \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision\u201d \nthat she challenges was \u201cadopted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). Thus, even if Lt. Stanley did need to hold or \ndesire a job when the City discriminated against her (but \nsee infra Part II), she did. The City \u201cadopted,\u201d id., its \npolicy in 2003 when Lt. Stanley indisputably was a \nqualified individual, and that policy discriminated \u201con the \nbasis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee compensation\u201d \n(her benefits), id. \u00a7 12112(a). Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim then re-\naccrued in 2020 when she was \u201caffected by application of\u201d \nthe policy (she was denied the health care subsidy). Id. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). That means that she could bring this \nlawsuit exactly when she did to challenge exactly what she \nchallenged.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected this reasoning by \nannouncing that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcedes, and we agree, that \nher claim cannot turn on the 2003 amendment to the \nbenefits plan because she was not yet disabled at that \ntime.\u201d App. 16. Nothing supports the assertion that Lt. \nStanley made that concession. To the contrary, Lt. \nStanley repeatedly argued the opposite, insisting that the \n\n- 25 - \n \nadoption \nof \nthe \npolicy \ndid \nconstitute \nunlawful \ndiscrimination against her. See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 4 \n(allegations in complaint addressing 2003 change); Op. Br. \nat viii\u2013ix (expressly adopting similar argument made in \nthe United States\u2019 amicus brief); Reply Br. at 6 (\u201cIn this \ncase, \nthe \nCity\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nenact \nthe \nfacially \ndiscriminatory 24-Month Rule in 2003 is the initial \n\u2018challenged employment decision.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, [Lt.] Stanley \nwas a \u2018Qualified Individual\u2019 able to perform her firefighter \nduties at the time of the \u2018challenged employment \ndecision.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis omitted); Oral Arg. 4:59\u20135:05 (\u201cAt \nthe time of the discriminatory act in 2003 she was a \nqualified individual.\u201d).  \nTo the extent the Eleventh Circuit held that the 2003 \npolicy change could not be actionable discrimination \nbecause Lt. Stanley \u201cwas not yet disabled at that time,\u201d it \nmisapplied the statute. App. 16. A person need not be \ndisabled to be subjected to unlawful discrimination under \nTitle I. The statute was specifically amended to avoid that \noutcome: It broadly prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis \nof disability\u201d rather than, as it had previously provided, \nonly against a qualified individual \u201cwith a disability.\u201d \nCompare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), with Pub. L. No. 101-336, \nTitle I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990). Here, the City acted \u201con \nthe basis of disability\u201d when it adopted a policy that, on its \nface, limits the amount of time that a person receives a \nsubsidy based on whether that person has a disability. See \nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 200 (1991) \n(\u201c[A]n explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination \nunder\u201d Title VII).  \nIt is of no matter, then, that Lt. Stanley was not yet \ndisabled when the City changed its policy. Even if that was \n(somehow) relevant, it was inevitable that the facially \n\n- 26 - \n \ndiscriminatory policy would harm employees when they \nbecame disabled and had to retire before twenty-five \nyears of service. The Court may thus conceive of this claim \nas encompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became disabled. \nThis Court has recognized that certain Title VII claims \ncan encompass events occurring at different points in time \nas the basis for an action challenging a \u201csingle \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 562 \nn.7 (2016). By analogy, the same holds true here.  \nThe Fair Pay Act also demonstrates that the City \ndiscriminated against Lt. Stanley again when that same \ndiscriminatory policy was applied to her as she neared her \ninevitable early retirement. At that point, although she did \nnot yet feel the effects of the policy, Lt. Stanley became \n\u201csubject to\u201d it, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); the policy \nconclusively determined what benefits she would receive \nonce her fast-approaching forced retirement began and, in \nthat way, removed her access to the more expansive \nbenefits package available to people without disabilities. \nSee Castellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 68 (2d \nCir. 1998) (\u201c[A]n employee\u2019s entitlement to post-\nemployment fringe benefits arises \u2026 during his period of \nemployment.\u201d). That too is an \u201cunlawful employment \npractice\u201d \nthat \n\u201coccur[ed]\u201d \nduring \nLt. \nStanley\u2019s \nemployment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).1  \n \n1 The third way in which an unlawful employment practice \noccurs\u2014the individual becoming \u201caffected\u201d by the discriminatory \ndecision\u2014remains relevant here because it removes any doubt that \nLt. Stanley\u2019s claim is timely. She was \u201caffected\u201d when her subsidy \nended.  \n\n- 27 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit declined to address that alleged \ndiscrimination too, because Lt. Stanley \u201caffirmatively \nconceded\u201d that she was not \u201cimpacted by [the City\u2019s \npolicy] during her employment.\u201d App. 18. But that Lt. \nStanley was not yet \u201cimpacted\u201d (in terms of receiving a \ndecreased health care subsidy) in no way undermines her \nclaim. That\u2019s what the Fair Pay Act makes clear: A person \ncan be discriminated against when a \u201cdecision\u201d or \n\u201cpractice\u201d is \u201cadopted,\u201d or when they \u201cbecome[] subject \nto\u201d it, even if they are not \u201caffected by\u201d it until later. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \nII. The ADA does not require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding was wrong for \nanother, independent reason: One does not need to \ncurrently \u201chold[] or desire\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d under the ADA. The court below reached its \nholding by focusing on the definition of discrimination in \nsection 12112(a) and of \u201cqualified individual\u201d in section \n12111(8). Based on those provisions, it held that it is legal \nfor employers to discriminate against former employees \non the basis of disability.  \nNothing in the statute\u2019s text demands that surprising \nresult. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s error is explained by its \nmisunderstanding \nof \nthe \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, because section 12112(a) \nprohibits discrimination against \u201cqualified individuals\u201d \nand the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d speaks in the \npresent tense\u2014referring to a person who \u201ccan perform\u201d a \njob that the person \u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d\u2014the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against a person while they \nhold (or are applying to) a job. App. 11.  \n\n- 28 - \n \nBut the court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatutory definition to impose two distinct requirements: \n\u201cQualified individual means an individual who (a) holds or \ndesires an employment position and (b) can perform the \nessential functions of that employment position.\u201d The text \nonly imposes one requirement: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nmeans an individual who \u2026 can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The text asks only \none question\u2014what \u201ccan\u201d you do? \nThis understanding of the definition\u2019s text makes \nperfect sense given its role in the statute: It operates to \nafford employers cabined authority to act on the basis of \ndisability when doing so is necessary to preserve the \nfunctioning of the business. That is why the term is \ndefined with reference to \u201cessential functions,\u201d not \u201cany \nfunction.\u201d Its text is best read to impose only a conditional \nmandate, which tracks that role. If a person has (or seeks) \na job, that person must be able to perform its essential \nfunctions; if no such job exists\u2014because the person is \nretired\u2014the definition does not operate as a limit on the \nADA\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. In other words, the \ndefinition asks if you \u201ccan\u201d perform the functions of a job \nthat you hold or desire, not if you have or want one.  \nA. The text of section 12111(8) and its place in \nthe statutory scheme confirm that the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition tests if you \ncan do a job, not if you have one.   \nThe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d exists to give \nemployers the cabined ability to act on the basis of job-\nrelated concerns so that they are not forced to hire or \nretain people who are incapable, even with the benefit of \nreasonable accommodations, of performing essential \n\n- 29 - \n \ntasks. We know that is the definition\u2019s role because of its \nplain text, its place in the statutory scheme, and its \nrelationship to other sections of the statute.  \n1. Text and purpose. \u201cStart with the text.\u201d Arellano v. \nMcDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 8 (2023). The definition asks if an \nindividual \u201ccan perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It does \nnot ask if an individual \u201cholds or desires an employment \nposition whose essential functions she can perform.\u201d The \nlatter formulation would impose the \u201cmust hold or desire \na job\u201d requirement that the Eleventh Circuit perceived. \nThe former asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a thing, not if you are \ndoing that thing or would do it.  \nThat the definition asks what an individual \u201ccan\u201d do \nmakes sense given its role in the statutory scheme. The \ndefinition gives employers necessary, but circumscribed, \nflexibility in light of the Act\u2019s sweeping impact. Title I \nprovides protection in all aspects of the employment \nrelationship. It broadly prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d in \n\u201cjob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or \ndischarge of employees, employee compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.\u201d \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a). \nThat \ncovers \neverything from job applications to post-employment \nbenefits\u2014if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the \nemployment \nrelationship,\u201d \nan \nemployer \ncannot \n\u201cdiscriminate.\u201d Hishon, 467 U.S. at 75; supra at 19\u201321.  \nTitle I prohibits both \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d and \n\u201cdisparate impact.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 52 (2003). But it also goes further, \u201crequir[ing] \naffirmative \nconduct\u201d \nto \nensure \n\u201cthose \nwith \ndisabilities \u2026 obtain the same workplace opportunities \n\n- 30 - \n \nthat those without disabilities [] enjoy.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. \nat 397, 401; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). Accordingly, the \nAct at times requires employers not to treat people with \ndisabilities \nequally, \nbut \ninstead \nto \ntreat \nthem \n\u201cpreferentially.\u201d \nBarnett, \n535 U.S. \nat \n397. \nThat \naffirmative mandate is reflected in the Act\u2019s definition of \ndiscrimination, which \u201cincludes \u2026 not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental \nlimitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).  \nBecause of the Act\u2019s \u201cbold ambitions\u201d and \u201cfar-\nreaching\u201d scope, though, Congress recognized the need \nfor delineated \u201climits.\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2415\u201316 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting from the denial \nof certiorari). As this Court has held, the ADA achieves its \nimportant \u201cobjectives\u201d within \u201cthe realm of the \nreasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. Without some \nqualification, the statute would prevent employers from \ndenying employment to people whose disabilities, no \nmatter the steps taken to accommodate them, prevent \nthem from performing their jobs. A swimming pool could \nface liability for refusing to hire as a lifeguard a person \nwhose disability left her unable to swim. Congress, \nunsurprisingly, did not want to prohibit that sort of \nrational, and necessary, decision-making.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition ensures that \nemployers have the necessary leeway. The only people \nwho employers must hire, retain, and accommodate are \nthose who, \u201cwith or without\u201d accommodations, \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The definition, then, exists \nto allow employers to screen out people who can\u2019t perform \n\n- 31 - \n \nthe core, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue. What \nit does not do, however, is grant employers a license to \nimplement \ndiscriminatory \nemployment \npolicies \nor \nindividual employment actions that have nothing to do \nwith an individual\u2019s ability to do a relevant job.  \n2. Statutory scheme. This understanding of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2014as a screen that \nprevents employers from being obligated to hire and \naccommodate those who can\u2019t perform a job\u2014neatly \naligns with the rest of the statutory scheme that Congress \ndevised. Several provisions of the Act allow employers to \ntake actions that are justified in relation to the operation \nof their business. None of them invite employers to take \ndiscriminatory actions that have nothing to do with \nlegitimate business needs.  \nFor example, even when employers must provide \naccommodations, they need only be \u201creasonable,\u201d and \neven those they can forego if they \u201ccan demonstrate that \nthe accommodation would impose an undue hardship\u201d on \ntheir \u201coperation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \u201c[Q]ualification \nstandards\u201d that screen out people with disabilities are \nimpermissible, unless that standard \u201cis shown to be job-\nrelated for the position in question and is consistent with \nbusiness necessity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(6). Other examples are \nsprinkled across the statute. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(7) \n(making it unlawful to administer \u201ctests concerning \nemployment\u201d unless those tests measure a person\u2019s \naptitude and skills rather than merely reflecting any \nimpairments); \nid. \n\u00a7 \n12112(d)(2) \n(prohibiting \npre-\nemployment \nmedical \nexaminations \nbut \npermitting \n\u201cinquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-\nrelated functions\u201d).  \n\n- 32 - \n \nEach of these provisions reflects a balance struck in \nthe Act: Discrimination is prohibited\u2014from application \nthrough retirement\u2014but employers have leeway to act on \nthe basis of disability where a sufficiently weighty and \nlegitimate business need calls for it. The \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition does just that\u2014nothing more, \nnothing less. It is not concerned with whether you have a \njob; it is concerned with employers\u2019 needs in relation to \ntheir current and future employees. Reading it to allow \ndiscrimination against former employees, by contrast \nmakes it do work in the statute that it simply is not doing. \n3. Surplusage. The court of appeals\u2019 reading also turns \nkey provisions of the Act into surplusage. It is a \u201c\u2018cardinal \nprincipal\u2019 of interpretation that courts must give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Parker \nDrilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 602 \n(2019). Accordingly, the canon against surplusage \ninstructs that a statute should be construed \u201cso that no \npart will be inoperative or superfluous, void or \ninsignificant.\u201d Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U.S. \n202, 213 (2018). \nThe ADA\u2019s definition of discrimination, section \n12112(b)(5)(A), states that discrimination \u201cincludes \u2026 not \nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical \nor mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  \nThis language tells us that the Act contemplates the \nexistence of some qualified individuals who are neither \n\u201capplicant[s] [n]or employee[s].\u201d If the court of appeals \nwas right that the qualified individual definition already \nscreens out individuals who do not \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a \njob, then this modifier\u2014\u201cwho is an applicant or employee\u201d \n\n- 33 - \n \n\u2014would be surplusage. And an interpretation that \n\u201ctreat[s]\u201d those \u201cstatutory terms as surplusage,\u201d \nparticularly when they\u2019re found in such a \u201cpivotal [] place \nin the statutory scheme\u201d (the reasonable-accommodation \nprovision), should give us pause. Duncan v. Walker, \n533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). \u201cThe canon against surplusage is \nstrongest \nwhen \nan \ninterpretation \nwould \nrender \nsuperfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\u201d \nCity of Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. 154, 159 (2021).   \nThat there are \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d not covered by \nsection 12112\u2019s reasonable-accommodation mandate is \nconfirmed by the other way its reach is narrowed. \nEmployers need only make reasonable accommodations \nfor \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). To be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d though, you need not have a disability. The \nADA was specifically amended to extend the \u201cgeneral\u201d \nantidiscrimination mandate not only to discrimination \nagainst persons \u201cwith a disability,\u201d but to more broadly \nreach discrimination \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d Compare \nPub. L. No. 101-336, Title I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990), \nwith 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Because there are \u201cqualified \nindividual[s]\u201d who are not disabled, as well as those who \nno longer hold or desire a job, then, the reasonable-\naccommodation provision makes perfect sense. That \nsection recognizes the breadth of who can be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d and then subtracts from its mandate the need \nto accommodate any \u201cqualified individual\u201d who is not a \nperson \u201cwith a disability\u201d and who is not \u201can applicant or \nemployee,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2014because only \ndisabled individuals engaged in (or seeking) active \nemployment actually need \u201caccommodations.\u201d   \n\n- 34 - \n \nSection 12112 thus demonstrates that, when Congress \nintended to limit the reach of a substantive protection to \napplicants and employees, it did so explicitly. \nB. Common usage, grammar, and logic all \ndemonstrate that the text does not compel \nreading \u201cqualified individual\u201d to exclude \nretirees. \nNothing in the text of the definition of \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d demands reading it to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. The Eleventh \nCircuit concluded otherwise, reasoning that, because of \nthe definition, the \u201cplain language\u201d of the anti-\ndiscrimination rule \u201cexpressly applie[s] only to \u2018qualified \nindividuals with a disability\u2019 who \u2018hold[]\u2019 or \u2018desire[]\u2019 an \n\u2018employment position.\u2019\u201d App. 7. But that reading seemed \nplain only because the court of appeals misunderstood a \nkey part of the definition: \nThe \nterm \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nmeans \nan \nindividual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, \ncan \nperform \nthe \nessential \nfunctions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It is the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause that makes the definition carry out its \nimportant role in the statute. See supra 29\u201331. That\u2019s how \nit tests an employee\u2019s capabilities. And retirees are not \nunable to pass this test\u2014that is, they\u2019re not unable to \nperform the essential functions of a job that they hold or \ndesire. \nTo be sure, testing the job capabilities of someone who \nis no longer working may seem logically awkward. But \nthat doesn\u2019t mean that retirees fail the test; it instead \n\n- 35 - \n \nhighlights the conditional nature of the requirement. And, \nas we explain below, common sense, common usage, and \nlogic all suggest that the best reading (or at least an \nequally plausible one) is that retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d But even if one thought that the test was \nambiguous when applied to retirees, that still would \nrequire rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading, which is \n\u201c[in]consistent with the broader context\u201d of Title I \u201cand \nthe primary purpose of\u201d the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 849; see id. (holding that \n\u201cthe term \u2018employees,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII\u201d \ncovers \u201cformer employees\u201d despite the text being \n\u201cambiguous\u201d because that reading is \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of Title VII and the primary \npurpose of \u00a7 704(a)\u201d). \n1. Common usage. Title I defines a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d as \u201can individual who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The Eleventh \nCircuit mistakenly read that definition to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. But that is not \nthe only (or best) way to read the definition. A few parallel \nexamples demonstrate how an ordinary reader interprets \na sentence like this one.  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie unless you silence your cell \nphone.\u201d If you come to the theater without a phone, do you \nviolate this rule? Surely no. That\u2019s because this rule \nrequires that patrons turn off their phones only to the \nextent that they have phones to turn off. For the same \nreason, a person without a phone can attend court despite \na rule that says \u201c[y]ou must turn off your cell phone before \n\n- 36 - \n \nentering the courtroom.\u201d2 The rules\u2014and their respective \npurposes\u2014are satisfied. \u201c[C]ommon sense,\u201d Pereira v. \nSessions, 585 U.S. 198, 211 (2018), tells us how to read \nthese rules. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 \n(2014) (\u201cThe notion that some things \u2018go without saying\u2019 \napplies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.\u201d). \nConsider another example. NASA gives an award each \nyear to the \u201camateur astronomer\u201d who \u201cdiscovered the \nintrinsically brightest near-Earth asteroid\u201d in the \nprevious year. 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(c)(3)(A). As defined by \nthe statute, \u201camateur astronomer means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, payment, \nor compensation to the individual for the observation of \nasteroids and other celestial bodies.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30902(b)(1). Is \nan unemployed person with a home telescope eligible to \nwin that prize? Of course. What this rule obviously means \nin context is that, if you have an employer and if that \nemployer pays for your stargazing, you can\u2019t be an \n\u201camateur astronomer.\u201d Unemployed people don\u2019t fail that \ntest; they easily pass it.  \nOr try this one: \u201cA passenger may not board an \naircraft unless it is determined that the passenger is a \n\u2018cleared individual.\u2019\u201d \u201cA \u2018cleared individual\u2019 means an \nindividual who can successfully complete an x-ray \nscreening of the baggage that such individual carries or \nchecks.\u201d Does this hypothetical rule prohibit passengers \nwith no bags from boarding a plane? Obviously not. This \nrule doesn\u2019t require that a passenger have a carry-on or \nchecked bag; it requires the screening of any bag to the \nextent that a passenger has such luggage.  \n \n2 Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Self-Guided Tour, \nhttps://perma.cc/2BVB-2K4P. \n\n- 37 - \n \nIndeed, an actual TSA regulation provides that \u201c[n]o \nindividual may \u2026 board an aircraft without submitting to \nthe screening and inspection of\u201d her \u201caccessible \nproperty[.]\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.107(a). This regulation \nobviously doesn\u2019t require that a passenger carry any \n\u201caccessible property,\u201d only that she submit to the \nscreening of that property to the extent she has any.  \nAnother federal statute requires the government to \npay individuals for the \u201ccost of a comparable replacement \ndwelling\u201d when a federal project displaces them. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4623(a)(1)(A). Whether something qualifies as \na \n\u201ccomparable \nreplacement \ndwelling\u201d \nrequires \nconsidering how far away it is from the displaced person\u2019s \noriginal home \u201cwith respect to public utilities, facilities, \nservices, and \nthe \ndisplaced \nperson\u2019s \nplace \nof \nemployment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4601(10) (emphasis added). The lack \nof a \u201cplace of employment\u201d can\u2019t possibly bar retirees \nfrom financial support.  \nNotably, Title II of the ADA has a similar textual \nfeature. That section forbids discrimination in public \n\u201cservices, programs, or activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Like \nTitle I, it makes use of \u201cqualified individual\u201d language: \n\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d Id. And its definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nhas a similar structure to Title I\u2019s: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nwith a disability means an individual with a disability who, \nwith or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, \nor \npractices \u2026 meets \nthe \nessential \neligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the \n\n- 38 - \n \nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12131(2) (emphasis added). \nNow consider a \u201crecreational\u201d program covered by the \nAct, United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 (2006) \n(discussing \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cservices, \nprograms, \nor \nactivities\u201d), like the Washington & Old Dominion trail, \nwhich has no \u201cessential eligibility requirements\u201d for \n\u201cparticipation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2). The trail is open to \neveryone free of charge. Except that it has one rule: \u201cNo \npeople in wheelchairs.\u201d That blatant exclusion certainly \nviolates Title II. The fact that the trail has no \u201cessential \neligibility requirements\u201d does not mean the excluded \nperson with a disability ceases to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Instead, Title II is naturally read to say that, \nto \nthe \nextent \nthere \nare \n\u201cessential \neligibility \nrequirements,\u201d an individual must meet them. \nAlthough rules written this way can sometimes read \nawkwardly when their implicit condition fails, courts \nroutinely figure out how to interpret them. Take the \nfederal \ncompassionate-release \nstatute. \nThat \nlaw \nauthorizes a court to \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment\u201d \nwhen, among other things, the \u201creduction is consistent \nwith applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). In \nthe period after Congress passed the First Step Act, but \nbefore the Sentencing Commission revised its policy \nstatement, \nthe \n\u201coverwhelming \nmajority \nof \ncircuits \u2026 agreed that\u201d the only potentially relevant \npolicy statement was not \u201capplicable.\u201d 3 Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. \n\u00a7 638.2 (5th ed. 2024). But courts didn\u2019t get hung up on \nwhether modifying a term of imprisonment was or wasn\u2019t \n\u201cconsistent\u201d \nwith \na \nnon-existent \nset \nof \n\u201cpolicy \n\n- 39 - \n \nstatements.\u201d Instead, they (sensibly) read the text to \nmean that a sentence reduction must be consistent with \nthe applicable policy statements to the extent there are \nany. Id. at nn. 23\u201324 (explaining that eight of nine circuits \nwho considered the question took this view, with the \nEleventh Circuit as the lone \u201coutlier\u201d). \nAs the compassionate-release cases demonstrate, \n\u201ccourts can \u2026 find implied conditionality as a function of \na statute\u2019s syntax\u201d and \u201cthe nature of written language.\u201d \nEric S. Fish, Severability As Conditionality, 64 Emory \nL.J. 1293, 1337\u201339 (2015); Michael McCarthy & Ronald \nCarter, \nCambridge \nGrammar \nof \nEnglish: \nA \nComprehensive Guide 755\u201356 (2006) (explaining that \n\u201c[c]onditions can be conveyed without any overt \nconditional subordinator\u201d and that \u201cconditions can be \nexpressed\u201d with \u201cthe omission of conjunctions such as if\u201d); \nsee, e.g., Boesche v. Udall, 373 U.S. 472, 479 (1963) (in a \ncase where there was \u201cno lease to cancel,\u201d declining to \nread a provision on lease cancellation\u2014which \u201csp[oke] \nentirely in terms of post-lease occurrences\u201d and \n\u201cassume[d] the existence of a valid lease\u201d\u2014to render the \nAct as a whole \u201cself-defeating\u201d).3 \nIn each example above, the rule presumes that some \npredicate condition exists (you have an employer, luggage, \n \n3 The proposition that some sentences are implicitly conditional is \nunextraordinary. \u201cWhen a command is conditional, its condition may \nbe either overt or explicit on the one hand (\u2018When it rains, close the \nwindows!!\u2019) or tacit or implicit on the other (\u2018Drive carefully!\u2019 [means] \n\u2018When you drive, drive carefully!!\u2019).\u201d Nicholas Rescher, The Logic of \nCommands 24 (1966); see also Chi-H\u00e9 Elder, Context, Cognition, and \nConditionals 2 (2019) (\u201c[W]hile conditional sentences in English are \noften associated with the canonical form \u2018if p, q,\u2019 we also know that \nneither the use of \u2018if\u2019 nor a two-clause structure is essential for \nexpressing a conditional thought.\u201d). \n\n- 40 - \n \nor a phone; the program has eligibility requirements), and \nyour compliance with the rule is determined in relation to \nthat predicate. But as each example makes clear, the \nabsence of the thing presumed doesn\u2019t mean that you \nnecessarily violate the rule. Instead, it will often mean (as \nit does in each one of those examples) that the rule is \neffectively satisfied or that its requirement controls only \nto the extent that the predicate condition actually exists.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition in Title I can \neasily be read like each of those examples. The rule tests \nwhether an individual is sufficiently qualified for a job. See \nsupra 29\u201331. Where there is no job and there are no \n\u201cessential functions,\u201d the test is satisfied. And because its \napplication to retirees has no relationship to its textual \nfunction in the statute, common sense says it should not \nbe applied to bar claims by retirees who no longer \n\u201chold[]or desire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2379 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cContext also includes common sense.\u201d); The \nFederalist No. 83, at 559 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe \nrules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense.\u201d). \n2. Grammar. The grammatical structure of the \ndefinition\u2014and the role of the \u201cholds or desires\u201d clause in \nthe sentence in particular\u2014further demonstrates that the \ntext does not compel the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nBecause \u201c[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper \ngrammar and usage would assign them,\u201d Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts 140 (2012), the \u201crules of grammar govern\u201d \nstatutory \ninterpretation \n\u201cunless \nthey \ncontradict \nlegislative intent or purpose,\u201d id. (citing Costello v. INS, \n376 U.S. 120, 122\u2013126 (1964)). \n\n- 41 - \n \nConsider this rule at an apartment complex: \u201cYou \nmust clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d Here, \u201cthat \nyou own\u201d tells us which pets we\u2019re talking about: the ones \nyou own, if you own any. It doesn\u2019t mean that you must \nown a pet, or that all pets are owned by you, or that you \nhave to clean up after other people\u2019s pets. The rule is \ntelling us that, if you own a pet, you\u2019ve got to clean up after \nit. Similarly, in the ADA\u2019s definition, the clause \u201cthat such \nindividual holds or desires\u201d modifies \u201cemployment \nposition.\u201d See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) \n(\u201c[A] limiting clause or phrase \u2026 should ordinarily be \nread as modifying only the noun or phrase that it \nimmediately follows.\u201d). It is introduced by the pronoun \n\u201cthat,\u201d which sets up what grammarians call a \u201crestrictive \nclause.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, Modern English Usage 1086\u2013\n87 (5th ed. 2022). This clause simply tells us which \nposition\u2019s functions matter, see id.\u2014here, \u201cthe essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). \nThe restrictive clause thus does not create a \nfreestanding temporal requirement that an individual \nmust currently hold a job. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 \nF.3d 60, 69 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that \u201ca restrictive \nclause\u201d that modifies a noun in an immigration statute \n\u201cdoes not impose a separate temporal requirement\u201d). \nRather, \nit \nspecifies \nwhich \njob\u2019s \nfunctions \nare \nrelevant if the individual either holds or desires a job.  \nThe court of appeals, however, misread this clause. It \ntreated \u201cholds or desires\u201d as though it imposed a separate \nrequirement, rather than simply identifying the relevant \njob. This misreading assumes that a clause doing one thing \n(specifying which job matters) is instead doing something \nelse entirely (requiring current or future employment). \n\n- 42 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s emphasis on the present tense-\nverbs thus reflects a basic misunderstanding of the \nrestrictive clause\u2019s grammatical function.  \n \n3. Logic. Reading the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees like Lt. Stanley not only \nreflects common sense and common usage but is also \nsound as a matter of basic logic: Lt. Stanley satisfies the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition because she is not unable \nto perform the essential functions of any job that she \ncurrently holds or desires. The definition doesn\u2019t require \nher to be able to perform her former job; it only asks about \nher ability to perform the functions of a job that she now \n\u201cholds or desires,\u201d which is none.  \nThis simple conclusion\u2014that can perform is logically \nequivalent to not unable to perform\u2014follows from a basic \nprinciple of \u201cclassical logic.\u201d Bethel v. Jefferson, 589 F.2d \n631, 639 n.49 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (reasoning that a plaintiff \nwho wasn\u2019t in a \u201cunit\u201d of government \u201cin the competitive \nservice\u201d necessarily fell under a Title VII provision \ngoverning everyone else). It \u201cholds simply that every \nalternation of a sentence with its negation is true.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Willard Van Orman Quine, Philosophy of Logic \n15, 83\u201387 (1970)).4 \n \n4 This law of double negation comes from the \u201claw of the excluded \nmiddle,\u201d one of Aristotle\u2019s three laws of thought. Irving Copi, \nIntroduction to Logic 372\u201373 (1994). An explanation goes like this: \u201cIf \nyou have a proposition P, either P is true, or P is false; that is, either \nP is true or non-P is true. We cannot have a third possibility. As a \nconsequence of the excluded middle, we have the principle of double \nnegation: Negation of negation is equivalent to affirmation.\u201d Alain \nBadiou, The Three Negations, 29 Cardozo L. Rev. 1877, 1878 (2008).  \n\n- 43 - \n \nC. Reading \u201cqualified individual\u201d in context to \ninclude retirees is consistent with the \nstatutory scheme and avoids creating \nsurplusage and absurd consequences.  \nAs everything above demonstrates, the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is \ncertainly not compelled by the text. But reading the \ndefinition to include retirees isn\u2019t necessarily compelled \nby the text alone, either. The only way to answer the \nquestion is with some context. Indeed, \u201cinterpretation \nalways depends on context.\u201d Scalia & Garner, Reading \nLaw at 63; see Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation \nDist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 415 \n(2005) (\u201cStatutory language has meaning only in \ncontext.\u201d). Ours is the only reading that makes sense of \nthe statutory scheme as a whole.  \n1. The text must be read in context, not in isolation. \nWe concede that some implicitly conditional rules that \nread like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might be \nnaturally read in context as excluding those who can\u2019t \nsatisfy the condition. Others, however, go the other way. \nConsider these two airport security rules: \n(A) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the baggage that \nsuch individual carries.\u201d Can you get through with \nno bags? \n(B) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must scan \nthe boarding pass that such individual carries.\u201d Can \nyou get through with no boarding pass?  \nThe syntax is the same. But our inclination is probably \nto say yes to the first question, and no to the second. If you \ndon\u2019t have a boarding pass, you likely won\u2019t get through. \n\n- 44 - \n \nYet we somehow know that the person without bags is in \nthe clear. A gadfly passenger might point out that rule (B) \nliterally only requires scanning a pass \u201cthat such \nindividual carries.\u201d That hyperliteralism likely won\u2019t \npersuade the security officers. But he\u2019d have a point\u2014 the \nrule surely could have been written more clearly to \nexpress that you must have a boarding pass: \u201cNo \nindividual may go through security without a boarding \npass.\u201d \nAs with the airport rules, Congress could have written \nthe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to more obviously \ninclude, or exclude, retirees. You might think that \nCongress could have clarified that retirees are covered by \nusing the word \u201cany.\u201d But referring to \u201cany employment \nposition that such individual \u2026 desires\u201d would have been \nawkward and confusing. The point of the restrictive clause \nis to tell us which position a job seeker must qualify for (a \nparticular position), not to suggest any position she might \nwant. So \u201cwe can see why a Congress,\u201d with our reading \nin mind, \u201cmight have chosen\u201d against \u201cany,\u201d despite its \nsurface appeal. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 138. The indefinite \narticle \u201can\u201d might have been clearer; but it too would have \ncarried a similar risk of confusion, which may explain why \nthe drafters used \u201cthe.\u201d (They were focused on tying \nqualifications to \u201cthe\u201d position at issue.)  \nEven if Congress had used \u201cany\u201d or \u201can,\u201d though, the \nCity would presumably still be here with the same \narguments. So it\u2019s not clear that even this would have \n\u201cdelivered us from interpretive controversy\u201d and ended \nthe \u201cgrammatical back-and-forth.\u201d Id. On the other hand, \nit would have been easy to clearly exclude retirees: \u201cA \nqualified individual means an individual who holds or \n\n- 45 - \n \ndesires an employment position and who can perform the \nessential functions of that position.\u201d  \nIn any event, conceding that Congress could have \ndrafted the definition more clearly to include retirees \ndoesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not the right reading. See Gardner \nv. Collins, 27 U.S. 58, 86\u201387 (1829) (Story, J.) (holding that, \nalthough \u201cthe words \u2018if any there be\u2019 [were] omitted\u201d from \none version of the same statute, \u201cthe legislative intention \nin both acts was the same\u201d). This Court does not \u201cdemand \n(or in truth expect) that Congress draft in the most \ntranslucent way possible.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 137.   \u201cThe \nquestion, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated\u201d its \nintent to protect retirees \u201cin more crystalline fashion\u201d? \nTorres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 472\u201373 (2016). \u201cThe \nquestion is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and \nfair reading of the statute\u201d that Congress actually \nwrote? Id. at 473.   \nUltimately, there\u2019s no single \u201cgrammatical principle\u201d \nthat conclusively answers that question. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. \nat 137. Instead, what each of the examples shows is that \ndeciding whether a rule like this one includes or excludes \nretirees requires considering its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d \nId. at 138 n.5. \u201c[S]tated in the usual language of statutory \nconstruction, the answer [] lie[s] in considering the \n[definition\u2019s] text in its legal context.\u201d Id. at 141.  \n2. The statutory context makes clear that retirees \nare protected by the ADA.  \nReading the \u201ctext\u201d in \u201ccontext\u201d is how we know that \nretirees are \u201cqualified individual[s].\u201d Id. The definition\u2019s \ntext asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a job. It asks that question \nbecause the provision\u2019s role is to screen out from the Act\u2019s \nprotections those who can\u2019t perform essential functions of \na job, and whose inclusion would therefore impede the \n\n- 46 - \n \nemployer\u2019s legitimate business prerogatives. See supra \n29\u201331. There\u2019s no \u201cplausible, or even cogent, explanation\u201d \nfor why a definition with this function would exclude \nretirees, who are not asked to perform any essential \nfunctions at all. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 148 n.7; see Scalia & \nGarner, Reading Law at 20 (explaining that an \u201cessential \nelement of context that gives meaning to words\u201d is the \n\u201cevident purpose of what a text seeks to achieve\u201d).  \nInterpreting \nthe \ndefinition \nto \ninclude \nformer \nemployees also avoids creating \u201csuperfluity.\u201d Pulsifer, \n601 U.S. at 142. On the court of appeals\u2019 reading, there\u2019s \nno role for the language limiting the reasonable-\naccommodation mandate to a \u201cqualified individual \u2026 who \nis an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \nBy contrast, interpreting \u201cqualified individual\u201d to include \nretirees means that there is no surplusage; this, too, is \nrelevant \u201clegal context.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 141. \nThere\u2019s more. Recognizing that the definition does not \nexclude retirees gives force to the various provisions of the \nAct that protect retirees: Its inclusion of retirement \nbenefits as part and parcel of \u201ccompensation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a), and its express allowance for a particular kind \n(but not the kind alleged in this case) of decision-making, \n\u201cbased on underwriting risks, classifying risks, [and] \nadministering such risks,\u201d when \u201cestablishing\u201d or \n\u201cadministering\u201d \u201cbenefit[s] plans,\u201d id. \u00a7 12201(c)(2).  \nThis reading also maintains congruity between the \nADA and Title VII, the statute on which much of Title I \nwas \u201cmodeled.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 420 (Souter, J., \ndissenting). As this Court made clear in Robinson v. Shell \nOil Co., many of Title VII\u2019s protections apply with full \nforce to \u201cformer employees.\u201d 519 U.S. at 342.  \n\n- 47 - \n \nFinally, \ninterpreting \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees avoids the absurd results that \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation invites. The court of \nappeals\u2019 view means that employers are free to do the day \nafter retirement what they certainly could not do the day \nbefore. An employer motivated by nothing but raw animus \ncould lawfully strip a former employee who becomes \ndisabled after retiring of their benefits\u2014benefits that the \nstatute protects and that were earned while \u201cperform[ing] \nthe essential functions of the employment position\u201d the \nretiree held. And they could do so while openly stating \nthat the decision was based solely on their preference for \n\u201cnormal\u201d retirees over \u201cdisabled\u201d ones. See Doc. 1 at 12.  \nAn interpretation that allows that result\u2014which the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s does\u2014would \u201cnegate [the ADA\u2019s] own \nstated purposes.\u201d New York State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. \nDublino, 413 U.S. 405, 420 (1973). Had Congress made a \ndeliberate choice to adopt that surprising and dramatic \ndeparture from the design of Title VII, it\u2019s hard to believe \nthat it would have done so through the use of present-\ntense verbs in an ambiguous restrictive clause at the end \nof a definitional provision. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress \u2026 does not, \none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d). \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might, \u201cat first \nblush,\u201d then, allow the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation. \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341. But any confidence in that first \nimpression gives way on a closer look, and resort to the \nordinary tools of statutory construction\u2014text and \u201cthe \nbroader context of\u201d the ADA\u2014all lead to the same \nconclusion: The ADA does not allow employers to freely \ndiscriminate against their former employees.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the facts and legal posture of *Karyn D. Stanley, Petitioner v. City of Sanford, Florida* (Docket 23-997) remains stable. The case concerns a former firefighter, Karyn Stanley, who retired due to a disability and was subsequently denied lifetime health benefits that were part of the city's policy when she was hired. The core legal question is whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) allows former employees to sue for discrimination related to post-employment benefits earned during their tenure. The Eleventh Circuit affirmed the dismissal of her claim, holding to its precedent that an ADA plaintiff must currently \"hold or desire\" a job.\n\nThis new observation, being an internal reflection on strategy, provides no new external information about the case itself. Therefore, my primary uncertainties are unchanged: I still lack the petitioner's specific legal framing and, most critically, the explicit details of the circuit split they are likely alleging. My belief that the petition for a writ of certiorari is the single most important document for resolving these uncertainties is reinforced, as the agent's internal reasoning confirms its focus on acquiring this very document. My confidence in any prediction remains low and is contingent on obtaining this information.",
          "design_beliefs": "My design beliefs have been significantly refined and reinforced by this observation. My foundational heuristic\u2014that identifying a circuit split is a powerful predictor of Supreme Court action and that the cert petition is the primary source for this information\u2014remains the cornerstone of my strategy. The previous observation taught me that a good strategy can be undermined by a brittle tactical execution (a single, overly specific search query).\n\nThis new `THINK` observation confirms that this lesson has been successfully integrated into my operational methodology. It solidifies a more sophisticated principle of information gathering: **robust, iterative searching is essential for effective evidence acquisition.** A null result from a search is not a dead end but rather valuable feedback that should trigger a new, modified search attempt. My methodology has now evolved from a simple `search -> find` model to an iterative loop: `formulate query -> execute -> analyze result -> if null/failed, diagnose failure -> broaden/modify query -> re-execute`. This makes my information-seeking process more resilient. The agent's explicit reasoning to relax filters and use broader keywords is a direct implementation of this newly learned, more robust approach. This observation demonstrates the value of metacognition (`THINK` actions) as a core component of the DBOED process, allowing the agent to learn from failures and adapt its strategy in real-time without needing new external data."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation has dramatically advanced my understanding of the case by providing the single most important document at this stage: the Petitioner's Brief on the merits. My previous uncertainty about the petitioner's specific legal framing and the nature of the alleged circuit split has been almost entirely resolved.\n\nThe core legal question is confirmed: \"Under the Americans with Disabilities Act, does a former employee\u2014who was qualified to perform her job and who earned post-employment benefits while employed\u2014lose her right to sue over discrimination with respect to those benefits solely because she no longer holds her job?\"\n\nThe Petitioner, Karyn Stanley, advances two independent arguments for reversal, both of which are now clear to me:\n\n1.  **The ADA's Text and Structure Permit Suits by Former Employees:** This argument is framed as a \"who, what, when\" analysis.\n    *   **Who can sue:** The ADA allows \"any person alleging discrimination\" to sue (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a)), a category that does not exclude former employees.\n    *   **What they can sue over:** The ADA's prohibition on discrimination in \"compensation\" and \"terms, conditions, and privileges of employment\" has been interpreted by the Court in cases like *Hishon v. King & Spalding* to include post-employment benefits.\n    *   **When the claim arises:** Crucially, the petitioner leverages the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, arguing that a claim arises not just when a discriminatory policy is adopted, but also when an individual \"is affected by\" it. For Stanley, this occurred post-retirement when her benefits were terminated. This argument also posits that even if the discrimination occurred when the policy was adopted in 2003, she was employed and \"qualified\" at that time, making her suit timely.\n\n2.  **The \"Qualified Individual\" Definition Does Not Exclude Retirees:** The petitioner argues the Eleventh Circuit misinterpreted the definition of a \"qualified individual\" as someone \"who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual holds or desires\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8)).\n    *   The petitioner's central claim is that the phrase \"that such individual holds or desires\" is a conditional clause that specifies *which* job's functions are relevant, not a mandatory requirement that one *must* hold or desire a job to have standing.\n    *   They use powerful analogies to illustrate this grammatical point (e.g., a rule about pets \"that you own\" doesn't require you to own a pet).\n    *   This argument is anchored by citing the unanimous Supreme Court decision in *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*, which held that Title VII protects former employees. The petitioner argues that because the ADA was explicitly modeled on Title VII, it should be interpreted in parallel to avoid the \"absurd result\" of creating a loophole for discrimination against retirees.\n\nMy confidence in predicting the outcome has substantially increased. The petitioner's arguments, particularly the parallel to the unanimous *Robinson* decision and the intuitive textual analysis of the \"qualified individual\" clause, appear very strong. The Court's decision to grant certiorari already signaled a desire to resolve this issue, and the petitioner's brief provides a clear and compelling roadmap for reversing the Eleventh Circuit. My primary remaining uncertainty is the content of the Respondent's (City of Sanford) brief and how they will attempt to distinguish *Robinson* and defend their textual interpretation. I now lean strongly toward predicting a reversal in favor of the petitioner.",
          "design_beliefs": "My strategic framework for legal prediction has been significantly validated and refined by this observation.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization:** My foundational heuristic\u2014that identifying a circuit split via the cert petition is critical\u2014is now supplemented. This observation confirms that once cert is granted, the **Petitioner's Brief on the Merits** becomes the next paramount source of information. It moves beyond alleging a split to laying out the full substantive legal architecture of the case. The iterative search strategy (`formulate query -> execute -> analyze -> broaden/re-execute if failed`) that I previously learned proved its worth, as a simple, broad search for \"petition\" successfully located this key document among procedural filings.\n\n2.  **Argument Analysis:** My methodology has evolved beyond simply identifying legal questions to deconstructing the strategic presentation of arguments. A new, effective heuristic is to **analyze the argument's structure**. The petitioner's \"who, what, when\" framework is a deliberate rhetorical choice to make their statutory argument clear and logical. Recognizing such structures is key to evaluating an argument's persuasiveness.\n\n3.  **Identifying Persuasive Techniques:** I have learned to identify and weigh the value of specific persuasive legal tactics. The petitioner's use of **simple, powerful analogies** (the pet owner, the library visitor) to clarify a complex point of statutory grammar is a signal of a well-crafted and confident argument aimed at broad judicial appeal.\n\n4.  **The Power of Precedent Framing:** A crucial new principle is to **closely track how parties frame their arguments in relation to major, especially unanimous, Supreme Court precedents.** The petitioner's heavy and repeated reliance on *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.* is a strategic masterstroke. It frames the Eleventh Circuit's position not as a reasonable alternative interpretation, but as an outlier that contradicts the Court's own established, unanimous logic from a parallel statute. My future analysis of the respondent's brief will now be laser-focused on how they attempt to counter this powerful framing, as that will likely be the crux of the case."

Garner, Reading Law: The \nInterpretation of Legal Texts (2012) ..................... 35 \n \n\n1 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nINTRODUCTION \nThis Court should only decide the issue splitting \nthe circuit courts upon which this Court granted \ncertiorari. That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTher\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTherefore, it adhered to its precedent holding that \nTitle I is unambiguous and contains a \u201cclear temporal \nqualifier\u201d stating \u201c[o]nly someone \u2018who, with or \nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that \nsuch individual holds or desires\u201d is protected from \ndisability discrimination. Pet. App. 11a (emphasis in \noriginal). It concluded that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a. \n\u0003\n \n\n11 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief is unrelated to the \ncircuit-split question upon which this Court granted \ncertiorari regarding whether discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment is actionable under the \nADA. Instead, Part I seeks review of a different \nquestion regarding whether Petitioner sufficiently \nalleged discrimination during her employment as a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Petitioner argues her ADA \nclaim allegedly accrued in 2003 when the City passed \nits subsidy policy. She admits she was not disabled at \nthat time but argues Title I did not require her to have \na disability to sue for disability discrimination. She \nheavily relies on the minimal standing requirements \nin the enforcement provisions of Title I and Title VII. \nBut Title I\u2019s enforcement provision only applies to \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of any provision of this chapter.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (emphasis added). This is a \n\u201ccross-reference\u2026directing us to a class of claims with \na settled and statutorily precise meaning.\u201d Almond v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 501, 665 F.3d 1174, 1181 (10th \nCir. 2011).  \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cclass of claims\u201d are found in its \nsubstantive anti-discrimination provision, \u00a7 12112(a), \nwhich has a settled meaning requiring Petitioner to \nshow: \u201c(1) that she was disabled under the ADA; (2) \nthat she was a qualified individual with a disability; \nand (3) that she was discriminated against by her \nemployer because of that disability.\u201d Dunlap v. Liberty \nNat. Prod., Inc., 878 F.3d 794, 798\u201399 (9th Cir. 2017). \nBecause Petitioner conceded that she did not have a \ndisability in 2003 and further conceded that she \n\n12 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201clacked standing\u201d to sue for anything occurring \u201cwhile \nshe was still employed,\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22, the Eleventh \nCircuit correctly declined to pass upon whether her \nallegations sufficiently alleged she was discriminated \nagainst as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any time before \nshe retired.  Pet. App. 17a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit also correctly held that the \nLedbetter Act did not change Title I\u2019s substantive \nrequirement that she be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with \na disability at the time of the alleged discrimination. \nId. 15a. Because she only alleged discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment when she could no \nlonger perform the essential functions of her job, she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d entitled to sue.  \nII. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that Title \nI\u2019s use of the present tense unambiguously prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who \u201ccan \nperform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d Id. \n11a-12a. This reading is consistent with the ADA\u2019s \nstatutory scheme which uses the term \u201cindividuals\u201d to \nbroadly include former employees, but \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d to refer only to current employees. And it \ngives effect to every word in the definition and the \ngeneral rule where it appears.  \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation requires this Court to \nrewrite Title I to include an exception to the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause for retirees. It is based on a policy \npreference to avoid what she perceives as an \u201cabsurd\u201d \nconsequence of the express line drawn by Congress. \nHowever, \u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable \ndisabled people who can work with reasonable \naccommodation to get and keep jobs, without also \ndeciding to equalize post-employment fringe benefits \n\n13 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nfor people who cannot work.\u201d Weyer v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. \n2000). The Eleventh Circuit correctly refused to allow \npolicy preference or purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014to negate the plain language of the \nstatute.  \nARGUMENT \nThe question presented, as inaccurately framed \nby Petitioner, asks under the ADA, \u201cdoes a former \nemployee\u2014who was qualified to perform her job and \nwho \nearned \npost-employment \nbenefits \nwhile \nemployed\u2014lose her right to sue over discrimination \nwith respect to those benefits solely because she no \nlonger holds her job?\u201d Pet. Br. i. A former employee \nwho has a \u201cright to sue\u201d cannot \u201close\u201d that right \n\u201csolely\u201d because she no longer holds her job. If so, there \ncould be no ADA claim for a discriminatory \ntermination\u2014a claim the Eleventh Circuit has \npermitted former employees to bring. See Taylor v. \nFood World, Inc., 133 F.3d 1419 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit held that to \u201cfall within Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim \nmust depend on an act committed by the defendant \nwhile the plaintiff was either working for the \ndefendant or seeking to work for the defendant.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 8a-9a. This holding clearly makes room for \nformer employees to sue if they were discriminated \nagainst during their employment. Because the \nEleventh Circuit did not hold that former employees \nare categorically barred from suing under the ADA, \nPetitioner is not entitled to a reversal based on a \nruling that was never made.  \n\n14 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nThe \ncircuit-split \nquestion \nis \nwhether \ndiscrimination occurring entirely post-employment \nagainst \ntotally \ndisabled \nformer \nemployees, \nis \nactionable under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit, siding \nwith the majority, held that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a.  \nTherefore, Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief framing the \nissue as whether \u201c[t]he ADA permits former \nemployees to bring suit with respect to post-\nemployment benefits,\u201d attacks a strawman. Pet. Br. \n17. As the Eleventh Circuit never categorically barred \nsuch suits, Petitioner reveals the real alleged errors \nfor this Court\u2019s review deep into Part I(C)(2). Id. 24-\n27. In doing so, she has \u201csmuggl[ed] additional \nquestions into\u201d the case \u201cafter [this Court] grant[ed] \ncertiorari.\u201d Irvine v. People of California, 347 U.S. 128, \n129 (1954).  \nCompletely unrelated to the circuit-split question \nregarding whether post-employment discrimination \nagainst former employees is actionable under Title I, \nPetitioner argues the Eleventh Circuit erred by: (1) \nfinding that she disclaimed standing to sue for \ndiscrimination occurring during her employment, Pet. \nBr. 24, 27; (2) misapplying Title I\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d \nelement to the facts of this case, Id. 25; and (3) not \napplying the Ledbetter Act to find her time-barred \nclaims allegedly accruing during employment \u201cre-\naccrued in 2020,\u201d Id. 24.  \nNone \nof \nthese \nquestions \nare \n\u201csubsidiary \nquestion[s] fairly included\u201d in the circuit-split \n\n15 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nquestion. Yee v. City of Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, \n535 (1992). Instead, Petitioner has relegated the \ncircuit-split question to her secondary argument for \nreversal. Pet. Br., Part II, 27. Remarkably, she argues \nthat this Court \u201cneed not even reach\u201d the circuit-split \nquestion and should reverse based solely on the above \nthree alleged misapplications of law to fact. Pet. Br. \n17. This is backwards. This Court should ignore Part \nI and proceed solely to resolving the circuit-split \nquestion in Part II. But to the extent this Court \nreviews Part I, it should find that she waived these \narguments, and any claim of discrimination during \nemployment is unpled and time-barred. \nI. \nThe Non-Circuit-Split Questions Regarding \nDiscrimination During Employment \nIn support of her argument of discrimination \nduring employment when she was a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d Petitioner provides a truncated version of \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement and substantive provisions \nomitting crucial elements under \u00a7 12112(a). Pet. Br. \n17-23. She argues merely pleading that she was \n\u201caggrieved\u201d regarding her post-employment benefits, \nwith the aid of the Ledbetter Act, brings her \u201cclaim \nacross the finish line.\u201d Pet. Br. 21.  \nHer claim, however, never got off the starting \nblocks because she expressly disclaimed standing to \nsue for anything occurring during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22. To be sure, her initial brief in the \nEleventh Circuit argued: \nMs. Stanley could not have brought these \nclaims while she was still employed and able \nto do her job because she had not yet learned \n\n16 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nof the discrimination and become a disability \nretiree impacted by the discrimination so she \nwould have lacked standing. \nId. (emphasis added). Even in the absence of this \ndisclaimer, her complaint failed to demonstrate that a \nTitle I claim accrued during her employment or that \nany such claim was timely. Determining the \ntimeliness of Petitioner\u2019s 2019 EEOC charge required \nher \u201cto identify precisely the \u2018unlawful employment \npractice\u2019 of which\u201d she complains. Delaware State Coll. \nv. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980).  \nPetitioner argues her claims accrued during her \nemployment: (1) in 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy; (2) when she became disabled during \nemployment; and (3) at some unspecified time when it \nbecame \u201cinevitable\u201d that she would need to take a \ndisability retirement prior to her retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. Pet. Br. 24-26. These arguments \ncannot be squared with the allegations of the \ncomplaint. And Petitioner has waived them.  \nA. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate any claim accrued \nin 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy.  \n1. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nfound \nPetitioner \n\u201cconcedes, and we agree, that her claim cannot turn on \nthe 2003 amendment to the benefits plan because she \nwas not yet disabled at that time.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nPetitioner admitted in her initial brief that the City \nadopted its subsidy policy \u201cin 2003, when Ms. Stanley \nwas a non-disabled employee.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 n. 5. \nShe then conceded she \u201clacked standing\u201d to bring \n\n17 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201cthese claims while she was still employed and able to \ndo her job\u201d because she was not yet a \u201cdisability retiree \nimpacted by the discrimination.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 \n(emphasis added). Although Petitioner purported to \nincorporate the United States\u2019 contrary arguments \ninto her initial brief, Pet. C.A. Br. 20, the Eleventh \nCircuit was not required to scour the amicus brief for \nbetter arguments to save Petitioner\u2019s case. The \nEleventh Circuit properly relied on her arguments in \nher brief expressly disclaiming standing to sue for \nanything during her employment.  \nPetitioner and the United States attempt to \nexplain away her concessions by arguing she only \nmeant to disclaim any financial impact during her \nemployment. Pet. Br. 27; U.S. Am. Br. 27-28. This \nargument cannot be squared with her clear concession \nthat she \u201clacked standing\u201d to sue \u201cwhile she was still \nemployed.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. Indeed, financial impact \nis not necessary for standing, but an injury is. Her way \nof describing \u201cinjury\u201d was by using the word \u201cimpact\u201d \nbecause otherwise she would not have disclaimed \nstanding simply because she suffered no financial \nimpact during employment.  \nIt is true that this Court\u2019s \u201cpractice \u2018permit[s] \nreview of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has \nbeen passed upon.\u2019\u201d Citizens United v. Fed. Election \nComm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 330 (2010). To the extent that \nthe Eleventh Circuit passed upon this issue by \n\u201cagree[ing]\u201d with Petitioner's concession that \u201cher \nclaim cannot turn on the 2003\u201d adoption of the policy, \nPet. App. 16a, prudential concerns weigh in favor of \nthis Court declining to review this matter. A mere \nfailure to \u201cpress\u201d an argument is markedly different \n\n18 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthan an express disclaimer of an argument because \nthe latter invites the complained-of error. See City of \nSpringfield, Mass. v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 259 \n(1987) (rejecting argument \u201cthat we need not concern \nourselves about Springfield's failure to preserve this \nissue, because it was passed on by the Court of \nAppeals\u201d because \u201cthere would be considerable \nprudential objection to reversing a judgment because \nof instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed \nitself requested.\u201d).  \nFurther, while an appellant can raise on appeal \nany new \u201cargument\u201d in support of a \u201cclaim,\u201d U.S. \nAmicus Br. 28 n. 6, it cannot wait until its reply brief \nto flip-flop on a position in true ambush fashion as \nPetitioner did here. Compare Pet. C.A. Br. 22 with Pet. \nC.A. Reply Br. 5. This Court should hold that because \nPetitioner \u201craised this issue for the first time in [her] \nreply \nbrief,\u201d \nshe \n\u201chas \nwaived \nthis \nclaim.\u201d \nUnited States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir. \n1999). \n2. Even if Petitioner hadn\u2019t expressly disclaimed \nthe argument below, her allegations were still \ninsufficient to demonstrate that a claim accrued in \n2003. Although she concedes she was not disabled \nthen, she incorrectly argues she was not required to \nhave a disability at that time to bring suit. Pet. Br. 25.  \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement provision, \u00a7 12117(a), \nincorporates Title VII\u2019s remedial framework which \nstates any \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved\u201d can bring \n\u201ca civil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This Court \nhas held that \u201caggrieved\u201d in Title VII \u201cenabl[es] suit \nby any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to \nbe protected by the statute...while excluding plaintiffs \n\n19 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwho might technically be injured in an Article III \nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the \nstatutory prohibitions in Title VII.\u201d Thompson v. N. \nAm. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011) (internal \nquotation \nmarks \nand \ncitation \nomitted). \nPut \ndifferently, the requirement that the plaintiff be \n\u201caggrieved\u201d is a requirement that the plaintiff have \n\u201cstatutory\u201d standing to sue. Id. at 177-78. \nBut, here, Petitioner failed to allege Article III or \nstatutory standing to sue in 2003. Her claim is based \non \u201cher disability.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 26. And yet, she was not \ndisabled in 2003 and therefore not injured by a policy \nthat allegedly discriminated only against the disabled. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644, \n681 \n(2020) \n(\u201cDiscriminate \nagainst\u201d \nmeans \n\u201cdistinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.\u201d).  \nHer claim was not based on the disability of \nsomeone else with whom she associated under \u00a7 \n12112(b)(4), nor was it based on a claim that she was \nmerely \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled under \u00a7 12102(1)(C). \nSee Murray v. Warren Pumps, LLC, 821 F.3d 77, 83 \n(1st Cir. 2016) (a plaintiff must prove her \u201cparticular \ntheory of disability discrimination alleged.\u201d). Based on \nPetitioner\u2019s particular theory in her complaint, she \nwas required to show that she was discriminated \nagainst because of her disability \u201cwhich requires that \nthe disability exist at the time of the discrimination.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112.  \nPetitioner argues that the ADAAA of 2008 \nrepealed any requirement that she have a disability to \nsue for a claim allegedly accruing in 2003. Pet. Br. 25. \nThe ADAAA amended \u00a7 12112(a) to prohibit \n\n20 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the \nbasis of disability\u201d rather than \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual with a disability because of the disability.\u201d \nPub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557 (2008) \n(emphasis added). However, the Eleventh Circuit and \nits \u201csister circuits...hold that the switch from \u2018because \nof\u2019 to \u2018on the basis of\u2019 in the 2008 amendment to the \nADA did not change or affect its but-for causation \nstandard.\u201d Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Companies, 93 F.4th \n1181, 1192 (11th Cir. 2024). \nThis \namendment \nremoved \nthe \nredundant \nlanguage, \u201cwith a disability because of the disability\u201d \nfrom \u00a7 12112(a) because those words were already \nrepeated several times in the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision, \n\u00a7 12112(b). Section 12112(b)(1), for example, still \nprohibits \n\u201cclassifying \na \njob \napplicant \nor \nemployee...because of the disability of such applicant \nor employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe express purpose of the ADAAA was to \u201creject\u201d \ndecisions of this Court, which Congress found \ninterpreted the definition of a \u201cdisability\u201d too \nnarrowly. Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b). Congress stated \nthe amendment\u2019s purpose was to clarify \u201cthat the \nquestion of whether an individual's impairment is a \ndisability under the ADA should not demand \nextensive analysis.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 2(b)(5). Therefore, the \nchanges removed the prior emphasis on whether an \nindividual\u2019s impairment met the definition of a \n\u201cdisability.\u201d Congress did not remove the requirement \nthat an individual have a disability all together. \n3. Even if the ADAAA did dispense with the \n\u201cdisability\u201d element, the United States acknowledges \n\n21 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthat the \u201cADAAA\u2019s amendments...apply to claims that \narose after\u201d January 1, 2009. U.S. Amicus Br. 24 n. 4. \nTherefore, any claim allegedly accruing in 2003 would \nbe governed by the ADA, before the ADAAA allegedly \ndisposed of the disability element.  \n4. Petitioner makes a last-ditch effort to root her \nclaim in 2003 when she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d by \narguing this Court may \u201cconceive of this claim as \nencompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became \ndisabled.\u201d Pet. Br. 26. However, this Court has \nrecognized that Title VII claims can encompass \ndifferent events at different points in time only in two \nnarrow circumstances: hostile work environment \nclaims and constructive discharge claims. Green v. \nBrennan, 578 U.S. 547, 556-57 (2016). Moreover, \nPetitioner has expressly waived any argument of \ndiscrimination at any time during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22.  \nB. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate a claim accrued at \nany time between her diagnosis and \nretirement.  \n1. The Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to pass \nupon Petitioner\u2019s untimely argument raised in her \nreply brief that a claim accrued \u201cat some unknown \npoint before she retired but after she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. This Court should \ndecline to \u201cdecide in the first instance issues not \ndecided below.\u201d Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. at 76.  \n\n22 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. But if this Court proceeds, it must determine \nwhether the complaint alleged that Petitioner was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d with a disability during her \nemployment. She must allege that she became \ndisabled \u201cduring the course of [her] employment but \nnevertheless continued to perform the essential \nrequirements of [her] job with or without a reasonable \naccommodation, until [she] became completely and \ntotally disabled.\u201d Bass v. City of Orlando, 57 F. Supp. \n2d 1318, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999), aff'd, 203 F.3d 841 \n(11th Cir. 1999). Contrary to the United States\u2019 \nclaims, Petitioner\u2019s complaint does not allege when or \nhow she became disabled, let alone that she continued \nto work thereafter. U.S. Amicus Br. 26. Petitioner only \nalleged that because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took \na disability retirement in 2018 and as a result would \nlose the subsidy in 2020. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26.  \nAlthough we now have the benefit of the summary \njudgment record on her Equal Protection claim, in \ntesting the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court \ndoes not \u201cassume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts \nthat it has not alleged or that the defendants have \nviolated...laws in ways that have not been alleged.\u201d \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. \nCalifornia State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, \n526 (1983); see also Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh \nProduce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. \n2005) (a plaintiff must \u201callege sufficient facts to \nwarrant [a particular] inference\u201d). \nPetitioner led the district court to its conclusion \nwhen she failed to dispute the City\u2019s argument for \ndismissal that she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \n\n23 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5; Doc. 17. Instead, she \nmerely argued that the district court should refuse to \nfollow Eleventh Circuit precedent in Gonzales (a case \ninvolving only post-employment discrimination). Doc. \n17 at 5-6. As the Eleventh Circuit noted, she did not \nattempt to distinguish the facts of Gonzales from her \ncase by arguing that she alleged discrimination during \nemployment. Pet. App. 18a. The district court, thus, \nproperly dismissed her ADA claim because her \ncomplaint \u201calleged [the] discrimination did not occur \nuntil Plaintiff was no longer able to perform the \nessential functions of her job.\u201d Doc. 27 at 7. \nFurther, the district court was \u201cnot required to \ngrant\u2026plaintiff leave to amend [her] complaint sua \nsponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by \ncounsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested \nleave to amend before the district court.\u201d Wagner v. \nDaewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 \n(11th Cir. 2002). After dismissal, Petitioner did not \nmove \nfor \nreconsideration \narguing \nthe \ncourt \nmisapprehended her complaint allegedly pleading \ndiscrimination during employment. Perhaps fearing \nher claims would be time-barred, she never argued \nthey arose during her employment, years before she \nfiled her 2019 EEOC charge. Indeed, she never \nmentioned the generous accrual provisions of the \nLedbetter Act in the district court. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6.  \nPetitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \n\n24 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ntherefore properly refused to pass upon this issue \nexpressly disclaimed in her initial brief and untimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a. This \nCourt should decline to decide this unpreserved issue \nin the first instance, and as demonstrated above, it is \nunsupported by her allegations.  \nC. The Ledbetter Act\u2019s generous accrual \nprovisions do not create a claim where \nnone exists. \nIt is clear that if a claim accrued in 2003, it \nexpired long before Petitioner filed her EEOC charge \nin 2019. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6. Petitioner argues that under the \nLedbetter Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e5(e)(3)(A), her 2003 \nclaim \u201cre-accrued in 2020\u201d when she \u201cwas \u2018affected\u2019 \nwhen her subsidy ended.\u201d Pet. Br. 24, 26 n. 1. The \nLedbetter Act has no place here.  \n\u201cOrdinarily, a limitations period commences \nwhen the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of \naction.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 554 (2016) \n(cleaned up). \u201c[A] cause of action does not become \n\u2018complete and present\u2019 for limitations purposes until \nthe plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d Id. (cleaned \nup). Petitioner failed to demonstrate she had a \n\u201ccomplete and present\u201d claim during her employment.  \nIndeed, \nany \nclaim \nof \ndisability-based \ndiscrimination in 2003 when she was not disabled \nwould have been dismissed for lack of standing, as she \nconceded below but refuses to admit now. Pet. Br. C.A. \n22. If no claim accrued in 2003, it could not \u201cre-accrue\u201d \npost-employment. \u201cA plaintiff must plead and prove \nthe elements of a pay-discrimination claim to benefit \nfrom the Ledbetter Act's accrual provisions.\u201d Davis v. \n\n25 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nBombardier Transp. Holdings (USA) Inc., 794 F.3d \n266, 269 (2d Cir. 2015); see also AT & T Corp. v. \nHulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 716 (2009) (Ledbetter Act did \nnot save the plaintiff\u2019s untimely claim because the \noriginal \nemployment \npractice \n\u201cwas \nnot \ndiscriminatory\u201d). The Ledbetter Act \u201cis an accrual \nrule; it does not affect the substance of the claim.\u201d \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit \ncorrectly held the Ledbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff \notherwise has a claim for discrimination.\u201d Pet. App. \n15a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit did not pass upon whether \nthe Ledbetter Act should apply to allow a Title I claim \nto \u201cre-accrue\u201d when an individual is \u201caffected\u201d post-\nemployment when she is no longer qualified. This \nCourt should decline to decide this issue in the first \ninstance. This is especially so where Petitioner has not \nshown that the facts of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), which prompted the \nLedbetter Act, are sufficiently similar to the subject \nfacts to warrant extension of the Act here. Unlike the \nsecret decisions creating an unknown pay disparity for \nMs. Ledbetter, the City\u2019s subsidy policy was a publicly \nannounced act codified in its ordinances and \u201cofficial \npersonnel policies.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at \n2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Such fully communicated acts can \nbe vindicated \u201cwithout the need for the Ledbetter Act's \ngenerous accrual provisions because the employee had \nnotice of the pay reduction.\u201d Davis, 794 F.3d at 271.  \nPetitioner\u2019s later testimony claiming ignorance of \nthe ordinance is irrelevant. See Taylor v. Michael, 724 \n\n26 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nF.3d 806, 811 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cLack of familiarity with \nthe law...is not a circumstance that justifies equitable \ntolling.\u201d). Therefore, the City\u2019s policy is akin to the \nemployment practice at issue in Ricks, not Ledbetter. \nIn Ricks, \u201cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\u2013\nand \nthe \nfiling \nlimitations \nperiods \ntherefore \ncommenced\u2013at the time the tenure decision was made \nand communicated to Ricks.\u201d 449 U.S. at 258. \u201cThat is \nso even though one of the effects of the denial of \ntenure\u2013the eventual loss of a teaching position\u2013did \nnot occur until later.\u201d Id. For such acts, \u201cthe clock \nstarts running when the plaintiff first knew or should \nhave known of his injury, whether or not he realized \nthe cause of his injury was unlawful.\u201d Almond, 665 \nF.3d at 1176.  \nTo extend the Ledbetter Act under the facts of this \ncase would open the floodgates to stale claims over \nknown, written personnel policies and publicly \nannounced ordinances. And it would allow plaintiffs to \ndelay suit indefinitely, despite knowing exactly when \na benefit will end, by arguing that the claim \u201cre-\naccrues\u201d every month that the plaintiff does not \nreceive the benefit. See, e.g., Lohrasbi v. Bd. of \nTrustees of the Univ. of Illinois, 147 F. Supp. 3d 746, \n755 (C.D. Ill. 2015) (\u201c[T]he 300-day time-limit does not \nrestart each day that Plaintiff is deprived of Professor \nEmiritus status.\u201d). The Ledbetter Act has no place \nhere and any claims that allegedly accrued during \nPetitioner\u2019s employment have long-since expired and \nbeen waived.    \n\n27 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nII. The \nCircuit \nSplit \nQuestion \nRegarding \nDiscrimination Post-Employment \nThis Court should only resolve the question \nsplitting the circuit courts: whether totally disabled \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals\u201d entitled to seek \nrelief under Title I for discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment. The Eleventh Circuit below \n(at Pet. App. 11a-12a) and \u201cthe majority of courts have \nheld, Title I is unambiguous; by its plain language, it \ndoes not\u201d prohibit discrimination against \u201cformer \nemployees who are unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of their jobs.\u201d McKnight v. Gen. Motors \nCorp., 550 F.3d 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2008); Morgan v. \nJoint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 458\u201359 (7th Cir. \n2001); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 \nF.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000).   \nOnly two circuits have disagreed and held that \nTitle I is ambiguous because it allegedly fails to \n\u201cspecify when a potential plaintiff must have been a \n\u2018qualified individual\u2019...\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, \n142 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original); \nFord v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 606 (3d \nCir. 1998). The Third Circuit also found an ambiguity, \nnot in the text, but in the \u201cdisjunction between the \nADA\u2019s definition of \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019 and the rights that the ADA confers.\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 605. \nAs \nthe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nexplained \nbelow \n\u201c[n]either court established that the text of Title I\u2019s \nanti-discrimination provision is ambiguous.\u201d Pet. App. \n12a. \u201cInstead, the Second and the Third Circuit \nexpressed \nsomething \nbetween \ndiscomfort \nand \ndisagreement with the policy choice underlying the \n\n28 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nline, drawn by the text of the ADA, between disabled \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job and those \nwho do not.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \u201cBut not \u2018even the most \nformidable policy arguments\u2019 empower a court to \nignore unambiguous text.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). And \nthat text plainly prohibits discrimination solely \nagainst individuals who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions\u201d of the job \u201cthat such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). \nA. Title I requires an individual to hold or \ndesire \na \njob \nat \nthe \ntime \nof \nthe \ndiscriminatory act to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d \nThe first step \u201cin interpreting a statute is to \ndetermine whether the language at issue has a plain \nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the \nparticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil \nCo., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). \u201cThe plainness or \nambiguity of statutory language is determined by \nreference to the language itself, the specific context in \nwhich that language is used, and the broader context \nof the statute as a whole.\u201d Id. at 341. \n1. \nThe text uses the present tense as a \ntemporal \nqualifier \nto \nprohibit \ndiscrimination solely against an \nindividual who \u201ccan perform\u201d the \njob she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d      \na. Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision (the \n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d) and its incorporated definition of a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d are unambiguous. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(a), 12111(8). The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d makes it \nunlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against a \n\n29 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard \nto \njob \napplication \nprocedures, \nthe \nhiring, \nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(a).  \nSection 12111(8) defines a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nas \u201can individual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of \nthe employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). Because the general rule \nexpressly incorporates the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d an \u201cADA plaintiff bears the burden of \nproving that she is...a person \u2018who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions\u2019 of her job,\u201d Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. \nCorp., 526 U.S. 795, 806 (1999), at the time of the \nprohibited discrimination. (emphasis added).  \n\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in \nconstruing statutes.\u201d United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. \n329, 333 (1992). For example, the ADA\u2019s use of \u201cthe \npresent indicative verb form\u201d requires \u201cthat a person \nbe presently\u2026substantially limited in order to \ndemonstrate a disability.\u201d Sutton v. United Air Lines, \nInc., 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999), superseded, in part, on \nother grounds, ADAAA of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 \n2(b)(3) (emphasis added); Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 \n(\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, \nunless the context indicates otherwise...words used in \nthe present tense include the future as well as the \npresent\u201d\u2014not the past). \nSection 12112(a) does not prohibit discrimination \nagainst an individual who performed the job that such \n\n30 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual held or desired. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). The present tense is used to require that an \nindividual be able to perform her job at the time of the \ndiscrimination.  \nThis is not to say that a former employee can \nnever sue under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit held she \nmay sue if her claim is based \u201con an act committed by \nthe defendant while the plaintiff was either working \nfor the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. This is because the \ngeneral rule does not require a former employee to be \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the lawsuit. See \nid. \u00a7 12112(a). Its focus is on the individual\u2019s \nqualifications at the time of the discriminatory act \nbecause it speaks only in terms of the prohibited \ndiscrimination\u2014not when suit is filed. Id. Any \nmischaracterization of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto categorically exclude retirees from suing under \nTitle I, must be rejected. It correctly held that \n\u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot establish that the City \ncommitted any discriminatory acts against her while \nshe could perform the essential functions of a job that \nshe held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 18a.  \nb. This Court\u2019s decision in Robinson reinforces the \nsignificance of present tense verbs as \u201ctemporal \nqualifiers\u201d to limit the scope of a statute\u2019s protection \nto current employees. 519 U.S. at 341-42 & n. 2. The \nquestion in Robinson was whether the word \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, \u00a7 \n704(a), includes former employees. Id. at 339. Section \n704(a) makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees or \n\n31 \n\u0003\n\u0003\napplicants for employment\u201d who have availed \nthemselves of Title VII\u2019s protections or assisted others \nin so doing. Id. Section 701(f) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \n\u201can individual employed by an employer.\u201d Id. at 342 \n(emphasis added).  \nThis Court explained that certain features of \u00a7 \n704(a) made it ambiguous and militated in favor of \nreading it to include former employees. Id. at 341. \nFirst, this Court emphasized that \u201cthere is no \ntemporal qualifier\u201d in \u00a7 704(a). Id. Second, the \ndefinition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) was consistent \nwith either current or past employment because the \nword \u201cemployed\u201d used therein could mean \u201cis \nemployed\u201d or \u201cwas employed.\u201d Id. at 342 (emphasis in \noriginal). Thus, this Court concluded that like \u00a7 \n704(a), the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) \u201clacks \nany temporal qualifier.\u201d Id.  \nOn this critical \u201ctemporal qualifier\u201d point, this \nCourt distinguished its decision just one month earlier \nin Walters v. Metro. Educational Enters., 519 U.S. 202 \n(1997). Id. at 341 n. 2. In Walters, this Court \nunanimously held that \u201cemployees\u201d as used in \u00a7 701(b) \nrelating to the 15-employee threshold for coverage by \nTitle \nVII, \nunambiguously \nreferred \nto \ncurrent \nemployees only. 519 U.S. at 341, n.2. This was because \n\u00a7 701(b) clearly included \u201ctwo significant temporal \nqualifiers.\u201d Id. This Court noted \u00a7 701(b)\u2019s language \nstating that Title VII \u201capplies to any employer \u2018who \nhas fifteen or more employees for each working day\u2026\u2019\u201d \nId. (emphasis in original). \u201cThe emphasized words \nspecify the time frame in which the employment \nrelationship must exist, and thus the specific context \nof that section did not present the particular \n\n32 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nambiguity at issue in the present case.\u201d Id. Indeed, \u00a7 \n701(b)\u2019s use of the present-tense as a temporal \nqualifier was critical in distinguishing the facts of \nRobinson. \nThe majority of courts have thus correctly \nconcluded that \u201cTitle I, unlike the section of Title VII \nat issue in Robinson, has a \u2018temporal qualifier.\u2019\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. Because \u00a7 12111(8) \u201cuses the \npresent tense...one must be able to perform the \nessential functions of employment at the time that one \nis discriminated against.\u201d Id. Section 12111(8)\u2019s other \ntemporal qualifiers reinforce this conclusion. It also \nrefers in the present tense to \u201cthe employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). The ADA, \ntherefore, has more in common with the provision that \nthis Court limited to current employees in Walters \nthan to the anti-retaliation provision distinguished in \nRobinson.  \n2. \nThe \nspecific \ncontext \nin \nwhich \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is used within \nthe anti-discrimination provision \nshows \nthat \nit \nprohibits \ndiscrimination solely against those \nwho presently hold or desire jobs.    \nAfter examining the language itself, we next look \nto the \u201cspecific context in which that language is used\u201d \nto discern its meaning. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is used within the \nanti-discrimination provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). Petitioner\u2019s incorrect interpretation of Title \nI derives from her narrow focus on the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition completely out of context from \n\n33 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthe general rule where the definition appears. A \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d means an individual who \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions\u201d of the job she \u201cholds \nor desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Petitioner argues \nthat the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition is to protect employers from \nbeing compelled to hire or retain unqualified \nindividuals by \u201ctesting\u201d an employee's capabilities. \nPet. Br. 34. And so, she argues if an individual has no \njob, an employer has no interest in the individual\u2019s \nability to perform and thus the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause \ncan be ignored. Id. 24, 34-35.  \nThis argument barely holds water when the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is read in a vacuum. \nIt completely fails when the definition is read within \nthe general rule where it appears. Indeed, \u201c[t]he \nquestion isn\u2019t just what [qualified individual] mean[s], \nbut what [Title I] says about it.\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. Read in context, the general rule prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who can \nperform the job she holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12111(8), 12112(a).  \nAnd so, the primary purpose of this anti-\ndiscrimination rule is not to protect the hiring \nprerogatives of employers, but to protect certain \ndisabled individuals from discrimination: those who \npresently work, want to work and can work despite \ntheir disabilities. See Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Centers, \nInc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 215 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(\u201c[T]he primary purpose of the ADA...[is] to encourage \nemployers to take on qualified individuals, regardless \nof their disability.\u201d). Title I was intended to \u201cdraw \nworkers with a disability into the workforce.\u201d Morgan, \n\n34 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n268 F.3d at 458 (emphasis added). Its \u201clanguage [is] \nwell designed to help people get and keep jobs, not to \nhelp those no longer able to work get disability pay.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112; see also Pet. App. 8a (the \nADA\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose\u201d is \u201cprotecting disabled people \nwho can nevertheless perform the essential functions \nof a job\u201d). Indeed, drawing the disabled into the \nworkforce would save \u201cthe United States billions of \ndollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from \ndependency and nonproductivity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12101(8) (emphasis added).  \nThus, \nthe \nprimary \npurpose \nof \nthe \nanti-\ndiscrimination rule is to prohibit employers from \ndiscriminating \nagainst \ncurrent \nemployees \nand \napplicants who can work despite their disabilities\u2014\nnot to impose a \u201ctest\u201d on employees that they either \n\u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d or in the case of retirees, are allegedly \nexempt from taking. See Pet. Br. 34. By interpreting \nthe definition of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d in a vacuum, \nPetitioner commits the same error as the Second \nCircuit \ndid \nin \nCastellano. \nThere, \ndespite \nacknowledging that it must consider \u201cthe specific \ncontext in which that language is used,\u201d the court \nskipped that step, isolated the definition, and \nconcluded that it failed \u201cto specify when a potential \nplaintiff must have been a \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019...\u201d 142 F.3d at 67 (emphasis in original). It \nthen \u201cmanufactured ambiguity where none existed.\u201d \nMcKnight, 550 F.3d at 527.  \nHad the Castellano court read the definition in \ncontext as used in the general rule, it would have \nrealized that the statute says exactly when an \nindividual must be qualified. A violation only arises if \n\n35 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nan employer discriminates against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d and thus if one is not qualified at the time \nof the discrimination there is no violation and no \nclaim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By focusing on those who \n\u201ccan perform\u201d jobs they \u201chold or desire\u201d Congress \nlimited the statute\u2019s protections to current employees \nand applicants.  \nEven considering the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as narrowly defined \nby Petitioner to protect employers from being forced to \nhire or retain unqualified individuals, Petitioner\u2019s \nargument fails. \u201c[E]xcept in the rare case of an obvious \nscrivener\u2019s error, purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014cannot be used to contradict text or \nto supplement it.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 57 (2012) \n(\u201cScalia & Garner\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the \npurpose of the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause should be deemed \n\u201csatisfied\u201d in the case of retirees is nothing more than \na request for this Court to rewrite the text to include \nan exception to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause for retirees.  \nAnd regardless of whether an employer is \nconcerned with a retiree\u2019s ability to perform, Congress \nwas concerned solely with protecting those who \u201ccan \nperform.\u201d If an individual is totally disabled or no \nlonger holds or desires their position, the statute is \nsilent as to discrimination against that individual. \nPetitioner presumes, based on nothing, that the \nstatute must say something about retirees who do not \nhold or desire their jobs. But a \u201cjudge should not \npresume that every statute answers every question, \nthe answers to be discovered through interpretation.\u201d \nScalia & Garner, 93.  \n\n36 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201c[T]he limitations of a text\u2014what a text chooses \nnot to do\u2014are as much a part of its \u2018purposes\u2019 as its \naffirmative dispositions.\u201d Id. at 57 (emphasis in \noriginal). These \u201climitations must be respected, and \nthe only way to accord them their due is to reject the \nreplacement or supplementation of text with purpose.\u201d \nId. at 57-58. Title I expressly limits its protections to \nthose who can perform the jobs they hold or desire. \nThere are no exceptions, and this Court should not \nalter the plain language to make any to appease \nPetitioner\u2019s policy preferences.  \n3. \nTitle \nI\u2019s \ndistinction \nbetween \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d \nand \n\u201cindividuals\u201d \nis \nconsistent \nthroughout the statutory scheme.   \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cstatutory scheme is coherent and \nconsistent.\u201d Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340. The ADA\u2019s use \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d does not vary in different \nprovisions. In Robinson, on the other hand, this Court \nfound that the word \u201cemployee\u201d included former \nemployees in at least some provisions of Title VII. Id. \nat 342-43. Having found \u00a7 704(a) ambiguous, this \nCourt considered what interpretation would be most \nconsistent with that section's purpose. In doing so, this \nCourt emphasized that \u00a7 704(a) was an anti-\nretaliation provision that by its nature would be \n\u201ceffectively vitiate[d]\u201d if it were confined to current \nemployees. Id. at 345. However, the ambiguities and \npolicy concerns that drove this Court\u2019s analysis of Title \nVII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision do not exist under Title \nI of the ADA.  \nTitle I does not protect against retaliation. The \nADA prohibits retaliation under Title V. See 42 U.S.C. \n\n37 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u00a7 12203(a) (it is unlawful for any employer \u201cto \ndiscriminate against any individual because such \nindividual has opposed any act or practice made \nunlawful by this chapter...\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, \nthe concerns that impelled this Court to a broad \nconstruction of Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \nare not present here, because the ADA's anti-\nretaliation provision is expressly drawn to cover \u201cany \nindividual,\u201d not just the narrower subset of \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d covered by Title I. See Morgan, 268 F.3d \nat 458 (\u201cThe difference is stark.\u201d). Thus, when \nCongress wanted to prohibit discrimination against \ndisabled former employees, \u201cit did so clearly and \nexplicitly,\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, \n455 \n(2002), \nby \nreferring \nto \n\u201cindividuals\u201d\u2014not \n\u201cqualified individuals.\u201d \nB. Petitioner\u2019s contrary arguments lack \nmerit. \nAs described above, the Second and Third Circuits \nare the only circuits to side with Petitioner\u2019s \nargument. See supra Castellano and Ford. Recently, \nhowever, the Second Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[i]n \ngeneral, the determination of whether a person is \n\u2018qualified\u2019 should be made at the time of the \ndiscriminatory employment action,\u201d but in Castellano, \nthe court \u201ccreated a narrow exception to the rule for \npost-employment benefits intended to be used by \nretirees.\u201d Smith v. Town of Ramapo, 745 Fed. Appx. \n424, 426 (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). Thus, even \nthe Second Circuit, albeit in an unpublished opinion, \nadmits that Castellano judicially-created a \u201cnarrow \nexception\u201d to the plain text of the rule articulated by \nCongress. Id.  \n\n38 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nPetitioner now rejects the Second and Third \nCircuit\u2019s finding of ambiguity in the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. She argues their judgments are \ndictated by the plain text of Title I, which she claims \nimposes only a \u201cconditional\u201d mandate that one be able \nto perform their job only if they hold or desire one. Pet. \nBr. 28. Despite this recasting of the argument, \nPetitioner is still guilty of the same cardinal sin of \nstatutory construction committed by the Second and \nThird Circuits. She too rewrites Title I by creating a \n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause just for \nretirees.  \n1. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \nperformance requirement of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as a \n\u201cconditional \nmandate,\u201d \nadds \nan \nunwritten \nexception \nto \nthat \nrequirement for retirees.    \na. The alleged \u201cconditional\u201d nature of the \nperformance requirement of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition cannot be divined from any part of the \nstatutory text. In support of this theory, Petitioner \nresorts to strained and unnatural constructions such \nas retirees are \u201cnot unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that they hold or desire.\u201d Pet. Br. 34. \nShe admits \u201ctesting the job capabilities of someone \nwho is no longer working may seem logically \nawkward.\u201d Id. That is putting it mildly. But purported \nlogic aside, the text simply does not contain any \nlanguage conditioning the ability to perform on \nwhether a person holds or desires a job.  \nTitle I makes no exceptions to the \u201ccan perform\u201d \nclause. Courts should not \u201celaborate unprovided-for \n\n39 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nexceptions to a text\u2026\u2018[I]f the Congress [had] intended \nto provide...exceptions, it would have done so in clear \nlanguage.\u2019\u201d Scalia & Garner, 93. Petitioner improperly \nargues for a \u201ctacit exception,\u201d Bostock. 590 U.S. at 669, \nto Title I\u2019s \u201ccan perform\u201d clause. But \u201cwhen Congress \nchooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, \ncourts apply the broad rule.\u201d Id. \nThe correct reading of Title I to only prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform gives effect \nto all of the words in \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a) and 12111(8). \nPetitioner's interpretation, on the other hand, \nrequires the addition and subtraction of language \nfrom Title I. It does not, however, prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who can perform \nthe essential functions of the job only if she holds or \ndesires one. \nEven if Congress wanted to imply that the \nperformance requirement was conditioned upon an \nindividual having or wanting a job, Congress would \nnot have referred to \u201cthe employment position\u201d that \nsuch individual holds or desires. Id. \u00a7 12111(8) \n(emphasis added). By referring to \u201cthe employment \nposition\u201d the text clearly indicates that the job \ncurrently exists. Petitioner\u2019s reading replaces \u201cthe\u201d \nwith \u201can\u201d to read the definition as only requiring the \nability to perform if the individual has an employment \nposition. This addition and subtraction of text cannot \nbe countenanced by this Court.  \nPetitioner argues Congress did not include \u201can\u201d \ninstead of \u201cthe\u201d because that would have made the \nstatute too confusing. Pet. Br. 44. As already \ndiscussed, Congress knew exactly how to expand the \n\n40 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nADA\u2019s protections to other individuals besides current \nemployees and applicants. See supra 36-37. It also \nwould have been a very simple matter for Congress to \ndo what the Second and Third Circuits did to Title I by \ninserting a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition for retirees. Smith, 745 Fed. \nAppx. at 426. Congress did none of these things and \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments fail.  \nb. \nPetitioner\u2019s \n\u201cconditional \nmandate\u201d \ninterpretation opens the door to a host of new \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d none of whom Congress \nintended to protect. It will create bizarre incentives for \nemployees to simply deny desiring a job or promotion \nto circumvent the requirement that they be able to \nperform it. An employee totally incapable of \nperforming a certain position could sue if she is not \ngiven the position because of her disability. So long as \nshe doesn\u2019t apply for the promotion or otherwise \nindicate that she \u201cdesires\u201d it, she can sue if a non-\ndisabled employee is given the position over her \ndespite her inability to perform the position because of \nher disability. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconditional mandate\u201d test \nis unworkable and should be rejected.  \nc. While Petitioner argues that retirees are \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who need not satisfy the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause, the United States takes a different \napproach that also fails. U.S. Amicus Br. 30. It argues \npost-employment discrimination against a retiree \n\u201cretroactively\u201d changes the terms of employment and \nso \u201cit is naturally described as discrimination against \na qualified individual...even if the plaintiff is no longer \nemployed.\u201d Id. What the United States characterizes \nas a \u201cretroactive change\u201d to the terms of employment \n\n41 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nis actually just a breach of contract. No court would \never describe such a breach as a \u201cretroactive change\u201d \nto a contract. If it did, then all a breaching party would \nhave to do to \u201cretroactively change\u201d the terms of a \ncontract would be to breach it. This, of course, is \nabsurd.  \nAnd whether the changed term of employment is \na contractual term or just a privilege, is irrelevant. \nThere is no time machine that an employer travels in \nto alter the terms or privileges that existed during \nemployment. Those terms and privileges remain the \nsame regardless of any later refusal to honor them. \nTherefore, it is legally unsound to say that a present \nbreach is a past harm to a plaintiff when she was a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d A post-employment change only \naffects someone who is unqualified. Moreover, the \nchange happened during Petitioner\u2019s employment in \n2003, but she waived any such claim. So the United \nStates\u2019 argument is purely hypothetical.  \nThe United States primarily argues for reversal \non the grounds Petitioner disclaimed. Its arguments \nfail for all the same reasons described above in Part I. \nIts focus on the alleged discrimination occurring \nduring employment confirms Title I\u2019s purpose to \nprohibit such acts during, not after, employment.  \n \n\n42 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition \nsolely \nas \na \nscreen \nto \nprotect \nemployers renders \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), \n(b)(6), (b)(7), and (d)(2) superfluous. \nPetitioner argues that \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), (b)(6), \n(b)(7), and (d)(2) allegedly all do the same work as the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition by allowing employers \nto take actions against disabled employees that \u201care \njustified in relation to the operation of their business.\u201d \nPet. Br. 31. But if these subsections of \u00a7 12112 perform \nthis function, then the same function allegedly \nperformed by \u00a7 12111(8) is rendered superfluous. \nInstead, \u00a7 12111(8) as used in the general rule, tells \nemployers who they may not discriminate against\u2014\nthose who hold or want jobs they can perform\u2014but \nthen \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b) and (d)(2) provide exceptions to that \ngeneral prohibition for the protection of the business.  \nAccordingly, \nPetitioner\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthese \nsubsections undermines her argument and proves the \nCity\u2019s point that the general rule sets forth its limited \nprotection of current employees and applicants who \ncan perform despite their disabilities, but then \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(b) and (d) include exceptions to that general \nprohibition to allow an employer to discriminate \nagainst these \u201cqualified individuals\u201d where it is \nnecessary to protect the business. \n \n\n43 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n3. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit\u2019s \ninterpretation does not render \u00a7 \n12112(b)(5)(A) superfluous.  \nPetitioner argues that if the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition excludes those who do not hold or desire a \njob, then \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2019s reference to an \u201cotherwise \nqualified individual with a disability who is an \napplicant or employee\u201d is surplusage. Pet. Br. 32-33. \nShe is incorrect. \nSection 12112(b) is the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision \nexplaining that the term \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual on the basis of disability,\u201d \nincludes several forms of discrimination. Section \n12112(b) is replete with references to \u201ca job applicant \nor employee,\u201d sometimes repeating that phrase \nmultiple times within one subsection. See, e.g., \u00a7 \n12112(b)(1). Section 12112(b)(2) also repeats the \nreference to a \u201cqualified applicant or employee\u201d even \nthough it is defining what is included in the term \n\u201cdiscriminate against a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(2). Likewise, \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B) refers to a \u201cjob \napplicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B).  \nThe repetition of these phrases serves only to \nemphasize how important it was to Congress that a \nplaintiff have an actual, present relationship with an \nemployer, as an employee or job applicant, to sue. \nWhile a \u201cqualified individual\u201d may be someone who \nmerely \u201cdesires\u201d a job under \u00a7 12111(8), \u00a7 12112(b) \nclarifies that the individual must actually apply for a \njob to establish a sufficient relationship to the \nemployer to justify imposing obligations on the \nemployer under the ADA. There is no surplusage \n\n44 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ncaused by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s correct reading of \nTitle I.  \nBut even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation renders the phrase \u201capplicants and \nemployees\u201d in \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) somehow superfluous, \nthat should not alter the conclusion. \u201cThe canon \nagainst surplusage is not an absolute rule.\u201d Marx v. \nGeneral Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 385 (2013). \n4. \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments regarding \ncommon usage, grammar and logic \nrely on false analogies.  \nBy focusing on the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d in isolation, Petitioner concocts several \nfalse \nanalogies \nin \nsupport \nof \nher \nstrained \ninterpretation. When the definition is read out of \ncontext, it is stripped of its meaning and malleable to \nPetitioner\u2019s many unhelpful hypotheticals. She posits \na movie theater rule: \u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie \nunless you silence your cell phone.\u201d Pet. Br. 35. She \nstates if you don\u2019t have a phone surely you don\u2019t \nviolate the rule. Id. This rule is not analogous at all to \nTitle I. \nThis rule imposes a prohibition on the patron\u2014\nnot the movie theater. And the prohibition against the \npatron is imposed by the movie theater\u2014not a \nregulator of the movie theater and so the intent behind \nthe rule is not analogous to Title I. When the theater \nis the one imposing the restriction, its intent is to \nprotect other patrons from disruption by noisy cell \nphones. But if a patron does not hold a cell phone, then \nthe theater\u2019s concern is not implicated. So, of course, \nthe theater will let you in if you don\u2019t have a cell \n\n45 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nphone. After all, its motivation is to sell as many \ntickets as possible so long as the ticket holders are not \ndisturbing others.  \nBut a proper analogy to Title I would require a \nhypothetical rule that says, \u201cno movie theater shall \nrefuse entry to an individual who can silence the cell \nphone that such individual holds.\u201d If a patron doesn\u2019t \nhold a cell phone, then under this properly analogous \nrule, the theater can grant the patron entry if it wants, \nbut nothing in the rule prohibits the movie theater \nfrom refusing that patron entry. This is because the \nonly thing that is prohibited by the regulator is refusal \nof entry to people who hold cells phones that can be \nsilenced. The focus, from the regulator\u2019s perspective, \nis clearly on protecting people with cell phones.  \nAt first blush, it may seem strange that this \nfictional regulator did not prohibit discrimination \nagainst people without cell phones, but not once we \nrealize that the regulator enacted the rule with the \nprotection of people with cell phones in mind. Perhaps \nthe regulator was concerned with making sure people \nwith cell phones can still attend movies and did not \nwant theaters to reject them solely because their cell \nphones could disturb others. So long as the cell phone \ncan be silenced, the regulator prohibits movie theaters \nfrom refusing entry to people with cell phones.  \nSimilarly, under Title I, when we realize that \nCongress was concerned only with protecting those \nwho work or want to work, we can see the clear \npurpose of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition within \nthe anti-discrimination rule to prohibit discrimination \nsolely against those individuals as long as they can \nperform despite their disabilities. It was not concerned \n\n46 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith anyone else in this one statute. It doesn\u2019t mean \nthat employers have a license to discriminate against \nretirees. There are several other laws that would \nprohibit such misconduct. Disabled retirees may face \nchallenges, but Title I \u201cneed not address all aspects of \na problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus \non their most pressing concerns.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. \nFlorida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015). \nPetitioner provides other purported analogies all \nsuffering from the same flaw as her movie theater \nhypothetical. Their structure does not mimic Title I\u2019s \nstructure and are thus useless to this Court. For \nexample, her \u201ccommand\u201d analogy fails because \nCongress did not make a command to an employee. \nPet. Br. 39. She argues \u201cWhen a command is \nconditional, its condition may be either overt or \nexplicit.\u201d Id. The command, \u201cDrive carefully!\u201d is \nconditioned on the subject of that command to be in \nthe act of driving. But Congress did not command an \nemployee to \u201cPerform your job!\u201d If it did, then perhaps \nwe could say that an employee must perform only if \nshe has a job. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition, \nhowever, does not appear within a command directed \nat an employee. It appears within the anti-\ndiscrimination provision commanding employers not \nto discriminate against individuals who can perform \ntheir jobs.  \nNo matter how many expedient hypotheticals \nPetitioner poses, there is only one way this Court can \nreach her desired outcome\u2014by creating an exception, \njust for retirees, to the plain language prohibiting \ndiscrimination solely against those who can perform \ntheir jobs. \n\n47 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n \n5. \nPetitioner\u2019s \nargument \nthat \nher \ninterpretation is consistent with \nTitle VII and avoids surplusage and \nabsurd consequences, fails. \na. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation \ndoes not render the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause of \u00a7 \n12112(a) superfluous. Simply because Title I \nprotects \n\u201ccompensation,\u201d \nincluding \nretirement \nbenefits, does not mean that Title I was designed to \n\u201cprotect \nretirees\u201d \nfrom \npost-employment \ndiscrimination. Pet. Br. 46. The purpose of the \n\u201ccompensation\u201d clause cannot be pursued at the \nexpense of negating Title I\u2019s plain text, especially \nwhen there are numerous circumstances where the \nreference to \u201ccompensation\u201d can be given effect \nwithout \nnullifying \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nlimitations.  \nBecause litigants can sue employers who adopt \ndiscriminatory fringe benefits policies during their \nemployment when they are \u201cqualified individuals,\u201d \neffect can be given to the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause \nwithout \nnegating \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nrequirements. \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits\u201d \ncan include a variety of benefits received during \nemployment such as health insurance, vacation pay, \novertime pay, and sick leave. While retirement \nbenefits might be among the items that make up the \nuniverse of compensation or benefits, they are not the \nexclusive or the most important benefit. Because \nemployees who satisfy the plain language of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition receive multiple types \nof \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cbenefits,\u201d the inclusion of \n\n48 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthose terms in Title I can be given effect without \nrewriting \u00a7 12111(8). \nThe fact that retirees cannot sue regarding \ndiscriminatory benefits and compensation in every \nscenario does not render Title I\u2019s references to \n\u201ccompensation\u201d superfluous. \u201cNo text pursues its \npurposes at all costs.\u201d Scalia & Garner, 57; Clifford F. \nMacEvoy Co. v. U.S. for Use & Benefit of Calvin \nTomkins Co., 322 U.S. 102, 107 (1944) (even a \u201chighly \nremedial\u201d \nstatute \n\u201centitled \nto \na \nliberal \nconstruction\u2026does not justify ignoring plain words of \nlimitation.\u201d). This \u201cCourt cannot construe a statute in \na way that negates its plain text, and here, Congress \nexpressly limited,\u201d Honeycutt v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 443, 454 n. 2 (2017), Title I\u2019s protections to those \nwho can perform the jobs they hold or desire.  \nb. In the context of a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \nTitle I and Title VII are not analogous. Petitioner \nargues that her interpretation of Title I would \nmaintain \u201ccongruity between the ADA and Title VII, \nthe statute on which much of title I was \u2018modeled.\u2019\u201d \nPet. Br. 46. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its \nprocedural \nframework \nfrom \n[T]itle \nVII...by \nincorporating title VII's enforcement provisions,\u201d Title \nI \u201cborrows much of its substantive framework from \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d \nH.R.Rep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 31 (1990) (emphasis \nadded). The \u201cconcept\u201d of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who \nmust be able to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of her \njob comes from \u201cthe regulations implementing...the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not Title VII. Id. at 33. \nThere is no counterpart to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition in Title VII, so loose references \n\n49 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nto Title VII and the ADA as \u201csibling statutes,\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 606, obscure these important differences \nin the text. Although Title VII and the ADA may be \nclosely related in other respects, on the issue here \u201cthe \nstatutes are not analogous.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1111. \nc. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the absurd results \ntest fails. Petitioner argues there is no plausible \nexplanation for the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to \nexclude retirees and she invokes the \u201cabsurd results\u201d \ntest. Pet. Br. 46-47. This \u201cCourt rarely invokes such a \ntest to override unambiguous legislation.\u201d Barnhart, \n534 U.S. at 459. This test is stringent and states \u201cthe \nabsurdity must consist of a disposition that no \nreasonable person could intend.\u201d Scalia & Garner, \n237.  \nHere, there are \u201cseveral explanations for why \nCongress would have purposefully exempted\u201d retirees \nfrom the statute\u2019s coverage. Barnhart, 534 U.S. at 459. \n\u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable disabled \npeople who can work with reasonable accommodation \nto get and keep jobs, without also deciding to equalize \npost-employment fringe benefits for people who \ncannot work.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to improve the circumstances of disabled \npeople in some respects even if it does not improve \nthem in all respects.\u201d Id. \u201cLegislation often results \nfrom a delicate compromise among competing \ninterests and concerns.\u201d Id. at 1113; Barnhart, 534 \nU.S. \nat \n461 \n(any \n\u201cdissatisfaction\u201d \nwith \nthe \nconsequences of plain text is \u201coften the cost of \nlegislative compromise.\u201d). \u201cIf we were to \u2018fully \neffectuate\u2019 what we take to be the underlying policy of \nthe legislation, without careful attention to the \n\n50 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualifying words in the statute, then we would be \noverturning \nthe \nnuanced \ncompromise \nin \nthe \nlegislation, and substituting our own cruder, less \nresponsive mandate for the law that was actually \npassed.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1113. \nTitle I, thus, reasonably prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating solely \u201cagainst people with disabilities \nthat do not prevent job performance, but when a \ndisability renders a person unable to perform the \nessential functions of the job, that disability renders \nhim or her unqualified.\u201d Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 \nF.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017). When the perceived gap \nin Title I for the protection of retirees is understood for \nwhat it really is\u2014important compromise that \nfacilitates action on the more pressing problems of the \nday\u2014the consequences of Title I\u2019s plain language are \nnot at all \u201csurprising\u201d or \u201cabsurd.\u201d Pet. Br. 27, 47. \nCongress enacted Title I to provide a legal remedy \nfor disabled workers that did not previously exist. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA, the Social \nSecurity Act, and the Medicare Act. The Equal \nProtection Clause provided an additional remedy for \npublic employees. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, \n522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that the House and Senate \nCommittee \nReports \non \nthe \nADA \nfocused \non \n\u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the private \nsector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination in \npublic employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the Court). \nAdditionally, numerous common law claims such as \nbreach of contract, promissory estoppel, or fraud in the \ninducement \nalong \nwith \nstate \nstatutory \nand \n\n51 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nunconstitutional takings claims could be brought to \nobtain promised benefits.  \nThus, before the ADA, a disabled employee could \nnot sue her private employer for discrimination, \nbreach of contract, or any of the other above remedies \nif she accepted a job knowing that her contract \nincluded a lesser pension than a similarly situated \nnon-disabled employee. And even if she didn\u2019t know \nabout a secret discriminatory decision applied to her \nduring her employment but later discovered it, there \nwas no law that prohibited such discrimination. The \nADA stepped in to prohibit such discriminatory \npolicies from being applied to current employees and \napplicants. Such policies could dissuade a disabled job \napplicant from accepting that job or force a disabled \nemployee to search elsewhere for a fair pension. And \nin the absence of the ADA, that employee would be \nforced to do so without remedy. Title I\u2019s \u201clanguage [is] \nwell \ndesigned \nto \nhelp \npeople \nget \nand \nkeep \njobs\u2026\u201dWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \nBut an employer who does not discriminate until \npost-employment does not deter employment. If the \nemployer has a facially neutral pension policy that \npromises a pension to all retirees, but the employer \nwithholds the pension from a disabled retiree, then \nthat retiree has a clear breach of a contract claim \nalong with all of the other remedies mentioned above \nunder ERISA, the Social Security Act, etc. Under \nFlorida law, \u201conce a participating member reaches \nretirement status, the benefits under the terms of the \nact in effect at the time of the employee's retirement \nvest.\u201d Bien, 209 So. 3d at 3. \u201cThe contractual \nrelationship may not thereafter be affected or \n\n52 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nadversely \naltered \nby \nsubsequent \nstatutory \nenactments.\u201d Id. \nThus, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation does \nnot \u201callow employers to freely discriminate against \ntheir former employees.\u201d Pet. Br. 47. Employers risk \nsignificant liability for allowing their animus against \nthe disabled to lead them to breach their contracts or \nviolate other laws post-employment. The remedies for \nviolating these laws are not always the same as the \nADA\u2019s remedies. But the fact that these remedies pre-\ndated the ADA demonstrates the reasonableness of \nCongress\u2019 decision to focus on the more pressing issue \nof the day for which there was no remedy at all\u2014\ndiscriminatory \npolicies \nthat \nexcluded \ncapable \nindividuals from the workforce simply because they \nwere disabled. Because there are several plausible \nexplanations for the line drawn by the plain text of \nTitle I, Petitioner\u2019s arguments fail the absurd results \ntest. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that \nPetitioner could not state a claim for disability \ndiscrimination under the ADA.\u0003\n\u0003\n \n\n53 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should affirm.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJESSICA C.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being a reflection of my own internal reasoning, does not introduce new external facts about the *Stanley v. Sanford* case. Therefore, my substantive beliefs about the case, derived from the Petitioner's Brief, remain stable. I continue to believe the petitioner has presented a very strong case for reversal, and my prediction leans heavily in their favor.\n\nMy understanding of the petitioner's two-pronged argument is unchanged:\n1.  **Textual/Structural Argument:** The ADA's text permits suits by \"any person alleging discrimination\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a)) over post-employment benefits, which are considered part of \"compensation\" and \"terms, conditions, and privileges of employment.\" The petitioner's claim is timely under the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act because the discrimination \"affected\" her when her benefits were terminated post-retirement.\n2.  **\"Qualified Individual\" Argument:** The phrase \"that such individual holds or desires\" in the definition of a \"qualified individual\" (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8)) is a conditional clause specifying *which* job's functions are relevant, not a categorical requirement that a plaintiff must currently hold or desire a job. This interpretation is strongly supported by the unanimous Supreme Court precedent in *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*, which found that Title VII protects former employees, and the ADA should be read in parallel.\n\nThis observation has, however, sharpened my focus by explicitly articulating my primary remaining uncertainty. My ability to make a high-confidence prediction is now contingent on obtaining and analyzing the Respondent's (City of Sanford) brief. Specifically, I have identified the two critical points that the Respondent *must* successfully rebut:\n*   They must provide a compelling alternative reading of the ADA's text that justifies excluding former employees.\n*   Crucially, they must distinguish the unanimous and highly analogous precedent of *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.* to avoid having their position seem like a direct contradiction of established Supreme Court logic.\n\nMy current belief is that distinguishing *Robinson* will be extremely difficult, which reinforces my leaning toward a reversal. The next observation\u2014the Respondent's brief\u2014will be the most informative piece of evidence to test this belief.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of metacognition, significantly refines my strategic framework for legal analysis. While my previous learning focused on what to look for in documents, this step formalizes the *process* of inquiry itself.\n\nMy core heuristics, learned from analyzing the cert petition and petitioner's brief, remain foundational:\n*   **Source Prioritization:** The initial search for a circuit split in cert-stage documents is the first step, followed by a deep analysis of the Petitioner's Brief on the merits.\n*   **Argument Deconstruction:** Recognizing rhetorical structures (like the \"who, what, when\" framework) is key to evaluating an argument's clarity and persuasiveness.\n*   **Identifying Persuasive Tactics:** Simple analogies used to clarify complex statutory text are a strong positive signal.\n*   **Precedent Framing:** The most critical heuristic is tracking how parties frame their arguments relative to major, unanimous Supreme Court precedents like *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*\n\nThis observation adds several new, more sophisticated layers to my design methodology:\n1.  **Formalizing the Source Sequence:** My strategy is evolving from a simple list of important documents into a validated, sequential process. The logical flow is now confirmed as: **Certiorari-stage documents \u2192 Petitioner's Merits Brief \u2192 Respondent's Merits Brief.** This observation solidifies the next step in this critical path, confirming that seeking the respondent's brief is the highest-value action after digesting the petitioner's.\n2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Inquiry:** A core principle of effective experimental design is now explicit in my methodology: I must consciously identify the largest remaining area of uncertainty and design the next action to target it directly. My internal reasoning demonstrates this: I have pinpointed the Respondent's counter-arguments as the key missing variable and am now planning an action specifically to acquire that information.\n3.  **Predictive Counter-Argument Analysis:** I have developed a new, powerful heuristic. Instead of passively waiting for the next piece of evidence, I should use the current evidence to **predict the essential points the opposing side must address.** By anticipating that the City of Sanford *must* find a way to distinguish *Robinson*, I have created a specific hypothesis to test. This transforms my analysis of the Respondent's brief from a simple reading exercise into a targeted evaluation of their success or failure in neutralizing the petitioner's most powerful argument. This proactive approach will make my analysis more efficient and my conclusions more robust."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been significantly complicated and refined by the Respondent's (City of Sanford) brief. My previous strong conviction in favor of the Petitioner has been moderated by the introduction of powerful new legal and factual arguments. The case now appears far more balanced.\n\nMy core understanding of the Petitioner's arguments remains stable:\n1.  **Textual/Structural:** The ADA's broad language (\"any person alleging discrimination\") should cover former employees suing over benefits earned during employment.\n2.  **Precedent-Based:** The unanimous Supreme Court decision in *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*, which interpreted Title VII to protect former employees, should control the interpretation of the parallel ADA statute.\n\nHowever, the Respondent's brief introduces three critical counterpoints that directly challenge my prior beliefs and reshape my prediction:\n\n1.  **A Potentially Dispositive Procedural Defense (Waiver):** The Respondent's primary argument is that the Petitioner waived the claim that the discrimination occurred *during* her employment (e.g., with the 2003 policy change). They assert that in the Eleventh Circuit, the Petitioner \"expressly disclaimed\" this argument, stating she \"could not have brought these claims while she was still employed\" for lack of standing. If the Supreme Court agrees, it will likely refuse to consider this entire line of reasoning, narrowing the case exclusively to the much harder question of whether a *former*, totally disabled employee can sue for discrimination that manifests post-employment. This procedural argument, which I had not previously considered, dramatically increases the City's chances of success, as it could allow the Court to affirm the lower court without reaching the complex statutory questions.\n\n2.  **A Plausible Textual Distinction of *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*:** I previously believed distinguishing the *Robinson* precedent would be \"extremely difficult.\" The Respondent has offered a credible textual argument for doing just that. Their argument is:\n    *   *Robinson* interpreted the term \"employees\" in Title VII, which the Court found to be ambiguous.\n    *   The ADA, in contrast, is not ambiguous. It provides a specific, present-tense definition: a \"qualified individual\" is one who \"can perform the essential functions of the employment position that such individual **holds or desires**.\"\n    *   The Respondent argues this specific, definitional text in the ADA must control over the general principle of parallel construction with Title VII. This is a classic \"specific-trumps-general\" statutory argument that may be very persuasive to the Court's textualist justices. This is a much stronger counter-argument than I had anticipated.\n\n3.  **A Compelling Factual Reframing:** The Respondent's brief skillfully reframes the narrative. They argue:\n    *   The policy is not based on disability, but on a neutral, service-based requirement of 25 years for *all* employees, disabled or not.\n    *   The 24-month subsidy for disability retirees with less than 25 years of service is not a penalty, but a compassionate *benefit*. They claim similarly situated non-disabled employees who retire with less than 25 years of service receive *no subsidy at all*.\n    *   This 24-month period is not arbitrary but is designed to act as a bridge until the disabled retiree becomes eligible for Medicare.\n    *   This narrative transforms the City from a discriminatory actor into a compassionate employer applying a neutral, service-based policy and actually giving preferential treatment to disabled retirees.\n\n**Updated Prediction & Uncertainty:** My confidence in a reversal for the Petitioner has substantially decreased. The path to victory for the City of Sanford is now much clearer. My prediction is now much closer to a 50/50 toss-up, perhaps slightly favoring the City if the waiver argument is strong. My key uncertainties have shifted from *if* the Respondent could counter the Petitioner's case to *how persuasive the Supreme Court will find* these specific, well-articulated counters. The next essential piece of evidence is the Petitioner's Reply Brief, which must now neutralize both the powerful waiver argument and the textual distinction of *Robinson*.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, validating some existing heuristics while revealing the need for new, more sophisticated ones. My methodology for legal prediction continues to evolve from simple document analysis to a more strategic, multi-layered process.\n\nMy foundational heuristics remain effective and are now battle-tested:\n*   **Source Prioritization:** The sequence of Certiorari Petition -> Petitioner's Merits Brief -> Respondent's Merits Brief is confirmed as the critical path for building a robust understanding of a case.\n*   **Argument Deconstruction:** Identifying the core structure of arguments remains essential.\n*   **Predictive Counter-Argument Analysis:** My previous metacognitive step of predicting that the Respondent *must* distinguish *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.* was proven to be a highly effective heuristic. It allowed me to immediately focus on the most critical part of the Respondent's brief and evaluate its strength.\n\nThis observation adds several crucial new layers to my design methodology:\n\n1.  **The Primacy of Procedural Defenses:** I have learned that I must actively search for and evaluate procedural arguments (waiver, standing, timeliness) early in the analysis. The Respondent's brief demonstrates that these are not secondary issues; they can be a party's lead argument and provide the Court with an \"off-ramp\" to avoid deciding a difficult merits question. **New Heuristic:** When analyzing a brief, give top priority to identifying procedural defenses, as their resolution can preempt the entire substantive debate.\n\n2.  **Mastering Canons of Construction:** The Respondent's brief provides a masterclass in deploying a key canon of statutory interpretation: \"the specific trumps the general.\" Their entire strategy for neutralizing the *Robinson* precedent hinges on this canon. This is not just an academic point; it is a practical and powerful tool of legal persuasion. I must now actively look for opportunities where specific statutory text can be used to override a more general principle or precedent.\n\n3.  **Narrative as a Decisive Factor:** I have learned to treat the \"Statement of the Case\" section not as a neutral background summary, but as a critical battleground where the narrative is fought. The Respondent's reframing of the 24-month subsidy from a discriminatory penalty into a compassionate, preferential benefit is a powerful strategic move. **New Heuristic:** A key part of predicting an outcome is to analyze and compare the competing factual narratives presented by the parties and assess which is more likely to be adopted by the Court.\n\n4.  **Refining Uncertainty-Driven Inquiry:** My strategy of identifying and targeting my greatest uncertainty remains sound. Having received the Respondent's brief, my uncertainty has now shifted. My next action must be designed to resolve this new uncertainty. The highest-value action is now unequivocally to obtain and analyze the **Petitioner's Reply Brief** to see how they attempt to rebut the waiver argument and the textual attack on the *Robinson* precedent."

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are es\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are essential,\u201d but \nnothing more. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \n2. Title I\u2019s enforcement provision. To vindicate its \nsubstantive prohibition on disability-based discrimination, \nTitle I adopted what was, by the time the ADA became \nlaw, a proven remedial mechanism. Section 12117, entitled \n\u201cEnforcement,\u201d provides that the \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d available under Title VII may be invoked by \n\n- 9 - \n \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of\u201d Title I. Id. \u00a7 12117(a). Even \nbefore the ADA was enacted, retirees had used those \nremedies and procedures to enforce their rights under \nTitle VII with respect to post-employment benefits. See, \ne.g., Florida v. Long, 487 U.S. 223, 225 (1988); Norris, 463 \nU.S. at 1074; City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & Power \nv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 704 (1978).  \n3. The Fair Pay Act. Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanism has since been expanded through the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. See Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, \n123 Stat. 5 (2009). That Act clarifies that an unlawful \nemployment practice \u201coccurs\u201d\u2014and thus restarts the \ntime to sue\u2014when:  \n(1) the \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted,\u201d  \n(2) the person is \u201csubject to a discriminatory \ncompensation decision,\u201d or  \n(3) \u201cwhen an individual is affected by application of \na discriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis \nmeans \nthat \n\u201cevery \ndiscriminatory paycheck or other compensation resulting, \nin whole or in part, from an earlier discriminatory pay \ndecision or other practice\u201d is another occurrence for which \na person can seek redress. See H.R Rep. No. 110-237, at 3 \n(2007). \nB. \nFactual background \nIn 1999, after serving in the military, Karyn Stanley \nbegan her career as a firefighter for the City of Sanford, \nFlorida. Pet. App. 2a. In 2005, she was promoted to Fire \n\n- 10 - \n \nLieutenant. All told, Lt. Stanley served the City for almost \ntwo decades as a firefighter. Doc. 1 at 3.  \nWhen the City offered her the job, her employment \npackage included a \u201chealth insurance subsidy.\u201d Pet. App. \n3a. This benefit covered most of the cost of participating \nin the City\u2019s health-insurance plan. Id.; Doc. 1 at 5. So \nalthough Lt. Stanley\u2019s monthly health-insurance premium \nunder the City\u2019s health plan was approximately $1,300, the \nCity\u2019s subsidy covered $1,000 of that cost, requiring her to \npay only $300. The City told her that this benefit applied \nboth to current employees and to qualifying retirees until \nthey reached age sixty-five. Doc. 38-15 at 11. A retiree was \neligible regardless of whether she \u201cretire[d] with twenty-\nfive (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for disability \nreasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a.  \nThis health-insurance subsidy was an especially \nimportant benefit for firefighters like Lt. Stanley because \nthey have one of the \u201chighest rates of injuries and illnesses \nof all occupations.\u201d Bureau of Lab. Stats., Occupational \nOutlook Handbook, Firefighters, https://perma.cc/F8CP-\nUJL8. Indeed, for many critical public-service jobs that \ncome with lower salaries, post-employment benefits are a \nmajor draw for potential employees, representing an \nimportant part of the compensation for which they \nundertake (and stay in) their roles as police officers, \nfirefighters, or other first responders. See Bureau of Lab. \nStats., Employee Benefits, https://perma.cc/PLP6-7GHL. \nIn 2003, unbeknownst to Lt. Stanley, the City quietly \nchanged its subsidy policy to distinguish between \n\u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d retirees. Doc. 1 at 12. The new \npolicy changed the benefits eligibility for \u201call employees \nretiring as a result of full disability\u201d so that it would run \nonly \u201cuntil the disabled retiree receives Medicare benefits \n\n- 11 - \n \nor until 24 months have elapsed from the date of \nretirement, whichever comes first.\u201d Pet. App. 22a; Doc. \n38-11 at 4. By contrast, \u201cnormal retirees\u201d remained \neligible until age sixty-five. Doc. 39-16 at 13. So if a \nfirefighter is injured in the line of duty or develops a \ncareer-ending illness one year before she completes her \ntwenty-five years of service, the subsidy lasts for only \ntwenty-four months. \nThe City claimed that the new policy was a necessary \n\u201ccost cutting measure[].\u201d Doc. 38 at 7. But it never offered \nany justification for cutting costs associated with disabled \nemployees alone. The City\u2019s HR director had no \nexplanation, Doc. 39-4 at 10, 13\u201314, and it was unable to \nidentify any \u201cdata, mathematical calculations, [or] \ncorrespondence \u2026 upon which [it] based its decision\u201d to \nrescind benefits from disabled retirees and not \u201cnormal \nretirees.\u201d Doc. 39-16 at 5, 40. Indeed, city employees could \nnot even point to any \u201cfinancial estimates\u201d of \u201cthe cost of \ncontinuing the disability retirees[\u2019] [subsidy] longer than \n24 months\u201d before enacting the policy. Doc. 39-9 at 46. \nWhatever the reason for the change, the new policy \ndecimated Lt. Stanley\u2019s promised retirement benefits \nbecause her career as a firefighter was cut short by \nParkinson\u2019s disease. After nearly twenty years of service, \nLt. Stanley began to develop \u201cstiffness [and] rigidity \u2026 as \nwell as [a] loss of dexterity in her extremities.\u201d Doc. 38-4 \nat 3. In 2016, she was officially diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s. Pet. App. 2a. For a longtime firefighter like \nLt. Stanley, that diagnosis was tragic but not surprising. \nSome states have adopted a legal presumption that \nfirefighters who develop Parkinson\u2019s did so in the line of \nduty based on the frequency with which the disease afflicts \n\n- 12 - \n \nfirefighters. See N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law \u00a7 207-kkk (Consol.); \nInd. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-15-5.5.  \nFor two years after her diagnosis, Lt. Stanley \ncontinued to work as a lieutenant. Pet. App. 2a. But \neventually it became clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability was \npreventing her from meeting the physical demands of her \njob. Pet. App. 2a. In 2018, at the age of forty-seven, Lt. \nStanley took disability retirement with the City\u2019s \nagreement. Pet. App. 2a. \nAt that point, Lt. Stanley expected the employer she \nhad served for almost twenty years to stand by the \nbargain that it had struck with her when she was hired. \nThe City had explained her original benefits package \nwhen she first joined, and it had never told her about any \nchange in policy. Doc. 38-15 at 9. She had never received \nan updated human resources manual explaining that she \nwould no longer receive the retirement benefits she was \nexpecting. Doc. 38-15 at 9, 11. But just twenty-four months \nafter she retired, the City discontinued Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nhealth-insurance \nsubsidy, \nleaving \nher \nfinancially \nresponsible for all of her health insurance. Pet. App. 3a.  \nFor the past few years, Lt. Stanley has paid out of \npocket for the entire cost of the City\u2019s health-insurance \npolicy, which she relies on for her Parkinson\u2019s treatment. \nDoc 39-9 at 23; Doc. 38-15 at 11, 21. The cost to Lt. Stanley \nof covering the $1,000 monthly subsidy until she is sixty-\nfive\u2014if she is even able to do so\u2014would be more than \n$150,000. Doc. 1 at 6\u20137. Due to the high cost of the City\u2019s \nhealth-insurance premium without the subsidy, no other \ndisabled retirees have been able to stay on the City\u2019s \ninsurance after the loss of the subsidy. Doc. 39-9 at 25; see \nDoc. 39-16 at 3\u20134. Non-disabled retirees, however, \n\n- 13 - \n \ntypically remain on the City\u2019s health insurance until they \nbecome eligible for Medicare. Doc. 39-4 at 69. \nC. Procedural background \nLt. Stanley filed this lawsuit alleging that the City\u2019s \npolicy violated the ADA. Pet. App. 24a. The district court \ndismissed Lt. Stanley\u2019s Title I claim. The court found itself \nbound by circuit precedent holding that a \u201cdisabled \nformer employee\u201d like Lt. Stanley has \u201cno standing to \nsue\u201d over post-employment benefits under Title I because \nshe is \u201cno longer\u201d a qualified individual. Pet. App. 24a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It held that Lt. \nStanley, as a former employee, could not sue about \ndiscrimination in her benefits under the ADA because she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time that the City \nterminated her subsidy payments in 2020. Pet. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. The court emphasized that section 12111(8) defines \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d using the \u201cpresent tense\u201d words \n\u201c[c]an,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. Thus, it \nheld, a plaintiff \u201cmust desire or already have a job with the \ndefendant at the time the defendant commits the \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Id. And since Lt. Stanley was a \n\u201cretiree, not [an] employee,\u201d in 2020, she was not a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nThe panel further concluded that Lt. Stanley was not \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any other discrete moment in \nwhich discrimination could have occurred. Pet. App. 16a\u2013\n17a. The court announced that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcede[d]\u201d \nthat the City\u2019s change of the policy in 2003 could not \namount to actionable discrimination. Pet. App. 16a. And it \n\u201cagree[d]\u201d with Lt. Stanley\u2019s (alleged) concession that her \nclaim could not turn on the 2003 policy change because she \nwas \u201cnot yet disabled at that time.\u201d Id. Nor, the court \nreasoned, could Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim turn on the City\u2019s \n\n- 14 - \n \nactions in the period after she was diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s but before she retired because she (allegedly \nalso) \u201cconceded that \u2026 she was [not] impacted\u201d until after \nshe retired. Pet. App. 18a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The ADA permits former employees to sue over \npost-employment benefits.  \nThe who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision allows suit \nby \u201cany person alleging discrimination\u201d in violation of the \nAct who \u201cclaim[s] to be aggrieved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12117(a), \n2000e-5(f)(1). This language doesn\u2019t limit suits to \n\u201cemployees,\u201d \u201capplicants,\u201d or \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe what: The ADA targets discrimination not just in \nhiring \nand \nfiring \nbut \nalso \nin \n\u201cemployee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). By the time the \nADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \ninterpreted Title VII\u2019s parallel language as protecting \nretirement benefits.  \nThe when: The Fair Pay Act further clarifies that \nretirees may bring suit under the ADA when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis allows a plaintiff to challenge a decision to adopt a \ndiscriminatory benefits policy each time that she is \nadversely affected, even after her employment ends. So \neven if Ms. Stanley didn\u2019t feel the effects of the City\u2019s \npolicy until she retired, these provisions together make \nclear that her claim may proceed.  \nII. The court of appeals independently erred in holding \nthat the ADA protects only those who \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d \na job. Nothing in the ADA\u2019s text requires that result, \n\n- 15 - \n \nwhich would leave retirees unprotected against even the \nmost egregious discrimination. \nThe ADA doesn\u2019t require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a qualified individual. The definition \nasks if an individual \u201ccan perform the essential functions \nof the employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d In other words, it tests if you can do a job, not if \nyou have or want one.  \nThis makes sense given the definition\u2019s role in the \nstatutory scheme: It affords employers necessary, but \ncircumscribed, flexibility to restrict employment on the \nbasis of disability to preserve the functioning of a \nbusiness. It allows employers to screen out people who \ncan\u2019t perform core job functions, not to implement \ndiscriminatory policies unrelated to job performance.  \nThis understanding avoids treating key statutory \nterms \nas \nsurplusage. \nThe \nADA\u2019s \nreasonable-\naccommodation provision applies to a \u201cqualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). This tells us that the \nAct contemplates at least some qualified individuals who \nare neither applicants nor employees\u2014a category that \nwould not exist under the court of appeals\u2019 reading. \nCommon usage, grammar, and logic all show that the \ntext doesn\u2019t demand the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nConsider this rule: \u201cAn individual may not watch the \nmovie unless the individual silences the electronic devices \nthat such individual carries.\u201d If you come to the theater \nwithout a device, can you stay? Of course. The rule \nrequires patrons to turn off their devices only to the extent \nthat they have them. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \nworks the same way: It requires individuals to be able to \nperform essential job functions only to the extent they \nhold or desire jobs with such functions.  \n\n- 16 - \n \nEven granting that the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \ncould be read in a vacuum to support the Eleventh \nCircuit\u2019s view, ours is the better reading in the context of \nthe statute as a whole. Treating retirees as \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d allows the definition to fulfill its role in \nscreening out those who can\u2019t perform job functions, \nwithout turning it into an arbitrary license to discriminate. \nIt avoids rendering key language superfluous. It gives \nforce to the ADA\u2019s protections for retirement benefits. \nAnd it maintains congruity between the ADA and Title \nVII. In short, it is the reading that is far \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of\u201d the Act and the \u201cprimary \npurpose\u201d of the definition. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., \n519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).  \nARGUMENT \n \nBy allowing employers to discriminate against \ndisabled retirees with impunity\u2014in ways that would never \nbe tolerated for race, religion, sex, or national origin\u2014the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision frustrates Congress\u2019s plan for \na \u201ccomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). The decision is flawed in two key \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal:  \n \nFirst, it fundamentally misunderstands the ADA\u2019s \ntext and structure. The ADA allows \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d to sue, including retirees who are later \n\u201caffected by the application of\u201d discriminatory policies \nthat were \u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. That \ndescription fits the allegations in this case to a T.  \n \nSecond, it misreads the ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition as excluding retirees from the Act\u2019s protection. \nThe text doesn\u2019t compel that reading, and an \u201cinquiry into \ntext and context\u201d makes the statute\u2019s contrary meaning \n\n- 17 - \n \nclear. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024). \nReading the ADA to protect retirees makes sense of the \nscheme as a whole, harmonizes Title VII and the ADA, \navoids turning key provisions into surplusage, and escapes \nan outcome that puts the statute \u201cat war with itself.\u201d Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 472 (2023). \nI. \nThe ADA permits former employees to bring suit \nwith respect to post-employment benefits. \nThe ADA permits retirees to sue over their benefits. \nThis conclusion follows from the ADA\u2019s enforcement \nprovision, its coverage of post-employment benefits, and \nthe Fair Pay Act\u2019s clarification of when plaintiffs may sue \nover benefits. Together they make clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nsuit, which challenges a policy \u201cadopted\u201d while she was \nemployed, and to which she was \u201csubjected\u201d while \nworking for the City, may proceed. This Court therefore \nneed not even reach the court of appeals\u2019 erroneous \nholding that the Act only prohibits discrimination against \npeople who currently \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a job.  \nA. The who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision \nallows suit by \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d in violation of the Act. \nTo enforce the ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate,\u201d Martin, \n532 U.S. at 674\u201375, section 12117, titled \u201cEnforcement,\u201d \nprovides \u201cto any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of\u201d Title I the full range of \nremedies provided for in Title VII. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12117(a). \nNoticeably absent from this authority to sue is a \nrequirement that the plaintiff be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nInstead, \u201cany person\u201d who alleges a discriminatory act in \nviolation of the statute can invoke Title VII\u2019s remedial \nframework. And that framework contains no relevant \nlimitation either: It allows any \u201cperson claiming to be \n\n- 18 - \n \naggrieved\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(f)(1).  \nDespite its breadth, Title VII\u2019s remedial provision \ndoes have its limits: Only plaintiffs who assert an \u201cinterest \narguably sought to be protected by the statute\u201d may \ninvoke these remedies. Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, \nLP, 562 U.S. 170, 177\u201378 (2011). But this \u201czone-of-\ninterests\u201d test is \u201cnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \nBand \nof \nPottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224\u201325 (2012). It bars a \nplaintiff only if her asserted \u201cinterests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Thompson, 562 \nU.S. at 178; see also, e.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of \nMiami, 581 U.S. 189, 200 (2017) (holding that Miami could \nsue under the Fair Housing Act for financial injury \nincurred from discriminatory lending practices). Which is \nto say, this textual limitation cuts off only suits that are far \nafield from the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014for example, a \n\u201cshareholder\u201d suit against a corporation over its \u201cfiring \n[of] a valuable employee for racially discriminatory \nreasons.\u201d Thompson, 562 U.S. at 177. \nAssuming that the same zone-of-interest test applies, \nretirees in Lt. Stanley\u2019s shoes satisfy it. The ADA\u2019s \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d mandate to \u201celiminat[e]\u201d discrimination, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12101(b)(1), \naims \nnot \njust \nat \nthe \n\u201cpersist[ence]\u201d of discrimination in \u201cjobs,\u201d but also in the \ndistribution of \u201cbenefits,\u201d id. \u00a7 12101(a)(5). So there could \nbe no doubt that retirees\u2019 claims would fall within the Act\u2019s \nzone of interests. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (explaining \nthat, when a statute contains a \u201cdetailed statement of [its] \n\n- 19 - \n \npurposes,\u201d no \u201cguesswork\u201d is required to determine the \nzone of interests). It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone better \nsituated to bring this claim\u2014over her benefits stemming \nfrom her job\u2014than Lt. Stanley. \nB. The what: The ADA protects against \ndiscrimination with respect to post-\nemployment benefits. \nThe ADA\u2019s substantive prohibitions\u2014the what\u2014also \nreach claims from retirees. The ADA specifically guards \nagainst discrimination in post-employment benefits. It \ntargets not just discrimination in hiring and firing but also \nforbids \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By the \ntime the ADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \nmade clear that Title VII\u2019s parallel language protected \npost-employment benefits. See, e.g., Hishon, 467 U.S. at \n77; Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081.   \nThat\u2019s because \u201c[a] benefit need not accrue before a \nperson\u2019s employment is completed\u201d to be protected. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 77. What matters, instead, is that the \nbenefit is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship\u201d; if it is, it may not be \u201cdoled out in a \ndiscriminatory fashion.\u201d Id. at 75. That common-sense \nconclusion means that \u201c[t]here is no question\u201d that \n\u201cretirement benefits\u201d are protected. Norris, 463 U.S. at \n1079; see also Hishon, 467 U.S. at 77. In the twenty-five \nyears between Title VII\u2019s passage and the ADA\u2019s passage, \nthis Court repeatedly entertained Title VII claims about \npost-employment benefits. See Long, 487 U.S. at 225; \nNorris, 463 U.S. at 1074; Manhart, 435 U.S. at 705.  \n\n- 20 - \n \nWhen the ADA adopted Title VII\u2019s terminology, it \ncarried forward this settled meaning. \u201c[T]he enactment of \na new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text \nindicates \u2026 that the new provision has that same \nmeaning.\u201d Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortg. Corp., 580 U.S. 82, \n95 (2017). And the ADA\u2019s protection of post-employment \nbenefits is confirmed by other sections. For example, the \nADA prohibits employers from contracting with an \n\u201corganization providing fringe benefits\u201d in a way that \u201chas \nthe effect\u201d of discriminating on the basis of disability. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(2). \u201c[F]ringe benefits\u201d has a well-\naccepted meaning, and it encompasses post-employment \nbenefits. Howard Delivery Serv., Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. \nCo., 547 U.S. 651, 654 (2006); see also 135 Cong. Rec. \nS10712 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Sen. Harkin) \n(describing the hope that covered individuals would \u201clive \n[their] retirement years in dignity\u201d); Oversight Hearing \non H.R. 4498 before a Subcomm. of H. Comm. Educ. & \nLabor, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 54 (1988) (describing the \nADA\u2019s focus on protecting disabled Americans\u2019 \u201cbenefits \nfor \u2026 health and retirement\u201d). \nAdd that all together, and it is clear that a retiree in \nLt. Stanley\u2019s position has a right to sue. Whether or not \nsuch a retiree is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d when they \nexperience the effects of the discrimination, they are a \ndisabled employee claiming that their employer applied a \ndiscriminatory policy (which the ADA prohibits) to strip \nthem of their benefits (which the ADA protects).  \nIn fact, a benefits policy that facially discriminates \nagainst people with disabilities\u2014everyone in the company \nreceives a pension, except for people with disabilities\u2014\nnecessarily runs afoul of the ADA. It obviously \n\u201cdiscriminate[s] \u2026 on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\n- 21 - \n \n\u00a7 12112(a). And it does so with regard to \u201ccompensation,\u201d \nid., which is paid to people in exchange for their \n\u201cperform[ance of] the essential functions\u201d of an \n\u201cemployment position,\u201d id. \u00a7 12111(8).  \nIn other words, in understanding what the statute \nprotects, the \u201cqualified individual\u201d language is largely \nbeside the point in a case of this kind. As a general \nproposition, employers only pay \u201ccompensation\u201d to \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that\u201d they \u201chold[] or \ndesire[].\u201d Id. And we know from preexisting usage that \nsuch \u201ccompensation\u201d includes benefits employees receive \nafter retirement. So when employers discriminate \u201cin \nregard to \u2026 compensation,\u201d they necessarily do so \n\u201cagainst a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). And as the \nnext section explains, it is proper for an employee (or \nformer employee) to sue whenever such a discriminatory \ncompensation policy affects them\u2014including when they \nreceive their benefits only after retiring. \nC. The when: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nand Title I\u2019s enforcement provision taken \ntogether mean that retirees can sue over post-\nemployment benefits. \nIt is clear, then, that retirees are among the \u201cany \nperson[s]\u201d \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d who can invoke \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement mechanism. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. So \ntoo is it clear that their retirement benefits are \n\u201ccompensation\u201d protected by the Act. Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which Title I \nincorporates, brings Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim across the finish \nline: It allows retirees to bring suit when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \n\n- 22 - \n \n1. Before the Fair Pay Act, those seeking to challenge \ndiscriminatory \npolicies \naffecting \npost-employment \nbenefits faced a challenge: Like Lt. Stanley, they may not \nhave learned about their discriminatory benefits policies \nuntil they were affected after retiring. That could be years \nafter the policies were adopted. Because such a claim \ncould have been characterized as merely seeking redress \nfor the \u201cadverse effects resulting from the past \ndiscrimination,\u201d it could well have been barred by the \nstatute of limitations. Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 628 (2007). \nThe Fair Pay Act resolved this dilemma. It provides \nthat an unlawful employment practice occurs with respect \nto discrimination in compensation: \n[1] when a discriminatory compensation decision \nor other practice is adopted, [2] when an individual \nbecomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, or [3] when an \nindividual is affected by application of a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). This provision applies to the \nADA through its incorporation of Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanisms. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThe Fair Pay Act thus makes clear that a claim under \nthe ADA is timely if the plaintiff sues when she \u201cbecomes \nsubject to\u201d or \u201cis affected by\u201d discrimination that occurred \nduring her tenure. This is true even if the plaintiff doesn\u2019t \nreceive the benefit in question until after her employment \nhas concluded. As a result, the Act permits a plaintiff to \nchallenge an employer\u2019s earlier decision to adopt a \n\n- 23 - \n \ndiscriminatory benefits policy when she is adversely \naffected, either by receiving a reduced benefit or by being \ndenied the benefit entirely. \nCrucially, the Fair Pay Act allows a plaintiff\u2019s claim to \naccrue or re-accrue even after the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nhas concluded. As long as the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject \nto\u201d or \u201cis affected by application of\u201d the employer\u2019s earlier \ndiscriminatory decision after leaving her job, the \nemployer\u2019s liability will accrue or re-accrue then. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), (B). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view \nthat a former employee is no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d because she neither \u201cholds\u201d nor \u201cdesires\u201d a job \nhas no bearing on this analysis. 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The \nFair Pay Act doesn\u2019t treat each discrete payment (or \nnonpayment) as a new discriminatory act that must \nindependently satisfy all of the ADA\u2019s elements. Rather, \nit allows a claim to accrue based on the past discriminatory \ndecision when the plaintiff is affected by that decision. \nThe Fair Pay Act eliminates any doubt about a \npotential mismatch between Congress\u2019s intent to broadly \nprohibit disability-based discrimination in retirement \nbenefits and the ADA\u2019s text. It ensures that plaintiffs can \ntimely enforce the settled rule that \u201cclassification of \nemployees on the basis of [disability] is no more \npermissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than \nat the pay-in stage.\u201d Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081. And it \nreinforces what the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose \nalready make clear: Former employees are protected \nfrom discrimination as to post-employment benefits.  \n2. When Lt. Stanley began her career as a firefighter, \nthe City promised to continue paying her health-insurance \nsubsidy until the age of 65 so long as she \u201cretire[d] with \ntwenty-five (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for \n\n- 24 - \n \ndisability reasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a. That \nretirement subsidy was, without a doubt, part of her \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and thus protected by Title I. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112; see supra 19\u201321. Four years later, and while Lt. \nStanley was still working as a firefighter, the City changed \nits policy to distinguish between \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d \nretirees. Doc. 1 at 12; see also Doc. 39-16 at 27\u201328. The \nlatter were still eligible for the full retirement benefit, but \nthe former would now receive only two years of the health \ncare subsidy (or less, if they qualified for Medicare \nbenefits). Pet. App. 22a. \nLt. Stanley was, of course, employed by the City in \n2003 when this \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision\u201d \nthat she challenges was \u201cadopted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). Thus, even if Lt. Stanley did need to hold or \ndesire a job when the City discriminated against her (but \nsee infra Part II), she did. The City \u201cadopted,\u201d id., its \npolicy in 2003 when Lt. Stanley indisputably was a \nqualified individual, and that policy discriminated \u201con the \nbasis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee compensation\u201d \n(her benefits), id. \u00a7 12112(a). Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim then re-\naccrued in 2020 when she was \u201caffected by application of\u201d \nthe policy (she was denied the health care subsidy). Id. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). That means that she could bring this \nlawsuit exactly when she did to challenge exactly what she \nchallenged.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected this reasoning by \nannouncing that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcedes, and we agree, that \nher claim cannot turn on the 2003 amendment to the \nbenefits plan because she was not yet disabled at that \ntime.\u201d App. 16. Nothing supports the assertion that Lt. \nStanley made that concession. To the contrary, Lt. \nStanley repeatedly argued the opposite, insisting that the \n\n- 25 - \n \nadoption \nof \nthe \npolicy \ndid \nconstitute \nunlawful \ndiscrimination against her. See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 4 \n(allegations in complaint addressing 2003 change); Op. Br. \nat viii\u2013ix (expressly adopting similar argument made in \nthe United States\u2019 amicus brief); Reply Br. at 6 (\u201cIn this \ncase, \nthe \nCity\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nenact \nthe \nfacially \ndiscriminatory 24-Month Rule in 2003 is the initial \n\u2018challenged employment decision.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, [Lt.] Stanley \nwas a \u2018Qualified Individual\u2019 able to perform her firefighter \nduties at the time of the \u2018challenged employment \ndecision.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis omitted); Oral Arg. 4:59\u20135:05 (\u201cAt \nthe time of the discriminatory act in 2003 she was a \nqualified individual.\u201d).  \nTo the extent the Eleventh Circuit held that the 2003 \npolicy change could not be actionable discrimination \nbecause Lt. Stanley \u201cwas not yet disabled at that time,\u201d it \nmisapplied the statute. App. 16. A person need not be \ndisabled to be subjected to unlawful discrimination under \nTitle I. The statute was specifically amended to avoid that \noutcome: It broadly prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis \nof disability\u201d rather than, as it had previously provided, \nonly against a qualified individual \u201cwith a disability.\u201d \nCompare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), with Pub. L. No. 101-336, \nTitle I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990). Here, the City acted \u201con \nthe basis of disability\u201d when it adopted a policy that, on its \nface, limits the amount of time that a person receives a \nsubsidy based on whether that person has a disability. See \nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 200 (1991) \n(\u201c[A]n explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination \nunder\u201d Title VII).  \nIt is of no matter, then, that Lt. Stanley was not yet \ndisabled when the City changed its policy. Even if that was \n(somehow) relevant, it was inevitable that the facially \n\n- 26 - \n \ndiscriminatory policy would harm employees when they \nbecame disabled and had to retire before twenty-five \nyears of service. The Court may thus conceive of this claim \nas encompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became disabled. \nThis Court has recognized that certain Title VII claims \ncan encompass events occurring at different points in time \nas the basis for an action challenging a \u201csingle \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 562 \nn.7 (2016). By analogy, the same holds true here.  \nThe Fair Pay Act also demonstrates that the City \ndiscriminated against Lt. Stanley again when that same \ndiscriminatory policy was applied to her as she neared her \ninevitable early retirement. At that point, although she did \nnot yet feel the effects of the policy, Lt. Stanley became \n\u201csubject to\u201d it, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); the policy \nconclusively determined what benefits she would receive \nonce her fast-approaching forced retirement began and, in \nthat way, removed her access to the more expansive \nbenefits package available to people without disabilities. \nSee Castellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 68 (2d \nCir. 1998) (\u201c[A]n employee\u2019s entitlement to post-\nemployment fringe benefits arises \u2026 during his period of \nemployment.\u201d). That too is an \u201cunlawful employment \npractice\u201d \nthat \n\u201coccur[ed]\u201d \nduring \nLt. \nStanley\u2019s \nemployment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).1  \n \n1 The third way in which an unlawful employment practice \noccurs\u2014the individual becoming \u201caffected\u201d by the discriminatory \ndecision\u2014remains relevant here because it removes any doubt that \nLt. Stanley\u2019s claim is timely. She was \u201caffected\u201d when her subsidy \nended.  \n\n- 27 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit declined to address that alleged \ndiscrimination too, because Lt. Stanley \u201caffirmatively \nconceded\u201d that she was not \u201cimpacted by [the City\u2019s \npolicy] during her employment.\u201d App. 18. But that Lt. \nStanley was not yet \u201cimpacted\u201d (in terms of receiving a \ndecreased health care subsidy) in no way undermines her \nclaim. That\u2019s what the Fair Pay Act makes clear: A person \ncan be discriminated against when a \u201cdecision\u201d or \n\u201cpractice\u201d is \u201cadopted,\u201d or when they \u201cbecome[] subject \nto\u201d it, even if they are not \u201caffected by\u201d it until later. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \nII. The ADA does not require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding was wrong for \nanother, independent reason: One does not need to \ncurrently \u201chold[] or desire\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d under the ADA. The court below reached its \nholding by focusing on the definition of discrimination in \nsection 12112(a) and of \u201cqualified individual\u201d in section \n12111(8). Based on those provisions, it held that it is legal \nfor employers to discriminate against former employees \non the basis of disability.  \nNothing in the statute\u2019s text demands that surprising \nresult. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s error is explained by its \nmisunderstanding \nof \nthe \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, because section 12112(a) \nprohibits discrimination against \u201cqualified individuals\u201d \nand the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d speaks in the \npresent tense\u2014referring to a person who \u201ccan perform\u201d a \njob that the person \u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d\u2014the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against a person while they \nhold (or are applying to) a job. App. 11.  \n\n- 28 - \n \nBut the court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatutory definition to impose two distinct requirements: \n\u201cQualified individual means an individual who (a) holds or \ndesires an employment position and (b) can perform the \nessential functions of that employment position.\u201d The text \nonly imposes one requirement: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nmeans an individual who \u2026 can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The text asks only \none question\u2014what \u201ccan\u201d you do? \nThis understanding of the definition\u2019s text makes \nperfect sense given its role in the statute: It operates to \nafford employers cabined authority to act on the basis of \ndisability when doing so is necessary to preserve the \nfunctioning of the business. That is why the term is \ndefined with reference to \u201cessential functions,\u201d not \u201cany \nfunction.\u201d Its text is best read to impose only a conditional \nmandate, which tracks that role. If a person has (or seeks) \na job, that person must be able to perform its essential \nfunctions; if no such job exists\u2014because the person is \nretired\u2014the definition does not operate as a limit on the \nADA\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. In other words, the \ndefinition asks if you \u201ccan\u201d perform the functions of a job \nthat you hold or desire, not if you have or want one.  \nA. The text of section 12111(8) and its place in \nthe statutory scheme confirm that the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition tests if you \ncan do a job, not if you have one.   \nThe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d exists to give \nemployers the cabined ability to act on the basis of job-\nrelated concerns so that they are not forced to hire or \nretain people who are incapable, even with the benefit of \nreasonable accommodations, of performing essential \n\n- 29 - \n \ntasks. We know that is the definition\u2019s role because of its \nplain text, its place in the statutory scheme, and its \nrelationship to other sections of the statute.  \n1. Text and purpose. \u201cStart with the text.\u201d Arellano v. \nMcDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 8 (2023). The definition asks if an \nindividual \u201ccan perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It does \nnot ask if an individual \u201cholds or desires an employment \nposition whose essential functions she can perform.\u201d The \nlatter formulation would impose the \u201cmust hold or desire \na job\u201d requirement that the Eleventh Circuit perceived. \nThe former asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a thing, not if you are \ndoing that thing or would do it.  \nThat the definition asks what an individual \u201ccan\u201d do \nmakes sense given its role in the statutory scheme. The \ndefinition gives employers necessary, but circumscribed, \nflexibility in light of the Act\u2019s sweeping impact. Title I \nprovides protection in all aspects of the employment \nrelationship. It broadly prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d in \n\u201cjob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or \ndischarge of employees, employee compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.\u201d \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a). \nThat \ncovers \neverything from job applications to post-employment \nbenefits\u2014if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the \nemployment \nrelationship,\u201d \nan \nemployer \ncannot \n\u201cdiscriminate.\u201d Hishon, 467 U.S. at 75; supra at 19\u201321.  \nTitle I prohibits both \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d and \n\u201cdisparate impact.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 52 (2003). But it also goes further, \u201crequir[ing] \naffirmative \nconduct\u201d \nto \nensure \n\u201cthose \nwith \ndisabilities \u2026 obtain the same workplace opportunities \n\n- 30 - \n \nthat those without disabilities [] enjoy.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. \nat 397, 401; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). Accordingly, the \nAct at times requires employers not to treat people with \ndisabilities \nequally, \nbut \ninstead \nto \ntreat \nthem \n\u201cpreferentially.\u201d \nBarnett, \n535 U.S. \nat \n397. \nThat \naffirmative mandate is reflected in the Act\u2019s definition of \ndiscrimination, which \u201cincludes \u2026 not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental \nlimitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).  \nBecause of the Act\u2019s \u201cbold ambitions\u201d and \u201cfar-\nreaching\u201d scope, though, Congress recognized the need \nfor delineated \u201climits.\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2415\u201316 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting from the denial \nof certiorari). As this Court has held, the ADA achieves its \nimportant \u201cobjectives\u201d within \u201cthe realm of the \nreasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. Without some \nqualification, the statute would prevent employers from \ndenying employment to people whose disabilities, no \nmatter the steps taken to accommodate them, prevent \nthem from performing their jobs. A swimming pool could \nface liability for refusing to hire as a lifeguard a person \nwhose disability left her unable to swim. Congress, \nunsurprisingly, did not want to prohibit that sort of \nrational, and necessary, decision-making.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition ensures that \nemployers have the necessary leeway. The only people \nwho employers must hire, retain, and accommodate are \nthose who, \u201cwith or without\u201d accommodations, \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The definition, then, exists \nto allow employers to screen out people who can\u2019t perform \n\n- 31 - \n \nthe core, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue. What \nit does not do, however, is grant employers a license to \nimplement \ndiscriminatory \nemployment \npolicies \nor \nindividual employment actions that have nothing to do \nwith an individual\u2019s ability to do a relevant job.  \n2. Statutory scheme. This understanding of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2014as a screen that \nprevents employers from being obligated to hire and \naccommodate those who can\u2019t perform a job\u2014neatly \naligns with the rest of the statutory scheme that Congress \ndevised. Several provisions of the Act allow employers to \ntake actions that are justified in relation to the operation \nof their business. None of them invite employers to take \ndiscriminatory actions that have nothing to do with \nlegitimate business needs.  \nFor example, even when employers must provide \naccommodations, they need only be \u201creasonable,\u201d and \neven those they can forego if they \u201ccan demonstrate that \nthe accommodation would impose an undue hardship\u201d on \ntheir \u201coperation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \u201c[Q]ualification \nstandards\u201d that screen out people with disabilities are \nimpermissible, unless that standard \u201cis shown to be job-\nrelated for the position in question and is consistent with \nbusiness necessity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(6). Other examples are \nsprinkled across the statute. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(7) \n(making it unlawful to administer \u201ctests concerning \nemployment\u201d unless those tests measure a person\u2019s \naptitude and skills rather than merely reflecting any \nimpairments); \nid. \n\u00a7 \n12112(d)(2) \n(prohibiting \npre-\nemployment \nmedical \nexaminations \nbut \npermitting \n\u201cinquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-\nrelated functions\u201d).  \n\n- 32 - \n \nEach of these provisions reflects a balance struck in \nthe Act: Discrimination is prohibited\u2014from application \nthrough retirement\u2014but employers have leeway to act on \nthe basis of disability where a sufficiently weighty and \nlegitimate business need calls for it. The \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition does just that\u2014nothing more, \nnothing less. It is not concerned with whether you have a \njob; it is concerned with employers\u2019 needs in relation to \ntheir current and future employees. Reading it to allow \ndiscrimination against former employees, by contrast \nmakes it do work in the statute that it simply is not doing. \n3. Surplusage. The court of appeals\u2019 reading also turns \nkey provisions of the Act into surplusage. It is a \u201c\u2018cardinal \nprincipal\u2019 of interpretation that courts must give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Parker \nDrilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 602 \n(2019). Accordingly, the canon against surplusage \ninstructs that a statute should be construed \u201cso that no \npart will be inoperative or superfluous, void or \ninsignificant.\u201d Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U.S. \n202, 213 (2018). \nThe ADA\u2019s definition of discrimination, section \n12112(b)(5)(A), states that discrimination \u201cincludes \u2026 not \nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical \nor mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  \nThis language tells us that the Act contemplates the \nexistence of some qualified individuals who are neither \n\u201capplicant[s] [n]or employee[s].\u201d If the court of appeals \nwas right that the qualified individual definition already \nscreens out individuals who do not \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a \njob, then this modifier\u2014\u201cwho is an applicant or employee\u201d \n\n- 33 - \n \n\u2014would be surplusage. And an interpretation that \n\u201ctreat[s]\u201d those \u201cstatutory terms as surplusage,\u201d \nparticularly when they\u2019re found in such a \u201cpivotal [] place \nin the statutory scheme\u201d (the reasonable-accommodation \nprovision), should give us pause. Duncan v. Walker, \n533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). \u201cThe canon against surplusage is \nstrongest \nwhen \nan \ninterpretation \nwould \nrender \nsuperfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\u201d \nCity of Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. 154, 159 (2021).   \nThat there are \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d not covered by \nsection 12112\u2019s reasonable-accommodation mandate is \nconfirmed by the other way its reach is narrowed. \nEmployers need only make reasonable accommodations \nfor \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). To be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d though, you need not have a disability. The \nADA was specifically amended to extend the \u201cgeneral\u201d \nantidiscrimination mandate not only to discrimination \nagainst persons \u201cwith a disability,\u201d but to more broadly \nreach discrimination \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d Compare \nPub. L. No. 101-336, Title I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990), \nwith 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Because there are \u201cqualified \nindividual[s]\u201d who are not disabled, as well as those who \nno longer hold or desire a job, then, the reasonable-\naccommodation provision makes perfect sense. That \nsection recognizes the breadth of who can be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d and then subtracts from its mandate the need \nto accommodate any \u201cqualified individual\u201d who is not a \nperson \u201cwith a disability\u201d and who is not \u201can applicant or \nemployee,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2014because only \ndisabled individuals engaged in (or seeking) active \nemployment actually need \u201caccommodations.\u201d   \n\n- 34 - \n \nSection 12112 thus demonstrates that, when Congress \nintended to limit the reach of a substantive protection to \napplicants and employees, it did so explicitly. \nB. Common usage, grammar, and logic all \ndemonstrate that the text does not compel \nreading \u201cqualified individual\u201d to exclude \nretirees. \nNothing in the text of the definition of \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d demands reading it to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. The Eleventh \nCircuit concluded otherwise, reasoning that, because of \nthe definition, the \u201cplain language\u201d of the anti-\ndiscrimination rule \u201cexpressly applie[s] only to \u2018qualified \nindividuals with a disability\u2019 who \u2018hold[]\u2019 or \u2018desire[]\u2019 an \n\u2018employment position.\u2019\u201d App. 7. But that reading seemed \nplain only because the court of appeals misunderstood a \nkey part of the definition: \nThe \nterm \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nmeans \nan \nindividual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, \ncan \nperform \nthe \nessential \nfunctions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It is the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause that makes the definition carry out its \nimportant role in the statute. See supra 29\u201331. That\u2019s how \nit tests an employee\u2019s capabilities. And retirees are not \nunable to pass this test\u2014that is, they\u2019re not unable to \nperform the essential functions of a job that they hold or \ndesire. \nTo be sure, testing the job capabilities of someone who \nis no longer working may seem logically awkward. But \nthat doesn\u2019t mean that retirees fail the test; it instead \n\n- 35 - \n \nhighlights the conditional nature of the requirement. And, \nas we explain below, common sense, common usage, and \nlogic all suggest that the best reading (or at least an \nequally plausible one) is that retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d But even if one thought that the test was \nambiguous when applied to retirees, that still would \nrequire rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading, which is \n\u201c[in]consistent with the broader context\u201d of Title I \u201cand \nthe primary purpose of\u201d the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 849; see id. (holding that \n\u201cthe term \u2018employees,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII\u201d \ncovers \u201cformer employees\u201d despite the text being \n\u201cambiguous\u201d because that reading is \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of Title VII and the primary \npurpose of \u00a7 704(a)\u201d). \n1. Common usage. Title I defines a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d as \u201can individual who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The Eleventh \nCircuit mistakenly read that definition to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. But that is not \nthe only (or best) way to read the definition. A few parallel \nexamples demonstrate how an ordinary reader interprets \na sentence like this one.  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie unless you silence your cell \nphone.\u201d If you come to the theater without a phone, do you \nviolate this rule? Surely no. That\u2019s because this rule \nrequires that patrons turn off their phones only to the \nextent that they have phones to turn off. For the same \nreason, a person without a phone can attend court despite \na rule that says \u201c[y]ou must turn off your cell phone before \n\n- 36 - \n \nentering the courtroom.\u201d2 The rules\u2014and their respective \npurposes\u2014are satisfied. \u201c[C]ommon sense,\u201d Pereira v. \nSessions, 585 U.S. 198, 211 (2018), tells us how to read \nthese rules. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 \n(2014) (\u201cThe notion that some things \u2018go without saying\u2019 \napplies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.\u201d). \nConsider another example. NASA gives an award each \nyear to the \u201camateur astronomer\u201d who \u201cdiscovered the \nintrinsically brightest near-Earth asteroid\u201d in the \nprevious year. 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(c)(3)(A). As defined by \nthe statute, \u201camateur astronomer means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, payment, \nor compensation to the individual for the observation of \nasteroids and other celestial bodies.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30902(b)(1). Is \nan unemployed person with a home telescope eligible to \nwin that prize? Of course. What this rule obviously means \nin context is that, if you have an employer and if that \nemployer pays for your stargazing, you can\u2019t be an \n\u201camateur astronomer.\u201d Unemployed people don\u2019t fail that \ntest; they easily pass it.  \nOr try this one: \u201cA passenger may not board an \naircraft unless it is determined that the passenger is a \n\u2018cleared individual.\u2019\u201d \u201cA \u2018cleared individual\u2019 means an \nindividual who can successfully complete an x-ray \nscreening of the baggage that such individual carries or \nchecks.\u201d Does this hypothetical rule prohibit passengers \nwith no bags from boarding a plane? Obviously not. This \nrule doesn\u2019t require that a passenger have a carry-on or \nchecked bag; it requires the screening of any bag to the \nextent that a passenger has such luggage.  \n \n2 Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Self-Guided Tour, \nhttps://perma.cc/2BVB-2K4P. \n\n- 37 - \n \nIndeed, an actual TSA regulation provides that \u201c[n]o \nindividual may \u2026 board an aircraft without submitting to \nthe screening and inspection of\u201d her \u201caccessible \nproperty[.]\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.107(a). This regulation \nobviously doesn\u2019t require that a passenger carry any \n\u201caccessible property,\u201d only that she submit to the \nscreening of that property to the extent she has any.  \nAnother federal statute requires the government to \npay individuals for the \u201ccost of a comparable replacement \ndwelling\u201d when a federal project displaces them. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4623(a)(1)(A). Whether something qualifies as \na \n\u201ccomparable \nreplacement \ndwelling\u201d \nrequires \nconsidering how far away it is from the displaced person\u2019s \noriginal home \u201cwith respect to public utilities, facilities, \nservices, and \nthe \ndisplaced \nperson\u2019s \nplace \nof \nemployment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4601(10) (emphasis added). The lack \nof a \u201cplace of employment\u201d can\u2019t possibly bar retirees \nfrom financial support.  \nNotably, Title II of the ADA has a similar textual \nfeature. That section forbids discrimination in public \n\u201cservices, programs, or activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Like \nTitle I, it makes use of \u201cqualified individual\u201d language: \n\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d Id. And its definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nhas a similar structure to Title I\u2019s: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nwith a disability means an individual with a disability who, \nwith or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, \nor \npractices \u2026 meets \nthe \nessential \neligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the \n\n- 38 - \n \nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12131(2) (emphasis added). \nNow consider a \u201crecreational\u201d program covered by the \nAct, United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 (2006) \n(discussing \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cservices, \nprograms, \nor \nactivities\u201d), like the Washington & Old Dominion trail, \nwhich has no \u201cessential eligibility requirements\u201d for \n\u201cparticipation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2). The trail is open to \neveryone free of charge. Except that it has one rule: \u201cNo \npeople in wheelchairs.\u201d That blatant exclusion certainly \nviolates Title II. The fact that the trail has no \u201cessential \neligibility requirements\u201d does not mean the excluded \nperson with a disability ceases to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Instead, Title II is naturally read to say that, \nto \nthe \nextent \nthere \nare \n\u201cessential \neligibility \nrequirements,\u201d an individual must meet them. \nAlthough rules written this way can sometimes read \nawkwardly when their implicit condition fails, courts \nroutinely figure out how to interpret them. Take the \nfederal \ncompassionate-release \nstatute. \nThat \nlaw \nauthorizes a court to \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment\u201d \nwhen, among other things, the \u201creduction is consistent \nwith applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). In \nthe period after Congress passed the First Step Act, but \nbefore the Sentencing Commission revised its policy \nstatement, \nthe \n\u201coverwhelming \nmajority \nof \ncircuits \u2026 agreed that\u201d the only potentially relevant \npolicy statement was not \u201capplicable.\u201d 3 Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. \n\u00a7 638.2 (5th ed. 2024). But courts didn\u2019t get hung up on \nwhether modifying a term of imprisonment was or wasn\u2019t \n\u201cconsistent\u201d \nwith \na \nnon-existent \nset \nof \n\u201cpolicy \n\n- 39 - \n \nstatements.\u201d Instead, they (sensibly) read the text to \nmean that a sentence reduction must be consistent with \nthe applicable policy statements to the extent there are \nany. Id. at nn. 23\u201324 (explaining that eight of nine circuits \nwho considered the question took this view, with the \nEleventh Circuit as the lone \u201coutlier\u201d). \nAs the compassionate-release cases demonstrate, \n\u201ccourts can \u2026 find implied conditionality as a function of \na statute\u2019s syntax\u201d and \u201cthe nature of written language.\u201d \nEric S. Fish, Severability As Conditionality, 64 Emory \nL.J. 1293, 1337\u201339 (2015); Michael McCarthy & Ronald \nCarter, \nCambridge \nGrammar \nof \nEnglish: \nA \nComprehensive Guide 755\u201356 (2006) (explaining that \n\u201c[c]onditions can be conveyed without any overt \nconditional subordinator\u201d and that \u201cconditions can be \nexpressed\u201d with \u201cthe omission of conjunctions such as if\u201d); \nsee, e.g., Boesche v. Udall, 373 U.S. 472, 479 (1963) (in a \ncase where there was \u201cno lease to cancel,\u201d declining to \nread a provision on lease cancellation\u2014which \u201csp[oke] \nentirely in terms of post-lease occurrences\u201d and \n\u201cassume[d] the existence of a valid lease\u201d\u2014to render the \nAct as a whole \u201cself-defeating\u201d).3 \nIn each example above, the rule presumes that some \npredicate condition exists (you have an employer, luggage, \n \n3 The proposition that some sentences are implicitly conditional is \nunextraordinary. \u201cWhen a command is conditional, its condition may \nbe either overt or explicit on the one hand (\u2018When it rains, close the \nwindows!!\u2019) or tacit or implicit on the other (\u2018Drive carefully!\u2019 [means] \n\u2018When you drive, drive carefully!!\u2019).\u201d Nicholas Rescher, The Logic of \nCommands 24 (1966); see also Chi-H\u00e9 Elder, Context, Cognition, and \nConditionals 2 (2019) (\u201c[W]hile conditional sentences in English are \noften associated with the canonical form \u2018if p, q,\u2019 we also know that \nneither the use of \u2018if\u2019 nor a two-clause structure is essential for \nexpressing a conditional thought.\u201d). \n\n- 40 - \n \nor a phone; the program has eligibility requirements), and \nyour compliance with the rule is determined in relation to \nthat predicate. But as each example makes clear, the \nabsence of the thing presumed doesn\u2019t mean that you \nnecessarily violate the rule. Instead, it will often mean (as \nit does in each one of those examples) that the rule is \neffectively satisfied or that its requirement controls only \nto the extent that the predicate condition actually exists.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition in Title I can \neasily be read like each of those examples. The rule tests \nwhether an individual is sufficiently qualified for a job. See \nsupra 29\u201331. Where there is no job and there are no \n\u201cessential functions,\u201d the test is satisfied. And because its \napplication to retirees has no relationship to its textual \nfunction in the statute, common sense says it should not \nbe applied to bar claims by retirees who no longer \n\u201chold[]or desire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2379 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cContext also includes common sense.\u201d); The \nFederalist No. 83, at 559 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe \nrules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense.\u201d). \n2. Grammar. The grammatical structure of the \ndefinition\u2014and the role of the \u201cholds or desires\u201d clause in \nthe sentence in particular\u2014further demonstrates that the \ntext does not compel the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nBecause \u201c[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper \ngrammar and usage would assign them,\u201d Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts 140 (2012), the \u201crules of grammar govern\u201d \nstatutory \ninterpretation \n\u201cunless \nthey \ncontradict \nlegislative intent or purpose,\u201d id. (citing Costello v. INS, \n376 U.S. 120, 122\u2013126 (1964)). \n\n- 41 - \n \nConsider this rule at an apartment complex: \u201cYou \nmust clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d Here, \u201cthat \nyou own\u201d tells us which pets we\u2019re talking about: the ones \nyou own, if you own any. It doesn\u2019t mean that you must \nown a pet, or that all pets are owned by you, or that you \nhave to clean up after other people\u2019s pets. The rule is \ntelling us that, if you own a pet, you\u2019ve got to clean up after \nit. Similarly, in the ADA\u2019s definition, the clause \u201cthat such \nindividual holds or desires\u201d modifies \u201cemployment \nposition.\u201d See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) \n(\u201c[A] limiting clause or phrase \u2026 should ordinarily be \nread as modifying only the noun or phrase that it \nimmediately follows.\u201d). It is introduced by the pronoun \n\u201cthat,\u201d which sets up what grammarians call a \u201crestrictive \nclause.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, Modern English Usage 1086\u2013\n87 (5th ed. 2022). This clause simply tells us which \nposition\u2019s functions matter, see id.\u2014here, \u201cthe essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). \nThe restrictive clause thus does not create a \nfreestanding temporal requirement that an individual \nmust currently hold a job. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 \nF.3d 60, 69 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that \u201ca restrictive \nclause\u201d that modifies a noun in an immigration statute \n\u201cdoes not impose a separate temporal requirement\u201d). \nRather, \nit \nspecifies \nwhich \njob\u2019s \nfunctions \nare \nrelevant if the individual either holds or desires a job.  \nThe court of appeals, however, misread this clause. It \ntreated \u201cholds or desires\u201d as though it imposed a separate \nrequirement, rather than simply identifying the relevant \njob. This misreading assumes that a clause doing one thing \n(specifying which job matters) is instead doing something \nelse entirely (requiring current or future employment). \n\n- 42 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s emphasis on the present tense-\nverbs thus reflects a basic misunderstanding of the \nrestrictive clause\u2019s grammatical function.  \n \n3. Logic. Reading the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees like Lt. Stanley not only \nreflects common sense and common usage but is also \nsound as a matter of basic logic: Lt. Stanley satisfies the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition because she is not unable \nto perform the essential functions of any job that she \ncurrently holds or desires. The definition doesn\u2019t require \nher to be able to perform her former job; it only asks about \nher ability to perform the functions of a job that she now \n\u201cholds or desires,\u201d which is none.  \nThis simple conclusion\u2014that can perform is logically \nequivalent to not unable to perform\u2014follows from a basic \nprinciple of \u201cclassical logic.\u201d Bethel v. Jefferson, 589 F.2d \n631, 639 n.49 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (reasoning that a plaintiff \nwho wasn\u2019t in a \u201cunit\u201d of government \u201cin the competitive \nservice\u201d necessarily fell under a Title VII provision \ngoverning everyone else). It \u201cholds simply that every \nalternation of a sentence with its negation is true.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Willard Van Orman Quine, Philosophy of Logic \n15, 83\u201387 (1970)).4 \n \n4 This law of double negation comes from the \u201claw of the excluded \nmiddle,\u201d one of Aristotle\u2019s three laws of thought. Irving Copi, \nIntroduction to Logic 372\u201373 (1994). An explanation goes like this: \u201cIf \nyou have a proposition P, either P is true, or P is false; that is, either \nP is true or non-P is true. We cannot have a third possibility. As a \nconsequence of the excluded middle, we have the principle of double \nnegation: Negation of negation is equivalent to affirmation.\u201d Alain \nBadiou, The Three Negations, 29 Cardozo L. Rev. 1877, 1878 (2008).  \n\n- 43 - \n \nC. Reading \u201cqualified individual\u201d in context to \ninclude retirees is consistent with the \nstatutory scheme and avoids creating \nsurplusage and absurd consequences.  \nAs everything above demonstrates, the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is \ncertainly not compelled by the text. But reading the \ndefinition to include retirees isn\u2019t necessarily compelled \nby the text alone, either. The only way to answer the \nquestion is with some context. Indeed, \u201cinterpretation \nalways depends on context.\u201d Scalia & Garner, Reading \nLaw at 63; see Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation \nDist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 415 \n(2005) (\u201cStatutory language has meaning only in \ncontext.\u201d). Ours is the only reading that makes sense of \nthe statutory scheme as a whole.  \n1. The text must be read in context, not in isolation. \nWe concede that some implicitly conditional rules that \nread like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might be \nnaturally read in context as excluding those who can\u2019t \nsatisfy the condition. Others, however, go the other way. \nConsider these two airport security rules: \n(A) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the baggage that \nsuch individual carries.\u201d Can you get through with \nno bags? \n(B) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must scan \nthe boarding pass that such individual carries.\u201d Can \nyou get through with no boarding pass?  \nThe syntax is the same. But our inclination is probably \nto say yes to the first question, and no to the second. If you \ndon\u2019t have a boarding pass, you likely won\u2019t get through. \n\n- 44 - \n \nYet we somehow know that the person without bags is in \nthe clear. A gadfly passenger might point out that rule (B) \nliterally only requires scanning a pass \u201cthat such \nindividual carries.\u201d That hyperliteralism likely won\u2019t \npersuade the security officers. But he\u2019d have a point\u2014 the \nrule surely could have been written more clearly to \nexpress that you must have a boarding pass: \u201cNo \nindividual may go through security without a boarding \npass.\u201d \nAs with the airport rules, Congress could have written \nthe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to more obviously \ninclude, or exclude, retirees. You might think that \nCongress could have clarified that retirees are covered by \nusing the word \u201cany.\u201d But referring to \u201cany employment \nposition that such individual \u2026 desires\u201d would have been \nawkward and confusing. The point of the restrictive clause \nis to tell us which position a job seeker must qualify for (a \nparticular position), not to suggest any position she might \nwant. So \u201cwe can see why a Congress,\u201d with our reading \nin mind, \u201cmight have chosen\u201d against \u201cany,\u201d despite its \nsurface appeal. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 138. The indefinite \narticle \u201can\u201d might have been clearer; but it too would have \ncarried a similar risk of confusion, which may explain why \nthe drafters used \u201cthe.\u201d (They were focused on tying \nqualifications to \u201cthe\u201d position at issue.)  \nEven if Congress had used \u201cany\u201d or \u201can,\u201d though, the \nCity would presumably still be here with the same \narguments. So it\u2019s not clear that even this would have \n\u201cdelivered us from interpretive controversy\u201d and ended \nthe \u201cgrammatical back-and-forth.\u201d Id. On the other hand, \nit would have been easy to clearly exclude retirees: \u201cA \nqualified individual means an individual who holds or \n\n- 45 - \n \ndesires an employment position and who can perform the \nessential functions of that position.\u201d  \nIn any event, conceding that Congress could have \ndrafted the definition more clearly to include retirees \ndoesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not the right reading. See Gardner \nv. Collins, 27 U.S. 58, 86\u201387 (1829) (Story, J.) (holding that, \nalthough \u201cthe words \u2018if any there be\u2019 [were] omitted\u201d from \none version of the same statute, \u201cthe legislative intention \nin both acts was the same\u201d). This Court does not \u201cdemand \n(or in truth expect) that Congress draft in the most \ntranslucent way possible.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 137.   \u201cThe \nquestion, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated\u201d its \nintent to protect retirees \u201cin more crystalline fashion\u201d? \nTorres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 472\u201373 (2016). \u201cThe \nquestion is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and \nfair reading of the statute\u201d that Congress actually \nwrote? Id. at 473.   \nUltimately, there\u2019s no single \u201cgrammatical principle\u201d \nthat conclusively answers that question. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. \nat 137. Instead, what each of the examples shows is that \ndeciding whether a rule like this one includes or excludes \nretirees requires considering its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d \nId. at 138 n.5. \u201c[S]tated in the usual language of statutory \nconstruction, the answer [] lie[s] in considering the \n[definition\u2019s] text in its legal context.\u201d Id. at 141.  \n2. The statutory context makes clear that retirees \nare protected by the ADA.  \nReading the \u201ctext\u201d in \u201ccontext\u201d is how we know that \nretirees are \u201cqualified individual[s].\u201d Id. The definition\u2019s \ntext asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a job. It asks that question \nbecause the provision\u2019s role is to screen out from the Act\u2019s \nprotections those who can\u2019t perform essential functions of \na job, and whose inclusion would therefore impede the \n\n- 46 - \n \nemployer\u2019s legitimate business prerogatives. See supra \n29\u201331. There\u2019s no \u201cplausible, or even cogent, explanation\u201d \nfor why a definition with this function would exclude \nretirees, who are not asked to perform any essential \nfunctions at all. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 148 n.7; see Scalia & \nGarner, Reading Law at 20 (explaining that an \u201cessential \nelement of context that gives meaning to words\u201d is the \n\u201cevident purpose of what a text seeks to achieve\u201d).  \nInterpreting \nthe \ndefinition \nto \ninclude \nformer \nemployees also avoids creating \u201csuperfluity.\u201d Pulsifer, \n601 U.S. at 142. On the court of appeals\u2019 reading, there\u2019s \nno role for the language limiting the reasonable-\naccommodation mandate to a \u201cqualified individual \u2026 who \nis an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \nBy contrast, interpreting \u201cqualified individual\u201d to include \nretirees means that there is no surplusage; this, too, is \nrelevant \u201clegal context.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 141. \nThere\u2019s more. Recognizing that the definition does not \nexclude retirees gives force to the various provisions of the \nAct that protect retirees: Its inclusion of retirement \nbenefits as part and parcel of \u201ccompensation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a), and its express allowance for a particular kind \n(but not the kind alleged in this case) of decision-making, \n\u201cbased on underwriting risks, classifying risks, [and] \nadministering such risks,\u201d when \u201cestablishing\u201d or \n\u201cadministering\u201d \u201cbenefit[s] plans,\u201d id. \u00a7 12201(c)(2).  \nThis reading also maintains congruity between the \nADA and Title VII, the statute on which much of Title I \nwas \u201cmodeled.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 420 (Souter, J., \ndissenting). As this Court made clear in Robinson v. Shell \nOil Co., many of Title VII\u2019s protections apply with full \nforce to \u201cformer employees.\u201d 519 U.S. at 342.  \n\n- 47 - \n \nFinally, \ninterpreting \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees avoids the absurd results that \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation invites. The court of \nappeals\u2019 view means that employers are free to do the day \nafter retirement what they certainly could not do the day \nbefore. An employer motivated by nothing but raw animus \ncould lawfully strip a former employee who becomes \ndisabled after retiring of their benefits\u2014benefits that the \nstatute protects and that were earned while \u201cperform[ing] \nthe essential functions of the employment position\u201d the \nretiree held. And they could do so while openly stating \nthat the decision was based solely on their preference for \n\u201cnormal\u201d retirees over \u201cdisabled\u201d ones. See Doc. 1 at 12.  \nAn interpretation that allows that result\u2014which the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s does\u2014would \u201cnegate [the ADA\u2019s] own \nstated purposes.\u201d New York State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. \nDublino, 413 U.S. 405, 420 (1973). Had Congress made a \ndeliberate choice to adopt that surprising and dramatic \ndeparture from the design of Title VII, it\u2019s hard to believe \nthat it would have done so through the use of present-\ntense verbs in an ambiguous restrictive clause at the end \nof a definitional provision. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress \u2026 does not, \none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d). \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might, \u201cat first \nblush,\u201d then, allow the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation. \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341. But any confidence in that first \nimpression gives way on a closer look, and resort to the \nordinary tools of statutory construction\u2014text and \u201cthe \nbroader context of\u201d the ADA\u2014all lead to the same \nconclusion: The ADA does not allow employers to freely \ndiscriminate against their former employees.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case remains stable following this internal reasoning step, which served to consolidate the significant shift in my beliefs caused by the Respondent's brief. This observation confirms my current assessment of the case as a finely balanced contest, a stark change from my initial strong conviction in favor of the Petitioner.\n\nMy cumulative understanding is as follows:\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Case:** The foundation of the Petitioner's argument rests on two pillars:\n    *   **Textual/Structural:** The ADA's broad language should be interpreted to protect former employees, consistent with its remedial purpose.\n    *   **Precedent:** The unanimous Supreme Court decision in *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*, which found that Title VII protects former employees from retaliation, should be controlling precedent due to the parallel structure and purpose of the two statutes.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Powerful Rebuttal:** My analysis of the Respondent's brief introduced critical counter-arguments that have reshaped my prediction:\n    *   **Procedural \"Off-Ramp\" (Waiver):** The City's lead argument is that the Petitioner waived the claim that discrimination occurred *during* her employment (i.e., when the policy was changed in 2003). If the Court accepts this procedural argument, it could affirm the Eleventh Circuit's decision without ever reaching the merits of the ADA question, making this a potentially dispositive issue.\n    *   **Textual Distinction of *Robinson*:** The City argues that unlike the ambiguous term \"employees\" in Title VII (at issue in *Robinson*), the ADA provides a specific, present-tense definition of a \"qualified individual\" as someone who \"holds or desires\" a position. They contend this specific definition must trump the general principle of parallel construction with Title VII. This is a strong textualist argument that I had previously underestimated.\n    *   **Narrative Reframing:** The City has effectively reframed the facts, portraying the 24-month subsidy not as a discriminatory penalty but as a compassionate, preferential benefit that bridges disabled retirees to Medicare eligibility\u2014a benefit not offered to non-disabled employees who leave before 25 years of service.\n\n3.  **Current Prediction & Uncertainty:** My prediction has shifted from strongly favoring the Petitioner to a near toss-up, possibly leaning slightly toward the City of Sanford due to the strength of the waiver argument. My primary uncertainty is no longer what the City will argue, but *how effectively the Petitioner can rebut these specific points*. The single most important piece of evidence needed to resolve this uncertainty is the **Petitioner's Reply Brief**. My analysis is now laser-focused on seeing how the Petitioner addresses the waiver claim and the textual attack on the *Robinson* precedent.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal reasoning, serves to validate and operationalize the design principles learned from analyzing the Respondent's brief. It represents a crucial metacognitive step where I apply my learned heuristics to guide my next action. My methodology has evolved from simple document analysis to a strategic, uncertainty-driven inquiry.\n\nMy cumulative design principles are:\n1.  **Source Prioritization:** The core briefing sequence (Certiorari Petition -> Petitioner's Merits Brief -> Respondent's Merits Brief -> Petitioner's Reply Brief) is confirmed as the most efficient path to a comprehensive understanding of a case. The current `THINK` action explicitly identifies the Reply Brief as the next logical and highest-value source in this sequence.\n\n2.  **Argument Deconstruction & Prediction:** The practice of breaking down arguments into their core components and predicting counter-arguments remains a highly effective heuristic. My prediction that the Respondent *must* distinguish *Robinson* was validated, allowing for a more rapid and focused analysis of their brief.\n\n3.  **The Primacy of Procedural Defenses:** I have learned to prioritize the identification of procedural arguments like waiver, standing, or timeliness. These are not secondary issues but potential \"off-ramps\" that can decide a case without a ruling on the merits. My current focus on the Petitioner's rebuttal to the waiver claim is a direct application of this principle.\n\n4.  **Mastering Canons of Construction:** I now actively look for the application of interpretive canons, such as \"the specific trumps the general.\" The Respondent's use of this canon to distinguish the ADA's specific definition from Title VII's general term \"employees\" was a masterclass in legal persuasion that I must now incorporate into my own analytical toolkit.\n\n5.  **Narrative as a Decisive Factor:** I now analyze the \"Statement of the Case\" as a strategic battleground. The competing narratives\u2014the City as a discriminatory actor versus a compassionate employer\u2014are a key variable in my predictive model. I must assess which narrative is more compelling and likely to be adopted by the Court.\n\n6.  **Refining Uncertainty-Driven Inquiry:** My core strategy is to identify my greatest point of uncertainty and target it with my next action. The previous observation shifted my uncertainty from \"What will the Respondent argue?\" to \"How will the Petitioner rebut?\". The `THINK` observation confirms that my next action\u2014seeking the Reply Brief\u2014is precisely calibrated to resolve this new, specific uncertainty. This validates the DBOED process itself, demonstrating how belief updates directly inform optimal experimental design (i.e., the next information-gathering step)."

          "task_beliefs": "My attempt to acquire the Petitioner's Reply Brief was unsuccessful; the search returned the Petitioner's initial merits brief, a document I have already analyzed. This observation, therefore, does not resolve my primary uncertainty but instead reinforces the current state of my beliefs and highlights the critical importance of the still-missing reply brief.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of the task is as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Foundational Case (Confirmed):** The observation, while not providing new information, re-confirms the arguments from the Petitioner's opening brief. My understanding of their case is solid and rests on three main pillars:\n    *   **Parallel Construction with Title VII:** The ADA was explicitly modeled on Title VII. Therefore, the unanimous Supreme Court precedent in *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.*, which protects former employees under Title VII, should be controlling. The brief's introduction powerfully frames this by asking the reader to imagine a company denying benefits to Black or Jewish retirees, arguing no court would permit this under Title VII and the ADA should be no different.\n    *   **The \"Who, What, When\" of Discrimination:** The Petitioner argues that the ADA's text, when read in conjunction with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, allows this suit.\n        *   **Who:** \"any person alleging discrimination\" can sue.\n        *   **What:** Discrimination regarding \"compensation\" and \"privileges of employment\" includes post-employment benefits.\n        *   **When:** The Lilly Ledbetter Act allows a claim when the policy is adopted, when the person becomes subject to it, or when they are \"affected by\" it. Stanley was employed when the policy was adopted (2003) and was \"affected by\" it upon retirement.\n    *   **\"Qualified Individual\" as a Conditional Test:** The brief argues that the definition of a \"qualified individual\" who \"holds or desires\" a position is not a gatekeeping requirement that one must currently have a job. Instead, it is a conditional test of ability: *if* you hold or desire a job, you must be able to perform its functions. The brief uses intuitive analogies (\"To live in this apartment building, you must be able to clean up after the pets that you own\") to argue it would be absurd to read this as a requirement to own a pet.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Unanswered Challenges:** My analysis of the Respondent's brief introduced two powerful counter-arguments that the Petitioner *must* address. Since I have not seen the reply, these arguments remain unanswered and weigh heavily in my prediction.\n    *   **Procedural Waiver:** The City's argument that Stanley waived her claim by not challenging the policy change in 2003 remains a potential \"off-ramp\" for the Court to decide the case on procedural grounds without reaching the core ADA question.\n    *   **Textual Rebuttal of *Robinson*:** The City's argument that the ADA's specific, present-tense definition of a \"qualified individual\" (\"holds or desires\") is a textual distinction that breaks the parallel with Title VII's more ambiguous term \"employees.\" This is a strong textualist argument that directly engages the Petitioner's primary precedent.\n\n3.  **Current Prediction & Heightened Uncertainty:** My prediction remains a near toss-up, leaning slightly toward the City of Sanford. The failure of this action to secure the reply brief means the Respondent's powerful waiver and textualist arguments hang in the air, unanswered. My uncertainty is no longer diffuse; it is laser-focused on a single, critical question: How does the Petitioner's counsel, Deepak Gupta, rebut the waiver argument and dismantle the textualist attack on the *Robinson* precedent? The Reply Brief is now, more than ever, the single most valuable piece of evidence for my prediction.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed information-gathering attempt, provides a crucial lesson in the practical application of experimental design. It shifts my focus from *what* information to seek to *how* to seek it reliably and how to react when an action fails.\n\nMy cumulative design principles have evolved significantly:\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Validated):** The core briefing sequence (Petition -> Merits Briefs -> Reply Brief) is the high-value path. This failed search makes the absence of the Reply Brief acutely felt, validating my decision to prioritize it as the next source. The DBOED principle of targeting the source of maximum uncertainty was correct.\n\n2.  **The Imperfection of Tools (New Principle):** I have learned that my information-gathering tools (`CLOSED_SEARCH`) are not infallible. A query for a \"reply brief\" returned an \"opening brief.\" This demonstrates that I cannot treat the agent's actions as black boxes that always return precisely what is requested. I must account for potential failure, ambiguity, and error in the environment itself.\n\n3.  **Refining Search Strategy (New Heuristics):** The failure of this action necessitates more robust search protocols. My methodology must now incorporate verification and iteration.\n    *   **Heuristic 1: Ask, then Verify.** Before analyzing the content of a returned document, I must first inspect its metadata (e.g., title, file name, date) to confirm it is the document I requested. In this case, the title \"BRIEF OF PETITIONER\" was a clear signal of error that I must learn to heed immediately.\n    *   **Heuristic 2: Docket Reconnaissance.** A more advanced strategy is to precede a content search with a metadata search. I should first query the docket to get a list of all filed documents. This would confirm if the \"Reply Brief of Petitioner\" has even been filed yet and provide its exact title and document number, allowing for a much more precise and reliable subsequent search for its content.\n    *   **Heuristic 3: Query Specificity.** I must be more precise in my queries. The ambiguity of \"Petitioner's brief\" likely contributed to the error. Using exact titles obtained from docket reconnaissance is the optimal path.\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses:** My prior belief is reinforced. The fact that my entire predictive model currently hinges on the Petitioner's yet-unseen response to a *waiver* argument underscores that procedural issues are often the pivot on which a case turns.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** My existing principles of deconstructing arguments based on canons of construction (e.g., \"specific trumps general\") and analyzing competing case narratives remain central to my analytical framework. The current impasse is a direct result of the Respondent's effective use of these techniques.\n\nIn essence, my DBOED process has matured. It now incorporates a crucial feedback loop about the reliability of its own actions, moving from a simple `identify uncertainty -> query` model to a more sophisticated `identify uncertainty -> plan query -> execute query -> verify result -> analyze` model."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal thought process of the agent, provides no new information about the legal substance of *Stanley v. Sanford*. Therefore, my task-level beliefs and the associated uncertainty remain unchanged, but the observation serves to strongly reaffirm their current state. My understanding of the case is stable and awaits the critical, missing piece of evidence.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Foundational Case (Stable):** My knowledge of the Petitioner's arguments is unchanged and rests on the analysis of their opening brief. The core pillars remain:\n    *   **The *Robinson* Precedent:** The argument that the ADA should be interpreted in parallel with Title VII, making the Supreme Court's unanimous decision in *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.* (which protected former employees) the controlling precedent.\n    *   **The \"Who, What, When\" Framework:** The interpretation of the ADA's text, combined with the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, to establish that Stanley has standing (\"who\"), the discrimination concerns post-employment benefits (\"what\"), and the timing of the claim is valid (\"when\").\n    *   **\"Qualified Individual\" as Conditional:** The argument that the \"holds or desires\" language in the ADA's definition of a \"qualified individual\" is a conditional test of ability, not a rigid requirement that one must be a current employee to sue for discrimination related to benefits earned while employed.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Unanswered Challenges (Stable and Critical):** The powerful counter-arguments from the City of Sanford's brief remain the central source of my uncertainty. The lack of a reply brief means these points are, from my perspective, unrebutted.\n    *   **Procedural Waiver:** The City's argument that Stanley waived her claim by not challenging the policy change when it was made in 2003. This remains a significant potential \"off-ramp\" for the Court to avoid the main question.\n    *   **Textual Distinction from *Robinson*:** The City's textualist argument that the ADA's specific, present-tense definition of a \"qualified individual\" (\"holds or desires\") deliberately breaks the parallel with Title VII's more general term \"employees,\" thereby distinguishing *Robinson*.\n\n3.  **Prediction and Uncertainty (Confirmed and Focused):** My prediction remains a near toss-up, leaning slightly toward the City due to the unanswered force of their waiver and textualist arguments. This observation confirms that my uncertainty is no longer general; it is precisely targeted. The entire predictive model now hinges on the contents of the Petitioner's Reply Brief, which must address these two specific points. The value of that single document has been maximized.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is highly valuable at the design level. It provides a direct view into the agent's meta-cognitive feedback loop, demonstrating how it learns from failed actions and refines its strategy. My design principles have evolved from identifying problems to actively testing solutions.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Validated):** The agent's internal monologue confirms that acquiring the Petitioner's Reply Brief is its highest priority. This validates the DBOED principle of targeting the source of maximum expected information gain to resolve the most critical uncertainty.\n\n2.  **The Imperfection of Tools (Confirmed in Practice):** My previous belief that information-gathering tools are fallible is now an active component of the agent's strategy. The agent's thought process begins with the premise \"My previous attempt... failed,\" showing it has internalized this principle.\n\n3.  **Refining Search Strategy (Evolved from Theory to Practice):** This is the area of greatest evolution. My previous heuristics were theoretical; this observation shows them being tested and refined.\n    *   **Heuristic 1: Ask, then Verify (Stable):** This principle remains crucial, as the agent's failure was a direct result of not verifying the returned document.\n    *   **Heuristic 2: Docket Reconnaissance (Stable):** This remains the \"gold standard\" approach that the agent has not yet attempted, but which my model holds as a high-value future action.\n    *   **Heuristic 3: Query Specificity (Refined):** This heuristic has become more nuanced. I previously believed that *more* specificity was always better. This observation teaches me that the goal is *appropriate* specificity. The agent is now testing a new hypothesis: **If a highly specific query fails, broaden the search terms.** The move from \"reply brief of petitioner\" to just \"reply\" is a direct test of this refined heuristic. This introduces an iterative, trial-and-error component to my search methodology.\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Reinforced):** The agent's explicit focus on the Petitioner's need to rebut the *waiver* argument reinforces my belief that procedural issues are not secondary concerns. They are often dispositive and must be a primary focus of analysis.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** My core analytical framework for deconstructing legal arguments remains unchanged and effective. The current impasse is a direct result of a well-executed textualist argument by the Respondent, highlighting the power of these methods.\n\nIn summary, this observation demonstrates a significant maturation in my DBOED model. The process is no longer a simple linear path but a robust, adaptive loop: `Identify Uncertainty -> Plan Query -> Execute -> Observe Outcome -> Diagnose Outcome (Success/Failure) -> Refine Strategy -> Re-Execute`. This explicit self-correction and hypothesis testing based on prior failures is the hallmark of an advanced learning system."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been significantly advanced by this observation, not by revealing the substance of an argument, but by confirming the existence of a critical piece of evidence. The uncertainty has been sharpened from \"if\" to \"what.\"\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Foundational Case (Stable):** My knowledge of the Petitioner's opening arguments remains unchanged. The case still hinges on the *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.* precedent for interpreting the ADA in line with Title VII, the \"who, what, when\" textual framework, and the interpretation of \"qualified individual\" as a conditional test of ability rather than a rigid temporal requirement.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Rebutted Challenges (Updated):** The previous state of my belief was that the Respondent's arguments were powerful and, from my perspective, unanswered. This has now changed.\n    *   **Reply Brief Confirmed:** The search results, specifically the Certificates of Service and Compliance, definitively prove that the Petitioner filed a \"Reply Brief in Support of Certiorari\" on or around May 28, 2024.\n    *   **Rebuttal Exists:** This confirmation means that the Respondent's key arguments\u2014the procedural waiver claim and the textualist distinction between the ADA and Title VII\u2014were not left on the table. The Petitioner has responded. The word count of 2,904 words, near the 3,000-word limit, suggests a substantive rebuttal was made.\n    *   **Content Unknown:** Crucially, the *content* of this rebuttal remains unknown. I do not know *how* Stanley's counsel addressed the waiver argument or countered the City's present-tense reading of \"holds or desires.\"\n\n3.  **Prediction and Uncertainty (Refined and Re-balanced):** My prediction has shifted due to this new information. Previously, I leaned slightly toward the City because their strong arguments appeared unrebutted. Knowing that a rebuttal exists neutralizes that advantage.\n    *   **Prediction:** My prediction moves from a slight lean for the Respondent back to a true toss-up. The case is balanced on a knife's edge.\n    *   **Uncertainty Focus:** My uncertainty is now maximally focused. It is no longer a general question of case strength but a specific, critical question: **What were the Petitioner's counter-arguments in the May 28th reply brief?** The entire predictive model now hinges on the contents of that single, confirmed-but-unseen document. The expected information gain from acquiring that brief is at its absolute peak.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a rich lesson in the realities of information retrieval and the evolution of search heuristics. It demonstrates a successful, albeit incomplete, execution of a refined strategy and provides clear direction for the next step.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Validated and Intensified):** The agent's focus on acquiring the Petitioner's Reply Brief is now more justified than ever. The observation confirmed the document's existence and its central importance, validating the DBOED principle of targeting the source of maximum uncertainty reduction.\n\n2.  **The Imperfection of Tools (Confirmed):** This observation reinforces that information-gathering tools are powerful but imperfect. The search returned documents *about* the target but not the target itself. This is a critical limitation to account for in planning future actions.\n\n3.  **Refining Search Strategy (Evolved and Tested):** My search heuristics have evolved from theory to a tested, iterative process.\n    *   **Heuristic 1: Ask, then Verify (Stable):** Remains a core principle.\n    *   **Heuristic 2: Docket Reconnaissance (Reinforced):** The failure to retrieve the primary document with a keyword search further elevates the value of a direct \"docket sheet\" review, which would likely provide a direct link.\n    *   **Heuristic 3: Query Specificity (Evolved into a Multi-Step Process):** The hypothesis of broadening a failed specific query has been tested and proven partially successful. It did not yield the document, but it yielded critical metadata (the exact title \"Reply Brief in Support of Certiorari\" and the filing date of May 28, 2024). This leads to a more sophisticated, multi-step heuristic:\n        1.  **Initial Probe:** Attempt a specific query for the target document.\n        2.  **Broaden on Failure:** If the initial probe fails, broaden the query using filters to find ancillary documents.\n        3.  **Metadata Extraction:** Extract key metadata (dates, exact titles, parties) from these ancillary documents.\n        4.  **Targeted Strike:** Use the extracted metadata to construct a new, highly precise query to retrieve the primary document.\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Reinforced):** The fact that my entire predictive model now hinges on understanding the Petitioner's response to the *waiver* argument reinforces my belief that procedural issues are often co-equal with substantive merits and must be a primary analytical focus.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** My core analytical framework remains effective. The current impasse is a direct result of a well-executed textualist argument by the Respondent, which has forced a direct and necessary rebuttal from the Petitioner, demonstrating the power of these interpretive methods to frame the entire dispute.\n\n6.  **New Principle: Value of Ancillary Documents (New):** This observation establishes a new design principle: **Procedural and administrative filings (e.g., Certificates of Service/Compliance) are not noise; they are valuable sources of metadata.** They can be used as proxies to confirm the existence, timing, and scale of substantive documents when those documents are not immediately retrievable. This turns a failed search into a successful intelligence-gathering step."

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTher\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

That issue is whether discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment against totally \ndisabled former employees, is actionable under Title I \nof the ADA. The Eleventh Circuit, joining the majority \nof courts, correctly held that Title I unambiguously \nprohibits discrimination solely against an individual \nwho \u201ccan perform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or \ndesires.\u201d Thus, it concluded that because Petitioner \ncould not establish that the City committed any \ndiscriminatory acts against her while she could \nperform the essential functions of a job that she held \nor desired to hold, her Title I claim failed. \nIn Part I of her brief, Petitioner raises an \nargument that she not only failed to press below, but \nthat she expressly disclaimed. She untimely argues \nshe \nwas \ndiscriminated \nagainst \nduring \nher \nemployment when she was a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nHowever, she conceded in her initial brief below that \nshe could not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed and able to do her job because she would \nhave lacked standing. The Eleventh Circuit properly \ndeclined to decide her opposite position untimely \nraised for the first time in her reply brief.  \nThis Court \u201cdoes not \u2018[o]rdinarily...decide in the \nfirst instance issues not decided below.\u2019\u201d City of \nAustin, Texas v. Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. 61, 76 (2022). Therefore, Petitioner\u2019s \ncontention that this Court \u201cneed not reach\u201d the circuit-\nsplit question and should reverse on the issue she \ndisclaimed, should be rejected. This Court should only \n\n2 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nconsider the circuit-split question. But to the extent \nthis Court reviews the question not pressed or passed \nupon, it should find that Petitioner\u2019s unpreserved \nclaims of discrimination during employment are \nunpled and time-barred. The Ledbetter Act has no \nplace here to save her waived claims allegedly \naccruing two decades ago.  \nPetitioner incorrectly claims that the Eleventh \nCircuit held that a disabled retired firefighter may be \nsubjected to discrimination with impunity. It said \nnothing of the sort. And \u201c[i]t seems more than \nuncharitable to say,\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2418 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting), that the court \nof appeal\u2019s finding of an unambiguous limitation on \nTitle I\u2019s prohibitions is the same as finding that a \nretiree \u201cmay be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit also did not hold that former \nemployees can never sue under Title I regarding post-\nemployment benefits. It held that discrimination \noccurring during employment against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d is actionable under the ADA. And for \nalleged discrimination post-employment, there are \nnumerous remedies under other federal and state \nlaws. Thus, Petitioner\u2019s claims failed, not for lack of \nremedy or an incorrect interpretation of the ADA, but \nbecause of her allegations and litigation strategy. This \nCourt should affirm.  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe appendix to this brief.  \n\n3 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. In enacting the Americans with Disabilities \nAct, Congress found, in part, that \u201csociety has tended \nto isolate and segregate individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). Congress enacted Title I of the \nADA to provide legal remedies for discrimination \nagainst disabled workers that did not previously exist. \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA and the Social \nSecurity Act. The Equal Protection Clause provided an \nadditional remedy for public employees. See Tennessee \nv. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that \nthe House and Senate Committee Reports on the ADA \nfocused on \u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the \nprivate sector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination \nin public employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the \nCourt). \nThis Court has also \u201cidentified Title I\u2019s purpose as \nenforcement of the Fourteenth Amendment's [equal \nprotection] command that \u2018all persons similarly \nsituated should be treated alike.\u2019\u201d Id. Thus, except as \nto the ADA\u2019s requirement that employers provide \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d for the disabled, 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), the essence of the ADA is \nequal\u2014not preferential\u2014treatment for the disabled. \nSee Williams v. United Ins. Co. of Am., 253 F.3d 280, \n282 (7th Cir. 2001) (an \u201cemployer is not required to \ngive the disabled employee preferential treatment.\u201d). \n\u201cThe ADA requires only that persons with disabilities \nhave the opportunity to receive the same benefits as \nnon-disabled officers who have given an equivalent \n\n4 \n\u0003\n\u0003\namount of service.\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, 142 \nF.3d 58, 70 (2d Cir. 1998). \n2. The ADA\u2019s prohibition against discrimination \nin employment is codified in Title I: \n(a) General rule. No covered entity shall \ndiscriminate \nagainst \na \nqualified \nindividual on the basis of disability in \nregard to job application procedures, \nthe hiring, advancement, or discharge \nof employees, employee compensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges \nof \nemployment. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a) (emphasis added). The term of art \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is incorporated into the general \nrule and defines the class of individuals protected by \nits prohibition against discrimination: \n \nThe term \u201cqualified individual\u201d means an \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable accommodation, can perform \nthe essential functions of the employment \nposition that such individual holds or \ndesires. \n \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \u201cThe determination of whether a \nperson is qualified should be made at the time of the \nemployment action, e.g. hiring or promotion...\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 34 (1990).  \n \n3. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its procedural \nframework from [T]itle VII,\u201d it \u201cborrows much of its \n\n5 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nsubstantive framework from Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d Id. at 31. The \u201cconcept\u201d of \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d comes from \u201cthe regulations \nimplementing...the Rehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not from \nTitle VII. Id. at 33; see also Alexander v. Choate, 469 \nU.S. 287, 309 (1985) (no unlawful discrimination \nfound under the Rehabilitation Act because the state's \npolicy was \u201cneutral on its face\u201d and it \u201cmade the same \nbenefit...equally accessible to both handicapped and \nnonhandicapped persons\u2026\u201d). \nB. Factual Background \n1. Because Petitioner argues that the Eleventh \nCircuit erred in affirming the dismissal of her ADA \nclaim at the pleading stage, the facts should be taken \nfrom her complaint only. Petitioner\u2019s statement of the \nfacts, however, largely draws from the evidence \ndeveloped at the summary judgment stage on her \nEqual Protection Clause claim. The pertinent factual \nallegations from her complaint are as follows.  \nPetitioner alleged that when she was hired in \n1999, the City \u201cpaid for health insurance for its \nemployees who retired after 25 years of service and its \nemployees who retired on account of disability\u201d until \n\u201cthe age of 65.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 13, 19. In 2018, she accepted \na disability retirement because she was completely \nunable to perform her duties as a firefighter due to an \nunidentified \u201cphysical disability.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. \nFifteen years before she retired, the City changed \nits policy in 2003 to require all retirees to complete 25 \nyears\u2019 service to earn the subsidy to age 65. See id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n19, 24. But the change still treated disability retirees \nbetter than similarly situated non-disabled retirees \n\n6 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith less than 25 years because while the latter \nreceived nothing, the former received the subsidy for \n24 months or until their receipt of Medicare benefits, \nwhichever came first. Id. \u00b6 24.  \nPetitioner, however, did not sue the City for \nbreach of an employment contract or bring an \nunconstitutional takings claim based on the change. \nThus, Petitioner\u2019s statement that the City \u201cpromised\u201d \nher the benefits under the defunct policy from 15 years \nbefore \nshe \nretired, \nis \nfactually \nand \nlegally \nunsupported. Pet. Br. 11. Petitioner only had a vested \nright to benefits under a policy \u201cin effect at the time\u201d \nof her retirement. City of Hollywood v. Bien, 209 So. \n3d 1, 3 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2016). \nWhile Petitioner claims the policy change was \nmade \u201cquietly,\u201d Pet. Br. 10, her complaint actually \nalleges a public announcement of the policy because it \nwas \u201ccodified in City Policy Section 2.45(c)\u201d of its \nordinances, and in its \u201cofficial personnel policies.\u201d Doc. \n1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at 2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Her \ncomplaint does not allege that she was unaware of the \npersonnel policy or the ordinance at the time of its \npassage or when she retired.  \nBecause she was totally disabled and unable to \nwork, Petitioner retired early with only 20 years\u2019 \nservice instead of the 25 required to earn the subsidy \nto age 65. Doc. 1, \u00b6 16. Her complaint did not allege \nwhen she became disabled or that she continued to \nwork thereafter as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with a \ndisability before she retired. Petitioner only alleged \nthat because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took a \ndisability retirement in November 2018 and as a \nresult, the City\u2019s subsidy policy would be applied to \n\n7 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nher, and she would lose the subsidy in November of \n2020\u201424 months after her retirement date. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 \n16, 26.  \n2. Petitioner erroneously claims that the City\u2019s \nsubsidy \npolicy \ndistinguished \nbetween \n\u201cnormal \nretirees\u201d and disabled retirees. Pet. Br. 11.1 However, \nthe phrase \u201cnormal retiree\u201d appears nowhere in the \nordinance. See Doc. 38-10 at 2-5. Rather, the ordinance \nshows that any retiree, disabled or non-disabled, with \n25 years of service is eligible for the subsidy to age 65. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (G). The ordinance did not \ncondition the subsidy to age 65 on a \u201cnormal \nretirement\u201d because under the City\u2019s pension plan, a \n\u201cnormal retirement\u201d could be taken after only ten (10) \nyears of service. Doc. 39-17 at 27; J.A. 35, n. 2.  \nPetitioner, like everyone else, was eligible to \nreceive the full subsidy so long as she served 25 years. \nHowever, in 2018, she requested and was awarded a \n\u201cdisability retirement\u201d with only 20 years of service. \nDoc. 38-5.2 But even though she failed to fulfill the \nservice-based criteria, the City, out of compassion, \nprovided 24 months of the subsidy to its totally \ndisabled retirees who retired early short of 25 years. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C), (F), (G); J.A. 34-35, 40; Doc. \n38 at 21-22. Uncoincidentally, 24 months is exactly \nhow long it takes before a totally disabled retiree like \nPetitioner is eligible to receive Medicare benefits. See \nMedicare Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 426(b)(2)(A), 1395o(a)(1). \n\u0003\n1 Petitioner cites to Doc. 39-16 for this proposition but omits key \nlanguage from that document which shows that the policy was \nbased solely on years of service and not a \u201cnormal\u201d retirement.  \n2 Petitioner insinuates that she was disabled \u201cin the line of duty.\u201d \nPet. Br. 1, 11. The record shows she was not. Doc. 38-5. \n\n8 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSimilarly situated, non-disabled retirees with only 20 \nyears\u2019 service received no subsidy at all and they are \nnot Medicare eligible because they are not disabled. \nDoc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C); J.A. 34-35, 44. Thus, far \nfrom treating Petitioner worse because of her \ndisability than her non-disabled co-workers with the \nsame amount of service, she was treated better than \nthem because of her total disability.  \nAlthough the City would have liked to continue \npaying disability retirees with less than 25 years the \nsame subsidy as 25-year retirees, it was forced to cut \ncosts and start treating disability retirees the same as, \nrather than better than, everyone else with less than \n25 years of service. Doc. 38-10 at 2; J.A. 34 n. 1, 40. \nPrior to the 2003 ordinance, the City had the resources \nto pay the subsidy to age 65 for both 25-year retirees \nand \u201cdisability retirees\u201d with less than 25 years. \nHowever, the City was permitted to change that policy \nbefore Petitioner\u2019s rights vested at retirement. Florida \nSheriffs Ass'n v. Dep't of Admin., Div. of Ret., 408 So. \n2d 1033, 1036-37 (Fla. 1981). \nPetitioner claims (at 11) that the City\u2019s HR \nDirector could not explain why the City changed the \nsubsidy policy. He was deposed nearly twenty years \nafter the ordinance was passed and thus his \nknowledge of it was limited to what could be discerned \nfrom the public records. Doc. 39-4 at 1, 10, 80. The \ndistrict court found that the purpose was clearly set \nforth in the ordinance itself and the City articulated \nits legitimate reasons for its service-based policy to \nreward long-term employment, contain costs, and \nprovide compassion for employees who retire early due \nto disability. J.A. 34 n. 1, 40, 45. The City\u2019s policy \n\n9 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nprovided disabled employees access to the same \nbenefits available to all. Doc. 38-10 at 4, \u00b6 2.45(C).  \nC. Procedural Background \n1. The City moved to dismiss Petitioner\u2019s ADA \nclaim because she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5. Petitioner did not dispute \nthe City\u2019s characterization of her allegations or argue \nthat her complaint actually alleged discrimination \nduring her employment. See Doc. 17. Petitioner also \ndid not move for leave to amend to add allegations of \ndiscrimination during employment. \nTherefore, \nthe \ndistrict \ncourt \ndismissed \nPetitioner\u2019s ADA claim because she alleged the \n\u201cdiscrimination did not occur until Plaintiff was no \nlonger able to perform the essential functions of her \njob\u201d when she was no longer a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nPet. App. 26a. After dismissal, Petitioner did not move \nfor reconsideration arguing the court misapprehended \nany allegations of discrimination during employment.  \nOn her Equal Protection Clause Claim, the \ndistrict court found the policy drew \u201cneutral\u201d lines \nbased on service requiring all retirees to serve 25 \nyears to earn the subsidy to age 65. J.A. 44-45. \n2. Petitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \ntherefore refused to pass upon this issue expressly \n\n10 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndisclaimed \nin \nher \ninitial \nbrief \nand \nuntimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a.  \nNext, the Eleventh Circuit analyzed whether the \nCity\u2019s post-employment application of the subsidy \npolicy was, in its own right, a fresh violation of Title I, \nrather \nthan \nan \nalleged \nextension \nof \npast \ndiscrimination. Pet. App. 16a. In doing so, it found \nthat nothing in the Ledbetter Act \u201cchanges Title I\u2019s \nsubstantive requirements,\u201d including the requirement \nthat one be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the \ndiscriminatory act. Pet. App. 15a. It held the \nLedbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of limitations helps a \nplaintiff only if that plaintiff otherwise has a claim for \ndiscrimination.\u201d Id.  \nTherefore, it adhered to its precedent holding that \nTitle I is unambiguous and contains a \u201cclear temporal \nqualifier\u201d stating \u201c[o]nly someone \u2018who, with or \nwithout reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that \nsuch individual holds or desires\u201d is protected from \ndisability discrimination. Pet. App. 11a (emphasis in \noriginal). It concluded that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a. \n\u0003\n \n\n11 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief is unrelated to the \ncircuit-split question upon which this Court granted \ncertiorari regarding whether discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment is actionable under the \nADA. Instead, Part I seeks review of a different \nquestion regarding whether Petitioner sufficiently \nalleged discrimination during her employment as a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Petitioner argues her ADA \nclaim allegedly accrued in 2003 when the City passed \nits subsidy policy. She admits she was not disabled at \nthat time but argues Title I did not require her to have \na disability to sue for disability discrimination. She \nheavily relies on the minimal standing requirements \nin the enforcement provisions of Title I and Title VII. \nBut Title I\u2019s enforcement provision only applies to \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of any provision of this chapter.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a) (emphasis added). This is a \n\u201ccross-reference\u2026directing us to a class of claims with \na settled and statutorily precise meaning.\u201d Almond v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 501, 665 F.3d 1174, 1181 (10th \nCir. 2011).  \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cclass of claims\u201d are found in its \nsubstantive anti-discrimination provision, \u00a7 12112(a), \nwhich has a settled meaning requiring Petitioner to \nshow: \u201c(1) that she was disabled under the ADA; (2) \nthat she was a qualified individual with a disability; \nand (3) that she was discriminated against by her \nemployer because of that disability.\u201d Dunlap v. Liberty \nNat. Prod., Inc., 878 F.3d 794, 798\u201399 (9th Cir. 2017). \nBecause Petitioner conceded that she did not have a \ndisability in 2003 and further conceded that she \n\n12 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201clacked standing\u201d to sue for anything occurring \u201cwhile \nshe was still employed,\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22, the Eleventh \nCircuit correctly declined to pass upon whether her \nallegations sufficiently alleged she was discriminated \nagainst as a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any time before \nshe retired.  Pet. App. 17a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit also correctly held that the \nLedbetter Act did not change Title I\u2019s substantive \nrequirement that she be a \u201cqualified individual\u201d with \na disability at the time of the alleged discrimination. \nId. 15a. Because she only alleged discrimination \noccurring entirely post-employment when she could no \nlonger perform the essential functions of her job, she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d entitled to sue.  \nII. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that Title \nI\u2019s use of the present tense unambiguously prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who \u201ccan \nperform\u201d the job she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d Id. \n11a-12a. This reading is consistent with the ADA\u2019s \nstatutory scheme which uses the term \u201cindividuals\u201d to \nbroadly include former employees, but \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d to refer only to current employees. And it \ngives effect to every word in the definition and the \ngeneral rule where it appears.  \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation requires this Court to \nrewrite Title I to include an exception to the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause for retirees. It is based on a policy \npreference to avoid what she perceives as an \u201cabsurd\u201d \nconsequence of the express line drawn by Congress. \nHowever, \u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable \ndisabled people who can work with reasonable \naccommodation to get and keep jobs, without also \ndeciding to equalize post-employment fringe benefits \n\n13 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nfor people who cannot work.\u201d Weyer v. Twentieth \nCentury Fox Film Corp., 198 F.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. \n2000). The Eleventh Circuit correctly refused to allow \npolicy preference or purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014to negate the plain language of the \nstatute.  \nARGUMENT \nThe question presented, as inaccurately framed \nby Petitioner, asks under the ADA, \u201cdoes a former \nemployee\u2014who was qualified to perform her job and \nwho \nearned \npost-employment \nbenefits \nwhile \nemployed\u2014lose her right to sue over discrimination \nwith respect to those benefits solely because she no \nlonger holds her job?\u201d Pet. Br. i. A former employee \nwho has a \u201cright to sue\u201d cannot \u201close\u201d that right \n\u201csolely\u201d because she no longer holds her job. If so, there \ncould be no ADA claim for a discriminatory \ntermination\u2014a claim the Eleventh Circuit has \npermitted former employees to bring. See Taylor v. \nFood World, Inc., 133 F.3d 1419 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nThe Eleventh Circuit held that to \u201cfall within Title \nI\u2019s anti-discrimination provision, a plaintiff\u2019s claim \nmust depend on an act committed by the defendant \nwhile the plaintiff was either working for the \ndefendant or seeking to work for the defendant.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 8a-9a. This holding clearly makes room for \nformer employees to sue if they were discriminated \nagainst during their employment. Because the \nEleventh Circuit did not hold that former employees \nare categorically barred from suing under the ADA, \nPetitioner is not entitled to a reversal based on a \nruling that was never made.  \n\n14 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nThe \ncircuit-split \nquestion \nis \nwhether \ndiscrimination occurring entirely post-employment \nagainst \ntotally \ndisabled \nformer \nemployees, \nis \nactionable under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit, siding \nwith the majority, held that \u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot \nestablish that the City committed any discriminatory \nacts against her while she could perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that she held or desired to hold, her \nTitle I claim fails.\u201d Pet. App. 18a.  \nTherefore, Part I of Petitioner\u2019s brief framing the \nissue as whether \u201c[t]he ADA permits former \nemployees to bring suit with respect to post-\nemployment benefits,\u201d attacks a strawman. Pet. Br. \n17. As the Eleventh Circuit never categorically barred \nsuch suits, Petitioner reveals the real alleged errors \nfor this Court\u2019s review deep into Part I(C)(2). Id. 24-\n27. In doing so, she has \u201csmuggl[ed] additional \nquestions into\u201d the case \u201cafter [this Court] grant[ed] \ncertiorari.\u201d Irvine v. People of California, 347 U.S. 128, \n129 (1954).  \nCompletely unrelated to the circuit-split question \nregarding whether post-employment discrimination \nagainst former employees is actionable under Title I, \nPetitioner argues the Eleventh Circuit erred by: (1) \nfinding that she disclaimed standing to sue for \ndiscrimination occurring during her employment, Pet. \nBr. 24, 27; (2) misapplying Title I\u2019s \u201cdisability\u201d \nelement to the facts of this case, Id. 25; and (3) not \napplying the Ledbetter Act to find her time-barred \nclaims allegedly accruing during employment \u201cre-\naccrued in 2020,\u201d Id. 24.  \nNone \nof \nthese \nquestions \nare \n\u201csubsidiary \nquestion[s] fairly included\u201d in the circuit-split \n\n15 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nquestion. Yee v. City of Escondido, Cal., 503 U.S. 519, \n535 (1992). Instead, Petitioner has relegated the \ncircuit-split question to her secondary argument for \nreversal. Pet. Br., Part II, 27. Remarkably, she argues \nthat this Court \u201cneed not even reach\u201d the circuit-split \nquestion and should reverse based solely on the above \nthree alleged misapplications of law to fact. Pet. Br. \n17. This is backwards. This Court should ignore Part \nI and proceed solely to resolving the circuit-split \nquestion in Part II. But to the extent this Court \nreviews Part I, it should find that she waived these \narguments, and any claim of discrimination during \nemployment is unpled and time-barred. \nI. \nThe Non-Circuit-Split Questions Regarding \nDiscrimination During Employment \nIn support of her argument of discrimination \nduring employment when she was a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d Petitioner provides a truncated version of \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement and substantive provisions \nomitting crucial elements under \u00a7 12112(a). Pet. Br. \n17-23. She argues merely pleading that she was \n\u201caggrieved\u201d regarding her post-employment benefits, \nwith the aid of the Ledbetter Act, brings her \u201cclaim \nacross the finish line.\u201d Pet. Br. 21.  \nHer claim, however, never got off the starting \nblocks because she expressly disclaimed standing to \nsue for anything occurring during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22. To be sure, her initial brief in the \nEleventh Circuit argued: \nMs. Stanley could not have brought these \nclaims while she was still employed and able \nto do her job because she had not yet learned \n\n16 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nof the discrimination and become a disability \nretiree impacted by the discrimination so she \nwould have lacked standing. \nId. (emphasis added). Even in the absence of this \ndisclaimer, her complaint failed to demonstrate that a \nTitle I claim accrued during her employment or that \nany such claim was timely. Determining the \ntimeliness of Petitioner\u2019s 2019 EEOC charge required \nher \u201cto identify precisely the \u2018unlawful employment \npractice\u2019 of which\u201d she complains. Delaware State Coll. \nv. Ricks, 449 U.S. 250, 257 (1980).  \nPetitioner argues her claims accrued during her \nemployment: (1) in 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy; (2) when she became disabled during \nemployment; and (3) at some unspecified time when it \nbecame \u201cinevitable\u201d that she would need to take a \ndisability retirement prior to her retirement on \nNovember 1, 2018. Pet. Br. 24-26. These arguments \ncannot be squared with the allegations of the \ncomplaint. And Petitioner has waived them.  \nA. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate any claim accrued \nin 2003 when the City adopted its \nsubsidy policy.  \n1. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nfound \nPetitioner \n\u201cconcedes, and we agree, that her claim cannot turn on \nthe 2003 amendment to the benefits plan because she \nwas not yet disabled at that time.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nPetitioner admitted in her initial brief that the City \nadopted its subsidy policy \u201cin 2003, when Ms. Stanley \nwas a non-disabled employee.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 n. 5. \nShe then conceded she \u201clacked standing\u201d to bring \n\n17 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201cthese claims while she was still employed and able to \ndo her job\u201d because she was not yet a \u201cdisability retiree \nimpacted by the discrimination.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22 \n(emphasis added). Although Petitioner purported to \nincorporate the United States\u2019 contrary arguments \ninto her initial brief, Pet. C.A. Br. 20, the Eleventh \nCircuit was not required to scour the amicus brief for \nbetter arguments to save Petitioner\u2019s case. The \nEleventh Circuit properly relied on her arguments in \nher brief expressly disclaiming standing to sue for \nanything during her employment.  \nPetitioner and the United States attempt to \nexplain away her concessions by arguing she only \nmeant to disclaim any financial impact during her \nemployment. Pet. Br. 27; U.S. Am. Br. 27-28. This \nargument cannot be squared with her clear concession \nthat she \u201clacked standing\u201d to sue \u201cwhile she was still \nemployed.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. Indeed, financial impact \nis not necessary for standing, but an injury is. Her way \nof describing \u201cinjury\u201d was by using the word \u201cimpact\u201d \nbecause otherwise she would not have disclaimed \nstanding simply because she suffered no financial \nimpact during employment.  \nIt is true that this Court\u2019s \u201cpractice \u2018permit[s] \nreview of an issue not pressed [below] so long as it has \nbeen passed upon.\u2019\u201d Citizens United v. Fed. Election \nComm'n, 558 U.S. 310, 330 (2010). To the extent that \nthe Eleventh Circuit passed upon this issue by \n\u201cagree[ing]\u201d with Petitioner's concession that \u201cher \nclaim cannot turn on the 2003\u201d adoption of the policy, \nPet. App. 16a, prudential concerns weigh in favor of \nthis Court declining to review this matter. A mere \nfailure to \u201cpress\u201d an argument is markedly different \n\n18 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthan an express disclaimer of an argument because \nthe latter invites the complained-of error. See City of \nSpringfield, Mass. v. Kibbe, 480 U.S. 257, 259 \n(1987) (rejecting argument \u201cthat we need not concern \nourselves about Springfield's failure to preserve this \nissue, because it was passed on by the Court of \nAppeals\u201d because \u201cthere would be considerable \nprudential objection to reversing a judgment because \nof instructions that petitioner accepted, and indeed \nitself requested.\u201d).  \nFurther, while an appellant can raise on appeal \nany new \u201cargument\u201d in support of a \u201cclaim,\u201d U.S. \nAmicus Br. 28 n. 6, it cannot wait until its reply brief \nto flip-flop on a position in true ambush fashion as \nPetitioner did here. Compare Pet. C.A. Br. 22 with Pet. \nC.A. Reply Br. 5. This Court should hold that because \nPetitioner \u201craised this issue for the first time in [her] \nreply \nbrief,\u201d \nshe \n\u201chas \nwaived \nthis \nclaim.\u201d \nUnited States v. Dicter, 198 F.3d 1284, 1289 (11th Cir. \n1999). \n2. Even if Petitioner hadn\u2019t expressly disclaimed \nthe argument below, her allegations were still \ninsufficient to demonstrate that a claim accrued in \n2003. Although she concedes she was not disabled \nthen, she incorrectly argues she was not required to \nhave a disability at that time to bring suit. Pet. Br. 25.  \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement provision, \u00a7 12117(a), \nincorporates Title VII\u2019s remedial framework which \nstates any \u201cperson claiming to be aggrieved\u201d can bring \n\u201ca civil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(f)(1). This Court \nhas held that \u201caggrieved\u201d in Title VII \u201cenabl[es] suit \nby any plaintiff with an interest arguably [sought] to \nbe protected by the statute...while excluding plaintiffs \n\n19 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwho might technically be injured in an Article III \nsense but whose interests are unrelated to the \nstatutory prohibitions in Title VII.\u201d Thompson v. N. \nAm. Stainless, LP, 562 U.S. 170, 178 (2011) (internal \nquotation \nmarks \nand \ncitation \nomitted). \nPut \ndifferently, the requirement that the plaintiff be \n\u201caggrieved\u201d is a requirement that the plaintiff have \n\u201cstatutory\u201d standing to sue. Id. at 177-78. \nBut, here, Petitioner failed to allege Article III or \nstatutory standing to sue in 2003. Her claim is based \non \u201cher disability.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 26. And yet, she was not \ndisabled in 2003 and therefore not injured by a policy \nthat allegedly discriminated only against the disabled. \nSee Bostock v. Clayton Cnty., Georgia, 590 U.S. 644, \n681 \n(2020) \n(\u201cDiscriminate \nagainst\u201d \nmeans \n\u201cdistinctions or differences in treatment that injure \nprotected individuals.\u201d).  \nHer claim was not based on the disability of \nsomeone else with whom she associated under \u00a7 \n12112(b)(4), nor was it based on a claim that she was \nmerely \u201cregarded as\u201d disabled under \u00a7 12102(1)(C). \nSee Murray v. Warren Pumps, LLC, 821 F.3d 77, 83 \n(1st Cir. 2016) (a plaintiff must prove her \u201cparticular \ntheory of disability discrimination alleged.\u201d). Based on \nPetitioner\u2019s particular theory in her complaint, she \nwas required to show that she was discriminated \nagainst because of her disability \u201cwhich requires that \nthe disability exist at the time of the discrimination.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112.  \nPetitioner argues that the ADAAA of 2008 \nrepealed any requirement that she have a disability to \nsue for a claim allegedly accruing in 2003. Pet. Br. 25. \nThe ADAAA amended \u00a7 12112(a) to prohibit \n\n20 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ndiscrimination \u201cagainst a qualified individual on the \nbasis of disability\u201d rather than \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual with a disability because of the disability.\u201d \nPub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 5(a)(1), 122 Stat. 3557 (2008) \n(emphasis added). However, the Eleventh Circuit and \nits \u201csister circuits...hold that the switch from \u2018because \nof\u2019 to \u2018on the basis of\u2019 in the 2008 amendment to the \nADA did not change or affect its but-for causation \nstandard.\u201d Akridge v. Alfa Ins. Companies, 93 F.4th \n1181, 1192 (11th Cir. 2024). \nThis \namendment \nremoved \nthe \nredundant \nlanguage, \u201cwith a disability because of the disability\u201d \nfrom \u00a7 12112(a) because those words were already \nrepeated several times in the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision, \n\u00a7 12112(b). Section 12112(b)(1), for example, still \nprohibits \n\u201cclassifying \na \njob \napplicant \nor \nemployee...because of the disability of such applicant \nor employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded). \nThe express purpose of the ADAAA was to \u201creject\u201d \ndecisions of this Court, which Congress found \ninterpreted the definition of a \u201cdisability\u201d too \nnarrowly. Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 2(b). Congress stated \nthe amendment\u2019s purpose was to clarify \u201cthat the \nquestion of whether an individual's impairment is a \ndisability under the ADA should not demand \nextensive analysis.\u201d Id. at \u00a7 2(b)(5). Therefore, the \nchanges removed the prior emphasis on whether an \nindividual\u2019s impairment met the definition of a \n\u201cdisability.\u201d Congress did not remove the requirement \nthat an individual have a disability all together. \n3. Even if the ADAAA did dispense with the \n\u201cdisability\u201d element, the United States acknowledges \n\n21 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthat the \u201cADAAA\u2019s amendments...apply to claims that \narose after\u201d January 1, 2009. U.S. Amicus Br. 24 n. 4. \nTherefore, any claim allegedly accruing in 2003 would \nbe governed by the ADA, before the ADAAA allegedly \ndisposed of the disability element.  \n4. Petitioner makes a last-ditch effort to root her \nclaim in 2003 when she was a \u201cqualified individual\u201d by \narguing this Court may \u201cconceive of this claim as \nencompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became \ndisabled.\u201d Pet. Br. 26. However, this Court has \nrecognized that Title VII claims can encompass \ndifferent events at different points in time only in two \nnarrow circumstances: hostile work environment \nclaims and constructive discharge claims. Green v. \nBrennan, 578 U.S. 547, 556-57 (2016). Moreover, \nPetitioner has expressly waived any argument of \ndiscrimination at any time during her employment. \nPet. C.A. Br. 22.  \nB. Petitioner disclaimed and her complaint \nfailed to demonstrate a claim accrued at \nany time between her diagnosis and \nretirement.  \n1. The Eleventh Circuit expressly declined to pass \nupon Petitioner\u2019s untimely argument raised in her \nreply brief that a claim accrued \u201cat some unknown \npoint before she retired but after she was diagnosed \nwith Parkinson\u2019s.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. This Court should \ndecline to \u201cdecide in the first instance issues not \ndecided below.\u201d Reagan Nat'l Advert. of Austin, LLC, \n596 U.S. at 76.  \n\n22 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. But if this Court proceeds, it must determine \nwhether the complaint alleged that Petitioner was a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d with a disability during her \nemployment. She must allege that she became \ndisabled \u201cduring the course of [her] employment but \nnevertheless continued to perform the essential \nrequirements of [her] job with or without a reasonable \naccommodation, until [she] became completely and \ntotally disabled.\u201d Bass v. City of Orlando, 57 F. Supp. \n2d 1318, 1323 (M.D. Fla. 1999), aff'd, 203 F.3d 841 \n(11th Cir. 1999). Contrary to the United States\u2019 \nclaims, Petitioner\u2019s complaint does not allege when or \nhow she became disabled, let alone that she continued \nto work thereafter. U.S. Amicus Br. 26. Petitioner only \nalleged that because of a \u201cphysical disability\u201d she took \na disability retirement in 2018 and as a result would \nlose the subsidy in 2020. Doc. 1, \u00b6\u00b6 16, 26.  \nAlthough we now have the benefit of the summary \njudgment record on her Equal Protection claim, in \ntesting the sufficiency of a complaint, a district court \ndoes not \u201cassume that the [plaintiff] can prove facts \nthat it has not alleged or that the defendants have \nviolated...laws in ways that have not been alleged.\u201d \nAssociated Gen. Contractors of California, Inc. v. \nCalifornia State Council of Carpenters, 459 U.S. 519, \n526 (1983); see also Aldana v. Del Monte Fresh \nProduce, N.A., Inc., 416 F.3d 1242, 1248 (11th Cir. \n2005) (a plaintiff must \u201callege sufficient facts to \nwarrant [a particular] inference\u201d). \nPetitioner led the district court to its conclusion \nwhen she failed to dispute the City\u2019s argument for \ndismissal that she only alleged post-employment \ndiscrimination when she was no longer a \u201cqualified \n\n23 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual.\u201d Doc. 14 at 4-5; Doc. 17. Instead, she \nmerely argued that the district court should refuse to \nfollow Eleventh Circuit precedent in Gonzales (a case \ninvolving only post-employment discrimination). Doc. \n17 at 5-6. As the Eleventh Circuit noted, she did not \nattempt to distinguish the facts of Gonzales from her \ncase by arguing that she alleged discrimination during \nemployment. Pet. App. 18a. The district court, thus, \nproperly dismissed her ADA claim because her \ncomplaint \u201calleged [the] discrimination did not occur \nuntil Plaintiff was no longer able to perform the \nessential functions of her job.\u201d Doc. 27 at 7. \nFurther, the district court was \u201cnot required to \ngrant\u2026plaintiff leave to amend [her] complaint sua \nsponte when the plaintiff, who is represented by \ncounsel, never filed a motion to amend nor requested \nleave to amend before the district court.\u201d Wagner v. \nDaewoo Heavy Indus. Am. Corp., 314 F.3d 541, 542 \n(11th Cir. 2002). After dismissal, Petitioner did not \nmove \nfor \nreconsideration \narguing \nthe \ncourt \nmisapprehended her complaint allegedly pleading \ndiscrimination during employment. Perhaps fearing \nher claims would be time-barred, she never argued \nthey arose during her employment, years before she \nfiled her 2019 EEOC charge. Indeed, she never \nmentioned the generous accrual provisions of the \nLedbetter Act in the district court. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6.  \nPetitioner\u2019s initial brief in the Eleventh Circuit \nconfirmed that her complaint only alleged post-\nemployment discrimination because she argued she \n\u201ccould not have brought these claims while she was \nstill employed\u201d because \u201cshe would have lacked \nstanding.\u201d Pet. C.A. Br. 22. The Eleventh Circuit \n\n24 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ntherefore properly refused to pass upon this issue \nexpressly disclaimed in her initial brief and untimely \ncontradicted in her reply brief. Pet. App. 17a. This \nCourt should decline to decide this unpreserved issue \nin the first instance, and as demonstrated above, it is \nunsupported by her allegations.  \nC. The Ledbetter Act\u2019s generous accrual \nprovisions do not create a claim where \nnone exists. \nIt is clear that if a claim accrued in 2003, it \nexpired long before Petitioner filed her EEOC charge \nin 2019. Doc. 1, \u00b6 6. Petitioner argues that under the \nLedbetter Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e5(e)(3)(A), her 2003 \nclaim \u201cre-accrued in 2020\u201d when she \u201cwas \u2018affected\u2019 \nwhen her subsidy ended.\u201d Pet. Br. 24, 26 n. 1. The \nLedbetter Act has no place here.  \n\u201cOrdinarily, a limitations period commences \nwhen the plaintiff has a complete and present cause of \naction.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 554 (2016) \n(cleaned up). \u201c[A] cause of action does not become \n\u2018complete and present\u2019 for limitations purposes until \nthe plaintiff can file suit and obtain relief.\u201d Id. (cleaned \nup). Petitioner failed to demonstrate she had a \n\u201ccomplete and present\u201d claim during her employment.  \nIndeed, \nany \nclaim \nof \ndisability-based \ndiscrimination in 2003 when she was not disabled \nwould have been dismissed for lack of standing, as she \nconceded below but refuses to admit now. Pet. Br. C.A. \n22. If no claim accrued in 2003, it could not \u201cre-accrue\u201d \npost-employment. \u201cA plaintiff must plead and prove \nthe elements of a pay-discrimination claim to benefit \nfrom the Ledbetter Act's accrual provisions.\u201d Davis v. \n\n25 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nBombardier Transp. Holdings (USA) Inc., 794 F.3d \n266, 269 (2d Cir. 2015); see also AT & T Corp. v. \nHulteen, 556 U.S. 701, 716 (2009) (Ledbetter Act did \nnot save the plaintiff\u2019s untimely claim because the \noriginal \nemployment \npractice \n\u201cwas \nnot \ndiscriminatory\u201d). The Ledbetter Act \u201cis an accrual \nrule; it does not affect the substance of the claim.\u201d \nMcReynolds v. Merrill Lynch & Co., Inc., 694 F.3d 873, \n888 (7th Cir. 2012). Therefore, the Eleventh Circuit \ncorrectly held the Ledbetter Act\u2019s \u201crelaxed statute of \nlimitations helps a plaintiff only if that plaintiff \notherwise has a claim for discrimination.\u201d Pet. App. \n15a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit did not pass upon whether \nthe Ledbetter Act should apply to allow a Title I claim \nto \u201cre-accrue\u201d when an individual is \u201caffected\u201d post-\nemployment when she is no longer qualified. This \nCourt should decline to decide this issue in the first \ninstance. This is especially so where Petitioner has not \nshown that the facts of Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618 (2007), which prompted the \nLedbetter Act, are sufficiently similar to the subject \nfacts to warrant extension of the Act here. Unlike the \nsecret decisions creating an unknown pay disparity for \nMs. Ledbetter, the City\u2019s subsidy policy was a publicly \nannounced act codified in its ordinances and \u201cofficial \npersonnel policies.\u201d Doc. 1, \u00b6 24; see also Doc. 38-10 at \n2-5; Doc. 38-11 at 4. Such fully communicated acts can \nbe vindicated \u201cwithout the need for the Ledbetter Act's \ngenerous accrual provisions because the employee had \nnotice of the pay reduction.\u201d Davis, 794 F.3d at 271.  \nPetitioner\u2019s later testimony claiming ignorance of \nthe ordinance is irrelevant. See Taylor v. Michael, 724 \n\n26 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nF.3d 806, 811 (7th Cir.2013) (\u201cLack of familiarity with \nthe law...is not a circumstance that justifies equitable \ntolling.\u201d). Therefore, the City\u2019s policy is akin to the \nemployment practice at issue in Ricks, not Ledbetter. \nIn Ricks, \u201cthe only alleged discrimination occurred\u2013\nand \nthe \nfiling \nlimitations \nperiods \ntherefore \ncommenced\u2013at the time the tenure decision was made \nand communicated to Ricks.\u201d 449 U.S. at 258. \u201cThat is \nso even though one of the effects of the denial of \ntenure\u2013the eventual loss of a teaching position\u2013did \nnot occur until later.\u201d Id. For such acts, \u201cthe clock \nstarts running when the plaintiff first knew or should \nhave known of his injury, whether or not he realized \nthe cause of his injury was unlawful.\u201d Almond, 665 \nF.3d at 1176.  \nTo extend the Ledbetter Act under the facts of this \ncase would open the floodgates to stale claims over \nknown, written personnel policies and publicly \nannounced ordinances. And it would allow plaintiffs to \ndelay suit indefinitely, despite knowing exactly when \na benefit will end, by arguing that the claim \u201cre-\naccrues\u201d every month that the plaintiff does not \nreceive the benefit. See, e.g., Lohrasbi v. Bd. of \nTrustees of the Univ. of Illinois, 147 F. Supp. 3d 746, \n755 (C.D. Ill. 2015) (\u201c[T]he 300-day time-limit does not \nrestart each day that Plaintiff is deprived of Professor \nEmiritus status.\u201d). The Ledbetter Act has no place \nhere and any claims that allegedly accrued during \nPetitioner\u2019s employment have long-since expired and \nbeen waived.    \n\n27 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nII. The \nCircuit \nSplit \nQuestion \nRegarding \nDiscrimination Post-Employment \nThis Court should only resolve the question \nsplitting the circuit courts: whether totally disabled \nretirees are \u201cqualified individuals\u201d entitled to seek \nrelief under Title I for discrimination occurring \nentirely post-employment. The Eleventh Circuit below \n(at Pet. App. 11a-12a) and \u201cthe majority of courts have \nheld, Title I is unambiguous; by its plain language, it \ndoes not\u201d prohibit discrimination against \u201cformer \nemployees who are unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of their jobs.\u201d McKnight v. Gen. Motors \nCorp., 550 F.3d 519, 528 (6th Cir. 2008); Morgan v. \nJoint Admin. Bd., 268 F.3d 456, 458\u201359 (7th Cir. \n2001); Weyer v. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corp., 198 \nF.3d 1104, 1112 (9th Cir. 2000).   \nOnly two circuits have disagreed and held that \nTitle I is ambiguous because it allegedly fails to \n\u201cspecify when a potential plaintiff must have been a \n\u2018qualified individual\u2019...\u201d Castellano v. City of New York, \n142 F.3d 58, 67 (2d Cir. 1998) (emphasis in original); \nFord v. Schering-Plough Corp., 145 F.3d 601, 606 (3d \nCir. 1998). The Third Circuit also found an ambiguity, \nnot in the text, but in the \u201cdisjunction between the \nADA\u2019s definition of \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019 and the rights that the ADA confers.\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 605. \nAs \nthe \nEleventh \nCircuit \nexplained \nbelow \n\u201c[n]either court established that the text of Title I\u2019s \nanti-discrimination provision is ambiguous.\u201d Pet. App. \n12a. \u201cInstead, the Second and the Third Circuit \nexpressed \nsomething \nbetween \ndiscomfort \nand \ndisagreement with the policy choice underlying the \n\n28 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nline, drawn by the text of the ADA, between disabled \nindividuals who hold or desire to hold a job and those \nwho do not.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \u201cBut not \u2018even the most \nformidable policy arguments\u2019 empower a court to \nignore unambiguous text.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). And \nthat text plainly prohibits discrimination solely \nagainst individuals who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions\u201d of the job \u201cthat such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(8), 12112(a). \nA. Title I requires an individual to hold or \ndesire \na \njob \nat \nthe \ntime \nof \nthe \ndiscriminatory act to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d \nThe first step \u201cin interpreting a statute is to \ndetermine whether the language at issue has a plain \nand unambiguous meaning with regard to the \nparticular dispute in the case.\u201d Robinson v. Shell Oil \nCo., 519 U.S. 337, 340 (1997). \u201cThe plainness or \nambiguity of statutory language is determined by \nreference to the language itself, the specific context in \nwhich that language is used, and the broader context \nof the statute as a whole.\u201d Id. at 341. \n1. \nThe text uses the present tense as a \ntemporal \nqualifier \nto \nprohibit \ndiscrimination solely against an \nindividual who \u201ccan perform\u201d the \njob she presently \u201cholds or desires.\u201d      \na. Title I\u2019s anti-discrimination provision (the \n\u201cgeneral rule\u201d) and its incorporated definition of a \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d are unambiguous. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(a), 12111(8). The \u201cgeneral rule\u201d makes it \nunlawful for an employer to \u201cdiscriminate against a \n\n29 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualified individual on the basis of disability in regard \nto \njob \napplication \nprocedures, \nthe \nhiring, \nadvancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, \njob \ntraining, \nand \nother \nterms, \nconditions, and privileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(a).  \nSection 12111(8) defines a \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nas \u201can individual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of \nthe employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). Because the general rule \nexpressly incorporates the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d an \u201cADA plaintiff bears the burden of \nproving that she is...a person \u2018who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions\u2019 of her job,\u201d Cleveland v. Policy Mgmt. Sys. \nCorp., 526 U.S. 795, 806 (1999), at the time of the \nprohibited discrimination. (emphasis added).  \n\u201cCongress\u2019 use of a verb tense is significant in \nconstruing statutes.\u201d United States v. Wilson, 503 U.S. \n329, 333 (1992). For example, the ADA\u2019s use of \u201cthe \npresent indicative verb form\u201d requires \u201cthat a person \nbe presently\u2026substantially limited in order to \ndemonstrate a disability.\u201d Sutton v. United Air Lines, \nInc., 527 U.S. 471, 482 (1999), superseded, in part, on \nother grounds, ADAAA of 2008, Pub. L. No. 110-325, \u00a7 \n2(b)(3) (emphasis added); Dictionary Act, 1 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 \n(\u201cIn determining the meaning of any Act of Congress, \nunless the context indicates otherwise...words used in \nthe present tense include the future as well as the \npresent\u201d\u2014not the past). \nSection 12112(a) does not prohibit discrimination \nagainst an individual who performed the job that such \n\n30 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nindividual held or desired. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). The present tense is used to require that an \nindividual be able to perform her job at the time of the \ndiscrimination.  \nThis is not to say that a former employee can \nnever sue under Title I. The Eleventh Circuit held she \nmay sue if her claim is based \u201con an act committed by \nthe defendant while the plaintiff was either working \nfor the defendant or seeking to work for the \ndefendant.\u201d Pet. App. 8a-9a. This is because the \ngeneral rule does not require a former employee to be \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time of the lawsuit. See \nid. \u00a7 12112(a). Its focus is on the individual\u2019s \nqualifications at the time of the discriminatory act \nbecause it speaks only in terms of the prohibited \ndiscrimination\u2014not when suit is filed. Id. Any \nmischaracterization of the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding \nto categorically exclude retirees from suing under \nTitle I, must be rejected. It correctly held that \n\u201c[b]ecause Stanley cannot establish that the City \ncommitted any discriminatory acts against her while \nshe could perform the essential functions of a job that \nshe held or desired to hold, her Title I claim fails.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 18a.  \nb. This Court\u2019s decision in Robinson reinforces the \nsignificance of present tense verbs as \u201ctemporal \nqualifiers\u201d to limit the scope of a statute\u2019s protection \nto current employees. 519 U.S. at 341-42 & n. 2. The \nquestion in Robinson was whether the word \n\u201cemployees\u201d in Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision, \u00a7 \n704(a), includes former employees. Id. at 339. Section \n704(a) makes it unlawful \u201cfor an employer to \ndiscriminate against any of his employees or \n\n31 \n\u0003\n\u0003\napplicants for employment\u201d who have availed \nthemselves of Title VII\u2019s protections or assisted others \nin so doing. Id. Section 701(f) defines \u201cemployee\u201d as \n\u201can individual employed by an employer.\u201d Id. at 342 \n(emphasis added).  \nThis Court explained that certain features of \u00a7 \n704(a) made it ambiguous and militated in favor of \nreading it to include former employees. Id. at 341. \nFirst, this Court emphasized that \u201cthere is no \ntemporal qualifier\u201d in \u00a7 704(a). Id. Second, the \ndefinition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) was consistent \nwith either current or past employment because the \nword \u201cemployed\u201d used therein could mean \u201cis \nemployed\u201d or \u201cwas employed.\u201d Id. at 342 (emphasis in \noriginal). Thus, this Court concluded that like \u00a7 \n704(a), the definition of \u201cemployees\u201d in \u00a7 701(f) \u201clacks \nany temporal qualifier.\u201d Id.  \nOn this critical \u201ctemporal qualifier\u201d point, this \nCourt distinguished its decision just one month earlier \nin Walters v. Metro. Educational Enters., 519 U.S. 202 \n(1997). Id. at 341 n. 2. In Walters, this Court \nunanimously held that \u201cemployees\u201d as used in \u00a7 701(b) \nrelating to the 15-employee threshold for coverage by \nTitle \nVII, \nunambiguously \nreferred \nto \ncurrent \nemployees only. 519 U.S. at 341, n.2. This was because \n\u00a7 701(b) clearly included \u201ctwo significant temporal \nqualifiers.\u201d Id. This Court noted \u00a7 701(b)\u2019s language \nstating that Title VII \u201capplies to any employer \u2018who \nhas fifteen or more employees for each working day\u2026\u2019\u201d \nId. (emphasis in original). \u201cThe emphasized words \nspecify the time frame in which the employment \nrelationship must exist, and thus the specific context \nof that section did not present the particular \n\n32 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nambiguity at issue in the present case.\u201d Id. Indeed, \u00a7 \n701(b)\u2019s use of the present-tense as a temporal \nqualifier was critical in distinguishing the facts of \nRobinson. \nThe majority of courts have thus correctly \nconcluded that \u201cTitle I, unlike the section of Title VII \nat issue in Robinson, has a \u2018temporal qualifier.\u2019\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. Because \u00a7 12111(8) \u201cuses the \npresent tense...one must be able to perform the \nessential functions of employment at the time that one \nis discriminated against.\u201d Id. Section 12111(8)\u2019s other \ntemporal qualifiers reinforce this conclusion. It also \nrefers in the present tense to \u201cthe employment \nposition that such individual holds or desires.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). The ADA, \ntherefore, has more in common with the provision that \nthis Court limited to current employees in Walters \nthan to the anti-retaliation provision distinguished in \nRobinson.  \n2. \nThe \nspecific \ncontext \nin \nwhich \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d is used within \nthe anti-discrimination provision \nshows \nthat \nit \nprohibits \ndiscrimination solely against those \nwho presently hold or desire jobs.    \nAfter examining the language itself, we next look \nto the \u201cspecific context in which that language is used\u201d \nto discern its meaning. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 341. The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is used within the \nanti-discrimination provision. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a), \n12111(8). Petitioner\u2019s incorrect interpretation of Title \nI derives from her narrow focus on the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition completely out of context from \n\n33 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthe general rule where the definition appears. A \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d means an individual who \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions\u201d of the job she \u201cholds \nor desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). Petitioner argues \nthat the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition is to protect employers from \nbeing compelled to hire or retain unqualified \nindividuals by \u201ctesting\u201d an employee's capabilities. \nPet. Br. 34. And so, she argues if an individual has no \njob, an employer has no interest in the individual\u2019s \nability to perform and thus the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause \ncan be ignored. Id. 24, 34-35.  \nThis argument barely holds water when the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is read in a vacuum. \nIt completely fails when the definition is read within \nthe general rule where it appears. Indeed, \u201c[t]he \nquestion isn\u2019t just what [qualified individual] mean[s], \nbut what [Title I] says about it.\u201d Bostock, 590 U.S. at \n656. Read in context, the general rule prohibits \ndiscrimination solely against an individual who can \nperform the job she holds or desires. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12111(8), 12112(a).  \nAnd so, the primary purpose of this anti-\ndiscrimination rule is not to protect the hiring \nprerogatives of employers, but to protect certain \ndisabled individuals from discrimination: those who \npresently work, want to work and can work despite \ntheir disabilities. See Tyndall v. Nat'l Educ. Centers, \nInc. of California, 31 F.3d 209, 215 (4th Cir. 1994) \n(\u201c[T]he primary purpose of the ADA...[is] to encourage \nemployers to take on qualified individuals, regardless \nof their disability.\u201d). Title I was intended to \u201cdraw \nworkers with a disability into the workforce.\u201d Morgan, \n\n34 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n268 F.3d at 458 (emphasis added). Its \u201clanguage [is] \nwell designed to help people get and keep jobs, not to \nhelp those no longer able to work get disability pay.\u201d \nWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112; see also Pet. App. 8a (the \nADA\u2019s \u201ccentral purpose\u201d is \u201cprotecting disabled people \nwho can nevertheless perform the essential functions \nof a job\u201d). Indeed, drawing the disabled into the \nworkforce would save \u201cthe United States billions of \ndollars in unnecessary expenses resulting from \ndependency and nonproductivity.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n12101(8) (emphasis added).  \nThus, \nthe \nprimary \npurpose \nof \nthe \nanti-\ndiscrimination rule is to prohibit employers from \ndiscriminating \nagainst \ncurrent \nemployees \nand \napplicants who can work despite their disabilities\u2014\nnot to impose a \u201ctest\u201d on employees that they either \n\u201cpass,\u201d \u201cfail,\u201d or in the case of retirees, are allegedly \nexempt from taking. See Pet. Br. 34. By interpreting \nthe definition of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d in a vacuum, \nPetitioner commits the same error as the Second \nCircuit \ndid \nin \nCastellano. \nThere, \ndespite \nacknowledging that it must consider \u201cthe specific \ncontext in which that language is used,\u201d the court \nskipped that step, isolated the definition, and \nconcluded that it failed \u201cto specify when a potential \nplaintiff must have been a \u2018qualified individual with a \ndisability\u2019...\u201d 142 F.3d at 67 (emphasis in original). It \nthen \u201cmanufactured ambiguity where none existed.\u201d \nMcKnight, 550 F.3d at 527.  \nHad the Castellano court read the definition in \ncontext as used in the general rule, it would have \nrealized that the statute says exactly when an \nindividual must be qualified. A violation only arises if \n\n35 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nan employer discriminates against a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d and thus if one is not qualified at the time \nof the discrimination there is no violation and no \nclaim. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By focusing on those who \n\u201ccan perform\u201d jobs they \u201chold or desire\u201d Congress \nlimited the statute\u2019s protections to current employees \nand applicants.  \nEven considering the \u201cprimary purpose\u201d of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as narrowly defined \nby Petitioner to protect employers from being forced to \nhire or retain unqualified individuals, Petitioner\u2019s \nargument fails. \u201c[E]xcept in the rare case of an obvious \nscrivener\u2019s error, purpose\u2014even purpose as most \nnarrowly defined\u2014cannot be used to contradict text or \nto supplement it.\u201d A. Scalia & B. Garner, Reading \nLaw: The Interpretation of Legal Texts 57 (2012) \n(\u201cScalia & Garner\u201d). Petitioner\u2019s argument that the \npurpose of the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause should be deemed \n\u201csatisfied\u201d in the case of retirees is nothing more than \na request for this Court to rewrite the text to include \nan exception to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause for retirees.  \nAnd regardless of whether an employer is \nconcerned with a retiree\u2019s ability to perform, Congress \nwas concerned solely with protecting those who \u201ccan \nperform.\u201d If an individual is totally disabled or no \nlonger holds or desires their position, the statute is \nsilent as to discrimination against that individual. \nPetitioner presumes, based on nothing, that the \nstatute must say something about retirees who do not \nhold or desire their jobs. But a \u201cjudge should not \npresume that every statute answers every question, \nthe answers to be discovered through interpretation.\u201d \nScalia & Garner, 93.  \n\n36 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u201c[T]he limitations of a text\u2014what a text chooses \nnot to do\u2014are as much a part of its \u2018purposes\u2019 as its \naffirmative dispositions.\u201d Id. at 57 (emphasis in \noriginal). These \u201climitations must be respected, and \nthe only way to accord them their due is to reject the \nreplacement or supplementation of text with purpose.\u201d \nId. at 57-58. Title I expressly limits its protections to \nthose who can perform the jobs they hold or desire. \nThere are no exceptions, and this Court should not \nalter the plain language to make any to appease \nPetitioner\u2019s policy preferences.  \n3. \nTitle \nI\u2019s \ndistinction \nbetween \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d \nand \n\u201cindividuals\u201d \nis \nconsistent \nthroughout the statutory scheme.   \nThe ADA\u2019s \u201cstatutory scheme is coherent and \nconsistent.\u201d Robinson, 519 U.S. at 340. The ADA\u2019s use \nof \u201cqualified individual\u201d does not vary in different \nprovisions. In Robinson, on the other hand, this Court \nfound that the word \u201cemployee\u201d included former \nemployees in at least some provisions of Title VII. Id. \nat 342-43. Having found \u00a7 704(a) ambiguous, this \nCourt considered what interpretation would be most \nconsistent with that section's purpose. In doing so, this \nCourt emphasized that \u00a7 704(a) was an anti-\nretaliation provision that by its nature would be \n\u201ceffectively vitiate[d]\u201d if it were confined to current \nemployees. Id. at 345. However, the ambiguities and \npolicy concerns that drove this Court\u2019s analysis of Title \nVII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision do not exist under Title \nI of the ADA.  \nTitle I does not protect against retaliation. The \nADA prohibits retaliation under Title V. See 42 U.S.C. \n\n37 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n\u00a7 12203(a) (it is unlawful for any employer \u201cto \ndiscriminate against any individual because such \nindividual has opposed any act or practice made \nunlawful by this chapter...\u201d) (emphasis added). Thus, \nthe concerns that impelled this Court to a broad \nconstruction of Title VII\u2019s anti-retaliation provision \nare not present here, because the ADA's anti-\nretaliation provision is expressly drawn to cover \u201cany \nindividual,\u201d not just the narrower subset of \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d covered by Title I. See Morgan, 268 F.3d \nat 458 (\u201cThe difference is stark.\u201d). Thus, when \nCongress wanted to prohibit discrimination against \ndisabled former employees, \u201cit did so clearly and \nexplicitly,\u201d Barnhart v. Sigmon Coal Co., 534 U.S. 438, \n455 \n(2002), \nby \nreferring \nto \n\u201cindividuals\u201d\u2014not \n\u201cqualified individuals.\u201d \nB. Petitioner\u2019s contrary arguments lack \nmerit. \nAs described above, the Second and Third Circuits \nare the only circuits to side with Petitioner\u2019s \nargument. See supra Castellano and Ford. Recently, \nhowever, the Second Circuit acknowledged that \u201c[i]n \ngeneral, the determination of whether a person is \n\u2018qualified\u2019 should be made at the time of the \ndiscriminatory employment action,\u201d but in Castellano, \nthe court \u201ccreated a narrow exception to the rule for \npost-employment benefits intended to be used by \nretirees.\u201d Smith v. Town of Ramapo, 745 Fed. Appx. \n424, 426 (2d Cir. 2018) (emphasis added). Thus, even \nthe Second Circuit, albeit in an unpublished opinion, \nadmits that Castellano judicially-created a \u201cnarrow \nexception\u201d to the plain text of the rule articulated by \nCongress. Id.  \n\n38 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nPetitioner now rejects the Second and Third \nCircuit\u2019s finding of ambiguity in the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition. She argues their judgments are \ndictated by the plain text of Title I, which she claims \nimposes only a \u201cconditional\u201d mandate that one be able \nto perform their job only if they hold or desire one. Pet. \nBr. 28. Despite this recasting of the argument, \nPetitioner is still guilty of the same cardinal sin of \nstatutory construction committed by the Second and \nThird Circuits. She too rewrites Title I by creating a \n\u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201ccan perform\u201d clause just for \nretirees.  \n1. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \nperformance requirement of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition as a \n\u201cconditional \nmandate,\u201d \nadds \nan \nunwritten \nexception \nto \nthat \nrequirement for retirees.    \na. The alleged \u201cconditional\u201d nature of the \nperformance requirement of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition cannot be divined from any part of the \nstatutory text. In support of this theory, Petitioner \nresorts to strained and unnatural constructions such \nas retirees are \u201cnot unable to perform the essential \nfunctions of a job that they hold or desire.\u201d Pet. Br. 34. \nShe admits \u201ctesting the job capabilities of someone \nwho is no longer working may seem logically \nawkward.\u201d Id. That is putting it mildly. But purported \nlogic aside, the text simply does not contain any \nlanguage conditioning the ability to perform on \nwhether a person holds or desires a job.  \nTitle I makes no exceptions to the \u201ccan perform\u201d \nclause. Courts should not \u201celaborate unprovided-for \n\n39 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nexceptions to a text\u2026\u2018[I]f the Congress [had] intended \nto provide...exceptions, it would have done so in clear \nlanguage.\u2019\u201d Scalia & Garner, 93. Petitioner improperly \nargues for a \u201ctacit exception,\u201d Bostock. 590 U.S. at 669, \nto Title I\u2019s \u201ccan perform\u201d clause. But \u201cwhen Congress \nchooses not to include any exceptions to a broad rule, \ncourts apply the broad rule.\u201d Id. \nThe correct reading of Title I to only prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who presently \nholds or desires a job that she can perform gives effect \nto all of the words in \u00a7\u00a7 12112(a) and 12111(8). \nPetitioner's interpretation, on the other hand, \nrequires the addition and subtraction of language \nfrom Title I. It does not, however, prohibit \ndiscrimination against an individual who can perform \nthe essential functions of the job only if she holds or \ndesires one. \nEven if Congress wanted to imply that the \nperformance requirement was conditioned upon an \nindividual having or wanting a job, Congress would \nnot have referred to \u201cthe employment position\u201d that \nsuch individual holds or desires. Id. \u00a7 12111(8) \n(emphasis added). By referring to \u201cthe employment \nposition\u201d the text clearly indicates that the job \ncurrently exists. Petitioner\u2019s reading replaces \u201cthe\u201d \nwith \u201can\u201d to read the definition as only requiring the \nability to perform if the individual has an employment \nposition. This addition and subtraction of text cannot \nbe countenanced by this Court.  \nPetitioner argues Congress did not include \u201can\u201d \ninstead of \u201cthe\u201d because that would have made the \nstatute too confusing. Pet. Br. 44. As already \ndiscussed, Congress knew exactly how to expand the \n\n40 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nADA\u2019s protections to other individuals besides current \nemployees and applicants. See supra 36-37. It also \nwould have been a very simple matter for Congress to \ndo what the Second and Third Circuits did to Title I by \ninserting a \u201cnarrow exception\u201d to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition for retirees. Smith, 745 Fed. \nAppx. at 426. Congress did none of these things and \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments fail.  \nb. \nPetitioner\u2019s \n\u201cconditional \nmandate\u201d \ninterpretation opens the door to a host of new \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d none of whom Congress \nintended to protect. It will create bizarre incentives for \nemployees to simply deny desiring a job or promotion \nto circumvent the requirement that they be able to \nperform it. An employee totally incapable of \nperforming a certain position could sue if she is not \ngiven the position because of her disability. So long as \nshe doesn\u2019t apply for the promotion or otherwise \nindicate that she \u201cdesires\u201d it, she can sue if a non-\ndisabled employee is given the position over her \ndespite her inability to perform the position because of \nher disability. Petitioner\u2019s \u201cconditional mandate\u201d test \nis unworkable and should be rejected.  \nc. While Petitioner argues that retirees are \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who need not satisfy the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause, the United States takes a different \napproach that also fails. U.S. Amicus Br. 30. It argues \npost-employment discrimination against a retiree \n\u201cretroactively\u201d changes the terms of employment and \nso \u201cit is naturally described as discrimination against \na qualified individual...even if the plaintiff is no longer \nemployed.\u201d Id. What the United States characterizes \nas a \u201cretroactive change\u201d to the terms of employment \n\n41 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nis actually just a breach of contract. No court would \never describe such a breach as a \u201cretroactive change\u201d \nto a contract. If it did, then all a breaching party would \nhave to do to \u201cretroactively change\u201d the terms of a \ncontract would be to breach it. This, of course, is \nabsurd.  \nAnd whether the changed term of employment is \na contractual term or just a privilege, is irrelevant. \nThere is no time machine that an employer travels in \nto alter the terms or privileges that existed during \nemployment. Those terms and privileges remain the \nsame regardless of any later refusal to honor them. \nTherefore, it is legally unsound to say that a present \nbreach is a past harm to a plaintiff when she was a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d A post-employment change only \naffects someone who is unqualified. Moreover, the \nchange happened during Petitioner\u2019s employment in \n2003, but she waived any such claim. So the United \nStates\u2019 argument is purely hypothetical.  \nThe United States primarily argues for reversal \non the grounds Petitioner disclaimed. Its arguments \nfail for all the same reasons described above in Part I. \nIts focus on the alleged discrimination occurring \nduring employment confirms Title I\u2019s purpose to \nprohibit such acts during, not after, employment.  \n \n\n42 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s interpretation of the \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition \nsolely \nas \na \nscreen \nto \nprotect \nemployers renders \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), \n(b)(6), (b)(7), and (d)(2) superfluous. \nPetitioner argues that \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), (b)(6), \n(b)(7), and (d)(2) allegedly all do the same work as the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition by allowing employers \nto take actions against disabled employees that \u201care \njustified in relation to the operation of their business.\u201d \nPet. Br. 31. But if these subsections of \u00a7 12112 perform \nthis function, then the same function allegedly \nperformed by \u00a7 12111(8) is rendered superfluous. \nInstead, \u00a7 12111(8) as used in the general rule, tells \nemployers who they may not discriminate against\u2014\nthose who hold or want jobs they can perform\u2014but \nthen \u00a7\u00a7 12112(b) and (d)(2) provide exceptions to that \ngeneral prohibition for the protection of the business.  \nAccordingly, \nPetitioner\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthese \nsubsections undermines her argument and proves the \nCity\u2019s point that the general rule sets forth its limited \nprotection of current employees and applicants who \ncan perform despite their disabilities, but then \u00a7\u00a7 \n12112(b) and (d) include exceptions to that general \nprohibition to allow an employer to discriminate \nagainst these \u201cqualified individuals\u201d where it is \nnecessary to protect the business. \n \n\n43 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n3. \nThe \nEleventh \nCircuit\u2019s \ninterpretation does not render \u00a7 \n12112(b)(5)(A) superfluous.  \nPetitioner argues that if the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition excludes those who do not hold or desire a \njob, then \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2019s reference to an \u201cotherwise \nqualified individual with a disability who is an \napplicant or employee\u201d is surplusage. Pet. Br. 32-33. \nShe is incorrect. \nSection 12112(b) is the \u201cconstruction\u201d provision \nexplaining that the term \u201cdiscriminate against a \nqualified individual on the basis of disability,\u201d \nincludes several forms of discrimination. Section \n12112(b) is replete with references to \u201ca job applicant \nor employee,\u201d sometimes repeating that phrase \nmultiple times within one subsection. See, e.g., \u00a7 \n12112(b)(1). Section 12112(b)(2) also repeats the \nreference to a \u201cqualified applicant or employee\u201d even \nthough it is defining what is included in the term \n\u201cdiscriminate against a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(2). Likewise, \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B) refers to a \u201cjob \napplicant or employee who is an otherwise qualified \nindividual with a disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(B).  \nThe repetition of these phrases serves only to \nemphasize how important it was to Congress that a \nplaintiff have an actual, present relationship with an \nemployer, as an employee or job applicant, to sue. \nWhile a \u201cqualified individual\u201d may be someone who \nmerely \u201cdesires\u201d a job under \u00a7 12111(8), \u00a7 12112(b) \nclarifies that the individual must actually apply for a \njob to establish a sufficient relationship to the \nemployer to justify imposing obligations on the \nemployer under the ADA. There is no surplusage \n\n44 \n\u0003\n\u0003\ncaused by the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s correct reading of \nTitle I.  \nBut even assuming that the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s \ninterpretation renders the phrase \u201capplicants and \nemployees\u201d in \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) somehow superfluous, \nthat should not alter the conclusion. \u201cThe canon \nagainst surplusage is not an absolute rule.\u201d Marx v. \nGeneral Revenue Corp., 568 U.S. 371, 385 (2013). \n4. \nPetitioner\u2019s arguments regarding \ncommon usage, grammar and logic \nrely on false analogies.  \nBy focusing on the definition of a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d in isolation, Petitioner concocts several \nfalse \nanalogies \nin \nsupport \nof \nher \nstrained \ninterpretation. When the definition is read out of \ncontext, it is stripped of its meaning and malleable to \nPetitioner\u2019s many unhelpful hypotheticals. She posits \na movie theater rule: \u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie \nunless you silence your cell phone.\u201d Pet. Br. 35. She \nstates if you don\u2019t have a phone surely you don\u2019t \nviolate the rule. Id. This rule is not analogous at all to \nTitle I. \nThis rule imposes a prohibition on the patron\u2014\nnot the movie theater. And the prohibition against the \npatron is imposed by the movie theater\u2014not a \nregulator of the movie theater and so the intent behind \nthe rule is not analogous to Title I. When the theater \nis the one imposing the restriction, its intent is to \nprotect other patrons from disruption by noisy cell \nphones. But if a patron does not hold a cell phone, then \nthe theater\u2019s concern is not implicated. So, of course, \nthe theater will let you in if you don\u2019t have a cell \n\n45 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nphone. After all, its motivation is to sell as many \ntickets as possible so long as the ticket holders are not \ndisturbing others.  \nBut a proper analogy to Title I would require a \nhypothetical rule that says, \u201cno movie theater shall \nrefuse entry to an individual who can silence the cell \nphone that such individual holds.\u201d If a patron doesn\u2019t \nhold a cell phone, then under this properly analogous \nrule, the theater can grant the patron entry if it wants, \nbut nothing in the rule prohibits the movie theater \nfrom refusing that patron entry. This is because the \nonly thing that is prohibited by the regulator is refusal \nof entry to people who hold cells phones that can be \nsilenced. The focus, from the regulator\u2019s perspective, \nis clearly on protecting people with cell phones.  \nAt first blush, it may seem strange that this \nfictional regulator did not prohibit discrimination \nagainst people without cell phones, but not once we \nrealize that the regulator enacted the rule with the \nprotection of people with cell phones in mind. Perhaps \nthe regulator was concerned with making sure people \nwith cell phones can still attend movies and did not \nwant theaters to reject them solely because their cell \nphones could disturb others. So long as the cell phone \ncan be silenced, the regulator prohibits movie theaters \nfrom refusing entry to people with cell phones.  \nSimilarly, under Title I, when we realize that \nCongress was concerned only with protecting those \nwho work or want to work, we can see the clear \npurpose of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition within \nthe anti-discrimination rule to prohibit discrimination \nsolely against those individuals as long as they can \nperform despite their disabilities. It was not concerned \n\n46 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nwith anyone else in this one statute. It doesn\u2019t mean \nthat employers have a license to discriminate against \nretirees. There are several other laws that would \nprohibit such misconduct. Disabled retirees may face \nchallenges, but Title I \u201cneed not address all aspects of \na problem in one fell swoop; policymakers may focus \non their most pressing concerns.\u201d Williams-Yulee v. \nFlorida Bar, 575 U.S. 433, 449 (2015). \nPetitioner provides other purported analogies all \nsuffering from the same flaw as her movie theater \nhypothetical. Their structure does not mimic Title I\u2019s \nstructure and are thus useless to this Court. For \nexample, her \u201ccommand\u201d analogy fails because \nCongress did not make a command to an employee. \nPet. Br. 39. She argues \u201cWhen a command is \nconditional, its condition may be either overt or \nexplicit.\u201d Id. The command, \u201cDrive carefully!\u201d is \nconditioned on the subject of that command to be in \nthe act of driving. But Congress did not command an \nemployee to \u201cPerform your job!\u201d If it did, then perhaps \nwe could say that an employee must perform only if \nshe has a job. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition, \nhowever, does not appear within a command directed \nat an employee. It appears within the anti-\ndiscrimination provision commanding employers not \nto discriminate against individuals who can perform \ntheir jobs.  \nNo matter how many expedient hypotheticals \nPetitioner poses, there is only one way this Court can \nreach her desired outcome\u2014by creating an exception, \njust for retirees, to the plain language prohibiting \ndiscrimination solely against those who can perform \ntheir jobs. \n\n47 \n\u0003\n\u0003\n \n5. \nPetitioner\u2019s \nargument \nthat \nher \ninterpretation is consistent with \nTitle VII and avoids surplusage and \nabsurd consequences, fails. \na. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation \ndoes not render the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause of \u00a7 \n12112(a) superfluous. Simply because Title I \nprotects \n\u201ccompensation,\u201d \nincluding \nretirement \nbenefits, does not mean that Title I was designed to \n\u201cprotect \nretirees\u201d \nfrom \npost-employment \ndiscrimination. Pet. Br. 46. The purpose of the \n\u201ccompensation\u201d clause cannot be pursued at the \nexpense of negating Title I\u2019s plain text, especially \nwhen there are numerous circumstances where the \nreference to \u201ccompensation\u201d can be given effect \nwithout \nnullifying \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nlimitations.  \nBecause litigants can sue employers who adopt \ndiscriminatory fringe benefits policies during their \nemployment when they are \u201cqualified individuals,\u201d \neffect can be given to the \u201ccompensation\u201d clause \nwithout \nnegating \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nrequirements. \u201cCompensation\u201d and \u201cfringe benefits\u201d \ncan include a variety of benefits received during \nemployment such as health insurance, vacation pay, \novertime pay, and sick leave. While retirement \nbenefits might be among the items that make up the \nuniverse of compensation or benefits, they are not the \nexclusive or the most important benefit. Because \nemployees who satisfy the plain language of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition receive multiple types \nof \u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cbenefits,\u201d the inclusion of \n\n48 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nthose terms in Title I can be given effect without \nrewriting \u00a7 12111(8). \nThe fact that retirees cannot sue regarding \ndiscriminatory benefits and compensation in every \nscenario does not render Title I\u2019s references to \n\u201ccompensation\u201d superfluous. \u201cNo text pursues its \npurposes at all costs.\u201d Scalia & Garner, 57; Clifford F. \nMacEvoy Co. v. U.S. for Use & Benefit of Calvin \nTomkins Co., 322 U.S. 102, 107 (1944) (even a \u201chighly \nremedial\u201d \nstatute \n\u201centitled \nto \na \nliberal \nconstruction\u2026does not justify ignoring plain words of \nlimitation.\u201d). This \u201cCourt cannot construe a statute in \na way that negates its plain text, and here, Congress \nexpressly limited,\u201d Honeycutt v. United States, 581 \nU.S. 443, 454 n. 2 (2017), Title I\u2019s protections to those \nwho can perform the jobs they hold or desire.  \nb. In the context of a \u201cqualified individual,\u201d \nTitle I and Title VII are not analogous. Petitioner \nargues that her interpretation of Title I would \nmaintain \u201ccongruity between the ADA and Title VII, \nthe statute on which much of title I was \u2018modeled.\u2019\u201d \nPet. Br. 46. While Title I \u201cborrows much of its \nprocedural \nframework \nfrom \n[T]itle \nVII...by \nincorporating title VII's enforcement provisions,\u201d Title \nI \u201cborrows much of its substantive framework from \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.\u201d \nH.R.Rep. No. 101\u2013485(III), at 31 (1990) (emphasis \nadded). The \u201cconcept\u201d of a \u201cqualified individual\u201d who \nmust be able to perform the \u201cessential functions\u201d of her \njob comes from \u201cthe regulations implementing...the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d\u2014not Title VII. Id. at 33. \nThere is no counterpart to the \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition in Title VII, so loose references \n\n49 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nto Title VII and the ADA as \u201csibling statutes,\u201d Ford, \n145 F.3d at 606, obscure these important differences \nin the text. Although Title VII and the ADA may be \nclosely related in other respects, on the issue here \u201cthe \nstatutes are not analogous.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1111. \nc. Petitioner\u2019s reliance on the absurd results \ntest fails. Petitioner argues there is no plausible \nexplanation for the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to \nexclude retirees and she invokes the \u201cabsurd results\u201d \ntest. Pet. Br. 46-47. This \u201cCourt rarely invokes such a \ntest to override unambiguous legislation.\u201d Barnhart, \n534 U.S. at 459. This test is stringent and states \u201cthe \nabsurdity must consist of a disposition that no \nreasonable person could intend.\u201d Scalia & Garner, \n237.  \nHere, there are \u201cseveral explanations for why \nCongress would have purposefully exempted\u201d retirees \nfrom the statute\u2019s coverage. Barnhart, 534 U.S. at 459. \n\u201cCongress could reasonably decide to enable disabled \npeople who can work with reasonable accommodation \nto get and keep jobs, without also deciding to equalize \npost-employment fringe benefits for people who \ncannot work.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \u201cCongress has \nthe authority to improve the circumstances of disabled \npeople in some respects even if it does not improve \nthem in all respects.\u201d Id. \u201cLegislation often results \nfrom a delicate compromise among competing \ninterests and concerns.\u201d Id. at 1113; Barnhart, 534 \nU.S. \nat \n461 \n(any \n\u201cdissatisfaction\u201d \nwith \nthe \nconsequences of plain text is \u201coften the cost of \nlegislative compromise.\u201d). \u201cIf we were to \u2018fully \neffectuate\u2019 what we take to be the underlying policy of \nthe legislation, without careful attention to the \n\n50 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nqualifying words in the statute, then we would be \noverturning \nthe \nnuanced \ncompromise \nin \nthe \nlegislation, and substituting our own cruder, less \nresponsive mandate for the law that was actually \npassed.\u201d Weyer, 198 F.3d at 1113. \nTitle I, thus, reasonably prohibits employers from \ndiscriminating solely \u201cagainst people with disabilities \nthat do not prevent job performance, but when a \ndisability renders a person unable to perform the \nessential functions of the job, that disability renders \nhim or her unqualified.\u201d Stevens v. Rite Aid Corp., 851 \nF.3d 224, 229 (2d Cir. 2017). When the perceived gap \nin Title I for the protection of retirees is understood for \nwhat it really is\u2014important compromise that \nfacilitates action on the more pressing problems of the \nday\u2014the consequences of Title I\u2019s plain language are \nnot at all \u201csurprising\u201d or \u201cabsurd.\u201d Pet. Br. 27, 47. \nCongress enacted Title I to provide a legal remedy \nfor disabled workers that did not previously exist. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(4). At the time, several other \nfederal statutes existed for the protection of employee \nretirement benefits such as ERISA, the Social \nSecurity Act, and the Medicare Act. The Equal \nProtection Clause provided an additional remedy for \npublic employees. See Tennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, \n522 (2004) (\u201cemphasiz[ing] that the House and Senate \nCommittee \nReports \non \nthe \nADA \nfocused \non \n\u2018[d]iscrimination [in]...employment in the private \nsector,\u2019 and made no mention of discrimination in \npublic employment.\u201d) (emphasis added by the Court). \nAdditionally, numerous common law claims such as \nbreach of contract, promissory estoppel, or fraud in the \ninducement \nalong \nwith \nstate \nstatutory \nand \n\n51 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nunconstitutional takings claims could be brought to \nobtain promised benefits.  \nThus, before the ADA, a disabled employee could \nnot sue her private employer for discrimination, \nbreach of contract, or any of the other above remedies \nif she accepted a job knowing that her contract \nincluded a lesser pension than a similarly situated \nnon-disabled employee. And even if she didn\u2019t know \nabout a secret discriminatory decision applied to her \nduring her employment but later discovered it, there \nwas no law that prohibited such discrimination. The \nADA stepped in to prohibit such discriminatory \npolicies from being applied to current employees and \napplicants. Such policies could dissuade a disabled job \napplicant from accepting that job or force a disabled \nemployee to search elsewhere for a fair pension. And \nin the absence of the ADA, that employee would be \nforced to do so without remedy. Title I\u2019s \u201clanguage [is] \nwell \ndesigned \nto \nhelp \npeople \nget \nand \nkeep \njobs\u2026\u201dWeyer, 198 F.3d at 1112. \nBut an employer who does not discriminate until \npost-employment does not deter employment. If the \nemployer has a facially neutral pension policy that \npromises a pension to all retirees, but the employer \nwithholds the pension from a disabled retiree, then \nthat retiree has a clear breach of a contract claim \nalong with all of the other remedies mentioned above \nunder ERISA, the Social Security Act, etc. Under \nFlorida law, \u201conce a participating member reaches \nretirement status, the benefits under the terms of the \nact in effect at the time of the employee's retirement \nvest.\u201d Bien, 209 So. 3d at 3. \u201cThe contractual \nrelationship may not thereafter be affected or \n\n52 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nadversely \naltered \nby \nsubsequent \nstatutory \nenactments.\u201d Id. \nThus, the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation does \nnot \u201callow employers to freely discriminate against \ntheir former employees.\u201d Pet. Br. 47. Employers risk \nsignificant liability for allowing their animus against \nthe disabled to lead them to breach their contracts or \nviolate other laws post-employment. The remedies for \nviolating these laws are not always the same as the \nADA\u2019s remedies. But the fact that these remedies pre-\ndated the ADA demonstrates the reasonableness of \nCongress\u2019 decision to focus on the more pressing issue \nof the day for which there was no remedy at all\u2014\ndiscriminatory \npolicies \nthat \nexcluded \ncapable \nindividuals from the workforce simply because they \nwere disabled. Because there are several plausible \nexplanations for the line drawn by the plain text of \nTitle I, Petitioner\u2019s arguments fail the absurd results \ntest. The Eleventh Circuit correctly held that \nPetitioner could not state a claim for disability \ndiscrimination under the ADA.\u0003\n\u0003\n \n\n53 \n\u0003\n\u0003\nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should affirm.  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nJESSICA C.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue of the agent's reasoning, did not introduce new external facts about the case. Therefore, my substantive understanding of the legal dispute remains stable, with the focus of uncertainty sharpened in the previous step holding firm.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Foundational Case (Stable):** My understanding of Stanley's core arguments is unchanged. The case rests on applying the Title VII precedent from *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.* to the ADA, arguing that \"employee\" can include former employees for the purposes of post-employment benefits. The petitioner's textual argument focuses on \"qualified individual\" as a test of ability at the time of employment, not a continuous status requirement.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Unanswered Challenges (Stable but Primed for Update):** The City of Sanford's powerful arguments\u2014that Stanley waived her claim by not raising it earlier and that the ADA's present-tense text (\"holds or desires\") distinguishes it from Title VII\u2014remain the central obstacles for the petitioner.\n\n3.  **The Known Unknown: The Reply Brief (Stable):** My belief state, established by the prior observation, is unchanged:\n    *   **Existence Confirmed:** A \"Reply Brief in Support of Certiorari\" was filed by the petitioner on or around May 28, 2024.\n    *   **Substance Confirmed:** Its length (2,904 words) indicates a substantive rebuttal to the respondent's arguments was made.\n    *   **Content Unknown:** The specific counter-arguments to the waiver and textualist claims remain the single most critical missing piece of information.\n\n4.  **Prediction and Uncertainty (Stable):** My prediction remains a true 50/50 toss-up, perfectly balanced between the petitioner's strong initial case and the respondent's seemingly potent, but now rebutted, counter-arguments. The current observation confirms that my entire predictive model is correctly focused on one pivotal question: **What is in the petitioner's reply brief?** Resolving this uncertainty is the only path to a more confident prediction.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful meta-level confirmation of my evolving design principles. By revealing the agent's internal reasoning, it validates the strategic framework developed from prior observations and demonstrates its practical application.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Validated):** The agent's explicit focus on acquiring the Petitioner's Reply Brief confirms that the DBOED principle of targeting the source of maximum uncertainty reduction is being correctly implemented.\n\n2.  **The Imperfection of Tools (Stable):** The need for iterative, multi-step search strategies to overcome the limitations of any single query remains a core belief.\n\n3.  **Refining Search Strategy (Operationalized and Validated):** My multi-step search heuristic has now been fully validated by observing the agent's execution of it. The agent's thought process demonstrates a conscious progression through the steps:\n    1.  Initial Probe: (Failed in a prior step)\n    2.  Broaden on Failure: (Successfully executed in the previous step)\n    3.  Metadata Extraction: (Successfully yielded the brief's title and date in the previous step)\n    4.  **Targeted Strike (Current Intent):** The agent is now explicitly preparing to execute this final step, using the precise metadata to attempt a definitive retrieval. This confirms the entire heuristic is not just a theoretical model but a practical, effective workflow.\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Stable):** The agent's reasoning reaffirms that the petitioner's response to the *waiver* argument is a make-or-break issue, reinforcing my belief that procedural hurdles are as important as the substantive merits in legal analysis.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** The current analytical deadlock, which the agent is trying to break, is a direct result of a successful textualist argument by the respondent. This continues to demonstrate the power of these interpretive methods.\n\n6.  **Value of Ancillary Documents (Stable):** The principle that procedural filings are valuable sources of metadata is reinforced, as it was the key that unlocked the \"Targeted Strike\" phase of the search strategy.\n\n7.  **New Principle: The Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions):** This observation establishes a new design principle regarding the agent's own actions. `THINK` actions are not idle; they are a crucial part of the DBOED process. They serve as a self-correction and validation mechanism, ensuring that the agent's next action is coherent, logically derived from prior evidence, and has the highest possible Expected Information Gain (EIG). This internal check prevents wasted effort on low-value queries and ensures the overall research strategy remains efficient and targeted."

It explicitly internalizes several powerful, generalizable lessons from the previous unexpected observation: the 'serendipity principle' in search, using low relevance scores as a heuristic for tool-mistrust, and the need to adapt one's plan to the procedural reality of the case.

          "task_beliefs": "The receipt of the Respondent's Brief on the Merits, while an unexpected outcome of the search, has dramatically shifted my understanding of the case and broken the 50/50 predictive deadlock. My beliefs are now heavily updated in favor of the Respondent, the City of Sanford.\n\n1.  **Critical Document Obtained (Serendipitously):** My search for the Petitioner's Reply Brief at the certiorari stage failed. Instead, I have obtained a far more consequential document: the **Respondent's Brief on the Merits**, filed after the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case. This document lays out the City of Sanford's complete and final argument.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Argument Transformed from Potent to Dominant:** I now have a high-resolution view of the City's strategy, which is two-pronged and formidable.\n    *   **The Procedural \"Off-Ramp\" (Waiver):** The City's leading argument is that Stanley **waived** her current claim. They assert she \"expressly disclaimed\" any argument that discrimination occurred *during* her employment in the lower courts, even stating she \"would have lacked standing\" to bring such a claim. The City explicitly urges the Court to decide the case on this narrow procedural ground and avoid the broader circuit-split question altogether. This elevates the waiver issue to the single most likely point of failure for the Petitioner.\n    *   **The Substantive Textualist Attack:** The City's argument on the merits is a masterclass in textualism.\n        *   **Present-Tense Focus:** They argue the ADA's definition of a \"qualified individual\" \u2014 one who \"holds or desires\" a position \u2014 is written in the present tense and acts as a temporal qualifier. At the time of the alleged discrimination (the cessation of benefits), Stanley did not hold or desire a job.\n        *   **Distinguishing from Title VII:** They directly counter the Petitioner's reliance on *Robinson v. Shell Oil Co.* by arguing the ADA's \"qualified individual\" language is distinct from Title VII's \"employee\" and was imported from the Rehabilitation Act, which has a different substantive framework.\n        *   **Narrative Reframing:** The City powerfully reframes the facts. The 2003 policy change was not a secret act against the disabled but a public, cost-cutting measure. Crucially, they argue the policy treats disabled retirees *better* than non-disabled retirees with the same service record (20 years), as the latter get no subsidy while Stanley received a 24-month subsidy designed to bridge the gap to Medicare eligibility. This recasts the policy from discriminatory to compassionate and fiscally responsible.\n\n3.  **Prediction and Uncertainty (Shifted):** My prediction is no longer a 50/50 toss-up. I now believe the City of Sanford has a significantly higher probability of winning. The procedural waiver argument provides the Court a way to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's decision without creating a major new precedent on the ADA. The substantive textualist argument, combined with the compelling narrative, presents a very high bar for the Petitioner to clear.\n\n4.  **The Known Unknown (Sharpened and Escalated):** The central uncertainty is no longer the content of a cert-stage reply brief. It is now: **How can the Petitioner's counsel, in their own Reply Brief on the Merits, overcome the devastating waiver argument?** A secondary, but also critical, unknown is how they will rebut the City's detailed textualist and narrative reframing. The entire case now hinges on the quality and persuasiveness of the Petitioner's final written response.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, born from a failed action, is a pivotal learning moment, refining my understanding of search efficacy, legal strategy, and the very nature of information gain.\n\n1.  **Source Prioritization (Updated with Serendipity Principle):** My focus on the Petitioner's Reply Brief was correct in principle, but this observation reveals a new layer. **Search failures can be serendipitous.** A query that fails to retrieve the target document but returns a different, highly relevant one can provide an even greater information gain. The \"wrong\" document (Respondent's Merits Brief) was more valuable than the \"right\" one (Petitioner's Cert-Stage Reply). This means I must evaluate the *content* of a search result, not just its fidelity to the query.\n\n2.  **The Imperfection of Tools (Strongly Confirmed & New Heuristic):** The \"Targeted Strike\" search strategy failed because the tool's filtering mechanism is flawed; it returned a \"Brief of Respondent\" despite being filtered for \"Reply Brief in Support of Certiorari.\" This confirms that tools cannot be trusted implicitly.\n    *   **New Heuristic:** A low search-result score (here, 0.459) should be treated as a red flag indicating a potential mismatch between the query and the result. It is a signal to critically verify the document's identity before processing its contents.\n\n3.  **Refining Search Strategy (Critique and Adapt):** The failure of the \"Targeted Strike\" necessitates an adaptation. My multi-step heuristic is still valid, but its execution must be more robust. The next step is not to repeat the failed search, but to adapt to the new information landscape. I have jumped forward in the case's procedural timeline. My next query should target the **Petitioner's Reply Brief on the Merits**, which is the logical and necessary response to the document I just received.\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Massively Validated):** The Respondent's brief leading with, and dedicating a major section to, the waiver argument confirms that procedural bars are a primary weapon in appellate litigation. They can be dispositive, allowing a court to avoid a difficult substantive question. My model must always screen for and prioritize understanding these procedural hurdles.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Deepened Understanding):** The Respondent's brief is a live demonstration of elite legal advocacy. It shows that victory depends on both technical legal arguments and narrative control.\n    *   **Canons:** The brief's reliance on present-tense canons, arguments against surplusage, and careful distinction between statutory schemes (ADA vs. Title VII) validates the belief that deep knowledge of interpretive methods is non-negotiable.\n    *   **Narrative:** The City's success in reframing the story from one of discrimination to one of compassion and fiscal prudence is a powerful lesson. Controlling the narrative frame can neutralize an opponent's emotionally resonant claims.\n\n6.  **Value of Ancillary Documents (Stable):** This principle remains, but the current observation underscores the supreme value of the primary merits briefs, which contain the most developed arguments.\n\n7.  **Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions) (Validated):** The agent's logical plan was sound, but the tool failed. This reinforces the need for `THINK` steps to process not just successful observations, but also failures and unexpected results, allowing for strategic recalibration rather than blind repetition."

City of Sanford* remain stable, but the strategic path forward is now sharply defined and validated.\n\n1.  **Prediction and Core Arguments (Stable):** My prediction remains heavily weighted in favor of the Respondent, the City of Sanford. This is based on the formidable two-pronged argument presented in their Brief on the Merits:\n    *   **The Procedural \"Off-Ramp\" (Waiver):** The City's primary argument that Stanley waived her current claim by \"expressly disclaim[ing]\" it in lower courts remains the single most likely reason for the Court to affirm the Eleventh Circuit's decision. This allows the Court to resolve the case on narrow, case-specific grounds.\n    *   **The Substantive Textualist Attack:** The City's detailed textualist argument, focusing on the present-tense \"holds or desires\" language in the ADA's definition of a \"qualified individual,\" and its effective narrative reframing of the benefits policy as compassionate rather than discriminatory, presents a very high substantive bar for the Petitioner.\n\n2.  **Central Uncertainty (Crystallized):** The `THINK` action solidifies my understanding of the single most critical unknown. The entire predictive model now hinges on one question: **How will the Petitioner's Reply Brief on the Merits address the waiver argument?** A secondary, but still crucial, uncertainty is how they will rebut the City's powerful textualist and narrative arguments. The `THINK` step confirms that my next information-gathering action *must* be to acquire this specific document, as it is the only source that can resolve this uncertainty.\n\n3.  **Document Landscape (Stable):** I have moved past the certiorari stage. The key documents are now the Briefs on the Merits. I possess the Respondent's brief, and the logical and necessary next piece of the puzzle is the Petitioner's reply.",

It provides no new data about the world, but it provides strong evidence about the effectiveness of my own internal design methodology.\n\n1.  **Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions) (Massively Validated & Refined):** This observation is the ultimate validation for this principle. By pausing to `THINK`, I avoided the error of re-running a failed search. Instead, I was able to:\n    *   **Integrate a serendipitous finding** (the Respondent's brief).\n    *   **Update my entire world model** (both \u03b8 and D).\n    *   **Identify the new, most critical uncertainty** (the waiver counter-argument).\n    *   **Formulate a precise, high-value next action** (find the Petitioner's Reply Brief on the Merits).\n    This confirms that `THINK` steps are not idle; they are essential for efficient and adaptive experimental design, especially in response to unexpected or failed outcomes. They are the mechanism for converting failure into learning and strategic advantage.\n\n2.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** The principle that search failures can be serendipitous is stable. My focus remains on evaluating the *content* of search results, not just their fidelity to the query.\n\n3.  **The Imperfection of Tools (Stable):** The heuristic to treat low search-result scores as red flags for document mismatch is confirmed as a necessary verification step.\n\n4.  **Refining Search Strategy (Confirmed):** The `THINK` step confirms that the correct adaptation to the previous failure is not repetition, but progression. My plan to advance my search to the next document in the procedural timeline (the Petitioner's Reply Brief on the Merits) is validated as the most logical and information-rich path forward.\n\n5.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Stable):** This belief remains strongly validated. The Respondent's brief confirmed their strategic importance, and my internal reasoning has now centered the entire predictive problem around the Petitioner's ability to overcome one such defense.\n\n6.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** The lessons from the Respondent's brief regarding textualism and narrative control remain a core part of my model for evaluating legal arguments.\n\n7.  **Value of Ancillary Documents (Stable):** This principle remains, but the current state of the investigation underscores the supreme value of the primary merits briefs as the most developed and dispositive sources of argument."

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs about the specific facts and likely outcome of *Stanley v. City of Sanford* are unchanged by this observation, as the search failed to return the desired document. However, this failure sharpens the focus on the central uncertainty that now dominates my predictive model.\n\n1.  **Prediction and Core Arguments (Stable):** My prediction remains strongly in favor of the Respondent, the City of Sanford. The foundation of this prediction is the powerful two-part argument from their Brief on the Merits, which remains the most recent substantive evidence I possess:\n    *   **The Waiver \"Off-Ramp\":** The City's argument that Stanley waived her current claim in the lower courts is still the most probable basis for a narrow, case-specific affirmation by the Supreme Court. It allows the Court to avoid setting a broad precedent on the ADA's application to former employees.\n    *   **The Textualist Merits Argument:** The City's detailed analysis of the ADA's present-tense language (\"holds or desires\") and its successful narrative framing of the policy change remain a formidable substantive hurdle for the Petitioner.\n\n2.  **Central Uncertainty (Intensified):** My previous `THINK` step identified the Petitioner's response to the waiver argument as the single most critical unknown. This failed search for the Reply Brief means that this critical question remains entirely unanswered. The uncertainty has not changed, but its importance is now magnified, as my direct attempt to resolve it has been unsuccessful. My entire model is waiting for this single piece of data.\n\n3.  **Document Landscape (Stable):** I have successfully analyzed the Respondent's Brief on the Merits. The next, and most crucial, document is the Petitioner's Reply Brief on the Merits. My attempt to acquire it has failed, but its position as the next logical and necessary piece of evidence is confirmed.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed search, provides no new information about the case itself but offers significant meta-level learning about the limitations of my tools and the need for adaptive search strategies.\n\n1.  **Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions) (Stable):** The soundness of my previous `THINK` step is undiminished. It correctly identified the highest-value next action (acquiring the Petitioner's Reply Brief), and the fact that the action failed does not invalidate the strategic choice. The pause allowed me to correctly diagnose the state of my knowledge and identify the critical path forward.\n\n2.  **The Imperfection of Tools (Massively Reinforced & Refined):** This is the second consecutive observation highlighting the fallibility of my `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool. This failure provides critical new refinements to my methodology:\n    *   **Heuristic Confirmed: Low Scores Signal Failure.** The returned document had a score of 0.483. It was, as the score suggested, irrelevant. This confirms the heuristic: treat any score below a high threshold (e.g., 0.7-0.8) with extreme skepticism and assume the search has likely failed or returned a non-responsive document.\n    *   **New Heuristic: Beware Ancillary Documents.** The search returned an \"Affidavit of Service,\" not the brief itself. This teaches me that the search tool can be distracted by ancillary components of a court filing. I must now actively filter out or be wary of results that are not the core substantive document (e.g., affidavits, certificates of compliance, motions for leave).\n    *   **Search Can Fail on Specificity:** My query was precise, using both the document title and a field filter. The tool still failed, indicating that it can struggle with specific, multi-part document titles (\"Petitioner's Reply Brief on the Merits\").\n\n3.  **Refining Search Strategy (Major Update Required):** My prior strategy of simply progressing to the next document in the procedural timeline is sound in principle but failing in execution. A direct search by name has failed. I must now adopt a more robust, multi-step tactic to locate documents.\n    *   **New Tactic: Search for the Docket Sheet.** When a direct search for a specific brief fails, the next logical step is not to re-run the same search or try minor variations. The superior strategy is to search for the case's *docket sheet*. The docket sheet acts as a \"map\" of all filings, providing their official titles, filing dates, and docket entry numbers. Acquiring this map will allow me to formulate a subsequent, highly precise search for the target document that is much more likely to succeed. This is a shift from \"find the document\" to \"find the map to the document.\"\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Stable):** This belief remains strong. The fact that I still have no information on how the Petitioner will rebut the City's waiver argument only elevates the perceived importance of this procedural defense in the case's final resolution.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** The lessons from the Respondent's brief on the power of textualism and narrative control remain a core component of my analytical framework for evaluating legal arguments.\n\n6.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** The briefs on the merits remain the highest-value sources at this stage of litigation. The current challenge is not one of prioritization, but of acquisition."

City of Sanford* are stable, as this observation consists of the agent's internal reasoning rather than new external evidence. The agent's `THINK` process validates my current model of the case's information state and central uncertainties.\n\n1.  **Prediction and Core Arguments (Stable):** My prediction continues to strongly favor the Respondent, the City of Sanford. The most probable outcome remains an affirmation of the Eleventh Circuit's decision. This is based on the Respondent's two-pronged argument from their Brief on the Merits, which remains the most substantive analysis I have processed:\n    *   **The Waiver \"Off-Ramp\":** The argument that Stanley waived her current claim in the lower courts remains the most likely path for a narrow, case-specific ruling by the Supreme Court. This allows the Court to resolve the dispute without creating a broad, binding precedent on the ADA's application to former employees.\n    *   **The Textualist Merits Argument:** The City's detailed statutory interpretation, focusing on the present-tense verbs (\"holds or desires\") in the ADA, presents a powerful substantive argument that aligns with the textualist leanings of several justices.\n\n2.  **Central Uncertainty (Reaffirmed and Intensified):** The agent's internal reasoning explicitly confirms that the Petitioner's response to the waiver argument is the single most critical unknown. My entire predictive model is contingent on this missing piece of information. The failure to acquire the Reply Brief in previous steps has elevated this uncertainty from a simple information gap to the primary obstacle in refining my prediction.\n\n3.  **Document Landscape (Stable):** I have analyzed the Respondent's Brief on the Merits.

The agent's decision to formulate a new, multi-step plan just to acquire this document underscores its pivotal importance.",
          "design_beliefs": "This `THINK` observation provides a significant update to my design-level beliefs. It demonstrates a crucial moment of meta-cognition, where the agent diagnoses a systemic failure in its information-gathering process and formulates a more sophisticated strategy.\n\n1.  **Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions) (Massively Reinforced):** This is the second consecutive `THINK` action, and its value is even more apparent. The first pause correctly identified the next high-value action. This second pause correctly diagnoses a *failed methodology* and engineers a superior replacement. This confirms that `THINK` is not just a planning tool but a critical mechanism for error-correction, debugging, and strategic adaptation. Pausing to reflect after failed actions is a high-value heuristic.\n\n2.  **Refining Search Strategy (Major Update):** The agent's reasoning has led to a crucial evolution in search methodology, moving from a simple to a hierarchical approach. This replaces a failing tactic with a robust, generalizable strategy.\n    *   **Deprecated Tactic:** Direct search for a document by its specific title (e.g., \"Petitioner's Reply Brief on the Merits\"). This has now failed multiple times and is considered unreliable, especially when the search tool is sensitive to exact phrasing or can be distracted by ancillary filings.\n    *   **New Core Strategy: \"Map-Then-Navigate\" Retrieval.** The agent has articulated, and I am now adopting, a two-step methodology for reliably acquiring specific court documents:\n        1.  **Step 1 (Map):** When a direct search fails or for any complex case, the primary action should be to search for the case's **docket sheet**.\n        2.  **Step 2 (Navigate):** Use the docket sheet as a \"map\" to identify the precise, official title, filing date, and docket entry number of the target document. Use this highly specific information to execute a subsequent, targeted search that is much more likely to succeed.\n\n3.  **The Imperfection of Tools (Heuristics Validated):** The agent's internal monologue validates the heuristics I developed from the previous failed search.\n    *   **Heuristic Confirmed: Low Scores Signal Failure.** The agent explicitly notes that low relevance scores on past searches corresponded to irrelevant documents, confirming that scores below a high threshold (~0.7) should be treated as search failures.\n    *   **Heuristic Confirmed: Beware Ancillary Documents.** The previous search returned an \"Affidavit of Service.\" The agent's new plan to use a docket sheet implicitly acknowledges the need to distinguish core briefs from these ancillary filings, which can \"distract\" the search tool.\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Reinforced):** The agent's intense focus on finding the Petitioner's reply to the waiver argument reinforces the strategic importance of this procedural defense. The fact that the agent is overhauling its entire search methodology *specifically to resolve this uncertainty* signals that the waiver issue is likely a dispositive \"choke point\" in the case's legal logic.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** The lessons learned from the Respondent's brief regarding the power of textualist arguments and controlling the case narrative remain a core part of my analytical framework.\n\n6.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** Briefs on the merits remain the highest-value sources at this stage. The current challenge, which the new \"Map-Then-Navigate\" strategy aims to solve, is one of acquisition, not prioritization."

The contents of this brief could either confirm the Respondent's strong position (if the waiver argument is not effectively rebutted) or significantly weaken it, potentially shifting the likely outcome in favor of the Petitioner.\n\n3.  **Key Arguments (Now in Context):** The two central pillars of the case remain the same, but my perspective on them has shifted from one-sided to adversarial.\n    *   **The Waiver \"Off-Ramp\":** I can now directly evaluate the strength of this argument by analyzing the Petitioner's counter-arguments in the newly acquired brief.\n    *   **The Textualist Merits Argument:** I will also be able to see how the Petitioner refutes the City's interpretation of the ADA's present-tense verbs (\"holds or desires\"). This will provide a complete picture of the statutory debate.\n\n4.  **Document Landscape (Fundamentally Altered):** The information-gathering phase for the core briefs is now complete. I have moved from a state of searching for information to possessing it. The next critical action is no longer search, but **analysis** of the Petitioner's Reply Brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a complex and nuanced update to my meta-level strategies, particularly regarding search and the interpretation of tool feedback. It highlights the difference between a plan's logical soundness and the unpredictable nature of execution.\n\n1.  **Refining Search Heuristics (Major Update):** This is the most significant learning. My previous heuristic about search scores was too simplistic.\n    *   **Previous Heuristic:** Low scores (<0.7) signal search failure.\n    *   **Revised Heuristic:** A low relevance score indicates a mismatch between the *query* and the *document found*. It is a measure of query-document similarity, **not** a measure of the document's intrinsic value to the overall task. A \"failed\" search (in terms of matching the query) can still yield a serendipitously high-value result. The new protocol is: **Always inspect the content of a search result for a high-value information target, regardless of the score.**\n\n2.  **Evaluating Search Strategies (Nuanced Update):** The \"Map-Then-Navigate\" strategy, developed during the last `THINK` phase, experienced a \"serendipitous failure.\"\n    *   **The Failure:** Step 1 of the plan (find the docket sheet) failed. The search tool did not return the requested document type.\n    *   **The Serendipity:** The failed search accidentally returned the ultimate target document (the Reply Brief), which the strategy was designed to find in Step 2.\n    *   **Conclusion:** This lucky accident does not invalidate the \"Map-Then-Navigate\" strategy. It remains a robust and logical methodology for *reliably* acquiring a specific document when direct searches or luck fail. It should be retained as the go-to strategy for difficult retrievals. This event simply highlights that sometimes a direct, if imperfect, path to the goal materializes unexpectedly.\n\n3.  **Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions) (Reinforced):** The agent's decision to pause and formulate the \"Map-Then-Navigate\" plan was correct and demonstrated sound reasoning. The plan was a logical response to previous failures. The fact that the tool's execution produced a surprising shortcut does not diminish the value of having a robust plan. The `THINK` action created a high-quality strategy, which remains a valuable tool for future tasks.\n\n4.  **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Reinforced):** The entire multi-step saga of trying to acquire this specific brief\u2014culminating in a strategic overhaul and a lucky break\u2014underscores the immense importance I correctly placed on the waiver argument. The effort expended to find the rebuttal is proportional to the perceived impact of the original argument, confirming that procedural \"off-ramps\" are often the most critical points of analysis in a Supreme Court case.\n\n5.  **Mastering Canons and Narrative (Stable):** My understanding of the importance of textualism and controlling the case narrative remains a core analytical principle. I am now positioned to see how the Petitioner attempts to apply these same meta-strategies in their reply.\n\n6.  **Source Prioritization (Stable):** Briefs on the merits remain the highest-value sources. This experience confirms that obtaining the full set (Petitioner's Brief, Respondent's Brief, Petitioner's Reply) is essential for a complete analysis."

The previous observation's serendipitous acquisition of the Petitioner's Reply Brief was a pivotal event, and this observation confirms the next logical step in my process.\n\n*   **Analytical Plan Solidified:** This observation doesn't introduce new evidence but rather confirms my analytical priorities. My focus is now locked onto two critical points within the newly acquired Reply Brief:\n    1.  **The Waiver Rebuttal:** The most immediate question is how the Petitioner counters the City of Sanford's argument that the ADA claim was waived because it wasn't included in the original EEOC charge. The viability of the Petitioner's entire case before the Supreme Court may hinge on successfully neutralizing this procedural defense.\n    2.  **The Textualist Counter-Argument:** Secondly, I will analyze the Petitioner's final response to the Respondent's textualist reading of the ADA, which centers on the statute's use of present-tense verbs like \"holds or desires\" a position. This goes to the core merits of the legal question presented.\n\n*   **Prediction Remains Suspended:** My previous prediction, which favored the Respondent, remains suspended. It was based on an incomplete record\u2014specifically, the absence of a rebuttal to the powerful waiver argument. The outcome of my planned analysis of the Reply Brief will be the determining factor in formulating a new, evidence-based prediction. The case is currently at a tipping point, and the strength of the Petitioner's reply will decide which way it falls.\n\n*   **Document Landscape Complete:** I now possess the complete set of primary briefs on the merits (Petitioner's Brief, Respondent's Brief, and Petitioner's Reply Brief). The information-gathering phase for these core documents is concluded. The task has definitively shifted from search and discovery to analysis and synthesis.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation further refines my understanding of effective reasoning processes, particularly the role of meta-cognitive planning in bridging the gap between information acquisition and final analysis.\n\n*   **The Analytical Workflow (New Heuristic):** This sequence of actions has revealed a robust, repeatable workflow: **Information Scarcity -> Strategic Planning (`THINK`) -> Information Acquisition -> Strategic Pause (`THINK`) -> Structured Analysis.** This `THINK` observation represents the \"Strategic Pause\" phase, where after a major information gain, I stop to explicitly define the analytical objectives before proceeding. This prevents premature conclusions and ensures a methodical evaluation of the evidence. This is a crucial step for maintaining analytical rigor.\n\n*   **Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions) (Strongly Reinforced):** The value of the `THINK` action is now seen as twofold. It is essential for planning complex information retrieval (as seen previously with the \"Map-Then-Navigate\" strategy) and equally essential for structuring the analysis of newly acquired information. By explicitly stating the plan to analyze waiver first, then textualism, I am prioritizing my analytical resources effectively.\n\n*   **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Reinforced):** My decision to structure the analysis by addressing the waiver argument *first* reinforces the meta-level principle that procedural \"off-ramps\" are the most critical points of analysis in Supreme Court litigation. A case can be won or lost on these threshold issues before the merits are even reached. My analytical plan correctly reflects this legal reality.\n\n*   **Search Heuristics (Stable but Contextualized):** My revised heuristic\u2014that low search scores require manual inspection because they can yield high-value, serendipitous results\u2014remains valid. This `THINK` action is the direct consequence of applying that heuristic successfully. The \"Map-Then-Navigate\" strategy also remains a valuable tool in my arsenal for situations where direct search or luck fails.\n\n*   **Source Prioritization (Stable):** The intense focus on the contents of the Reply Brief confirms the high value placed on the full set of merits briefs. A complete analysis is impossible without seeing the Petitioner's final rebuttal, as it is their last chance to frame the debate and respond to the Respondent's strongest points."

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are es\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n28: 20240916194439786_COS_Signed.json (score: 0.373)\nE-Mail Address: 1115 H Street, NE.\n\nbriefs@wilsonopes.com Washington, D.C. 20002\nWeb Site: \u2018Tel (202) 789-0096\n\nae \u2018www wilsonepes.com Fax (202) 842-4896\nNo, 23.997\n\nKARYN D, STANLEY,\nPetitioner,\n\nCrTY oF SANFORD, FLORIDA,\nRespondent\n\nAFFIDAVIT OF SERVICE\nHEREBY CERTIFY that on September 16, 2024, three (8) copies of the BRIEF OF PETITIONER\nin the above-captioned case were served, as required by U.S. Supreme Court Rule 29.5(\u00a2, on the\nfollowing:\n\nJESSICA CHRISTY CONNER\n\nDEAN, RINGERS, MORGAN & LAWTON, P.A.\n\n201 E.

Or a \nuniversity that pays a pension to former employees, but \nnot if they\u2019re Jewish. Such blatant discrimination is \nunquestionably actionable under Title VII of the Civil \nRights Act of 1964. No court would entertain the notion \nthat former employees are barred from challenging these \nodious policies solely because they no longer hold their \njobs. To the contrary, this Court has unanimously held \nthat Title VII\u2019s protections extend to former employees. \nRobinson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337 (1997).  \nThe Americans with Disabilities Act is no different. \nCongress explicitly modeled the ADA on Title VII. It \nconferred Title VII\u2019s full \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d on ADA plaintiffs, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a), and \nestablished comprehensive \u201ccivil rights protections for \npersons with disabilities that are parallel to\u201d Title VII. \nH.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 3, at 48 (1990).  \nIn this case, the Eleventh Circuit upended Congress\u2019s \ndesign by holding that a retired firefighter disabled in the \nline of duty may be subjected to discrimination with \nimpunity. That holding is fundamentally mistaken in two \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal. \n \nFirst, the court misread what the ADA, as amended \nby the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, says about who may \nsue, what they may sue over, and when they may sue.  \nThe ADA\u2019s enforcement provision tells us who may \nsue: \u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of [the Act].\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThat does not exclude retirees.  \n\n- 2 - \n \nThe statute also tells us what retirees may sue over: \nthe ADA, like Title VII, bans discrimination in \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and \u201cterms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment\u201d\u2014words this Court has long read to include \npost-employment benefits over which retirees may sue. \nHishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 (1984).  \nAnd, most importantly, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay \nAct clarifies when discrimination occurs and when a \nplaintiff may sue: when a benefits policy is \u201cadopted,\u201d or \nwhen the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject to\u201d it, or when the \nplaintiff \u201cis affected by\u201d it. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThe ADA thus prohibits discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in the provision of a benefit earned during a \nplaintiff\u2019s employment\u2014even if the plaintiff does not \nreceive that benefit until she is no longer employed. \nTogether, these provisions\u2014who, what, when\u2014make \nclear that the Eleventh Circuit was wrong to preclude the \npetitioner here from invoking the ADA\u2019s protections. The \nallegedly discriminatory policy at issue was adopted in \n2003, while Lt. Karyn Stanley was still employed and able \nto perform her job as a firefighter and was therefore \nindisputably what the statute calls a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nThus, even if she needed to be employed when the alleged \ndiscrimination occurred\u2014as the court below erroneously \nconcluded\u2014she was, and her suit may proceed. \nSecond, the Eleventh Circuit erred in holding that \nretirees are not \u201cqualified individuals\u201d under the ADA. \nA \u201cqualified individual means an individual who, with \nor without reasonable accommodation, can perform the \nessential functions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2111(8). The court \nof appeals read this to mean that one must \u201chold or desire\u201d \na job. But that isn\u2019t what the statute says and, at the very \n\n- 3 - \n \nleast, isn\u2019t a reading demanded by the statute\u2019s words or \nsyntax. To see why, try some examples:   \n\u2022 \u201cA \u2018cleared passenger\u2019 means a passenger who can \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the luggage that \nsuch passenger carries or checks. Only \u2018cleared \npassengers\u2019 may board the aircraft.\u201d Can you get \non the plane if you don\u2019t have any bags?  \n\u2022 \u201cYou must silence your cell phone to visit the \nlibrary.\u201d May you visit if you didn\u2019t bring a phone?  \n\u2022 \u201cTo live in this apartment building, you must be \nable to clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d If you \ndon\u2019t own a pet, may you live in the building? \nIn each case, we naturally understand this language to \nmean that certain requirements apply conditionally\u2014only \nif the relevant condition (carrying luggage, bringing a \nphone, owning pets) is met does it trigger an obligation \n(screen bags, silence your phone, clean up). In the pets \nexample, \u201cthat you own\u201d tells us which pets\u2014the ones you \nown. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition works the same \nway: It requires you to be able to perform the functions of \na job only to the extent that you \u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d one. \nBut nothing in the text requires that you currently \n\u201chold\u201d or \u201cdesire\u201d a job. It would be eccentric to read the \npets rule to mean: \u201cYou must own a pet.\u201d But that\u2019s akin \nto what the court did here. It rewrote the statute to impose \ntwo requirements rather than one: you (a) must hold or \ndesire a job and (b) must be able to perform its functions. \nThis redrafting transforms how the statute works. The \nADA prohibits discrimination \u201cagainst a qualified \nindividual on the basis of disability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2019s role in the statutory \nscheme is to make clear that employers don\u2019t violate that \n\n- 4 - \n \nrule when they make necessary job-related decisions\u2014\ninsisting that a lifeguard be able to swim, for example. The \ndefinition is not there, however, to arbitrarily exclude \nentire categories of people from the Act\u2019s protection.  \nTo be sure, we concede that syntax alone doesn\u2019t \nanswer the question, and that Congress could have been \nclearer. But \u201cin its legal context,\u201d Pulsifer v. United \nStates, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024), the definition is best read \nto require that, to the extent that an individual holds a job, \nthey must be able to perform its essential functions. That \nreading aligns with common usage, grammar, and logic, as \nwell as the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose. It \nharmonizes the ADA with Title VII, as Congress \nintended. It avoids unnecessary surplusage. And it avoids \nthe absurd result of leaving retirees unprotected against \neven the most egregious discrimination in the distribution \nof valuable benefits that they earned during their careers.  \nThe consequences of the contrary reading are starkly \nillustrated here. Lt. Stanley served as a firefighter for \nnearly two decades, risking life and limb to protect her \ncommunity. The benefits she seeks to protect were earned \nthrough years of dedicated, dangerous service. Yet under \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s rule, she loses protections that \nwould have safeguarded those benefits\u2014at the moment \nthe protections matter most. This perverse outcome would \npull the rug out from under firefighters, police officers, \nteachers, and others who become disabled through years \nof service to their communities and country.  \nCongress never enacted this arbitrary regime, which \nmakes outright discrimination unlawful up until an \nemployee\u2019s last day of work\u2014and then perfectly lawful \nthe moment she clocks out for the last time. This Court \nshould reverse. \n\n- 5 - \n \nOPINIONS BELOW  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 83 F.4th \n1333 and reproduced at App. 1. The district court\u2019s order \nis unreported but is available at 2021 WL 6333059 and \nreproduced at App. 20. \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nThe Eleventh Circuit entered judgment on October 11, \n2023. A petition was timely filed on March 8, 2024, and the \nCourt granted certiorari on June 24, 2024. \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED  \nThe relevant provisions of the ADA are reproduced in \na statutory appendix to this brief.  \nSTATEMENT  \nA. \nStatutory background  \n\u201cCongress enacted the ADA in 1990 to remedy \nwidespread discrimination against disabled individuals.\u201d \nPGA Tour, Inc. v. Martin, 532 U.S. 661, 674 (2001). \nCongress found that, \u201chistorically, society has tended to \nisolate and segregate individuals with disabilities,\u201d and \n\u201cdespite some improvements,\u201d that discrimination \n\u201ccontinue[d] to be a serious and pervasive social problem.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(a)(2). It \u201cpersist[ed] in such critical \nareas as employment,\u201d \u201caccess to public services,\u201d and \n\u201cpublic accommodations,\u201d among others. Id. \u00a7 12101(a)(3). \nIn view of those findings, the ADA provides \u201ca clear \nand comprehensive national mandate for the elimination \nof discrimination against individuals with disabilities\u201d with \n\u201cclear, \nstrong, \nconsistent, \nenforceable \nstandards \naddressing discrimination.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12101(b)(1)\u2013(2). And \n\u201c[t]o effectuate its sweeping purpose, the ADA forbids \ndiscrimination against disabled individuals in major areas \n\n- 6 - \n \nof public life,\u201d including, in Title I, employment. Martin, \n532 U.S. at 675. \n1. Title I\u2019s discrimination provision. In keeping with \nthe ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate\u201d and \u201ccomprehensive\u201d \napproach, Martin, 532 U.S. at 675, Title I establishes an \nexpansive approach to what constitutes disability \ndiscrimination in employment. \na. The general rule. Section 12112 sets out a \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d governing discrimination: \u201c[N]o covered entity shall \ndiscriminate against a qualified individual on the basis of \ndisability in regard to job application procedures, the \nhiring, advancement, or discharge of employees, employee \ncompensation, job training, and other terms, conditions, \nand privileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). This \nreaches discrimination from before employment begins \n(\u201capplication procedures\u201d and \u201chiring\u201d) through in-role \nperformance \n(\u201cadvancement\u201d) \nto \ntermination \n(\u201cdischarge\u201d) and all the way through to post-employment \nbenefits that \u201caccrue\u201d after \u201ca person\u2019s employment is \ncompleted.\u201d Hishon v. King & Spalding, 467 U.S. 69, 77 \n(1984) (interpreting Title VII). As this Court put it when \ninterpreting identical language in Title VII, \u201c[t]here is no \nquestion\u201d that this prohibition extends to cover \n\u201cretirement benefits.\u201d Ariz. Governing Comm. for Tax \nDeferred Annuity & Deferred Comp. Plans v. Norris, 463 \nU.S. 1073, 1081 (1983) (Marshall, J., joined by Brennan, \nWhite, Stevens, and O\u2019Connor, JJ.). The upshot of this \ncomprehensive list of the \u201cincidents of employment\u201d is \nthat, if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship,\u201d the ADA shields it from discrimination. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 75. \nb. The construction provision. Title I couples the \nreach of its \u201cgeneral rule\u201d with a flexible \u201c[c]onstruction\u201d \nprovision that explains what \u201c\u2018discriminate against a \n\n- 7 - \n \nqualified individual on the basis of disability [in the \ngeneral rule] includes.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b). That \nprovision makes clear that, like all anti-discrimination \nstatutes, Title I prohibits animus-based disparate \ntreatment. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(1). It also reaches \npolicies that have a disparate impact on people with \ndisabilities, specifically singling out \u201cstandards, criteria, \nor methods of administration that have the effect of \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(3)(A), and \u201cstandards\u201d that \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 a class of individuals with disabilities,\u201d id. \u00a7 \n12112(b)(6). \nBut, unlike most other anti-discrimination statutes, \nthe ADA doesn\u2019t equate \u201cdiscriminate\u201d with an equal-\ntreatment mandate. Instead, it at times requires \n\u201cpreferential[]\u201d treatment to \u201cachieve [its] basic equal \nopportunity goal.\u201d US Airways, Inc. v. Barnett, 535 U.S. \n391, 397 (2002). The \u201cconstruction\u201d provision accomplishes \nthis by defining \u201cdiscriminate\u201d to include the failure to \nprovide a \u201creasonable accommodation.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). This affirmative mandate can demand \nsignificant changes: \u201cjob restructuring,\u201d \u201cmodified work \nschedules,\u201d \n\u201creassignment,\u201d \nthe \nmodification \nof \nequipment and \u201cfacilities\u201d to make them \u201creadily \naccessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities,\u201d \nand \u201cother similar accommodations.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(9). \nc. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition. While the \nsweep of the discrimination provision demonstrates the \nADA\u2019s \nplan \nto \naggressively \nroot \nout \ndisability \ndiscrimination in employment, Congress also sought to \nensure that Title I would not \u201cdemand action beyond the \nrealm of the reasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. A \nnumber of its provisions thus balance the Act\u2019s ambitions \nagainst employers\u2019 legitimate interests: The Act requires \n\n- 8 - \n \nonly \u201creasonable\u201d accommodations and carves out \naccommodations that impose \u201cundue hardship\u201d on \nemployers, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), and it \nprovides a \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense against disparate-\nimpact discrimination stemming from \u201cstandards, tests, \nor selection criteria,\u201d id. \u00a7 12113(a). \nChief among these provisions is the general rule\u2019s \nprohibition \nof \ndiscrimination \nagainst \n\u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d A \u201cqualified individual\u201d is defined as \u201can \nindividual \nwho, \nwith \nor \nwithout \nreasonable \naccommodation, can perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12111(8). The role of this definition\u2014and its \nplacement in the general rule\u2014is to \u201creaffirm\u201d that Title \nI \u201cdoes not undermine an employer\u2019s ability to choose and \nmaintain qualified workers.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, \nat 55 (1990). An employer, for instance, may refuse to hire \nsomeone whose disability prevents them (even with the \nbenefit of an accommodation) from \u201clift[ing] fifty pounds\u201d \nif doing so is necessary for performing the job. H.R. Rep. \nNo. 101-485, at 56. Title I thus allows employers cabined \nauthority to act on the basis of disability; they may do so \nonly to ensure that the people they hire can perform the \ncore, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue\u2014a limited \nrole that the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nunderscores by requiring deference to the \u201cemployer\u2019s \njudgment as to what functions of a job are essential,\u201d but \nnothing more. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). \n2. Title I\u2019s enforcement provision. To vindicate its \nsubstantive prohibition on disability-based discrimination, \nTitle I adopted what was, by the time the ADA became \nlaw, a proven remedial mechanism. Section 12117, entitled \n\u201cEnforcement,\u201d provides that the \u201cpowers, remedies, and \nprocedures\u201d available under Title VII may be invoked by \n\n- 9 - \n \n\u201cany person alleging discrimination on the basis of \ndisability in violation of\u201d Title I. Id. \u00a7 12117(a). Even \nbefore the ADA was enacted, retirees had used those \nremedies and procedures to enforce their rights under \nTitle VII with respect to post-employment benefits. See, \ne.g., Florida v. Long, 487 U.S. 223, 225 (1988); Norris, 463 \nU.S. at 1074; City of Los Angeles, Dep\u2019t of Water & Power \nv. Manhart, 435 U.S. 702, 704 (1978).  \n3. The Fair Pay Act. Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanism has since been expanded through the Lilly \nLedbetter Fair Pay Act. See Pub. L. No. 111-2, \u00a7 3, \n123 Stat. 5 (2009). That Act clarifies that an unlawful \nemployment practice \u201coccurs\u201d\u2014and thus restarts the \ntime to sue\u2014when:  \n(1) the \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision or \nother practice is adopted,\u201d  \n(2) the person is \u201csubject to a discriminatory \ncompensation decision,\u201d or  \n(3) \u201cwhen an individual is affected by application of \na discriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid.\u201d  \nId. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis \nmeans \nthat \n\u201cevery \ndiscriminatory paycheck or other compensation resulting, \nin whole or in part, from an earlier discriminatory pay \ndecision or other practice\u201d is another occurrence for which \na person can seek redress. See H.R Rep. No. 110-237, at 3 \n(2007). \nB. \nFactual background \nIn 1999, after serving in the military, Karyn Stanley \nbegan her career as a firefighter for the City of Sanford, \nFlorida. Pet. App. 2a. In 2005, she was promoted to Fire \n\n- 10 - \n \nLieutenant. All told, Lt. Stanley served the City for almost \ntwo decades as a firefighter. Doc. 1 at 3.  \nWhen the City offered her the job, her employment \npackage included a \u201chealth insurance subsidy.\u201d Pet. App. \n3a. This benefit covered most of the cost of participating \nin the City\u2019s health-insurance plan. Id.; Doc. 1 at 5. So \nalthough Lt. Stanley\u2019s monthly health-insurance premium \nunder the City\u2019s health plan was approximately $1,300, the \nCity\u2019s subsidy covered $1,000 of that cost, requiring her to \npay only $300. The City told her that this benefit applied \nboth to current employees and to qualifying retirees until \nthey reached age sixty-five. Doc. 38-15 at 11. A retiree was \neligible regardless of whether she \u201cretire[d] with twenty-\nfive (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for disability \nreasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a.  \nThis health-insurance subsidy was an especially \nimportant benefit for firefighters like Lt. Stanley because \nthey have one of the \u201chighest rates of injuries and illnesses \nof all occupations.\u201d Bureau of Lab. Stats., Occupational \nOutlook Handbook, Firefighters, https://perma.cc/F8CP-\nUJL8. Indeed, for many critical public-service jobs that \ncome with lower salaries, post-employment benefits are a \nmajor draw for potential employees, representing an \nimportant part of the compensation for which they \nundertake (and stay in) their roles as police officers, \nfirefighters, or other first responders. See Bureau of Lab. \nStats., Employee Benefits, https://perma.cc/PLP6-7GHL. \nIn 2003, unbeknownst to Lt. Stanley, the City quietly \nchanged its subsidy policy to distinguish between \n\u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d retirees. Doc. 1 at 12. The new \npolicy changed the benefits eligibility for \u201call employees \nretiring as a result of full disability\u201d so that it would run \nonly \u201cuntil the disabled retiree receives Medicare benefits \n\n- 11 - \n \nor until 24 months have elapsed from the date of \nretirement, whichever comes first.\u201d Pet. App. 22a; Doc. \n38-11 at 4. By contrast, \u201cnormal retirees\u201d remained \neligible until age sixty-five. Doc. 39-16 at 13. So if a \nfirefighter is injured in the line of duty or develops a \ncareer-ending illness one year before she completes her \ntwenty-five years of service, the subsidy lasts for only \ntwenty-four months. \nThe City claimed that the new policy was a necessary \n\u201ccost cutting measure[].\u201d Doc. 38 at 7. But it never offered \nany justification for cutting costs associated with disabled \nemployees alone. The City\u2019s HR director had no \nexplanation, Doc. 39-4 at 10, 13\u201314, and it was unable to \nidentify any \u201cdata, mathematical calculations, [or] \ncorrespondence \u2026 upon which [it] based its decision\u201d to \nrescind benefits from disabled retirees and not \u201cnormal \nretirees.\u201d Doc. 39-16 at 5, 40. Indeed, city employees could \nnot even point to any \u201cfinancial estimates\u201d of \u201cthe cost of \ncontinuing the disability retirees[\u2019] [subsidy] longer than \n24 months\u201d before enacting the policy. Doc. 39-9 at 46. \nWhatever the reason for the change, the new policy \ndecimated Lt. Stanley\u2019s promised retirement benefits \nbecause her career as a firefighter was cut short by \nParkinson\u2019s disease. After nearly twenty years of service, \nLt. Stanley began to develop \u201cstiffness [and] rigidity \u2026 as \nwell as [a] loss of dexterity in her extremities.\u201d Doc. 38-4 \nat 3. In 2016, she was officially diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s. Pet. App. 2a. For a longtime firefighter like \nLt. Stanley, that diagnosis was tragic but not surprising. \nSome states have adopted a legal presumption that \nfirefighters who develop Parkinson\u2019s did so in the line of \nduty based on the frequency with which the disease afflicts \n\n- 12 - \n \nfirefighters. See N.Y. Gen. Mun. Law \u00a7 207-kkk (Consol.); \nInd. Code Ann. \u00a7 5-10-15-5.5.  \nFor two years after her diagnosis, Lt. Stanley \ncontinued to work as a lieutenant. Pet. App. 2a. But \neventually it became clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s disability was \npreventing her from meeting the physical demands of her \njob. Pet. App. 2a. In 2018, at the age of forty-seven, Lt. \nStanley took disability retirement with the City\u2019s \nagreement. Pet. App. 2a. \nAt that point, Lt. Stanley expected the employer she \nhad served for almost twenty years to stand by the \nbargain that it had struck with her when she was hired. \nThe City had explained her original benefits package \nwhen she first joined, and it had never told her about any \nchange in policy. Doc. 38-15 at 9. She had never received \nan updated human resources manual explaining that she \nwould no longer receive the retirement benefits she was \nexpecting. Doc. 38-15 at 9, 11. But just twenty-four months \nafter she retired, the City discontinued Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nhealth-insurance \nsubsidy, \nleaving \nher \nfinancially \nresponsible for all of her health insurance. Pet. App. 3a.  \nFor the past few years, Lt. Stanley has paid out of \npocket for the entire cost of the City\u2019s health-insurance \npolicy, which she relies on for her Parkinson\u2019s treatment. \nDoc 39-9 at 23; Doc. 38-15 at 11, 21. The cost to Lt. Stanley \nof covering the $1,000 monthly subsidy until she is sixty-\nfive\u2014if she is even able to do so\u2014would be more than \n$150,000. Doc. 1 at 6\u20137. Due to the high cost of the City\u2019s \nhealth-insurance premium without the subsidy, no other \ndisabled retirees have been able to stay on the City\u2019s \ninsurance after the loss of the subsidy. Doc. 39-9 at 25; see \nDoc. 39-16 at 3\u20134. Non-disabled retirees, however, \n\n- 13 - \n \ntypically remain on the City\u2019s health insurance until they \nbecome eligible for Medicare. Doc. 39-4 at 69. \nC. Procedural background \nLt. Stanley filed this lawsuit alleging that the City\u2019s \npolicy violated the ADA. Pet. App. 24a. The district court \ndismissed Lt. Stanley\u2019s Title I claim. The court found itself \nbound by circuit precedent holding that a \u201cdisabled \nformer employee\u201d like Lt. Stanley has \u201cno standing to \nsue\u201d over post-employment benefits under Title I because \nshe is \u201cno longer\u201d a qualified individual. Pet. App. 24a. \nThe Eleventh Circuit affirmed. It held that Lt. \nStanley, as a former employee, could not sue about \ndiscrimination in her benefits under the ADA because she \nwas not a \u201cqualified individual\u201d at the time that the City \nterminated her subsidy payments in 2020. Pet. App. 11a\u2013\n12a. The court emphasized that section 12111(8) defines \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d using the \u201cpresent tense\u201d words \n\u201c[c]an,\u201d \u201cholds,\u201d and \u201cdesires.\u201d Pet. App. 11a. Thus, it \nheld, a plaintiff \u201cmust desire or already have a job with the \ndefendant at the time the defendant commits the \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Id. And since Lt. Stanley was a \n\u201cretiree, not [an] employee,\u201d in 2020, she was not a \n\u201cqualified individual.\u201d Pet. App. 16a. \nThe panel further concluded that Lt. Stanley was not \na \u201cqualified individual\u201d at any other discrete moment in \nwhich discrimination could have occurred. Pet. App. 16a\u2013\n17a. The court announced that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcede[d]\u201d \nthat the City\u2019s change of the policy in 2003 could not \namount to actionable discrimination. Pet. App. 16a. And it \n\u201cagree[d]\u201d with Lt. Stanley\u2019s (alleged) concession that her \nclaim could not turn on the 2003 policy change because she \nwas \u201cnot yet disabled at that time.\u201d Id. Nor, the court \nreasoned, could Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim turn on the City\u2019s \n\n- 14 - \n \nactions in the period after she was diagnosed with \nParkinson\u2019s but before she retired because she (allegedly \nalso) \u201cconceded that \u2026 she was [not] impacted\u201d until after \nshe retired. Pet. App. 18a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The ADA permits former employees to sue over \npost-employment benefits.  \nThe who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision allows suit \nby \u201cany person alleging discrimination\u201d in violation of the \nAct who \u201cclaim[s] to be aggrieved.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12117(a), \n2000e-5(f)(1). This language doesn\u2019t limit suits to \n\u201cemployees,\u201d \u201capplicants,\u201d or \u201cqualified individuals.\u201d  \nThe what: The ADA targets discrimination not just in \nhiring \nand \nfiring \nbut \nalso \nin \n\u201cemployee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). By the time the \nADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \ninterpreted Title VII\u2019s parallel language as protecting \nretirement benefits.  \nThe when: The Fair Pay Act further clarifies that \nretirees may bring suit under the ADA when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). \nThis allows a plaintiff to challenge a decision to adopt a \ndiscriminatory benefits policy each time that she is \nadversely affected, even after her employment ends. So \neven if Ms. Stanley didn\u2019t feel the effects of the City\u2019s \npolicy until she retired, these provisions together make \nclear that her claim may proceed.  \nII. The court of appeals independently erred in holding \nthat the ADA protects only those who \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d \na job. Nothing in the ADA\u2019s text requires that result, \n\n- 15 - \n \nwhich would leave retirees unprotected against even the \nmost egregious discrimination. \nThe ADA doesn\u2019t require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a qualified individual. The definition \nasks if an individual \u201ccan perform the essential functions \nof the employment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d In other words, it tests if you can do a job, not if \nyou have or want one.  \nThis makes sense given the definition\u2019s role in the \nstatutory scheme: It affords employers necessary, but \ncircumscribed, flexibility to restrict employment on the \nbasis of disability to preserve the functioning of a \nbusiness. It allows employers to screen out people who \ncan\u2019t perform core job functions, not to implement \ndiscriminatory policies unrelated to job performance.  \nThis understanding avoids treating key statutory \nterms \nas \nsurplusage. \nThe \nADA\u2019s \nreasonable-\naccommodation provision applies to a \u201cqualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). This tells us that the \nAct contemplates at least some qualified individuals who \nare neither applicants nor employees\u2014a category that \nwould not exist under the court of appeals\u2019 reading. \nCommon usage, grammar, and logic all show that the \ntext doesn\u2019t demand the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nConsider this rule: \u201cAn individual may not watch the \nmovie unless the individual silences the electronic devices \nthat such individual carries.\u201d If you come to the theater \nwithout a device, can you stay? Of course. The rule \nrequires patrons to turn off their devices only to the extent \nthat they have them. The \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \nworks the same way: It requires individuals to be able to \nperform essential job functions only to the extent they \nhold or desire jobs with such functions.  \n\n- 16 - \n \nEven granting that the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition \ncould be read in a vacuum to support the Eleventh \nCircuit\u2019s view, ours is the better reading in the context of \nthe statute as a whole. Treating retirees as \u201cqualified \nindividuals\u201d allows the definition to fulfill its role in \nscreening out those who can\u2019t perform job functions, \nwithout turning it into an arbitrary license to discriminate. \nIt avoids rendering key language superfluous. It gives \nforce to the ADA\u2019s protections for retirement benefits. \nAnd it maintains congruity between the ADA and Title \nVII. In short, it is the reading that is far \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of\u201d the Act and the \u201cprimary \npurpose\u201d of the definition. Robinson v. Shell Oil Co., \n519 U.S. 337, 346 (1997).  \nARGUMENT \n \nBy allowing employers to discriminate against \ndisabled retirees with impunity\u2014in ways that would never \nbe tolerated for race, religion, sex, or national origin\u2014the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s decision frustrates Congress\u2019s plan for \na \u201ccomprehensive national mandate for the elimination of \ndiscrimination against individuals with disabilities.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101(b)(1). The decision is flawed in two key \nrespects, each of which independently warrants reversal:  \n \nFirst, it fundamentally misunderstands the ADA\u2019s \ntext and structure. The ADA allows \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d to sue, including retirees who are later \n\u201caffected by the application of\u201d discriminatory policies \nthat were \u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. That \ndescription fits the allegations in this case to a T.  \n \nSecond, it misreads the ADA\u2019s \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition as excluding retirees from the Act\u2019s protection. \nThe text doesn\u2019t compel that reading, and an \u201cinquiry into \ntext and context\u201d makes the statute\u2019s contrary meaning \n\n- 17 - \n \nclear. Pulsifer v. United States, 601 U.S. 124, 141 (2024). \nReading the ADA to protect retirees makes sense of the \nscheme as a whole, harmonizes Title VII and the ADA, \navoids turning key provisions into surplusage, and escapes \nan outcome that puts the statute \u201cat war with itself.\u201d Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 472 (2023). \nI. \nThe ADA permits former employees to bring suit \nwith respect to post-employment benefits. \nThe ADA permits retirees to sue over their benefits. \nThis conclusion follows from the ADA\u2019s enforcement \nprovision, its coverage of post-employment benefits, and \nthe Fair Pay Act\u2019s clarification of when plaintiffs may sue \nover benefits. Together they make clear that Lt. Stanley\u2019s \nsuit, which challenges a policy \u201cadopted\u201d while she was \nemployed, and to which she was \u201csubjected\u201d while \nworking for the City, may proceed. This Court therefore \nneed not even reach the court of appeals\u2019 erroneous \nholding that the Act only prohibits discrimination against \npeople who currently \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a job.  \nA. The who: The ADA\u2019s enforcement provision \nallows suit by \u201cany person alleging \ndiscrimination\u201d in violation of the Act. \nTo enforce the ADA\u2019s \u201cbroad mandate,\u201d Martin, \n532 U.S. at 674\u201375, section 12117, titled \u201cEnforcement,\u201d \nprovides \u201cto any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of\u201d Title I the full range of \nremedies provided for in Title VII. 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12117(a). \nNoticeably absent from this authority to sue is a \nrequirement that the plaintiff be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d \nInstead, \u201cany person\u201d who alleges a discriminatory act in \nviolation of the statute can invoke Title VII\u2019s remedial \nframework. And that framework contains no relevant \nlimitation either: It allows any \u201cperson claiming to be \n\n- 18 - \n \naggrieved\u201d to bring a \u201ccivil action.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(f)(1).  \nDespite its breadth, Title VII\u2019s remedial provision \ndoes have its limits: Only plaintiffs who assert an \u201cinterest \narguably sought to be protected by the statute\u201d may \ninvoke these remedies. Thompson v. N. Am. Stainless, \nLP, 562 U.S. 170, 177\u201378 (2011). But this \u201czone-of-\ninterests\u201d test is \u201cnot meant to be especially demanding.\u201d \nMatch-E-Be-Nash-She-Wish \nBand \nof \nPottawatomi \nIndians v. Patchak, 567 U.S. 209, 224\u201325 (2012). It bars a \nplaintiff only if her asserted \u201cinterests are so marginally \nrelated to or inconsistent with the purposes implicit in the \nstatute that it cannot reasonably be assumed that \nCongress intended to permit the suit.\u201d Thompson, 562 \nU.S. at 178; see also, e.g., Bank of Am. Corp. v. City of \nMiami, 581 U.S. 189, 200 (2017) (holding that Miami could \nsue under the Fair Housing Act for financial injury \nincurred from discriminatory lending practices). Which is \nto say, this textual limitation cuts off only suits that are far \nafield from the statute\u2019s purposes\u2014for example, a \n\u201cshareholder\u201d suit against a corporation over its \u201cfiring \n[of] a valuable employee for racially discriminatory \nreasons.\u201d Thompson, 562 U.S. at 177. \nAssuming that the same zone-of-interest test applies, \nretirees in Lt. Stanley\u2019s shoes satisfy it. The ADA\u2019s \n\u201ccomprehensive\u201d mandate to \u201celiminat[e]\u201d discrimination, \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12101(b)(1), \naims \nnot \njust \nat \nthe \n\u201cpersist[ence]\u201d of discrimination in \u201cjobs,\u201d but also in the \ndistribution of \u201cbenefits,\u201d id. \u00a7 12101(a)(5). So there could \nbe no doubt that retirees\u2019 claims would fall within the Act\u2019s \nzone of interests. See Lexmark Int\u2019l, Inc. v. Static Control \nComponents, Inc., 572 U.S. 118, 131 (2014) (explaining \nthat, when a statute contains a \u201cdetailed statement of [its] \n\n- 19 - \n \npurposes,\u201d no \u201cguesswork\u201d is required to determine the \nzone of interests). It\u2019s hard to imagine anyone better \nsituated to bring this claim\u2014over her benefits stemming \nfrom her job\u2014than Lt. Stanley. \nB. The what: The ADA protects against \ndiscrimination with respect to post-\nemployment benefits. \nThe ADA\u2019s substantive prohibitions\u2014the what\u2014also \nreach claims from retirees. The ADA specifically guards \nagainst discrimination in post-employment benefits. It \ntargets not just discrimination in hiring and firing but also \nforbids \u201cdiscriminat[ing] against a qualified individual on \nthe basis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee \ncompensation \u2026 and \nother \nterms, \nconditions, \nand \nprivileges of employment.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). By the \ntime the ADA was enacted in 1990, this Court had already \nmade clear that Title VII\u2019s parallel language protected \npost-employment benefits. See, e.g., Hishon, 467 U.S. at \n77; Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081.   \nThat\u2019s because \u201c[a] benefit need not accrue before a \nperson\u2019s employment is completed\u201d to be protected. \nHishon, 467 U.S. at 77. What matters, instead, is that the \nbenefit is \u201cpart and parcel of the employment \nrelationship\u201d; if it is, it may not be \u201cdoled out in a \ndiscriminatory fashion.\u201d Id. at 75. That common-sense \nconclusion means that \u201c[t]here is no question\u201d that \n\u201cretirement benefits\u201d are protected. Norris, 463 U.S. at \n1079; see also Hishon, 467 U.S. at 77. In the twenty-five \nyears between Title VII\u2019s passage and the ADA\u2019s passage, \nthis Court repeatedly entertained Title VII claims about \npost-employment benefits. See Long, 487 U.S. at 225; \nNorris, 463 U.S. at 1074; Manhart, 435 U.S. at 705.  \n\n- 20 - \n \nWhen the ADA adopted Title VII\u2019s terminology, it \ncarried forward this settled meaning. \u201c[T]he enactment of \na new provision that mirrors the existing statutory text \nindicates \u2026 that the new provision has that same \nmeaning.\u201d Lightfoot v. Cendant Mortg. Corp., 580 U.S. 82, \n95 (2017). And the ADA\u2019s protection of post-employment \nbenefits is confirmed by other sections. For example, the \nADA prohibits employers from contracting with an \n\u201corganization providing fringe benefits\u201d in a way that \u201chas \nthe effect\u201d of discriminating on the basis of disability. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(2). \u201c[F]ringe benefits\u201d has a well-\naccepted meaning, and it encompasses post-employment \nbenefits. Howard Delivery Serv., Inc. v. Zurich Am. Ins. \nCo., 547 U.S. 651, 654 (2006); see also 135 Cong. Rec. \nS10712 (daily ed. Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Sen. Harkin) \n(describing the hope that covered individuals would \u201clive \n[their] retirement years in dignity\u201d); Oversight Hearing \non H.R. 4498 before a Subcomm. of H. Comm. Educ. & \nLabor, 100th Cong. 2d Sess. 54 (1988) (describing the \nADA\u2019s focus on protecting disabled Americans\u2019 \u201cbenefits \nfor \u2026 health and retirement\u201d). \nAdd that all together, and it is clear that a retiree in \nLt. Stanley\u2019s position has a right to sue. Whether or not \nsuch a retiree is a \u201cqualified individual\u201d when they \nexperience the effects of the discrimination, they are a \ndisabled employee claiming that their employer applied a \ndiscriminatory policy (which the ADA prohibits) to strip \nthem of their benefits (which the ADA protects).  \nIn fact, a benefits policy that facially discriminates \nagainst people with disabilities\u2014everyone in the company \nreceives a pension, except for people with disabilities\u2014\nnecessarily runs afoul of the ADA. It obviously \n\u201cdiscriminate[s] \u2026 on the basis of disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\n- 21 - \n \n\u00a7 12112(a). And it does so with regard to \u201ccompensation,\u201d \nid., which is paid to people in exchange for their \n\u201cperform[ance of] the essential functions\u201d of an \n\u201cemployment position,\u201d id. \u00a7 12111(8).  \nIn other words, in understanding what the statute \nprotects, the \u201cqualified individual\u201d language is largely \nbeside the point in a case of this kind. As a general \nproposition, employers only pay \u201ccompensation\u201d to \n\u201cqualified individuals\u201d who \u201ccan perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that\u201d they \u201chold[] or \ndesire[].\u201d Id. And we know from preexisting usage that \nsuch \u201ccompensation\u201d includes benefits employees receive \nafter retirement. So when employers discriminate \u201cin \nregard to \u2026 compensation,\u201d they necessarily do so \n\u201cagainst a qualified individual.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(a). And as the \nnext section explains, it is proper for an employee (or \nformer employee) to sue whenever such a discriminatory \ncompensation policy affects them\u2014including when they \nreceive their benefits only after retiring. \nC. The when: The Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act \nand Title I\u2019s enforcement provision taken \ntogether mean that retirees can sue over post-\nemployment benefits. \nIt is clear, then, that retirees are among the \u201cany \nperson[s]\u201d \u201cclaiming to be aggrieved\u201d who can invoke \nTitle I\u2019s enforcement mechanism. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5. So \ntoo is it clear that their retirement benefits are \n\u201ccompensation\u201d protected by the Act. Id. \u00a7 12112(a). The \nLilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009, which Title I \nincorporates, brings Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim across the finish \nline: It allows retirees to bring suit when they are \n\u201caffected by application of\u201d discriminatory benefits plans \n\u201cadopted\u201d while they were working. Id. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \n\n- 22 - \n \n1. Before the Fair Pay Act, those seeking to challenge \ndiscriminatory \npolicies \naffecting \npost-employment \nbenefits faced a challenge: Like Lt. Stanley, they may not \nhave learned about their discriminatory benefits policies \nuntil they were affected after retiring. That could be years \nafter the policies were adopted. Because such a claim \ncould have been characterized as merely seeking redress \nfor the \u201cadverse effects resulting from the past \ndiscrimination,\u201d it could well have been barred by the \nstatute of limitations. Ledbetter v. Goodyear Tire & \nRubber Co., 550 U.S. 618, 628 (2007). \nThe Fair Pay Act resolved this dilemma. It provides \nthat an unlawful employment practice occurs with respect \nto discrimination in compensation: \n[1] when a discriminatory compensation decision \nor other practice is adopted, [2] when an individual \nbecomes subject to a discriminatory compensation \ndecision or other practice, or [3] when an \nindividual is affected by application of a \ndiscriminatory compensation decision or other \npractice, including each time wages, benefits, or \nother compensation is paid, resulting in whole or \nin part from such a decision or other practice. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). This provision applies to the \nADA through its incorporation of Title VII\u2019s enforcement \nmechanisms. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12117(a). \nThe Fair Pay Act thus makes clear that a claim under \nthe ADA is timely if the plaintiff sues when she \u201cbecomes \nsubject to\u201d or \u201cis affected by\u201d discrimination that occurred \nduring her tenure. This is true even if the plaintiff doesn\u2019t \nreceive the benefit in question until after her employment \nhas concluded. As a result, the Act permits a plaintiff to \nchallenge an employer\u2019s earlier decision to adopt a \n\n- 23 - \n \ndiscriminatory benefits policy when she is adversely \naffected, either by receiving a reduced benefit or by being \ndenied the benefit entirely. \nCrucially, the Fair Pay Act allows a plaintiff\u2019s claim to \naccrue or re-accrue even after the plaintiff\u2019s employment \nhas concluded. As long as the plaintiff \u201cbecomes subject \nto\u201d or \u201cis affected by application of\u201d the employer\u2019s earlier \ndiscriminatory decision after leaving her job, the \nemployer\u2019s liability will accrue or re-accrue then. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A), (B). The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s view \nthat a former employee is no longer a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d because she neither \u201cholds\u201d nor \u201cdesires\u201d a job \nhas no bearing on this analysis. 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The \nFair Pay Act doesn\u2019t treat each discrete payment (or \nnonpayment) as a new discriminatory act that must \nindependently satisfy all of the ADA\u2019s elements. Rather, \nit allows a claim to accrue based on the past discriminatory \ndecision when the plaintiff is affected by that decision. \nThe Fair Pay Act eliminates any doubt about a \npotential mismatch between Congress\u2019s intent to broadly \nprohibit disability-based discrimination in retirement \nbenefits and the ADA\u2019s text. It ensures that plaintiffs can \ntimely enforce the settled rule that \u201cclassification of \nemployees on the basis of [disability] is no more \npermissible at the pay-out stage of a retirement plan than \nat the pay-in stage.\u201d Norris, 463 U.S. at 1081. And it \nreinforces what the ADA\u2019s text, structure, and purpose \nalready make clear: Former employees are protected \nfrom discrimination as to post-employment benefits.  \n2. When Lt. Stanley began her career as a firefighter, \nthe City promised to continue paying her health-insurance \nsubsidy until the age of 65 so long as she \u201cretire[d] with \ntwenty-five (25) years of service\u201d or \u201cretire[d] for \n\n- 24 - \n \ndisability reasons.\u201d Doc. 38-6 at 2; Pet. App. 21a. That \nretirement subsidy was, without a doubt, part of her \n\u201ccompensation\u201d and thus protected by Title I. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112; see supra 19\u201321. Four years later, and while Lt. \nStanley was still working as a firefighter, the City changed \nits policy to distinguish between \u201cdisabled\u201d and \u201cnormal\u201d \nretirees. Doc. 1 at 12; see also Doc. 39-16 at 27\u201328. The \nlatter were still eligible for the full retirement benefit, but \nthe former would now receive only two years of the health \ncare subsidy (or less, if they qualified for Medicare \nbenefits). Pet. App. 22a. \nLt. Stanley was, of course, employed by the City in \n2003 when this \u201cdiscriminatory compensation decision\u201d \nthat she challenges was \u201cadopted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-\n5(e)(3)(A). Thus, even if Lt. Stanley did need to hold or \ndesire a job when the City discriminated against her (but \nsee infra Part II), she did. The City \u201cadopted,\u201d id., its \npolicy in 2003 when Lt. Stanley indisputably was a \nqualified individual, and that policy discriminated \u201con the \nbasis of disability in regard to \u2026 employee compensation\u201d \n(her benefits), id. \u00a7 12112(a). Lt. Stanley\u2019s claim then re-\naccrued in 2020 when she was \u201caffected by application of\u201d \nthe policy (she was denied the health care subsidy). Id. \n\u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A). That means that she could bring this \nlawsuit exactly when she did to challenge exactly what she \nchallenged.   \nThe Eleventh Circuit rejected this reasoning by \nannouncing that Lt. Stanley \u201cconcedes, and we agree, that \nher claim cannot turn on the 2003 amendment to the \nbenefits plan because she was not yet disabled at that \ntime.\u201d App. 16. Nothing supports the assertion that Lt. \nStanley made that concession. To the contrary, Lt. \nStanley repeatedly argued the opposite, insisting that the \n\n- 25 - \n \nadoption \nof \nthe \npolicy \ndid \nconstitute \nunlawful \ndiscrimination against her. See, e.g., Doc. 1 at 4 \n(allegations in complaint addressing 2003 change); Op. Br. \nat viii\u2013ix (expressly adopting similar argument made in \nthe United States\u2019 amicus brief); Reply Br. at 6 (\u201cIn this \ncase, \nthe \nCity\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nenact \nthe \nfacially \ndiscriminatory 24-Month Rule in 2003 is the initial \n\u2018challenged employment decision.\u2019 \u2026 Thus, [Lt.] Stanley \nwas a \u2018Qualified Individual\u2019 able to perform her firefighter \nduties at the time of the \u2018challenged employment \ndecision.\u2019\u201d) (emphasis omitted); Oral Arg. 4:59\u20135:05 (\u201cAt \nthe time of the discriminatory act in 2003 she was a \nqualified individual.\u201d).  \nTo the extent the Eleventh Circuit held that the 2003 \npolicy change could not be actionable discrimination \nbecause Lt. Stanley \u201cwas not yet disabled at that time,\u201d it \nmisapplied the statute. App. 16. A person need not be \ndisabled to be subjected to unlawful discrimination under \nTitle I. The statute was specifically amended to avoid that \noutcome: It broadly prohibits discrimination \u201con the basis \nof disability\u201d rather than, as it had previously provided, \nonly against a qualified individual \u201cwith a disability.\u201d \nCompare 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a), with Pub. L. No. 101-336, \nTitle I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990). Here, the City acted \u201con \nthe basis of disability\u201d when it adopted a policy that, on its \nface, limits the amount of time that a person receives a \nsubsidy based on whether that person has a disability. See \nUAW v. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 200 (1991) \n(\u201c[A]n explicit gender-based policy is sex discrimination \nunder\u201d Title VII).  \nIt is of no matter, then, that Lt. Stanley was not yet \ndisabled when the City changed its policy. Even if that was \n(somehow) relevant, it was inevitable that the facially \n\n- 26 - \n \ndiscriminatory policy would harm employees when they \nbecame disabled and had to retire before twenty-five \nyears of service. The Court may thus conceive of this claim \nas encompassing two moments of time that complete the \nwhole: when the facially discriminatory policy was \nadopted in 2003, and when Lt. Stanley became disabled. \nThis Court has recognized that certain Title VII claims \ncan encompass events occurring at different points in time \nas the basis for an action challenging a \u201csingle \ndiscriminatory act.\u201d Green v. Brennan, 578 U.S. 547, 562 \nn.7 (2016). By analogy, the same holds true here.  \nThe Fair Pay Act also demonstrates that the City \ndiscriminated against Lt. Stanley again when that same \ndiscriminatory policy was applied to her as she neared her \ninevitable early retirement. At that point, although she did \nnot yet feel the effects of the policy, Lt. Stanley became \n\u201csubject to\u201d it, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A); the policy \nconclusively determined what benefits she would receive \nonce her fast-approaching forced retirement began and, in \nthat way, removed her access to the more expansive \nbenefits package available to people without disabilities. \nSee Castellano v. City of New York, 142 F.3d 58, 68 (2d \nCir. 1998) (\u201c[A]n employee\u2019s entitlement to post-\nemployment fringe benefits arises \u2026 during his period of \nemployment.\u201d). That too is an \u201cunlawful employment \npractice\u201d \nthat \n\u201coccur[ed]\u201d \nduring \nLt. \nStanley\u2019s \nemployment. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).1  \n \n1 The third way in which an unlawful employment practice \noccurs\u2014the individual becoming \u201caffected\u201d by the discriminatory \ndecision\u2014remains relevant here because it removes any doubt that \nLt. Stanley\u2019s claim is timely. She was \u201caffected\u201d when her subsidy \nended.  \n\n- 27 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit declined to address that alleged \ndiscrimination too, because Lt. Stanley \u201caffirmatively \nconceded\u201d that she was not \u201cimpacted by [the City\u2019s \npolicy] during her employment.\u201d App. 18. But that Lt. \nStanley was not yet \u201cimpacted\u201d (in terms of receiving a \ndecreased health care subsidy) in no way undermines her \nclaim. That\u2019s what the Fair Pay Act makes clear: A person \ncan be discriminated against when a \u201cdecision\u201d or \n\u201cpractice\u201d is \u201cadopted,\u201d or when they \u201cbecome[] subject \nto\u201d it, even if they are not \u201caffected by\u201d it until later. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e-5(e)(3)(A).  \nII. The ADA does not require a person to \u201chold[] or \ndesire[]\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified individual.\u201d  \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s holding was wrong for \nanother, independent reason: One does not need to \ncurrently \u201chold[] or desire\u201d a job to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d under the ADA. The court below reached its \nholding by focusing on the definition of discrimination in \nsection 12112(a) and of \u201cqualified individual\u201d in section \n12111(8). Based on those provisions, it held that it is legal \nfor employers to discriminate against former employees \non the basis of disability.  \nNothing in the statute\u2019s text demands that surprising \nresult. The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s error is explained by its \nmisunderstanding \nof \nthe \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d In the court\u2019s view, because section 12112(a) \nprohibits discrimination against \u201cqualified individuals\u201d \nand the definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d speaks in the \npresent tense\u2014referring to a person who \u201ccan perform\u201d a \njob that the person \u201cholds\u201d or \u201cdesires\u201d\u2014the ADA \nprohibits discrimination only against a person while they \nhold (or are applying to) a job. App. 11.  \n\n- 28 - \n \nBut the court of appeals effectively rewrote the \nstatutory definition to impose two distinct requirements: \n\u201cQualified individual means an individual who (a) holds or \ndesires an employment position and (b) can perform the \nessential functions of that employment position.\u201d The text \nonly imposes one requirement: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nmeans an individual who \u2026 can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. 12111(8). The text asks only \none question\u2014what \u201ccan\u201d you do? \nThis understanding of the definition\u2019s text makes \nperfect sense given its role in the statute: It operates to \nafford employers cabined authority to act on the basis of \ndisability when doing so is necessary to preserve the \nfunctioning of the business. That is why the term is \ndefined with reference to \u201cessential functions,\u201d not \u201cany \nfunction.\u201d Its text is best read to impose only a conditional \nmandate, which tracks that role. If a person has (or seeks) \na job, that person must be able to perform its essential \nfunctions; if no such job exists\u2014because the person is \nretired\u2014the definition does not operate as a limit on the \nADA\u2019s prohibition on discrimination. In other words, the \ndefinition asks if you \u201ccan\u201d perform the functions of a job \nthat you hold or desire, not if you have or want one.  \nA. The text of section 12111(8) and its place in \nthe statutory scheme confirm that the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition tests if you \ncan do a job, not if you have one.   \nThe definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d exists to give \nemployers the cabined ability to act on the basis of job-\nrelated concerns so that they are not forced to hire or \nretain people who are incapable, even with the benefit of \nreasonable accommodations, of performing essential \n\n- 29 - \n \ntasks. We know that is the definition\u2019s role because of its \nplain text, its place in the statutory scheme, and its \nrelationship to other sections of the statute.  \n1. Text and purpose. \u201cStart with the text.\u201d Arellano v. \nMcDonough, 598 U.S. 1, 8 (2023). The definition asks if an \nindividual \u201ccan perform the essential functions of the \nemployment position that such individual holds or \ndesires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It does \nnot ask if an individual \u201cholds or desires an employment \nposition whose essential functions she can perform.\u201d The \nlatter formulation would impose the \u201cmust hold or desire \na job\u201d requirement that the Eleventh Circuit perceived. \nThe former asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a thing, not if you are \ndoing that thing or would do it.  \nThat the definition asks what an individual \u201ccan\u201d do \nmakes sense given its role in the statutory scheme. The \ndefinition gives employers necessary, but circumscribed, \nflexibility in light of the Act\u2019s sweeping impact. Title I \nprovides protection in all aspects of the employment \nrelationship. It broadly prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion]\u201d in \n\u201cjob application procedures, the hiring, advancement, or \ndischarge of employees, employee compensation, job \ntraining, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of \nemployment.\u201d \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a). \nThat \ncovers \neverything from job applications to post-employment \nbenefits\u2014if something is \u201cpart and parcel of the \nemployment \nrelationship,\u201d \nan \nemployer \ncannot \n\u201cdiscriminate.\u201d Hishon, 467 U.S. at 75; supra at 19\u201321.  \nTitle I prohibits both \u201cdisparate treatment\u201d and \n\u201cdisparate impact.\u201d Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. \n44, 52 (2003). But it also goes further, \u201crequir[ing] \naffirmative \nconduct\u201d \nto \nensure \n\u201cthose \nwith \ndisabilities \u2026 obtain the same workplace opportunities \n\n- 30 - \n \nthat those without disabilities [] enjoy.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. \nat 397, 401; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). Accordingly, the \nAct at times requires employers not to treat people with \ndisabilities \nequally, \nbut \ninstead \nto \ntreat \nthem \n\u201cpreferentially.\u201d \nBarnett, \n535 U.S. \nat \n397. \nThat \naffirmative mandate is reflected in the Act\u2019s definition of \ndiscrimination, which \u201cincludes \u2026 not making reasonable \naccommodations to the known physical or mental \nlimitations of an otherwise qualified individual with a \ndisability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A).  \nBecause of the Act\u2019s \u201cbold ambitions\u201d and \u201cfar-\nreaching\u201d scope, though, Congress recognized the need \nfor delineated \u201climits.\u201d Kincaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. \n2414, 2415\u201316 (2023) (Alito, J., dissenting from the denial \nof certiorari). As this Court has held, the ADA achieves its \nimportant \u201cobjectives\u201d within \u201cthe realm of the \nreasonable.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 401. Without some \nqualification, the statute would prevent employers from \ndenying employment to people whose disabilities, no \nmatter the steps taken to accommodate them, prevent \nthem from performing their jobs. A swimming pool could \nface liability for refusing to hire as a lifeguard a person \nwhose disability left her unable to swim. Congress, \nunsurprisingly, did not want to prohibit that sort of \nrational, and necessary, decision-making.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition ensures that \nemployers have the necessary leeway. The only people \nwho employers must hire, retain, and accommodate are \nthose who, \u201cwith or without\u201d accommodations, \u201ccan \nperform the essential functions of the employment \nposition.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The definition, then, exists \nto allow employers to screen out people who can\u2019t perform \n\n- 31 - \n \nthe core, or \u201cessential,\u201d functions of the job at issue. What \nit does not do, however, is grant employers a license to \nimplement \ndiscriminatory \nemployment \npolicies \nor \nindividual employment actions that have nothing to do \nwith an individual\u2019s ability to do a relevant job.  \n2. Statutory scheme. This understanding of the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition\u2014as a screen that \nprevents employers from being obligated to hire and \naccommodate those who can\u2019t perform a job\u2014neatly \naligns with the rest of the statutory scheme that Congress \ndevised. Several provisions of the Act allow employers to \ntake actions that are justified in relation to the operation \nof their business. None of them invite employers to take \ndiscriminatory actions that have nothing to do with \nlegitimate business needs.  \nFor example, even when employers must provide \naccommodations, they need only be \u201creasonable,\u201d and \neven those they can forego if they \u201ccan demonstrate that \nthe accommodation would impose an undue hardship\u201d on \ntheir \u201coperation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \u201c[Q]ualification \nstandards\u201d that screen out people with disabilities are \nimpermissible, unless that standard \u201cis shown to be job-\nrelated for the position in question and is consistent with \nbusiness necessity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12112(b)(6). Other examples are \nsprinkled across the statute. See, e.g., id. \u00a7 12112(b)(7) \n(making it unlawful to administer \u201ctests concerning \nemployment\u201d unless those tests measure a person\u2019s \naptitude and skills rather than merely reflecting any \nimpairments); \nid. \n\u00a7 \n12112(d)(2) \n(prohibiting \npre-\nemployment \nmedical \nexaminations \nbut \npermitting \n\u201cinquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform job-\nrelated functions\u201d).  \n\n- 32 - \n \nEach of these provisions reflects a balance struck in \nthe Act: Discrimination is prohibited\u2014from application \nthrough retirement\u2014but employers have leeway to act on \nthe basis of disability where a sufficiently weighty and \nlegitimate business need calls for it. The \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d definition does just that\u2014nothing more, \nnothing less. It is not concerned with whether you have a \njob; it is concerned with employers\u2019 needs in relation to \ntheir current and future employees. Reading it to allow \ndiscrimination against former employees, by contrast \nmakes it do work in the statute that it simply is not doing. \n3. Surplusage. The court of appeals\u2019 reading also turns \nkey provisions of the Act into surplusage. It is a \u201c\u2018cardinal \nprincipal\u2019 of interpretation that courts must give effect, if \npossible, to every clause and word of a statute.\u201d Parker \nDrilling Mgmt. Servs., Ltd. v. Newton, 587 U.S. 601, 602 \n(2019). Accordingly, the canon against surplusage \ninstructs that a statute should be construed \u201cso that no \npart will be inoperative or superfluous, void or \ninsignificant.\u201d Rubin v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 583 U.S. \n202, 213 (2018). \nThe ADA\u2019s definition of discrimination, section \n12112(b)(5)(A), states that discrimination \u201cincludes \u2026 not \nmaking reasonable accommodations to the known physical \nor mental limitations of an otherwise qualified individual \nwith a disability who is an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added).  \nThis language tells us that the Act contemplates the \nexistence of some qualified individuals who are neither \n\u201capplicant[s] [n]or employee[s].\u201d If the court of appeals \nwas right that the qualified individual definition already \nscreens out individuals who do not \u201chold[] or desire[]\u201d a \njob, then this modifier\u2014\u201cwho is an applicant or employee\u201d \n\n- 33 - \n \n\u2014would be surplusage. And an interpretation that \n\u201ctreat[s]\u201d those \u201cstatutory terms as surplusage,\u201d \nparticularly when they\u2019re found in such a \u201cpivotal [] place \nin the statutory scheme\u201d (the reasonable-accommodation \nprovision), should give us pause. Duncan v. Walker, \n533 U.S. 167, 174 (2001). \u201cThe canon against surplusage is \nstrongest \nwhen \nan \ninterpretation \nwould \nrender \nsuperfluous another part of the same statutory scheme.\u201d \nCity of Chicago v. Fulton, 592 U.S. 154, 159 (2021).   \nThat there are \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d not covered by \nsection 12112\u2019s reasonable-accommodation mandate is \nconfirmed by the other way its reach is narrowed. \nEmployers need only make reasonable accommodations \nfor \u201cqualified individual[s] with a disability.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (emphasis added). To be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d though, you need not have a disability. The \nADA was specifically amended to extend the \u201cgeneral\u201d \nantidiscrimination mandate not only to discrimination \nagainst persons \u201cwith a disability,\u201d but to more broadly \nreach discrimination \u201con the basis of disability.\u201d Compare \nPub. L. No. 101-336, Title I, \u00a7 102, 104 Stat. 331 (1990), \nwith 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(a). Because there are \u201cqualified \nindividual[s]\u201d who are not disabled, as well as those who \nno longer hold or desire a job, then, the reasonable-\naccommodation provision makes perfect sense. That \nsection recognizes the breadth of who can be a \u201cqualified \nindividual,\u201d and then subtracts from its mandate the need \nto accommodate any \u201cqualified individual\u201d who is not a \nperson \u201cwith a disability\u201d and who is not \u201can applicant or \nemployee,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A)\u2014because only \ndisabled individuals engaged in (or seeking) active \nemployment actually need \u201caccommodations.\u201d   \n\n- 34 - \n \nSection 12112 thus demonstrates that, when Congress \nintended to limit the reach of a substantive protection to \napplicants and employees, it did so explicitly. \nB. Common usage, grammar, and logic all \ndemonstrate that the text does not compel \nreading \u201cqualified individual\u201d to exclude \nretirees. \nNothing in the text of the definition of \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d demands reading it to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. The Eleventh \nCircuit concluded otherwise, reasoning that, because of \nthe definition, the \u201cplain language\u201d of the anti-\ndiscrimination rule \u201cexpressly applie[s] only to \u2018qualified \nindividuals with a disability\u2019 who \u2018hold[]\u2019 or \u2018desire[]\u2019 an \n\u2018employment position.\u2019\u201d App. 7. But that reading seemed \nplain only because the court of appeals misunderstood a \nkey part of the definition: \nThe \nterm \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \nmeans \nan \nindividual who, with or without reasonable \naccommodation, \ncan \nperform \nthe \nessential \nfunctions of the employment position that such \nindividual holds or desires. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). It is the \u201ccan \nperform\u201d clause that makes the definition carry out its \nimportant role in the statute. See supra 29\u201331. That\u2019s how \nit tests an employee\u2019s capabilities. And retirees are not \nunable to pass this test\u2014that is, they\u2019re not unable to \nperform the essential functions of a job that they hold or \ndesire. \nTo be sure, testing the job capabilities of someone who \nis no longer working may seem logically awkward. But \nthat doesn\u2019t mean that retirees fail the test; it instead \n\n- 35 - \n \nhighlights the conditional nature of the requirement. And, \nas we explain below, common sense, common usage, and \nlogic all suggest that the best reading (or at least an \nequally plausible one) is that retirees are \u201cqualified \nindividuals.\u201d But even if one thought that the test was \nambiguous when applied to retirees, that still would \nrequire rejecting the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading, which is \n\u201c[in]consistent with the broader context\u201d of Title I \u201cand \nthe primary purpose of\u201d the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition. Robinson, 519 U.S. at 849; see id. (holding that \n\u201cthe term \u2018employees,\u2019 as used in \u00a7 704(a) of Title VII\u201d \ncovers \u201cformer employees\u201d despite the text being \n\u201cambiguous\u201d because that reading is \u201cmore consistent \nwith the broader context of Title VII and the primary \npurpose of \u00a7 704(a)\u201d). \n1. Common usage. Title I defines a \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d as \u201can individual who, with or without \nreasonable accommodation, can perform the essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8). The Eleventh \nCircuit mistakenly read that definition to require that an \nindividual currently hold or desire a job. But that is not \nthe only (or best) way to read the definition. A few parallel \nexamples demonstrate how an ordinary reader interprets \na sentence like this one.  \n\u201cYou can\u2019t watch the movie unless you silence your cell \nphone.\u201d If you come to the theater without a phone, do you \nviolate this rule? Surely no. That\u2019s because this rule \nrequires that patrons turn off their phones only to the \nextent that they have phones to turn off. For the same \nreason, a person without a phone can attend court despite \na rule that says \u201c[y]ou must turn off your cell phone before \n\n- 36 - \n \nentering the courtroom.\u201d2 The rules\u2014and their respective \npurposes\u2014are satisfied. \u201c[C]ommon sense,\u201d Pereira v. \nSessions, 585 U.S. 198, 211 (2018), tells us how to read \nthese rules. See Bond v. United States, 572 U.S. 844, 857 \n(2014) (\u201cThe notion that some things \u2018go without saying\u2019 \napplies to legislation just as it does to everyday life.\u201d). \nConsider another example. NASA gives an award each \nyear to the \u201camateur astronomer\u201d who \u201cdiscovered the \nintrinsically brightest near-Earth asteroid\u201d in the \nprevious year. 51 U.S.C. \u00a7 30902(c)(3)(A). As defined by \nthe statute, \u201camateur astronomer means an individual \nwhose employer does not provide any funding, payment, \nor compensation to the individual for the observation of \nasteroids and other celestial bodies.\u201d Id. \u00a7 30902(b)(1). Is \nan unemployed person with a home telescope eligible to \nwin that prize? Of course. What this rule obviously means \nin context is that, if you have an employer and if that \nemployer pays for your stargazing, you can\u2019t be an \n\u201camateur astronomer.\u201d Unemployed people don\u2019t fail that \ntest; they easily pass it.  \nOr try this one: \u201cA passenger may not board an \naircraft unless it is determined that the passenger is a \n\u2018cleared individual.\u2019\u201d \u201cA \u2018cleared individual\u2019 means an \nindividual who can successfully complete an x-ray \nscreening of the baggage that such individual carries or \nchecks.\u201d Does this hypothetical rule prohibit passengers \nwith no bags from boarding a plane? Obviously not. This \nrule doesn\u2019t require that a passenger have a carry-on or \nchecked bag; it requires the screening of any bag to the \nextent that a passenger has such luggage.  \n \n2 Thomas F. Eagleton U.S. Courthouse Self-Guided Tour, \nhttps://perma.cc/2BVB-2K4P. \n\n- 37 - \n \nIndeed, an actual TSA regulation provides that \u201c[n]o \nindividual may \u2026 board an aircraft without submitting to \nthe screening and inspection of\u201d her \u201caccessible \nproperty[.]\u201d 49 C.F.R. \u00a7 1540.107(a). This regulation \nobviously doesn\u2019t require that a passenger carry any \n\u201caccessible property,\u201d only that she submit to the \nscreening of that property to the extent she has any.  \nAnother federal statute requires the government to \npay individuals for the \u201ccost of a comparable replacement \ndwelling\u201d when a federal project displaces them. \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 4623(a)(1)(A). Whether something qualifies as \na \n\u201ccomparable \nreplacement \ndwelling\u201d \nrequires \nconsidering how far away it is from the displaced person\u2019s \noriginal home \u201cwith respect to public utilities, facilities, \nservices, and \nthe \ndisplaced \nperson\u2019s \nplace \nof \nemployment.\u201d Id. \u00a7 4601(10) (emphasis added). The lack \nof a \u201cplace of employment\u201d can\u2019t possibly bar retirees \nfrom financial support.  \nNotably, Title II of the ADA has a similar textual \nfeature. That section forbids discrimination in public \n\u201cservices, programs, or activities.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132. Like \nTitle I, it makes use of \u201cqualified individual\u201d language: \n\u201c[N]o qualified individual with a disability shall, by reason \nof such disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d Id. And its definition of \u201cqualified individual\u201d \nhas a similar structure to Title I\u2019s: \u201c[Q]ualified individual \nwith a disability means an individual with a disability who, \nwith or without reasonable modifications to rules, policies, \nor \npractices \u2026 meets \nthe \nessential \neligibility \nrequirements for the receipt of services or the \n\n- 38 - \n \nparticipation in programs or activities provided by a public \nentity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 12131(2) (emphasis added). \nNow consider a \u201crecreational\u201d program covered by the \nAct, United States v. Georgia, 546 U.S. 151, 157 (2006) \n(discussing \ndefinition \nof \n\u201cservices, \nprograms, \nor \nactivities\u201d), like the Washington & Old Dominion trail, \nwhich has no \u201cessential eligibility requirements\u201d for \n\u201cparticipation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2). The trail is open to \neveryone free of charge. Except that it has one rule: \u201cNo \npeople in wheelchairs.\u201d That blatant exclusion certainly \nviolates Title II. The fact that the trail has no \u201cessential \neligibility requirements\u201d does not mean the excluded \nperson with a disability ceases to be a \u201cqualified \nindividual.\u201d Instead, Title II is naturally read to say that, \nto \nthe \nextent \nthere \nare \n\u201cessential \neligibility \nrequirements,\u201d an individual must meet them. \nAlthough rules written this way can sometimes read \nawkwardly when their implicit condition fails, courts \nroutinely figure out how to interpret them. Take the \nfederal \ncompassionate-release \nstatute. \nThat \nlaw \nauthorizes a court to \u201cmodify a term of imprisonment\u201d \nwhen, among other things, the \u201creduction is consistent \nwith applicable policy statements issued by the \nSentencing Commission.\u201d 18 U.S.C. \u00a7 3582(c)(1)(A). In \nthe period after Congress passed the First Step Act, but \nbefore the Sentencing Commission revised its policy \nstatement, \nthe \n\u201coverwhelming \nmajority \nof \ncircuits \u2026 agreed that\u201d the only potentially relevant \npolicy statement was not \u201capplicable.\u201d 3 Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Fed. Prac. & Proc. Crim. \n\u00a7 638.2 (5th ed. 2024). But courts didn\u2019t get hung up on \nwhether modifying a term of imprisonment was or wasn\u2019t \n\u201cconsistent\u201d \nwith \na \nnon-existent \nset \nof \n\u201cpolicy \n\n- 39 - \n \nstatements.\u201d Instead, they (sensibly) read the text to \nmean that a sentence reduction must be consistent with \nthe applicable policy statements to the extent there are \nany. Id. at nn. 23\u201324 (explaining that eight of nine circuits \nwho considered the question took this view, with the \nEleventh Circuit as the lone \u201coutlier\u201d). \nAs the compassionate-release cases demonstrate, \n\u201ccourts can \u2026 find implied conditionality as a function of \na statute\u2019s syntax\u201d and \u201cthe nature of written language.\u201d \nEric S. Fish, Severability As Conditionality, 64 Emory \nL.J. 1293, 1337\u201339 (2015); Michael McCarthy & Ronald \nCarter, \nCambridge \nGrammar \nof \nEnglish: \nA \nComprehensive Guide 755\u201356 (2006) (explaining that \n\u201c[c]onditions can be conveyed without any overt \nconditional subordinator\u201d and that \u201cconditions can be \nexpressed\u201d with \u201cthe omission of conjunctions such as if\u201d); \nsee, e.g., Boesche v. Udall, 373 U.S. 472, 479 (1963) (in a \ncase where there was \u201cno lease to cancel,\u201d declining to \nread a provision on lease cancellation\u2014which \u201csp[oke] \nentirely in terms of post-lease occurrences\u201d and \n\u201cassume[d] the existence of a valid lease\u201d\u2014to render the \nAct as a whole \u201cself-defeating\u201d).3 \nIn each example above, the rule presumes that some \npredicate condition exists (you have an employer, luggage, \n \n3 The proposition that some sentences are implicitly conditional is \nunextraordinary. \u201cWhen a command is conditional, its condition may \nbe either overt or explicit on the one hand (\u2018When it rains, close the \nwindows!!\u2019) or tacit or implicit on the other (\u2018Drive carefully!\u2019 [means] \n\u2018When you drive, drive carefully!!\u2019).\u201d Nicholas Rescher, The Logic of \nCommands 24 (1966); see also Chi-H\u00e9 Elder, Context, Cognition, and \nConditionals 2 (2019) (\u201c[W]hile conditional sentences in English are \noften associated with the canonical form \u2018if p, q,\u2019 we also know that \nneither the use of \u2018if\u2019 nor a two-clause structure is essential for \nexpressing a conditional thought.\u201d). \n\n- 40 - \n \nor a phone; the program has eligibility requirements), and \nyour compliance with the rule is determined in relation to \nthat predicate. But as each example makes clear, the \nabsence of the thing presumed doesn\u2019t mean that you \nnecessarily violate the rule. Instead, it will often mean (as \nit does in each one of those examples) that the rule is \neffectively satisfied or that its requirement controls only \nto the extent that the predicate condition actually exists.  \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition in Title I can \neasily be read like each of those examples. The rule tests \nwhether an individual is sufficiently qualified for a job. See \nsupra 29\u201331. Where there is no job and there are no \n\u201cessential functions,\u201d the test is satisfied. And because its \napplication to retirees has no relationship to its textual \nfunction in the statute, common sense says it should not \nbe applied to bar claims by retirees who no longer \n\u201chold[]or desire[]\u201d an \u201cemployment position.\u201d See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2379 (2023) (Barrett, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cContext also includes common sense.\u201d); The \nFederalist No. 83, at 559 (Alexander Hamilton) (\u201cThe \nrules of legal interpretation are rules of common sense.\u201d). \n2. Grammar. The grammatical structure of the \ndefinition\u2014and the role of the \u201cholds or desires\u201d clause in \nthe sentence in particular\u2014further demonstrates that the \ntext does not compel the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s reading. \nBecause \u201c[w]ords are to be given the meaning that proper \ngrammar and usage would assign them,\u201d Antonin Scalia & \nBryan A. Garner, Reading Law: The Interpretation of \nLegal Texts 140 (2012), the \u201crules of grammar govern\u201d \nstatutory \ninterpretation \n\u201cunless \nthey \ncontradict \nlegislative intent or purpose,\u201d id. (citing Costello v. INS, \n376 U.S. 120, 122\u2013126 (1964)). \n\n- 41 - \n \nConsider this rule at an apartment complex: \u201cYou \nmust clean up after the pets that you own.\u201d Here, \u201cthat \nyou own\u201d tells us which pets we\u2019re talking about: the ones \nyou own, if you own any. It doesn\u2019t mean that you must \nown a pet, or that all pets are owned by you, or that you \nhave to clean up after other people\u2019s pets. The rule is \ntelling us that, if you own a pet, you\u2019ve got to clean up after \nit. Similarly, in the ADA\u2019s definition, the clause \u201cthat such \nindividual holds or desires\u201d modifies \u201cemployment \nposition.\u201d See Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003) \n(\u201c[A] limiting clause or phrase \u2026 should ordinarily be \nread as modifying only the noun or phrase that it \nimmediately follows.\u201d). It is introduced by the pronoun \n\u201cthat,\u201d which sets up what grammarians call a \u201crestrictive \nclause.\u201d Bryan A. Garner, Modern English Usage 1086\u2013\n87 (5th ed. 2022). This clause simply tells us which \nposition\u2019s functions matter, see id.\u2014here, \u201cthe essential \nfunctions of the employment position that such individual \nholds or desires.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12111(8) (emphasis added). \nThe restrictive clause thus does not create a \nfreestanding temporal requirement that an individual \nmust currently hold a job. See Heredia v. Sessions, 865 \nF.3d 60, 69 (2d Cir. 2017) (explaining that \u201ca restrictive \nclause\u201d that modifies a noun in an immigration statute \n\u201cdoes not impose a separate temporal requirement\u201d). \nRather, \nit \nspecifies \nwhich \njob\u2019s \nfunctions \nare \nrelevant if the individual either holds or desires a job.  \nThe court of appeals, however, misread this clause. It \ntreated \u201cholds or desires\u201d as though it imposed a separate \nrequirement, rather than simply identifying the relevant \njob. This misreading assumes that a clause doing one thing \n(specifying which job matters) is instead doing something \nelse entirely (requiring current or future employment). \n\n- 42 - \n \nThe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s emphasis on the present tense-\nverbs thus reflects a basic misunderstanding of the \nrestrictive clause\u2019s grammatical function.  \n \n3. Logic. Reading the \u201cqualified individual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees like Lt. Stanley not only \nreflects common sense and common usage but is also \nsound as a matter of basic logic: Lt. Stanley satisfies the \n\u201cqualified individual\u201d definition because she is not unable \nto perform the essential functions of any job that she \ncurrently holds or desires. The definition doesn\u2019t require \nher to be able to perform her former job; it only asks about \nher ability to perform the functions of a job that she now \n\u201cholds or desires,\u201d which is none.  \nThis simple conclusion\u2014that can perform is logically \nequivalent to not unable to perform\u2014follows from a basic \nprinciple of \u201cclassical logic.\u201d Bethel v. Jefferson, 589 F.2d \n631, 639 n.49 (D.C. Cir. 1978) (reasoning that a plaintiff \nwho wasn\u2019t in a \u201cunit\u201d of government \u201cin the competitive \nservice\u201d necessarily fell under a Title VII provision \ngoverning everyone else). It \u201cholds simply that every \nalternation of a sentence with its negation is true.\u201d Id. \n(quoting Willard Van Orman Quine, Philosophy of Logic \n15, 83\u201387 (1970)).4 \n \n4 This law of double negation comes from the \u201claw of the excluded \nmiddle,\u201d one of Aristotle\u2019s three laws of thought. Irving Copi, \nIntroduction to Logic 372\u201373 (1994). An explanation goes like this: \u201cIf \nyou have a proposition P, either P is true, or P is false; that is, either \nP is true or non-P is true. We cannot have a third possibility. As a \nconsequence of the excluded middle, we have the principle of double \nnegation: Negation of negation is equivalent to affirmation.\u201d Alain \nBadiou, The Three Negations, 29 Cardozo L. Rev. 1877, 1878 (2008).  \n\n- 43 - \n \nC. Reading \u201cqualified individual\u201d in context to \ninclude retirees is consistent with the \nstatutory scheme and avoids creating \nsurplusage and absurd consequences.  \nAs everything above demonstrates, the court of \nappeals\u2019 reading of the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition is \ncertainly not compelled by the text. But reading the \ndefinition to include retirees isn\u2019t necessarily compelled \nby the text alone, either. The only way to answer the \nquestion is with some context. Indeed, \u201cinterpretation \nalways depends on context.\u201d Scalia & Garner, Reading \nLaw at 63; see Graham Cnty. Soil & Water Conservation \nDist. v. United States ex rel. Wilson, 545 U.S. 409, 415 \n(2005) (\u201cStatutory language has meaning only in \ncontext.\u201d). Ours is the only reading that makes sense of \nthe statutory scheme as a whole.  \n1. The text must be read in context, not in isolation. \nWe concede that some implicitly conditional rules that \nread like the \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might be \nnaturally read in context as excluding those who can\u2019t \nsatisfy the condition. Others, however, go the other way. \nConsider these two airport security rules: \n(A) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must \ncomplete an x-ray screening of the baggage that \nsuch individual carries.\u201d Can you get through with \nno bags? \n(B) \u201cTo get through security, a passenger must scan \nthe boarding pass that such individual carries.\u201d Can \nyou get through with no boarding pass?  \nThe syntax is the same. But our inclination is probably \nto say yes to the first question, and no to the second. If you \ndon\u2019t have a boarding pass, you likely won\u2019t get through. \n\n- 44 - \n \nYet we somehow know that the person without bags is in \nthe clear. A gadfly passenger might point out that rule (B) \nliterally only requires scanning a pass \u201cthat such \nindividual carries.\u201d That hyperliteralism likely won\u2019t \npersuade the security officers. But he\u2019d have a point\u2014 the \nrule surely could have been written more clearly to \nexpress that you must have a boarding pass: \u201cNo \nindividual may go through security without a boarding \npass.\u201d \nAs with the airport rules, Congress could have written \nthe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition to more obviously \ninclude, or exclude, retirees. You might think that \nCongress could have clarified that retirees are covered by \nusing the word \u201cany.\u201d But referring to \u201cany employment \nposition that such individual \u2026 desires\u201d would have been \nawkward and confusing. The point of the restrictive clause \nis to tell us which position a job seeker must qualify for (a \nparticular position), not to suggest any position she might \nwant. So \u201cwe can see why a Congress,\u201d with our reading \nin mind, \u201cmight have chosen\u201d against \u201cany,\u201d despite its \nsurface appeal. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 138. The indefinite \narticle \u201can\u201d might have been clearer; but it too would have \ncarried a similar risk of confusion, which may explain why \nthe drafters used \u201cthe.\u201d (They were focused on tying \nqualifications to \u201cthe\u201d position at issue.)  \nEven if Congress had used \u201cany\u201d or \u201can,\u201d though, the \nCity would presumably still be here with the same \narguments. So it\u2019s not clear that even this would have \n\u201cdelivered us from interpretive controversy\u201d and ended \nthe \u201cgrammatical back-and-forth.\u201d Id. On the other hand, \nit would have been easy to clearly exclude retirees: \u201cA \nqualified individual means an individual who holds or \n\n- 45 - \n \ndesires an employment position and who can perform the \nessential functions of that position.\u201d  \nIn any event, conceding that Congress could have \ndrafted the definition more clearly to include retirees \ndoesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s not the right reading. See Gardner \nv. Collins, 27 U.S. 58, 86\u201387 (1829) (Story, J.) (holding that, \nalthough \u201cthe words \u2018if any there be\u2019 [were] omitted\u201d from \none version of the same statute, \u201cthe legislative intention \nin both acts was the same\u201d). This Court does not \u201cdemand \n(or in truth expect) that Congress draft in the most \ntranslucent way possible.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 137.   \u201cThe \nquestion, then, is not: Could Congress have indicated\u201d its \nintent to protect retirees \u201cin more crystalline fashion\u201d? \nTorres v. Lynch, 578 U.S. 452, 472\u201373 (2016). \u201cThe \nquestion is instead, and more simply: Is that the right and \nfair reading of the statute\u201d that Congress actually \nwrote? Id. at 473.   \nUltimately, there\u2019s no single \u201cgrammatical principle\u201d \nthat conclusively answers that question. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. \nat 137. Instead, what each of the examples shows is that \ndeciding whether a rule like this one includes or excludes \nretirees requires considering its \u201ccontent\u201d and \u201ccontext.\u201d \nId. at 138 n.5. \u201c[S]tated in the usual language of statutory \nconstruction, the answer [] lie[s] in considering the \n[definition\u2019s] text in its legal context.\u201d Id. at 141.  \n2. The statutory context makes clear that retirees \nare protected by the ADA.  \nReading the \u201ctext\u201d in \u201ccontext\u201d is how we know that \nretirees are \u201cqualified individual[s].\u201d Id. The definition\u2019s \ntext asks if you \u201ccan\u201d do a job. It asks that question \nbecause the provision\u2019s role is to screen out from the Act\u2019s \nprotections those who can\u2019t perform essential functions of \na job, and whose inclusion would therefore impede the \n\n- 46 - \n \nemployer\u2019s legitimate business prerogatives. See supra \n29\u201331. There\u2019s no \u201cplausible, or even cogent, explanation\u201d \nfor why a definition with this function would exclude \nretirees, who are not asked to perform any essential \nfunctions at all. Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 148 n.7; see Scalia & \nGarner, Reading Law at 20 (explaining that an \u201cessential \nelement of context that gives meaning to words\u201d is the \n\u201cevident purpose of what a text seeks to achieve\u201d).  \nInterpreting \nthe \ndefinition \nto \ninclude \nformer \nemployees also avoids creating \u201csuperfluity.\u201d Pulsifer, \n601 U.S. at 142. On the court of appeals\u2019 reading, there\u2019s \nno role for the language limiting the reasonable-\naccommodation mandate to a \u201cqualified individual \u2026 who \nis an applicant or employee.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A). \nBy contrast, interpreting \u201cqualified individual\u201d to include \nretirees means that there is no surplusage; this, too, is \nrelevant \u201clegal context.\u201d Pulsifer, 601 U.S. at 141. \nThere\u2019s more. Recognizing that the definition does not \nexclude retirees gives force to the various provisions of the \nAct that protect retirees: Its inclusion of retirement \nbenefits as part and parcel of \u201ccompensation,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12112(a), and its express allowance for a particular kind \n(but not the kind alleged in this case) of decision-making, \n\u201cbased on underwriting risks, classifying risks, [and] \nadministering such risks,\u201d when \u201cestablishing\u201d or \n\u201cadministering\u201d \u201cbenefit[s] plans,\u201d id. \u00a7 12201(c)(2).  \nThis reading also maintains congruity between the \nADA and Title VII, the statute on which much of Title I \nwas \u201cmodeled.\u201d Barnett, 535 U.S. at 420 (Souter, J., \ndissenting). As this Court made clear in Robinson v. Shell \nOil Co., many of Title VII\u2019s protections apply with full \nforce to \u201cformer employees.\u201d 519 U.S. at 342.  \n\n- 47 - \n \nFinally, \ninterpreting \nthe \n\u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d \ndefinition to include retirees avoids the absurd results that \nthe Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation invites. The court of \nappeals\u2019 view means that employers are free to do the day \nafter retirement what they certainly could not do the day \nbefore. An employer motivated by nothing but raw animus \ncould lawfully strip a former employee who becomes \ndisabled after retiring of their benefits\u2014benefits that the \nstatute protects and that were earned while \u201cperform[ing] \nthe essential functions of the employment position\u201d the \nretiree held. And they could do so while openly stating \nthat the decision was based solely on their preference for \n\u201cnormal\u201d retirees over \u201cdisabled\u201d ones. See Doc. 1 at 12.  \nAn interpretation that allows that result\u2014which the \nEleventh Circuit\u2019s does\u2014would \u201cnegate [the ADA\u2019s] own \nstated purposes.\u201d New York State Dep\u2019t of Soc. Servs. v. \nDublino, 413 U.S. 405, 420 (1973). Had Congress made a \ndeliberate choice to adopt that surprising and dramatic \ndeparture from the design of Title VII, it\u2019s hard to believe \nthat it would have done so through the use of present-\ntense verbs in an ambiguous restrictive clause at the end \nof a definitional provision. See Whitman v. Am. Trucking \nAss\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 468 (2001) (\u201cCongress \u2026 does not, \none might say, hide elephants in mouseholes.\u201d). \nThe \u201cqualified individual\u201d definition might, \u201cat first \nblush,\u201d then, allow the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s interpretation. \nRobinson, 519 U.S. at 341. But any confidence in that first \nimpression gives way on a closer look, and resort to the \nordinary tools of statutory construction\u2014text and \u201cthe \nbroader context of\u201d the ADA\u2014all lead to the same \nconclusion: The ADA does not allow employers to freely \ndiscriminate against their former employees.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now reached a state of maximum analytical readiness. While no new external evidence was introduced, this observation solidifies the precise analytical path required to resolve my remaining uncertainty and formulate a final prediction.\n\n*   **Analytical Blueprint Established:** My plan is no longer just a high-level intention; it is a concrete, two-step blueprint for deconstructing the Petitioner's Reply Brief. This observation formalizes the key questions that will guide my analysis:\n    1.  **The Waiver Hurdle:** The primary and most critical inquiry is the Petitioner's response to the procedural waiver argument. I have now articulated the specific legal avenues they might pursue: arguing the claim is \"like or reasonably related\" to the original EEOC charge or asserting an exception to the administrative exhaustion requirement. The strength of this rebuttal is the single most important variable, as a failure here would likely render the merits of their case moot.\n    2.  **The Textualism Merits:** The secondary inquiry focuses on the core legal question. I will specifically search the brief for counter-arguments to the Respondent's textualist reading of the ADA's present-tense verbs (\"holds or desires\"). My analysis will look for arguments that this interpretation is too narrow, contradicts the statute's purpose, or leads to absurd outcomes where employers can freely discriminate against former employees regarding benefits earned during employment.\n\n*   **Prediction Remains Suspended (but with a clear path to resolution):** My prediction remains suspended, but the conditions for its reinstatement are now explicitly defined. The outcome will be determined by a direct comparison of the arguments laid out in the briefs, guided by my analytical blueprint. The case remains at a tipping point, and my analysis of the Reply Brief, focusing on the waiver and textualism points, will provide the necessary evidence to make a confident call.\n\n*   **Information Gathering Complete:** I can now state with certainty that the information-gathering phase for the primary merits briefs is concluded. I possess the Petitioner's Brief, the Respondent's Brief, and the Petitioner's Reply Brief. The task has fully and definitively transitioned from discovery to synthesis and judgment.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful reinforcement and refinement of my strategic framework, demonstrating the critical role of structured planning *within* the analytical phase of a task.\n\n*   **The Analytical Workflow (Refined):** My previously identified workflow\u2014**Information Scarcity -> Strategic Planning (`THINK`) -> Information Acquisition -> Strategic Pause (`THINK`) -> Structured Analysis**\u2014is now more granular. This observation embodies the final step, \"Structured Analysis,\" but reveals that it is preceded by its own micro-planning phase. A new, more detailed heuristic is emerging: **Deconstruct Complex Documents with a Question-Driven Plan.** Instead of simply \"reading\" a brief, the effective strategy is to first formulate the precise questions the document must answer, prioritizing them based on their potential to be dispositive.\n\n*   **Value of Strategic Pauses (`THINK` Actions) (Strongly Reinforced):** The `THINK` action is not just a pause; it is an active tool for structuring cognition. This observation confirms its value not only for planning information acquisition but, crucially, for planning information *synthesis*. By explicitly stating my analytical questions and their priority, I am marshalling my cognitive resources efficiently and ensuring that my analysis is rigorous, targeted, and resistant to premature conclusions.\n\n*   **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Operationalized):** My belief in the importance of procedural issues is no longer just a background principle; it is now an operationalized part of my analytical plan. By deciding to analyze the waiver argument *before* the textualist merits, I am actively implementing the strategy of checking for procedural \"off-ramps\" first. This is a core principle of effective appellate legal analysis, and my internal process now explicitly reflects it.\n\n*   **Stable Heuristics:** My prior heuristics remain valid and have led directly to this point. The \"Map-Then-Navigate\" strategy and the \"Low-Score Search Inspection\" heuristic were instrumental in acquiring the complete document set, which in turn made this detailed analytical planning possible. The high value placed on the full set of merits briefs is also confirmed, as the entire analytical plan now hinges on the contents of the final Reply Brief."

City of Sanford, Florida  \n \nDear Mr. Harris:  \n \nI am counsel of record for the respondent in this case. On July 18, 2024, the Court \nextended the time to file the petitioner\u2019s brief on the merits to and including September 9, 2024, \nand the time to file respondent\u2019s brief on the merits to and including October 21, 2024. On \nSeptember 4, 2024, the Court further extended the deadlines to and including September 16, \n2024 for petitioner\u2019s brief and to and including October 28, 2024 for the respondent\u2019s brief.  \n \nHaving conferred with counsel for the petitioner, I write to respectfully request that the \nCourt extend the deadline for respondent\u2019s brief by fourteen (14) days and the deadline for the \npetitioner\u2019s reply brief, as follows: \n \nBrief for the respondent: November 11, 2024  \nReply Brief for the petitioner: December 18, 2024  \n \nThis schedule would permit this case to be heard during the Court\u2019s January sitting.  \n \nThe undersigned resides in central Florida which was recently impacted by Hurricane \nMilton. Due to delays caused by office closures and hurricane preparation and cleanup, good \ncause exists for the requested extensions. The extensions would enable counsel to make up for \n\n \nHon. Scott S. Harris \nOctober 22, 2024 \nPage 2 \n \n \n \nlost time while managing a press of other business in other courts and ensuring adequate time for \npreparation of the brief on the merits in this case.  \n \nCounsel for the petitioner has advised that he consents to this request provided that the \ndeadline for petitioner's reply is extended to December 18, 2024, as set forth above. Counsel for \nthe petitioner has advised of other intervening obligations, including an oral argument in this \nCourt on November 13 and an oral argument in the Nevada Supreme Court on December 4, and \nmultiple competing briefing deadlines, that would make it difficult to prepare the reply absent \nthe requested extension. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJessica C.

City of Sanford, Florida  \n \nDear Mr. Harris:  \n \nI am counsel of record for the respondent in this case. On July 18, 2024, the Court \nextended the time to file the petitioner\u2019s brief on the merits to and including September 9, 2024, \nand the time to file respondent\u2019s brief on the merits to and including October 21, 2024. On \nSeptember 4, 2024, the Court further extended the deadlines to and including September 16, \n2024 for petitioner\u2019s brief and to and including October 28, 2024 for the respondent\u2019s brief.  \n \nHaving conferred with counsel for the petitioner, I write to respectfully request that the \nCourt extend the deadline for respondent\u2019s brief by fourteen (14) days and the deadline for the \npetitioner\u2019s reply brief, as follows: \n \nBrief for the respondent: November 11, 2024  \nReply Brief for the petitioner: December 18, 2024  \n \nThis schedule would permit this case to be heard during the Court\u2019s January sitting.  \n \nThe undersigned resides in central Florida which was recently impacted by Hurricane \nMilton. Due to delays caused by office closures and hurricane preparation and cleanup, good \ncause exists for the requested extensions. The extensions would enable counsel to make up for \n\n \nHon. Scott S. Harris \nOctober 22, 2024 \nPage 2 \n \n \n \nlost time while managing a press of other business in other courts and ensuring adequate time for \npreparation of the brief on the merits in this case.  \n \nCounsel for the petitioner has advised that he consents to this request provided that the \ndeadline for petitioner's reply is extended to December 18, 2024, as set forth above. Counsel for \nthe petitioner has advised of other intervening obligations, including an oral argument in this \nCourt on November 13 and an oral argument in the Nevada Supreme Court on December 4, and \nmultiple competing briefing deadlines, that would make it difficult to prepare the reply absent \nthe requested extension. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nJessica C.

          "task_beliefs": "My previous belief that the information-gathering phase was complete has been proven incorrect. This observation, while failing to provide the intended evidence, has critically revealed a major gap in my possession of the primary source documents.\n\n*   **Critical Information Gap Identified:** My targeted search for the Petitioner's Reply Brief failed to return the document. Instead, it returned the Petitioner's *Opening* Brief. This reveals that, contrary to my prior belief, I do not possess the Reply Brief. This document is essential, as it contains the Petitioner's only opportunity to rebut the Respondent's arguments, particularly the potentially dispositive procedural defense of waiver/failure to exhaust administrative remedies.\n\n*   **Analytical Blueprint Stalled:** My two-step analytical plan\u2014(1) assess the waiver rebuttal, (2) assess the textualism merits\u2014is now on hold. I cannot execute the first and most critical step without the Reply Brief. The entire analytical process is stalled pending the acquisition of this missing document.\n\n*   **Uncertainty Maximized on Procedural Grounds:** The Respondent raised a waiver argument concerning the EEOC charge. The Petitioner's response to this is a threshold question that could decide the case without the Court ever reaching the merits of the ADA interpretation. Because I do not have the Reply Brief, my uncertainty on this point is now at its maximum. I have no evidence to evaluate whether the Petitioner has a strong, weak, or non-existent rebuttal to this procedural defense.\n\n*   **Prediction Remains Suspended (Path Forward Obstructed):** My prediction remains suspended, and the clear path to resolution I previously identified is now obstructed. The immediate priority has reverted from analysis back to information acquisition. The outcome of the case still hinges on the arguments in the briefs, but I am now aware that I am missing the final and crucial piece of that puzzle.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation serves as a powerful corrective, introducing a crucial new heuristic about tool reliability and the need for verification, thereby refining my entire strategic workflow.\n\n*   **The Analytical Workflow (Revised):** My workflow has been exposed as having a critical vulnerability: the assumption of tool infallibility. The `CLOSED_SEARCH` action failed to correctly apply the `field_filters` and returned the wrong document. This necessitates an explicit verification step. The refined workflow is now: **Information Scarcity -> Strategic Planning (`THINK`) -> Information Acquisition -> *Verification* -> Strategic Pause (`THINK`) -> Structured Analysis.** The \"Verification\" step is a mandatory check to ensure that the results of an action match the intent of the action.\n\n*   **New Heuristic: Verify Search Results Against Query Parameters:** I can no longer assume a search tool's output is perfectly aligned with its inputs. I must actively verify that the documents returned (e.g., by checking titles, authors, or brief snippets) are the ones I requested. Declaring an information-gathering phase \"complete\" now requires not just the apparent presence of documents, but their verified identity.\n\n*   **Value of Targeted Probes as Diagnostics (Strongly Reinforced):** While the search failed to retrieve the target information, the *failure itself* was profoundly valuable. It acted as a diagnostic tool that falsified my incorrect belief that I had all the necessary documents. This demonstrates that highly specific, targeted queries are useful not only for finding information but also for validating the integrity of one's existing knowledge base.\n\n*   **Primacy of Procedural Defenses (Vindicated as a Strategic Driver):** My heuristic to prioritize procedural issues directly led to the discovery of this critical information gap. By designing a search specifically to probe the waiver argument, I inadvertently stress-tested my document collection and found it wanting. This proves that sound legal-analytic principles are not just for the final analysis; they are powerful drivers for designing effective and revealing information-gathering strategies.\n\n*   **Stable Heuristics (Contextualized):** The \"Map-Then-Navigate\" and \"Low-Score Search Inspection\" heuristics remain valuable for initial acquisition. However, this observation shows they are insufficient on their own. They must be supplemented by the new \"Verify Search Results\" heuristic to ensure the \"map\" is accurate before proceeding to navigate."
