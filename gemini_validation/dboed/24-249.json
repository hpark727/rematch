    "facts_of_the_case": "A.J.T., a student with epilepsy, experiences seizures so severe in the morning that she cannot attend school until noon. Her parents repeatedly requested evening instruction from Osseo Area Schools to give her a school day length more comparable to her peers. Despite the District providing some accommodations, including one-on-one instruction, a slightly extended school day, and summer home instruction sessions, they denied the requests for evening instruction. The District\u2019s Director of Student Services, responsible for Section 504 compliance, was unaware of the parents\u2019 complaints and did not know that District policies allowed at-home schooling as an accommodation. A.J.T., through her parents, sued the District for disability discrimination under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. The district court granted summary judgment in favor of the District, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed.",

The core legal question is whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require a 'bad faith or gross misjudgment' standard for educational discrimination claims. This is a statutory interpretation case in the context of disability rights.\n\nMy initial state is one of complete uncertainty for both task parameters (\u03b8) and design effectiveness (D).\n\nTo reduce uncertainty in \u03b8, I need to understand the specific arguments made by the petitioner (A.J.T.) and the respondent (Osseo Area Schools), the reasoning of the lower courts (Eighth Circuit), and the key precedents involved.\n\nTo reduce uncertainty in D, I need to understand how the Supreme Court generally approaches statutory interpretation, particularly for civil rights statutes like the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. I also need to know if there are established patterns or methodologies for predicting outcomes in such cases, for example, by looking for circuit splits or the position of the Solicitor General.\n\nThe most fundamental document to start with is the petition for a writ of certiorari. This document will lay out the petitioner's main arguments, explain why the lower court's decision was wrong, and argue why the Supreme Court should take the case. It will almost certainly describe any circuit split on the issue, which is a crucial piece of information for both \u03b8 (the legal context) and D (a strong predictor of a cert grant and often signals a need for legal clarification that the Court is likely to provide).\n\nTherefore, my first action will be to search the docket files for the petition for certiorari.

It will move my belief state from knowing only the legal question to understanding the petitioner's entire narrative: the specific facts they emphasize, the precise legal arguments they make, the precedents they rely on, and, crucially, their argument for why the case is of national importance (e.g., by identifying a circuit split). This is a massive reduction in uncertainty about one half of the case. The score is not 1.0 because it only presents the petitioner's side.\n\nFor the design (Design EIG = 0.8), this action directly tests and will likely validate my primary strategic hypothesis: that analyzing the cert petition is the most efficient first step in SCOTUS prediction. Observing the structure and content of the petition (e.g., how a circuit split is framed) provides concrete data to refine my general model for all future cases. It confirms the utility of identifying 'foundational documents' and looking for 'key predictive signals' early in the process, thus significantly improving my meta-level strategy.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore very high, as this single action is incredibly efficient, simultaneously providing foundational case-specific knowledge and validating a core component of my general predictive methodology.",

In the decision below, the Eighth Circuit \nheld that, for discrimination claims \u201cbased on \neducational services\u201d brought by children with \ndisabilities, these statutes are violated only if school \nofficials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nApp.3a. \nThat test squarely implicates an entrenched and \nacknowledged 5-2 circuit split over the standard \ngoverning such claims.  It is also plainly mistaken on \nthe \nmerits: \n \nAs \nthe \nEighth \nCircuit \nitself \nacknowledged, the test lacks \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext,\u201d App.5a n.2, and it arbitrarily departs from the \nmore lenient standards that all courts\u2014including the \nEighth Circuit\u2014apply to ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims brought by plaintiffs outside the school setting.   \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require \nchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nwhen seeking relief for discrimination relating to \ntheir education. \n \n\nii \n \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe following proceedings are directly related to \nthis petition under Rule 14.1(b)(iii): \n\u2022 A.J.T. v.

The court\u2019s denial of \nrehearing en banc (App.44a-45a) is not published, but \navailable at 2024 WL 2845774.  The opinion of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota granting Osseo Area Schools\u2019 motion for \nsummary judgment (App.6a-43a) is not published but \navailable at 2023 WL 2316893.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe court of appeals entered judgment on \nMarch 21, 2024 (App.1a-5a) and denied A.J.T.\u2019s \ntimely petition for rehearing en banc on June 5, 2024 \n(App.44a-45a).  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe petition appendix.  App.46a-48a. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case once again raises a frequently recurring \nquestion of exceptional importance for children with \ndisabilities \nseeking \nto \nvindicate \ntheir \nfederal \nstatutory rights against discrimination.  As in Perez \nv. Sturgis Public Schools, 598 U.S. 142 (2023), \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas County School \nDistrict RE-1, 580 U.S. 386 (2017), and Fry v. \nNapoleon Community Schools, 580 U.S. 154 (2017), \nthis Court should grant certiorari to resolve deep \ndivisions in the lower courts and enforce the plain \nterms of key statutes protecting vulnerable children \nfrom discrimination by their schools. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under Title II \nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \ncan \nobtain \ninjunctive \nrelief \nwithout \nproving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But the Eighth Circuit and \nfour other circuits have erected a more stringent test \nfor children with disabilities who face discrimination \nin the school setting.  Those plaintiffs\u2014and only those \nplaintiffs\u2014must prove that school officials acted with \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to obtain any kind \nof relief.  App.5a n.2.     \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s test has absolutely no basis \nin the relevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor \nthe Rehabilitation Act requires \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d or authorizes courts to apply a \nuniquely stringent standard to children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, Congress mandated that \u201cany person\u201d \nseeking relief under those statutes would have the \n\n3 \n \n \nsame rights and remedies as those available under \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act, which makes no \ndistinction \nbetween \nschoolchildren \nand \nother \nplaintiffs.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133.  \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s atextual approach also \nimplicates a deep circuit split.  Whereas the  Second, \nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have adopted the \nEighth \nCircuit\u2019s \nasymmetric \ninterpretation \ndisfavoring children with disabilities, the Third and \nNinth Circuits apply the same standards to those \nchildren as they do to all other ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  Indeed, the circuit split \nhas been acknowledged by multiple federal courts\u2014\nas well as by the respondents here. \nBelow, an Eighth Circuit panel rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(\u201cAva\u201d), a teenage girl who suffers from severe \nepilepsy.  The panel expressly acknowledged that Ava \nhad presented evidence showing that her Minnesota \nschool \ndistrict \nhad \nbeen \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately indifferent\u201d in refusing reasonable \naccommodations that her prior Kentucky school \ndistrict had provided for years.  App.3a.  Nonetheless, \nthe panel rejected her claims because it was \n\u201cconstrained\u201d by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s prior decision in \nMonahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), \nwhich \nfirst \nestablished \nthe \nbad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard.  App.4a-5a.  In the Third and \nNinth Circuits, Ava\u2019s evidence would have been \nsufficient to survive summary judgment.  But in the \nEighth Circuit\u2014and in the four other circuits \nembracing Monahan\u2019s uniquely stringent standard\u2014\n\u201cthat\u2019s just not enough.\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n\n4 \n \n \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit panel sharply \ncriticized Monahan for jacking up the standard for \nschoolchildren to bring disability claims.  The panel \nobserved that Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act was \u201cwithout any anchor in \nstatutory text\u201d and built instead on misguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own circuit precedent applying \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d to children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims\u2014and to \nno one else.  Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 \n(6th Cir. 2023).  After Ava filed an en banc petition \nasking the Eighth Circuit to overrule Monahan, \nJudges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented from the \ndenial of rehearing.   \nThis case presents an exceptionally important \nissue for children with disabilities and their families.  \nBoth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act provide \nmuch-needed relief for educational discrimination, \nwhich often has life-altering consequences for \nchildren with disabilities.  Yet as this case illustrates, \nthe atextual rule imposed in five circuits makes it far \nharder for them to prove their claims\u2014for no good \nreason.  That has real consequences:  Literally \nhundreds of decisions have relied on Monahan (or its \nequivalent in other circuits) to deny relief to children \nlike Ava. \nOnly this Court can resolve the circuit split and \nrestore the full measure of protection that Congress \nguaranteed to vulnerable children with disabilities.  \nThe petition should be granted.   \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA)\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildren a \u201cfree appropriate public education \n[or FAPE].\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  To that end, \nthe IDEA ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive \nan \n\u201c\u2018individualized \neducation \nprogram \n[or IEP]\u2019\u201d that \u201cspells out a personalized plan to meet \nall of the child\u2019s \u2018educational needs.\u2019\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at \n158 (citations omitted).   \nThe IDEA creates specialized procedures for \nspeedily resolving IEP-related disputes between \nfamilies and schools, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, but it allows \ncourts to award only \u201cequitable relief,\u201d Florence Cnty. \nSch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 16 \n(1993).  Such relief may include an injunction, see id., \nor \u201creimburse[ment]\u201d for educational expenses, Sch. \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 \nU.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).  But the IDEA \u201cd[oes] not \nallow for damages.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. \nComm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009). \nThe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \nadditional protection.  As relevant here, the ADA \nprovides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct contains a similarly phrased prohibition that \n\n6 \n \n \napplies to recipients of federal funding.  See 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794(a).  Unlike the IDEA, which concerns only \nschool-age children with respect to their education, \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprotect \nall \nAmericans, both inside and outside the school setting. \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both recognize \nthat failing to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d \nto people with disabilities that would enable them to \n\u201cparticipate equally\u201d in a given service or program \nconstitutes disability discrimination.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 170.  Accommodations are reasonable so long as \nthey do not entail \u201ca fundamental alteration\u201d of the \nservice in question or cause \u201cundue financial or \nadm\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In the decision below, the Eighth Circuit \nheld that, for discrimination claims \u201cbased on \neducational services\u201d brought by children with \ndisabilities, these statutes are violated only if school \nofficials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nApp.3a. \nThat test squarely implicates an entrenched and \nacknowledged 5-2 circuit split over the standard \ngoverning such claims.  It is also plainly mistaken on \nthe \nmerits: \n \nAs \nthe \nEighth \nCircuit \nitself \nacknowledged, the test lacks \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext,\u201d App.5a n.2, and it arbitrarily departs from the \nmore lenient standards that all courts\u2014including the \nEighth Circuit\u2014apply to ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims brought by plaintiffs outside the school setting.   \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require \nchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nwhen seeking relief for discrimination relating to \ntheir education. \n \n\nii \n \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe following proceedings are directly related to \nthis petition under Rule 14.1(b)(iii): \n\u2022 A.J.T. v.

This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe petition appendix.  App.46a-48a. \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case once again raises a frequently recurring \nquestion of exceptional importance for children with \ndisabilities \nseeking \nto \nvindicate \ntheir \nfederal \nstatutory rights against discrimination.  As in Perez \nv. Sturgis Public Schools, 598 U.S. 142 (2023), \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas County School \nDistrict RE-1, 580 U.S. 386 (2017), and Fry v. \nNapoleon Community Schools, 580 U.S. 154 (2017), \nthis Court should grant certiorari to resolve deep \ndivisions in the lower courts and enforce the plain \nterms of key statutes protecting vulnerable children \nfrom discrimination by their schools. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under Title II \nof the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \ncan \nobtain \ninjunctive \nrelief \nwithout \nproving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But the Eighth Circuit and \nfour other circuits have erected a more stringent test \nfor children with disabilities who face discrimination \nin the school setting.  Those plaintiffs\u2014and only those \nplaintiffs\u2014must prove that school officials acted with \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to obtain any kind \nof relief.  App.5a n.2.     \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s test has absolutely no basis \nin the relevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor \nthe Rehabilitation Act requires \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d or authorizes courts to apply a \nuniquely stringent standard to children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, Congress mandated that \u201cany person\u201d \nseeking relief under those statutes would have the \n\n3 \n \n \nsame rights and remedies as those available under \nTitle VI of the Civil Rights Act, which makes no \ndistinction \nbetween \nschoolchildren \nand \nother \nplaintiffs.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133.  \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s atextual approach also \nimplicates a deep circuit split.  Whereas the  Second, \nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have adopted the \nEighth \nCircuit\u2019s \nasymmetric \ninterpretation \ndisfavoring children with disabilities, the Third and \nNinth Circuits apply the same standards to those \nchildren as they do to all other ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  Indeed, the circuit split \nhas been acknowledged by multiple federal courts\u2014\nas well as by the respondents here. \nBelow, an Eighth Circuit panel rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(\u201cAva\u201d), a teenage girl who suffers from severe \nepilepsy.  The panel expressly acknowledged that Ava \nhad presented evidence showing that her Minnesota \nschool \ndistrict \nhad \nbeen \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately indifferent\u201d in refusing reasonable \naccommodations that her prior Kentucky school \ndistrict had provided for years.  App.3a.  Nonetheless, \nthe panel rejected her claims because it was \n\u201cconstrained\u201d by the Eighth Circuit\u2019s prior decision in \nMonahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), \nwhich \nfirst \nestablished \nthe \nbad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard.  App.4a-5a.  In the Third and \nNinth Circuits, Ava\u2019s evidence would have been \nsufficient to survive summary judgment.  But in the \nEighth Circuit\u2014and in the four other circuits \nembracing Monahan\u2019s uniquely stringent standard\u2014\n\u201cthat\u2019s just not enough.\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n\n4 \n \n \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit panel sharply \ncriticized Monahan for jacking up the standard for \nschoolchildren to bring disability claims.  The panel \nobserved that Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act was \u201cwithout any anchor in \nstatutory text\u201d and built instead on misguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own circuit precedent applying \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d to children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims\u2014and to \nno one else.  Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 \n(6th Cir. 2023).  After Ava filed an en banc petition \nasking the Eighth Circuit to overrule Monahan, \nJudges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented from the \ndenial of rehearing.   \nThis case presents an exceptionally important \nissue for children with disabilities and their families.  \nBoth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act provide \nmuch-needed relief for educational discrimination, \nwhich often has life-altering consequences for \nchildren with disabilities.  Yet as this case illustrates, \nthe atextual rule imposed in five circuits makes it far \nharder for them to prove their claims\u2014for no good \nreason.  That has real consequences:  Literally \nhundreds of decisions have relied on Monahan (or its \nequivalent in other circuits) to deny relief to children \nlike Ava. \nOnly this Court can resolve the circuit split and \nrestore the full measure of protection that Congress \nguaranteed to vulnerable children with disabilities.  \nThe petition should be granted.   \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act \n(IDEA)\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildren a \u201cfree appropriate public education \n[or FAPE].\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  To that end, \nthe IDEA ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive \nan \n\u201c\u2018individualized \neducation \nprogram \n[or IEP]\u2019\u201d that \u201cspells out a personalized plan to meet \nall of the child\u2019s \u2018educational needs.\u2019\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at \n158 (citations omitted).   \nThe IDEA creates specialized procedures for \nspeedily resolving IEP-related disputes between \nfamilies and schools, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, but it allows \ncourts to award only \u201cequitable relief,\u201d Florence Cnty. \nSch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, 16 \n(1993).  Such relief may include an injunction, see id., \nor \u201creimburse[ment]\u201d for educational expenses, Sch. \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 \nU.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).  But the IDEA \u201cd[oes] not \nallow for damages.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. \nComm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009). \nThe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \nadditional protection.  As relevant here, the ADA \nprovides that \u201cno qualified individual with a disability \nshall, by reason of such disability, be excluded from \nparticipation in or be denied the benefits of the \nservices, programs, or activities of a public entity, or \nbe subjected to discrimination by any such entity.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct contains a similarly phrased prohibition that \n\n6 \n \n \napplies to recipients of federal funding.  See 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794(a).  Unlike the IDEA, which concerns only \nschool-age children with respect to their education, \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprotect \nall \nAmericans, both inside and outside the school setting. \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both recognize \nthat failing to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d \nto people with disabilities that would enable them to \n\u201cparticipate equally\u201d in a given service or program \nconstitutes disability discrimination.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 170.  Accommodations are reasonable so long as \nthey do not entail \u201ca fundamental alteration\u201d of the \nservice in question or cause \u201cundue financial or \nadministrative burdens.\u201d  Gorman v. Bartch, 152 F.3d \n907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998) (citation omitted); see also \nK.M. ex rel. Bright v. Tustin Unified Sch. Dist., 725 \nF.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2013).   \n2. The ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cexpressly \nincorporate[]\u201d the same set of \u201crights and remedies \nprovided under Title VI\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of \n1964.  Cummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., \n596 U.S. 212, 218 (2022); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nthus follow Title VI in \u201cauthoriz[ing] individuals,\u201d \nincluding children with disabilities, \u201cto seek redress \nfor violations\u201d by \u201cbringing suits\u201d not just \u201cfor \ninjunctive relief,\u201d but also for \u201cmoney damages.\u201d  Fry, \n580 U.S. at 160; see also Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 \nU.S. 275, 278-80 (2001) (observing that \u201cprivate \nindividuals may sue\u201d under \u201cTitle VI and obtain both \ninjunctive relief and damages\u201d). \n \nIn cases outside the educational context, the \ncourts \nof \nappeals \nagree \nthat \nall \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs are eligible for injunctive \nrelief if they show, on the merits, that the defendant \n\n7 \n \n \nfailed to provide a reasonable accommodation to a \ncovered person with a disability.  Such plaintiffs need \nnot make any specific showing of wrongful intent to \nobtain such relief.1   \nFor compensatory damages, however, every circuit \nrequires \u201ca showing of intent[].\u201d  S.H. ex rel. Durrell \nv. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 262 \n(3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases).  Because \u201cprivate \nindividuals [may] not recover compensatory damages \nunder Title VI except for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nSandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83, and because the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nexpressly \nincorporate \nTitle VI\u2019s rights and rights, supra at 6, people with \ndisabilities may not obtain damages under the ADA \nor Rehabilitation Act without proving intent.  See \nS.H., 729 F.3d at 262.   \nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of courts hold that this intent \nrequirement for damages demands proof that the \ndefendant \nwas\u2014at \na \nminimum\u2014\u201cdeliberately \nindifferent\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s federally protected \nrights.  Pierce v. Dist. of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d \n250, 278-79 (D.D.C. 2015) (Jackson, J.) (collecting \n \n1   See Sosa v. Massachusetts Dep\u2019t of Corr., 80 F.4th 15, 30 \n(1st Cir. 2023); Hamilton v. Westchester County, 3 F.4th 86, 91 \n(2d Cir. 2021); Durham v. Kelley, 82 F.4th 217, 225-26 \n(3d Cir. 2023); Richardson v. Clarke, 52 F.4th 614, 619 \n(4th Cir. 2022); Bennett-Nelson v. La. Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d \n448, 455 (5th Cir. 2005); Finley v. Huss, 102 F.4th 789, 820 \n(6th Cir. 2024); Wis. Cmty. Servs., Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, \n465 F.3d 737, 750-51 (7th Cir. 2006) (en banc); Hall v. Higgins, \n77 F.4th 1171, 1180-81 (8th Cir. 2023); Payan v. L.A. Cmty. Coll. \nDist., 11 F.4th 729, 738 (9th Cir. 2021); Brooks v. Colo. Dep\u2019t of \nCorr., 12 F.4th 1160, 1167 (10th Cir. 2021); Charles v. Johnson, \n18 F.4th 686, 702 (11th Cir. 2021); Chenari v. George \nWashington Univ., 847 F.3d 740, 746-47 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  \n\n8 \n \n \ncases).  Those courts have done so based on this \nCourt\u2019s precedent adopting a deliberate indifference \nstandard under Title IX, which was likewise \u201cmodeled \nafter Title VI.\u201d  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n524 U.S. 274, 286, 290 (1998).2 \nAlthough the circuits largely agree on the \nstandards for applying the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct\u2019s protections outside the educational setting, they \nare intractably divided over whether those same \nstandards apply to children with disabilities bringing \neducation-related claims.  Two circuits\u2014the Third \nand Ninth\u2014apply the same standards in these cases \nas they do in all others.  But five circuits\u2014led by the \nEighth\u2014apply a different test.  Ever since Monahan \nv. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth \nCircuit has held that \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nmust be shown before a violation of the Rehabilitation \nAct (and thus the ADA) \u201ccan be made out\u201d in \u201cthe \ncontext of education of handicapped children.\u201d  Id. \nat 1170-71.  Since then, the Second, Fourth, Fifth, and \nSixth Circuits have followed suit.  See infra at 14-20 \n(describing circuit split in greater detail). \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Ever since she was six months old, Ava has \nsuffered from \u201ca rare form of epilepsy\u201d that severely \nimpacts her ability to function.  App.50a (opinion in \n \n2   See Loeffler v.

From then on, however, \u201cshe\u2019s alert and \nable to learn until about 6:00 p.m.\u201d  Id.   \n\u201cBefore moving to Minnesota in 2015,\u201d when she \nwas 10 years old, Ava\u2019s public school district in \nKentucky adequately addressed her needs, including \nby providing \u201cevening instruction at home.\u201d  Id.  But \nher Minnesota district, respondent Osseo Area \nSchools (the District), refused to accommodate her.  \nId.  \u201cYear after year, it denied [Ava\u2019s] parents\u2019 \nrequests for evening instruction\u201d based on \u201ca series of \nshifting explanations.\u201d  Id.  Initially, the District \n\u201cclaimed that state law d[id] not require\u201d adjusting \nAva\u2019s instructional hours.  Id.  Then, the District \u201csaid \nit needed to avoid setting unfavorable precedent for \nitself and other districts.\u201d  Id.  \u201cAnd later, it said that \nthe home environment would be too restrictive,\u201d while \ndemanding more \u201cdata\u201d to justify a \u201cprogramming \nchange.\u201d  Id.  All told, over her first three years in \nMinnesota, Ava received only 4.25 hours of \ninstruction per day\u2014more than two hours less than \nher non-disabled peers.  Id.; see id. at 8a. \nThen, in 2018, the District insisted on truncating \nAva\u2019s instructional time even further.  As Ava \nprepared to enter middle school, the District abruptly \namended her IEP to \u201ccut[] back her day to about \n3 hours\u201d\u2014less than half of what her peers would \nreceive.  App.51a; see id. at 8a.  Despite this latest \nsetback, Ava\u2019s parents continued to engage with the \nDistrict, seeking a workable compromise.  They made \n\u201cvarious proposals to at least maintain [Ava\u2019s] \n4.25-hour day,\u201d including keeping her at the \n\n10 \n \n \nelementary school, where the school day was longer.  \nId. at 51a.  The District rejected all of them.  Id.   \n2. After years of frustration, Ava\u2019s parents \n\u201c[r]ealiz[ed] that an agreement [with the District] was \nbeyond reach\u201d and filed an IDEA complaint with the \nMinnesota Department of Education.  Id.  After a \nfive-day hearing, an administrative law judge (ALJ) \nfound that the District had denied Ava a FAPE in \nviolation of the IDEA.   \nThe ALJ found that the District\u2019s \u201cprevailing and \nparamount consideration\u201d had never been Ava\u2019s \u201cneed \nfor instruction,\u201d but rather its own desire \u201cto maintain \nthe regular hours of the school\u2019s faculty.\u201d  CA8 \nAppellant\u2019s App. 367.  The ALJ accordingly ordered \nthe District to \u201crevise\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP to include evening \ninstruction and other services.  Id. at 368-69.  The \nALJ also ordered \u201c495 hours of compensatory \neducation instruction,\u201d limiting relief to what the ALJ \nbelieved was the proper two-year \u201climitations period\u201d \nunder the IDEA.  Id. at 366, 369. \n3. The parties then proceeded to federal court.  \nThe District challenged the ALJ\u2019s IDEA ruling.  For \nher part, Ava sued the District under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, seeking an injunction that would \n\u201cpermanently secure [Ava]\u2019s rights to a full school \nday,\u201d as well as \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d for the \nentire duration of her mistreatment.  Id. at 21-22, \n25, 28; see also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(4) (IDEA  \nprovision permitting school officials to revise IEPs \n\u201cperiodically\u201d).  By bringing these claims, Ava was \nable to take advantage of the six-year limitations \nperiod governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims \nbrought in Minnesota.  See Gaona v. Town & Country \nCredit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 (8th Cir. 2003).   \n\n11 \n \n \nThe district court upheld Ava\u2019s victory on her \nIDEA claim.  The court explained that Ava \u201crequires \nmore than 4.25 hours of schooling a day to have an \neducational program\u201d that \u201cwill allow her to meet \nchallenging objectives.\u201d  CA8 Appellant\u2019s App. 789.  \nThe court thus agreed that \u201c[e]xtending her \ninstructional day until 6:00pm and including \ncompensatory \nhours \nof \ninstruction\u201d \nwas \n\u201cthe \nappropriate remedy\u201d under the IDEA.  Id.  \nAs to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, however, \nthe district court granted summary judgment against \nAva and in favor of the District.  The court explained \nthat, under Monahan, Ava had to show that the \nDistrict had acted with either \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  App.24a-25a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d \nat 1171.  Applying Monahan\u2019s heightened standard, \nthe district court concluded that the District\u2019s actions \n\u201cdid not rise to th[at] level.\u201d  App.30a. \n4. In two published opinions by Judge Kobes, a \npanel of the Eighth Circuit unanimously affirmed \nboth rulings.  See App.49a-57a (IDEA decision); id. at \n1a-5a (ADA and Rehabilitation Act decision). \nIn the IDEA case, the panel agreed that Ava had \nnot received a FAPE based on \u201c[s]everal\u201d facts.  Id. \nat 54a.  First, Ava had made \u201conly slight progress in \na few areas\u201d while in the District\u2019s care.  Id.  Second, \nAva \u201cregressed in toileting\u201d so drastically that the \nDistrict had \u201cremoved her toileting goal\u201d altogether, \nciting only a \u201clack of time in the short day\u2014not [a] \nlack of ability to improve.\u201d  Id. at 55a-56a.  Third, \n\u201cexpert testimony\u201d confirmed that Ava \u201cwould have \nmade more progress\u201d with \u201cevening instruction.\u201d  Id. \nat 56a-57a.  The panel also sharply criticized the \nDistrict, \nemphasizing \nthat \nits \ndecisions \nhad \n\n12 \n \n \n\u201c[n]ever been grounded in [Ava]\u2019s individual needs.\u201d  \nId. at 57a.  \nDespite ruling for Ava on her IDEA claim, the \nEighth Circuit regretfully rejected her ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.  Like the district court, the \npanel considered itself duty-bound under Monahan to \nrequire Ava to establish \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d by the District.  Id. at 3a-4a (quoting \nMonahan, 687 F.2d at 1171).  The panel recognized \nthat Ava \u201cmay have established a genuine dispute \nabout whether the district was negligent or even \ndeliberately indifferent.\u201d  Id. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under \nMonahan,\u201d the panel explained, \u201cthat\u2019s just not \nenough.\u201d  Id.  Because her case involved \u201c\u2018educational \nservices for disabled children,\u2019\u201d Ava had to \u201cprove that \nschool officials acted with \u2018either bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u2019\u201d  Id. (citations omitted).  The panel \nheld that Ava \u201cha[d] failed to identify conduct clearing \nMonahan\u2019s bar\u201d\u2014and thus could not obtain any relief \nas a matter of law.  Id. at 4a-5a.   \nNotably, the panel expressed deep discomfort with \nMonahan\u2019s holding imposing \u201csuch a high bar for \nclaims based on educational services\u201d brought by \nchildren with disabilities.  Id. at 5a n.2.  The panel \nobserved that \u201cmuch less\u201d is required \u201cin other \ndisability-discrimination contexts.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, the \npanel explained that in every other scenario, \u201cno \nintent [is] required\u201d to obtain injunctive relief on a \n\u201cfailure-to-accommodate claim,\u201d while \u201cdamages\u201d \nclaims require only \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d  Id.   \nMonahan\u2019s carve-out for school-age children with \ndisabilities, the panel continued, is \u201cwithout any \nanchor in statutory text.\u201d  Id.  The court noted that \nMonahan had \u201cspeculated that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \n\n13 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act]\u2019s protections\u201d (and thus the \nADA\u2019s).  Id.  But the panel pointed out that \u201cCongress \nrejected [that] premise\u201d in amendments to the EHA \nenacted \u201cjust a few years later.\u201d  Id.  The panel \nconcluded that Monahan has thus rightly \u201cbeen \nquestioned\u201d\u2014and stands as \u201ca lesson in why\u201d courts \nshould not \u201c\u2018add provisions\u2019\u201d to \u201c\u2018federal statute[s]\u2019\u201d \nthat aren\u2019t there.  Id. (alteration in original) \n(quoting Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, \n352 (2010)).  Nevertheless, the panel observed, \nMonahan \u201cremains the law of [this] circuit,\u201d at least \n\u201cfor the time being.\u201d  Id. \n5.  On June 5, 2024, the Eighth Circuit denied \nAva\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc.  Id. at 44a-45a.  \nJudges Grasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented, noting that \nthey would grant the petition.  Id. at 44a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nThis petition readily satisfies all the traditional \ncriteria for certiorari.  See Sup. Ct. R. 10(a).  By \nadhering to circuit precedent imposing a uniquely \nstringent standard on children with disabilities \nbringing education-related claims, the Eighth Circuit \nfurther solidified a deep and entrenched circuit \nconflict.  Five circuits single out such children for \ndisfavored \ntreatment \nunder \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act, while two circuits adjudicate \ntheir claims under the same standards that apply to \neveryone else.  Even the District acknowledged the \ncircuit split below.  \nCertiorari is also warranted because the Eighth \nCircuit has incorrectly resolved an important \nquestion of federal law.  This Court has firmly \nrejected the \u201cdangerous principle that judges can give \nthe same statutory text different meanings in \n\n14 \n \n \ndifferent cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 \n(2005).  Yet five circuits do exactly that by \ninterpreting the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \ngenerally \napplicable \nprovisions \nto \nimpose \na \nheightened standard on children with disabilities and \nno one else.  This heightened standard lets school \ndistricts off the hook even when, as here, their \nbehavior evinces deliberate indifference to students\u2019 \nfederally protected rights.  This Court should reject \nthat asymmetric, atextual, and unduly harsh regime. \nThe question presented comes up frequently in \nlitigation brought by children with disabilities.  It \nshould now be resolved by this Court.  The circuit \nconflict has caused substantial harm to vulnerable \nchildren across the country by making it exceedingly \ndifficult to obtain much-needed relief under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act.  Only this Court can resolve \nthe split, and this case provides an ideal vehicle to do \nso.  The petition should be granted. \nI. The Decision Below Solidifies A Deep And \nEntrenched 5-2 Circuit Split \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision confirms a 5-2 circuit \nsplit on whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nrequire \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nbringing \neducation-related claims to satisfy a more stringent \nstandard than other plaintiffs under those same \nstatutes.  The District has conceded the existence of a \n\u201ccircuit split on this issue.\u201d  CA8 Resp. to Reh\u2019g Pet. 2.  \nSeveral federal courts have acknowledged it as well.  \nSee, e.g., Hamilton Sch. Dist. v. Doe, 2005 WL \n3240597, at *10 (E.D. Wis. Nov. 29, 2005); O.F. ex rel. \nN.S. v. Chester Upland Sch. Dist., 246 F. Supp. 2d \n409, 420 (E.D. Pa. 2002).   \n\n15 \n \n \nA. Five Circuits Apply A Uniquely Stringent \nStandard To Children With Disabilities \nAlleging Discrimination By Their Schools \nOn one side of the split, the Second, Fourth, Fifth, \nSixth, and Eighth Circuits all hold that, unlike other \nADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs, children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims must \nprove \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d to obtain relief \nof any kind.  District courts within the D.C. Circuit \nconsistently follow the same rule. \nThe Eighth Circuit first invented this stringent, \ncontext-specific standard in Monahan v. Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982).  There, the court \naffirmed the dismissal without prejudice of a \u201ccryptic\u201d \nRehabilitation Act claim alleging an \u201cimproper \neducational placement.\u201d  Id. at 1169-70.  To offer \u201ca \nfew words [of] guidance\u201d on remand, the court opined \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment should be \nshown\u201d before a Rehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be \nmade out\u201d in \u201cthe context of education of handicapped \nchildren.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71. \nMonahan \njustified \nimposing \na \nheightened \nstandard based on a perceived \u201cduty to harmonize the \nRehabilitation Act\u201d with the IDEA\u2019s predecessor\u2014the \nEHA\u2014given that the EHA specifically addressed the \neducational needs of children with disabilities.  Id. \nat 1171.  According to Monahan, the heightened \nstandard was necessary to \u201cgive each of these statutes \nthe full play intended by Congress\u201d and achieve \u201cwhat \n[the court] believe[d] to be a proper balance between \nthe \nrights \nof \nhandicapped \nchildren, \nthe \nresponsibilities of state education officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields.\u201d  Id.   \n\n16 \n \n \nEver since Monahan, the Eighth Circuit has \nadhered to this dicta and \u201cconsistently held\u201d that a \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard \napplies \nwhenever \u201calleged ADA and [Rehabilitation Act] \nviolations are based on educational services for \ndisabled children,\u201d regardless of the relief sought. \nB.M. ex rel. Miller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 \nF.3d 882, 887 (8th Cir. 2013); see, e.g., M.P. ex rel. K. \nv. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975, 982 \n(8th Cir. 2003).  And here, the Eighth Circuit rejected \nAva\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims because of \nMonahan\u2019s uniquely stringent standard, recognizing \nthat it \u201cremains the law of [the] circuit.\u201d  App.5a n.2. \nThe Fourth Circuit has applied the Eighth \nCircuit\u2019s approach for decades.  In Sellers ex rel. \nSellers v. School Board of the City of Manassas, 141 \nF.3d 524 (4th Cir. 1998), the Fourth Circuit explicitly \n\u201cagree[d] with\u201d Monahan \u201c\u2018that either bad faith or \ngross misjudgment should be shown\u2019\u201d for children \nwith disabilities to prevail on ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims related to their education.  Id. at 529 \n(quoting Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171).  The Fourth \nCircuit relied on that heightened standard to affirm \nthe dismissal of a lawsuit that, in the court\u2019s view, \nalleged only \u201cnegligence.\u201d  Id. \nThe Fifth Circuit has similarly fallen in lockstep \nwith the Eighth Circuit.  In D.A. ex rel. Latasha A. v. \nHouston Independent School District, 629 F.3d 450 \n(5th Cir. 2010), the Fifth Circuit held that \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment must be shown in order to state \na cause of action\u201d under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct \u201cin th[e] educational context.\u201d  Id. at 454.  \nExpressly \u201cconcur[ring]\u201d with Monahan\u2019s reasoning, \nthe Fifth Circuit denied relief of any kind to a child \nwho, according to the court, could demonstrate \u201cno \n\n17 \n \n \nmore than negligence\u201d by school officials.  Id. at \n454-55; see, e.g., D.H.H. ex rel. Rob Anna H. v. \nKirbyville Consol. Indep. Sch. Dist., 2021 WL \n4948918, at *2 (5th Cir. Oct. 22, 2021) (applying \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard); C.C. v. \nHurst-Euless-Bedford Indep. Sch. Dist., 641 F. App\u2019x \n423, 426 (5th Cir. 2016) (same). \nThe Second and Sixth Circuits similarly \u201crequire[] \nproof of bad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d for ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims \u201cin the context of educating \nchildren with disabilities.\u201d  C.L. v. Scarsdale Union \nFree Sch. Dist., 744 F.3d 826, 841 (2d Cir. 2014); \nsee, e.g., G.C. v. Owensboro Pub. Schs., 711 F.3d 623, \n635 (6th Cir. 2013); Li v. Revere Loc. Sch. Dist., 2023 \nWL 3302062, at *12-13 (6th Cir. May 8, 2023).  And \nwhile \u201cthe D.C. Circuit has never squarely adopted\u201d \nMonahan\u2019s heightened standard, district courts in \nthat circuit consistently require \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d \nin \nthis \nsingle \nfactual \ncontext.  \nReid-Witt ex rel. C.W. v. District of Columbia, 486 \nF. Supp. 3d 1, 7 (D.D.C. 2020) (collecting cases). \nB. Two Circuits Apply The Same Standards \nTo All Plaintiffs \nOn the other side of the split, the Third and Ninth \nCircuits treat children with disabilities bringing \neducation-related claims just like everyone else.  \nThose two circuits apply the same established \nstandards\u2014i.e., no intent required for injunctive \nrelief, and only deliberate indifference required for \ndamages\u2014to anyone suing under the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct, \nincluding \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities.  In addition, the Seventh Circuit has \nrecognized that no intent is required for children with \ndisabilities to obtain education-related injunctive \n\n18 \n \n \nrelief.  And district courts within the Tenth Circuit \nuniformly \napply \nthe \nbaseline \nstandards, \nnot \nMonahan\u2019s special rule disfavoring schoolchildren.   \nBelow, the District rightly conceded that the Third \nCircuit does not apply a Monahan-like \u201c\u2018bad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u2019 standard\u201d in the context of \n\u201cdiscrimination claims involving special education \nservices.\u201d  CA8 Resp. to Reh\u2019g Pet. 14.  For example, \nin D.E. v. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d \n260, 265 (3d Cir. 2014), the Third Circuit confronted \na lawsuit brought by a child with serious \u201cbehavior \nand social issues\u201d who had been \u201cmistakenly \nidentified as having mental retardation,\u201d rather than \nseeing his \u201cemotional and behavioral needs\u201d properly \naddressed.  Id. at 265-66.  Even though the case was \nbrought by a child with disabilities and asserted \neducation-related claims under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, the Third Circuit applied the \nsame standards for (1) \u201cma[king] out the prima facie \ncase\u201d of a statutory violation, and (2) obtaining \n\u201ccompensatory damages.\u201d  Id. at 269.  That is, the \nThird Circuit required \u201cintentional\u201d misconduct only \nfor damages, and held that a \u201cshowing of deliberate \nindifference satisfies that\u201d intent requirement.  Id.; \nsee, e.g., S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. \nDist., 729 F.3d 248, 262, 264 (3d Cir. 2013) (applying \nthe \nsame \nbaseline \nstandards \nto \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by a child with \ndisabilities); Sch. Dist. of Phila. v. Kirsch, 722 \nF. App\u2019x 215, 228-29 (3d Cir. 2018) (same). \nThe Ninth Circuit likewise applies the baseline \nstandards for children with disabilities bringing \neducation-related claims, just as it does in other ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act cases.  In Mark H. v. \nHamamoto, 620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010), the Ninth \n\n19 \n \n \nCircuit reversed a grant of summary judgment in \nfavor of the Hawaii Department of Education, \nconcluding that the Department was \u201con notice\u201d that \ntwo autistic children needed \u201cautism-specific services, \nbut did not provide those services,\u201d even though they \n\u201cwere available as a reasonable accommodation.\u201d  Id. \nat 1097.  The court held that the Department\u2019s failure \nto provide a reasonable accommodation was sufficient \nto show a statutory violation, while \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d exposed it to \u201cliab[ility] for damages.\u201d  \nId.; see, e.g., A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified Sch. Dist. \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1206-07 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(applying the same baseline standards to ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by a child with \ndisabilities); R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington \nSch. Dist., 843 F. App\u2019x 80, 83 (9th Cir. 2021) (same). \nThe Seventh Circuit has explicitly recognized that \neducation-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims \nbrought by children with disabilities do \u201cnot require a \nshowing of intentional discrimination,\u201d so long as \nthey seek only declaratory or injunctive relief.  CTL \nex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d 524, \n528 n.4 (7th Cir. 2014).  In that respect, the Seventh \nCircuit fully aligns with the Third and Ninth Circuits.  \nAnd while the Seventh Circuit has not yet \u201cdecide[d] \nthe appropriate [intent] standard for damages,\u201d id., a \ndistrict court within the Seventh Circuit has explicitly \n\u201cdecline[d] to apply a bad faith or gross misjudgment \nstandard,\u201d because the Seventh Circuit has never \n\u201cadopted this requirement,\u201d Brown v. Dist. 299\u2013\nChicago Pub. Schs., 762 F. Supp. 2d 1076, 1084 n.8 \n(N.D. Ill. 2010).   \n \nAlthough the Tenth Circuit has not weighed in on \nthe question presented, district courts within that \ncircuit uniformly reject the Monahan approach and \n\n20 \n \n \ntreat education-related claims brought by children \nwith disabilities like ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims brought by anybody else.  See, e.g., Clasen v. \nUnified Sch. Dist. No. 266, 2019 WL 4034476, at *8 \n(D. Kan. Aug. 27, 2019).  Several decisions have \nexplicitly refused to apply the bad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard because \u201cthe Tenth Circuit \nhas not adopted that view.\u201d  Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857, at *2 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, \n2008); see also Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nNo. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1145-47 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(similar).  Indeed, the Tenth Circuit consistently \napplies the same baseline standards in ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases, regardless of factual \ncontext.  See, e.g., Hampton v. Utah Dep\u2019t of Corr., 87 \nF.4th 1183, 1191 (10th Cir. 2023) (no intent for \ninjunction); Powers v. MJB Acquisition Corp., 184 \nF.3d 1147, 1153 (10th Cir. 1999) (deliberate \nindifference for damages).3 \nC. This Court Should Resolve The Split \nThe circuit split described above is clear and \nundeniable.  If Ava had brought her ADA and \n \n3   District courts within the First and Eleventh Circuits \nare divided amongst themselves over the proper standard.  \nFaced with education-related claims brought by children with \ndisabilities, some district courts apply the baseline standards \nthat govern ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims of all stripes.  \nSee, e.g., Ms. K v. City of South Portland, 407 F. Supp. 2d 290, \n295 (D. Me. 2006); T.H. ex rel. T.B. v. DeKalb Cnty. Sch. Dist., \n564 F. Supp. 3d 1349, 1360 (N.D. Ga. 2021).  Others, however, \nadhere to Monahan\u2019s context-specific rule.  See, e.g., S.W. v. \nHolbrook Pub. Sch., 221 F. Supp. 2d 222, 228 (D. Mass. 2002); \nE.W. v. Sch. Bd. of Miami-Dade Cnty. Fla., 307 F. Supp. 2d 1363, \n1370-71 (S.D. Fla. 2004).  This confusion and disarray only \nreinforce the need for this Court\u2019s review. \n\n21 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act claims in the Third or Ninth \nCircuits, she would have been subject to the same \nbaseline standards as any other plaintiff suing under \nthose statutes.  So too, in all likelihood, if she had \nsued in the Seventh or Tenth Circuits.  But because \nAva had the misfortune of attending school in the \nEighth Circuit, she was subject to a far more stringent \nstandard.  She would have faced the same impossibly \nlong odds if her case had arisen in the Second, Fourth, \nFifth, or Sixth Circuits (and likely the D.C. Circuit, at \nleast at the district court level).  \nThis deep divide in the lower courts will not fix \nitself.  Just last year, a unanimous panel of the Sixth \nCircuit sharply criticized its circuit precedent \nadopting Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard.  See Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, \n1002 (6th Cir. 2023).  The Sixth Circuit panel called \nMonahan\u2019s test \u201can impossibly high bar\u201d that is \u201chard \nto square\u201d with \u201cstatutory protection[s] that,\u201d by their \nterms, \u201creach[] even the unintentional denial of \nservices.\u201d  Id.  Nevertheless, the full Sixth Circuit did \nnot take the case en banc.   \nIn this case, a unanimous panel of the Eighth \nCircuit leveled similar criticisms.  App.5a n.2.  The \npanel attacked Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the \nRehabilitation Act\u2014and by extension, the ADA\u2014as \nlacking \u201cany anchor in statutory text,\u201d resting on a \n\u201cpremise\u201d that Congress later \u201crejected,\u201d and having \nrightly \n\u201cbeen \nquestioned\u201d \nby \ncourts \nand \ncommentators alike.  Id.  Yet the Eighth Circuit \ndenied Ava\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc, over three \ndissents.  Id. at 44a-45a.  \nFederal statutory protections should not vary by \ngeography.  This Court should grant review to resolve \nthe entrenched circuit split on the question presented. \n\n22 \n \n \nII. The Eighth Circuit\u2019s Atextual Rule Is Wrong \nCertiorari is also warranted because, as the \ndecision below recognized, the rule invented by the \nEighth Circuit in Monahan is wrong.  Imposing a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related discrimination \nclaims\u2014and on nobody else\u2014cannot be squared with \nstatutory text, structure, or purpose.   \n1. The text of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nlends no support for Monahan\u2019s rule.  Monahan \naddressed Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, \nwhich provides in relevant part:  \u201cNo otherwise \nqualified individual with a disability\u201d shall \u201csolely by \nreason of her or his disability, be excluded from the \nparticipation in, be denied the benefits of, or be \nsubjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  The Rehabilitation Act also \nexpressly incorporates \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, \nand rights set forth in [T]itle VI of the Civil Rights \nAct.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2).  The ADA establishes a \nmaterially identical prohibition for public entities and \nincorporates the same set of rights and remedies.  See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133; supra at 5-7. \nNeither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act \nexpressly sets forth an intent requirement for \nobtaining injunctive relief or compensatory damages.  \nBut as to damages, virtually all courts\u2014including the \nEighth Circuit\u2014have recognized that plaintiffs \noutside the educational setting must prove intent, \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s case interpreting \nTitle VI.  Supra at 6 & n.1 (collecting cases); see also \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001) \n(intent required for damages under Title VI).  The \n\n23 \n \n \noverwhelming majority have held that plaintiffs may \nsatisfy this intent requirement for damages by \nproving \nthat \nthe \ndefendant \nwas \ndeliberately \nindifferent to their federally protected rights.  Supra \nat 7 & n.2 (collecting cases); see also Gebser v. Lago \nVista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998) \n(holding that deliberate indifference is sufficient to \nshow such intent under Title IX, which was likewise \n\u201cmodeled after Title VI\u201d); Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. \n181, 185-89 (2002) (looking to Title IX precedent in \ndetermining the scope of private damages remedies \navailable under the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and \nTitle VI).  \nMonahan was wrong to carve out from these \nbaseline standards an exception that applies solely to \neducation-related claims brought by children with \ndisabilities.  The substantive prohibitions set forth in \nSection 202 of the ADA and Section 504 of  \nthe Rehabilitation Act create a single standard \ngoverning all claims for review under each statute.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132 (ADA); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) \n(Rehabilitation Act).  Nothing in either provision \nremotely suggests that education-related claims \nbrought by children with disabilities should be \nanalyzed differently from all other claims seeking \nrelief under the same operative provision.  Rather, the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s prohibitions apply no \nmatter a plaintiff\u2019s age, the nature of her disability, \nor the factual context in which she suffered \ndiscrimination.   \nThe same goes for the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct\u2019s remedial provisions.  Section 203 of the ADA \nincorporates \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and rights \nset forth in [the Rehabilitation Act].\u201d  42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133.  And Section 505 of the Rehabilitation Act \n\n24 \n \n \nprovides that \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and rights \nset forth in [T]itle VI\u201d are \u201cavailable to any person \naggrieved\u201d in violation of Section 504.  29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).  \u201cAny person\u201d means just that\u2014any \nperson.  This language requires equal treatment of all \nADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  It forecloses \nMonahan\u2019s \nview \nthat \neducation-related \nclaims \nbrought by children with disabilities must satisfy \nmore stringent standards than those governing all \nother claims.   \nAs for Title VI, that statute establishes an \nevenhanded remedy for any person subjected to \ndiscrimination in federally-funded programs or \nactivities \u201con the ground of race, color, or national \norigin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.  That across-the-board \nprohibition offers no basis for imposing a uniquely \nstringent standard on any class of plaintiffs, let alone \nschool-age children.  Indeed, no Title VI case has ever \nadopted a Monahan-like \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d rule in the school setting.  It follows \nthat the normal standards that govern all other ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act cases\u2014i.e., no intent for \ninjunctive relief, and only deliberate indifference for \ndamages\u2014must govern in this one too. \nMonahan perceived a need to establish a bespoke \nstandard \u201cin the context of education of handicapped \nchildren,\u201d given the existence of another statute \nprotecting their interests (the EHA, now the IDEA), \nand the fact that \u201c[e]xperts often disagree on what the \nspecial needs of a handicapped child are.\u201d  687 F.2d \nat 1170-71.  But the unstated premise of that \nreasoning rests on the \u201cdangerous\u201d\u2014and firmly \nrejected\u2014\u201cprinciple that judges can give the same \nstatutory text different meanings in different cases.\u201d \nClark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Federal \n\n25 \n \n \ncourts have an \u201cobligation to maintain the consistent \nmeaning of words in statutory text.\u201d  United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 523 (2008).  They may not do \nwhat Monahan did:  Give \u201cthe same word[s], in the \nsame statutory provision, different meanings in \ndifferent factual contexts.\u201d  Id. at 522 (emphasis \nomitted). \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act are not \n\u201cchameleon[s].\u201d  Id. (quoting Clark, 543 U.S at 382).  \nTheir meaning \u201ccannot change\u201d whenever a child with \ndisabilities alleges discrimination at the hands of \nschool officials.  Id.  By reading the same operative \nlanguage to establish a different standard in this \nsingle context, Monahan engaged in nothing less than \n\u201cinterpretive contortion.\u201d  Id. \n2. Monahan justified its atextual rule primarily \nbased on \u201cspeculat[ion] that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s predecessor\u201d statute\u2014the EHA\u2014\u201cto limit \n[the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s] protections.\u201d  App.5a n.2.  \nMonahan perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the two \nstatutes and prevent the Rehabilitation Act from \nbecoming a cause of action \u201cfor educational \nmalpractice\u201d that would supplant the EHA.  687 F.2d \nat 1170-71.  According to Monahan, this step was \nneeded to \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \nintended by Congress.\u201d  Id. at 1171.  \nSoon after the Eighth Circuit decided Monahan, \nthis Court took Monahan\u2019s logic one step further.  In \nSmith v. Robinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the Court \nheld that the EHA provided the \u201cexclusive avenue\u201d for \nchildren with disabilities to bring discrimination \nclaims related to their education.  Id. at 1009 \n(emphasis added).   \n\n26 \n \n \nCrucially, though, Congress swiftly repudiated \nSmith\u2014and with it, Monahan\u2019s reasoning.  In 1985, \nCongress amended the EHA (now the IDEA) to \n\u201c\u2018reaffirm[] the viability\u2019 of federal statutes like the \nADA [and Rehabilitation Act] \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 \nno less integral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the \nrights of handicapped children.\u2019\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon \nCmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 161 (2017) (quoting H.R. \nRep. No. 99-296, at 4, 6 (1985)).  Now codified at \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), this IDEA amendment provides, \nin relevant part, that \u201c[n]othing in the [IDEA] shall \nbe construed to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, \nand remedies available under the Constitution, the \n[ADA], [Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal laws \nprotecting the rights of children with disabilities.\u201d  \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).   \n \nCongress thus expressly declared that the IDEA \ndoes not \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the ability of children with \ndisabilities to obtain relief under the ADA or \nRehabilitation Act.  Id.  Yet Monahan asserted that \nthe IDEA (formerly the EHA) requires interpreting \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act to require children \nwith disabilities to show bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment \nto \nprevail \non \neducation-related \ndiscrimination claims.  687 F.2d at 1171.  That is, \nMonahan interpreted the IDEA to \u201crestrict\u201d and \n\u201climit\u201d the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cremedies\u201d available to \nchildren like Ava under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  That is precisely what \nSection 1415(l) forbids.  So as the panel here \nrecognized, Congress \u201crejected Monahan\u2019s premise \njust a few years later.\u201d  See App.5a n.2. \n3. Monahan\u2019s rule singling out education-related \nclaims brought by children with disabilities is also \n\n27 \n \n \nfundamentally at odds with the purpose of the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act.   \nCongress perceived \u201c[d]iscrimination against the \nhandicapped\u201d to be \u201cmost often the product, not of \ninvidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295-96 (1985).  The baseline standards \nfor ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims respect that \nprinciple.  But Monahan\u2019s directive that children with \ndisabilities \nmust \nshow \nbad \nfaith \nor \ngross \nmisjudgment\u2014rather than the mere \u201cindifference,\u201d \n\u201cthoughtlessness,\u201d or \u201cbenign neglect\u201d required from \nother plaintiffs\u2014defies it.  Id.  By giving a free pass \nto actions driven by educational officials\u2019 \u201capathetic \nattitudes,\u201d Monahan immunized \u201cmuch of the conduct \nthat Congress sought to alter in passing the \nRehabilitation Act,\u201d as well as the ADA.  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 296-97.  And in so doing, Monahan imposed \nan artificial barrier to relief that is \u201cdifficult if not \nimpossible\u201d for children with disabilities to surmount.  \nId.; see also Knox, 62 F.4th at 1002. \nAll of this is anathema to the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s purpose of protecting people with \ndisabilities from passive mistreatment or neglect.  \nThere is simply no reason to think that Congress \nwanted to single out perhaps the most vulnerable \nsubset of such people\u2014school-age children\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment under laws enacted to combat \ndisability discrimination.  \nOf course, Monahan claimed to be implementing, \nrather than directly undermining, Congress\u2019s goals.  \nIt insisted that imposing a uniquely stringent \nstandard in this single context would strike \u201ca proper \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, \nthe responsibilities of state educational officials, and \n\n28 \n \n \nthe competence of courts to make judgments in \ntechnical fields,\u201d as \u201cCongress [supposedly] intended.\u201d  \n687 F.2d at 1171.  But Congress later made its intent \nclear, in unequivocal statutory text:  \u201cNothing\u201d in the \nIDEA \u201crestrict[s]\u201d or \u201climit[s]\u201d the \u201crights\u201d and \n\u201cremedies\u201d provided by the ADA or Rehabilitation \nAct.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); see supra at 25-26.   \nIn any event, Monahan\u2019s atextual appeal to policy \nmakes little sense, even on its own terms.  Monahan \ndoubted \n\u201cthe \ncompetence \nof \ncourts \nto \nmake \njudgments\u201d about decisions by \u201ceducational officials\u201d \nin this \u201ctechnical field[].\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  But the \nIDEA demands inquiry into the \u201cadequacy of a given\u201d \nchild\u2019s education\u2014and thus judicial examination of \nthe \u201cdecisions\u201d made by educational officials, with \nappropriate respect for the \u201cexpertise and the exercise \nof judgment by school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F. ex rel. \nJoseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 580 U.S. \n386, 404 (2017).  Such respectful examination of \nschools\u2019 decisionmaking is equally proper under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act.   \nMore fundamentally, just last Term this Court \nresoundingly rejected the notion, echoed in Monahan, \nthat some matters are simply too \u201ctechnical\u201d for \ncourts to review independently.  Loper Bright Enters. \nv. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244, 2267 (2024).  Federal \ncourts are surely capable of showing due respect for \neducational officials\u2019 experience and expertise while \nadjudicating discrimination claims in the school \nsetting\u2014just as they do in any other context.  It is a \nmistake to distort statutory text out of a misplaced \nfear that courts cannot responsibly decide cases \nimplicating sensitive or technical matters.  \nMonahan\u2019s atextual rule also leads to extremely \nbizarre results.  It requires pre-K, elementary, \n\n29 \n \n \nmiddle, and high school students suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act to prove bad faith or \ngross misjudgment.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-\nApple Valley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 968, \n972-73 (8th Cir. 2017).  But college students bringing \nthe same claims do not have to clear that hurdle, even \nin \ncircuits \nthat \napply \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard.  See, e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. \nHealth Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); \nSwanson v. Univ. of Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 \n(6th Cir. 2001); Mershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d \n1069, 1076-77 (8th Cir. 2006).  There is no good reason \nwhy a graduation ceremony should drastically alter \nthe \nstandard \nfor \ndemonstrating \ndisability \ndiscrimination in the educational context.  And \nnothing suggests that this nonsensical asymmetric \ntreatment was part of Congress\u2019s design.  \n4. In short, Monahan\u2019s \u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about \nCongress\u2019s intent was fundamentally misguided.  \nApp.5a n.2.  Small wonder, then, that Monahan has \nbeen sharply\u2014and widely\u2014criticized.  See, e.g., id.; \nKnox, 62 F.4th at 1002; Howell ex rel. Howell v. \nWaterford Pub. Schs., 731 F. Supp. 1314, 1318 \n(E.D. Mich. 1990); Mark C. Weber, Accidently on \nPurpose: Intent in Disability Discrimination Law, 56 \nB.C. L. Rev. 1417, 1456-60 (2015); Thomas Simmons, \nThe ADA Prima Facie Plaintiff: A Critical Overview of \nEighth Circuit Case Law, 47 Drake L. Rev. 761, \n822-23 & nn.370-71 (1999).   \nThis Court should now fix Monahan\u2019s error.  In \nrecent years, the Court has repeatedly enforced the \nplain text of federal civil rights statutes that protect \nmembers \nof \nsociety\u2014including \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities\u2014from discrimination.  See, e.g., Perez v. \nSturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 146-47 (2023); \n\n30 \n \n \nFry, 580 U.S. at 158; Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 399; \nMuldrow v. City of St. Louis, 601 U.S. 346, 355 (2024); \nGroff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468-70 (2023); Babb v. \nWilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 402 (2020); Mount Lemmon Fire \nDist. v. Guido, 586 U.S. 1, 6-8 (2018).  These decisions \nvindicate the promise of textualism as a method of \nstatutory interpretation that is \u201cneutral as a matter \nof politics and policy.\u201d  Brett M. Kavanaugh, Fixing \nStatutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. 2118, 2135 \n(2016). \nThis case calls for continuing that important work.  \nThe Court should grant review to enforce the plain \nmeaning of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nIII. The Question Presented Is Exceptionally \nImportant And Merits Review In This Case \nWhether children with disabilities must satisfy \nMonahan\u2019s \nuniquely \nstringent \nstandard \nwhen \nbringing education-related claims under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act is a critically important question of \nfederal law.  The issue \u201cholds consequences not just \nfor [Ava] but for a great many children with \ndisabilities and their parents.\u201d  Perez, 598 U.S. at 146.  \nThe question presented warrants this Court\u2019s review, \nand this case is an ideal vehicle for answering it. \n1. Far too many children with disabilities are \n\u201cshunted aside, hidden, and ignored\u201d while at school. \nChoate, 469 U.S. at 295-96.  When that happens, the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act provide crucial means of \n\u201cprotecting their interests,\u201d just as those statutes \nassist other plaintiffs facing disability discrimination \nin other contexts.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 159.  Yet under the \natextual standard pioneered by the Eighth Circuit, \nonly children with disabilities face an \u201cimpossibly \n\n31 \n \n \nhigh bar\u201d for obtaining much-needed relief under \nthese statutes.  Knox, 62 F.4th at 1002.   \nThat disparity matters.  It is hard enough for \nparents to muster the resources needed to fight for \ntheir child\u2019s federally protected rights and remediate \nlife-altering educational gaps in the meantime.  Yet \nfive circuits have erected an additional barrier to \nrelief, while blunting incentives for schools to fulfill \ntheir responsibilities in the first place. \nIn this case, Ava\u2019s parents spent years fighting for \nthe District to provide her the same reasonable \naccommodations that her prior school district in \nKentucky had provided without issue.  App.50a-51a.  \nBut over and over again, the District refused, offering \n\u201ca series of shifting explanations\u201d that had nothing to \ndo with Ava\u2019s \u201cindividual needs.\u201d  Id. at 50a, 57a.  The \ndecision below acknowledged this and other evidence \nshowing that the District had been \u201cnegligent or even \ndeliberately indifferent\u201d in denying the reasonable \naccommodations she desperately needed.  Id. at 3a.  \nThat should have been sufficient for Ava to obtain \nrelief, including compensatory damages, under both \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Id. at 5a n.2; see \nsupra at 6-7.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan, that\u2019s just not \nenough.\u201d  App.3a.   \nAva\u2019s experience is all too common.  A Westlaw \nsearch reveals hundreds of district court decisions \napplying Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act cases, with \nthe overwhelming majority denying relief.4  Whether \n \n4  See, e.g., S.F. v. Union Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 2024 WL \n1316229, at *3-4 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 27, 2024); Torres v. Stewart \nCnty. Sch. Sys., 2023 WL 6368186, at *5-6 (M.D. Tenn.

It is impossible to \noverstate the importance of the question presented to \nsome of the most vulnerable members of our society.   \n2. This case is a perfect vehicle for resolving these \nissues.  The outcome here turned entirely on the \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment test.  Under the \nnormal rules governing most ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct cases outside the educational context\u2014and that \nwould have governed here too if Ava had sued in the \nThird or Ninth Circuits\u2014Ava\u2019s claims would have \nsurvived summary judgment, as the decision below \nexplicitly acknowledged.

A.J.T. ex rel. A.T., 96 F.4th \n1062 (8th Cir. 2024).  But here, A.J.T. sued Osseo \nArea \nSchools \n(the \nDistrict) \nfor \ndisability \n\n2a \n \ndiscrimination.  The district court1 granted the \nDistrict\u2019s motion for summary judgment, and we \naffirm. \nA.J.T. has epilepsy, and her seizures are so severe \nin the morning that she can\u2019t go to school until noon.  \nHer parents asked for evening instruction to give her \na school day closer in length to that of her peers, but \nDistrict officials denied their repeated requests.  So \nA.J.T. sued through her parents, alleging violations of \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act and the \nAmericans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  The district \ncourt granted the District\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment, concluding that the District could not be \nheld liable because it did not act with bad faith or \ngross misjudgment. \nWe review a district court\u2019s grant of summary \njudgment de novo, affirming only if \u201cthere is no \ngenuine dispute as to any material fact and the \nmovant is entitled to judgment as a matter of law.\u201d  \nB.M. ex rel. Miller v. S. Callaway R\u2013II Sch. Dist., 732 \nF.3d 882, 886 (8th Cir. 2013) (quoting Fed. R. Civ. P. \n56(a)).  We view all facts in favor of A.J.T. and give \nher \u201cthe benefit of all reasonable inferences in the \nrecord.\u201d  Argenyi v. Creighton Univ., 703 F.3d 441, 446 \n(8th Cir. 2013). \nClaims under Section 504 and the ADA live and \ndie together, as \u201cthe enforcement, remedies, and \nrights are the same under both.\u201d  B.M., 732 F.3d at \n887 (citation omitted); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133.  Section 504 \nrequires federal grantees to give \u201cotherwise qualified\u201d \npeople with disabilities \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to their \n \n1  The Honorable Michael J.

Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 301, 105 S.Ct. 712, \n83 L.Ed.2d 661 (1985)); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  And Title \nII of the ADA requires public entities to provide \nmeaningful access to their services, programs, or \nactivities.  Segal v. Metro. Council, 29 F.4th 399, 404 \n(8th Cir. 2022); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  \u201cMeaningful \naccess\u201d often requires \u201creasonable accommodations.\u201d  \nChoate, 469 U.S. at 301, 105 S.Ct. 712. \nThat said, when the alleged ADA and Section 504 \nviolations are \u201cbased on educational services for \ndisabled children,\u201d a school district\u2019s simple failure to \nprovide a reasonable accommodation is not enough to \ntrigger liability.  B.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (citation \nomitted).  Rather, a plaintiff must prove that school \nofficials acted with \u201ceither bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment,\u201d Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164, \n1171 (8th Cir. 1982), which requires \u201c \u2018something \nmore\u2019 than mere non-compliance with the applicable \nfederal statutes,\u201d B.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (citation \nomitted).  The district\u2019s \u201cstatutory non-compliance \nmust \ndeviate \nso \nsubstantially \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional judgment, practice, or standards as to \ndemonstrate that [it] acted with wrongful intent.\u201d  Id. \nA.J.T. may have established a genuine dispute \nabout whether the district was negligent or even \ndeliberately indifferent, but under Monahan, that\u2019s \njust not enough.  She points out that her parents \nrepeatedly notified the District that its refusal to \nprovide evening instruction violated Section 504 and \nthe ADA.  And she says that the District violated \naccepted professional standards by failing to follow its \nown policies and procedures requiring its staff to \nreport, investigate, and respond to complaints of \ndiscrimination.  As evidence, she notes that the \n\n4a \n \nDistrict\u2019s Director of Student Services, who oversees \nSection 504 compliance, testified that she was \nunaware of the parents\u2019 complaints and did not know \nthat the District\u2019s policies permit at-home schooling \nas an accommodation.  But the Director\u2019s non-\ncompliance does not amount to a deviation \u201cso \nsubstantial[]\u201d that it demonstrates \u201cwrongful intent.\u201d  \nId. \nTrue, \u201cnotice of a student\u2019s disability coupled with \ndelay in implementing accommodations can show bad \nfaith \nor \ngross \nmisjudgment\u201d \nunder \nsome \ncircumstances.  Id. at 888; see also M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975, 982 (8th Cir. \n2003) (finding genuine dispute as to bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where school district knew about \ndisability-based harassment of a student, ignored the \nmother\u2019s repeated calls, offered patently unworkable \nsolutions, and reneged on its offer to cover \ntransportation costs to a new school after the student \ntransferred).  But here, the District did not ignore \nA.J.T.\u2019s needs or delay its efforts to address them, \neven if the efforts were inadequate.  District officials \nmet \nwith \nA.J.T.\u2019s \nparents \nand \nupdated \nher \nindividualized education program (IEP) each year.  \nHer IEP included a variety of services, like intensive \none-on-one instruction and a 15-minute extension of \nher school day so that she could safely leave after the \nhalls cleared.  And the District even offered 16 three-\nhour sessions at home each summer.  Regardless of \nwhether these actions were enough to provide \nmeaningful access, they do not show wrongful intent. \nA.J.T. has failed to identify conduct clearing \nMonahan\u2019s bar, so we are constrained to hold that \n\n5a \n \nsummary judgment was proper.2  We affirm the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment. \n \n \n \n \n2  Why do we have such a high bar for claims based on \neducational services when we require much less in other \ndisability-discrimination contexts?  See, e.g., Withers v. Johnson, \n763 F.3d 998, 1003 (8th Cir. 2014) (no intent required for failure-\nto-accommodate claim); Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d \n384, 388\u201389 (8th Cir. 2011) (deliberate indifference required for \ndamages); accord S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 260\u201365 (3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases).  The \nanswer is a lesson in why \u201c[w]e do not . . . add provisions to . . . \nfederal statute[s].\u201d  Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 U.S. 330, \n352, 130 S.Ct. 2295, 176 L.Ed.2d 1070 (2010). \nIn Monahan, we speculated that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s predecessor to limit Section 504\u2019s protections, and \nwithout any anchor in statutory text, we added a judicial gloss \non Section 504 to achieve that end.  687 F.2d at 1170\u201371.  \nCongress rejected Monahan\u2019s premise just a few years later.  See \nHandicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99\u2013\n372, 100 Stat. 796; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But nonetheless, its bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment rule spread like wildfire.  See I.Z.M. \nv. Rosemount\u2013Apple Valley\u2013Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 973 \nn.6 (8th Cir. 2017) (collecting cases). \nMonahan has been questioned.  See, e.g., Knox Cnty. v. M.Q., \n62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. 2023); Mark C.

INTRODUCTION \nPlaintiff AJT is a teenage girl with a severe form \nof epilepsy called Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome (\u201cLGS\u201d).  \nAs a result of her disability, AJT has significantly \ndiminished intellectual capacities and has seizures \nthroughout the day.  Since moving to Defendant \n\n7a \n \nOsseo School District (\u201cthe District\u201d) in 2015 from \nKentucky when she was in fourth grade, AJT and the \nDistrict have agreed that she is unable to begin school \nuntil noon due to morning seizure activity. \nIn 2021, an administrative law judge (\u201cALJ\u201d) held \na hearing (\u201cthe administrative hearing\u201d), found the \nDistrict had violated the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (\u201cIDEA\u201d), and ordered the District to \nprovide \nAJT \nwith \neye \ngaze \ntechnology \nand \ncompensatory hours of education, among other \nthings.  (Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 20.)  On \nSeptember 13, 2022, the Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s \nDecision.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., Civil File No. \n21-1453 (MJD/DTS), 2022 WL 4226097, at *21 (Sept. \n13, 2022) [hereinafter, \u201cOsseo Area Schools\u201d]. \nIn the instant case, Plaintiffs assert three claims \nagainst the District:  (1) violations of the IDEA; \n(2) violations of Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act \nof 1973, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (\u201c\u00a7 504\u201d); and (3) violations of \nthe Americans with Disabilities Act (\u201cthe ADA\u201d). \n(Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-47.) \nCurrently before the Court is the District\u2019s Motion \nfor Summary Judgement.  (Doc. 31.)  The Court heard \noral argument via Zoom on October 12, 2022. \nAs discussed in detail below, the evidence in the \nrecord supports granting Defendants\u2019 Motion for \nSummary Judgment.  Even assuming AJT was denied \nthe benefits of a program or activity of a public entity \nreceiving federal funds and/or discriminated against \nbased on her disability, the District did not act with \nbad faith or gross misjudgment when making \neducational decisions regarding AJT.  In addition, \neven if the District took all the actions Plaintiffs \nallege it took, there is no evidence it did so to retaliate \n\n8a \n \nagainst AJT\u2019s parents for their advocacy on behalf of \nAJT.  Finally, Plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA claims are foreclosed \nfor a number of reasons.  Thus, the District\u2019s Motion \nfor Summary Judgment is granted. \nII. BACKGROUND \nThe facts of the case are well-known to the Court \nand the Parties and detailed in the Court\u2019s Order in \nOsseo Area Schools.  The Court only includes facts \nhere that are relevant to discussion of the instant \nmotion.  The relevant facts relate to AJT\u2019s elementary \nand middle school schedules.  The Parties have \nbriefed another motion related to AJT\u2019s high school \nschedule.  See Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., No. CV 21-\n1453 (MJD/DTS), 2022 WL 17082826, at *1 (D. Minn. \nNov. 18, 2022) (Order Denying Def\u2019s Motion for an \nOrder to Show Cause Why Pl. Should Not be Found \nin Contempt) [hereinafter, Osseo Area Schs. II]. \nA. Scheduled \nSchool \nDay \nin \nKentucky \nVersus in Minnesota \nAccording to the Amended Complaint, while a \nstudent in Kentucky, AJT received instruction from \nthe public school from noon until 6:00 p.m. each day, \nmostly in-school but supplemented with hours of \ninstruction in her home, which resulted in the same \nnumber of instructional hours as her nondisabled \npeers.  (Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 42-43.)  AJT\u2019s school days \nalways began at noon. \nFor the most part, a typical school day for a \nstudent in the District is 6.50 hours.  That has been \nthe goal for AJT\u2019s parents, AT and GT, since they \nmoved to the District.  However, due to AJT\u2019s \nunavailability for instruction before noon, the District \nnever \nprovided \nAJT \n6.50 \nhours \nof \nin-school \ninstruction. \n\n9a \n \nAfter several negotiations including different \nproposed IEPs, AJT has been in school 4 hours and 15 \nminutes each day for most of her years in the District \nreceiving intensive special education services.  She \nalways has one or two adults working solely with her \nproviding services and working on her learning goals.  \n(Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 9.) \nB. Negotiations Between AJT\u2019s Parents and \nthe District \nPlaintiffs assert that before the family moved from \nKentucky to Minnesota, they received assurances \nfrom the District that it would adopt AJT\u2019s Kentucky \nIEP \u201cin its entirety.\u201d  (AT Aff. \u00b6 12.) \nWhen AJT entered the District in October 2015, \nthe IEP team, including AJT\u2019s parents, agreed that \nstarting the school day at noon was appropriate given \nAJT\u2019s individual needs.  (Def. Ex. 16 (Oct. 16, 2015 \nPrior Written Notice (\u201cPWN\u201d)) at 2 (stating that AJT \n\u201ccan not [sic] come to school in the morning due to her \nseizure activity through the night and in the \nmorning\u201d).) \nWhen AJT\u2019s IEP team first met in 2015, the \nDistrict proposed an IEP that \u201cgenerally accepted the \ngoals and objectives on AJT\u2019s most recent IEP from \nKentucky.\u201d  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, at \n*4.  AJT\u2019s parents requested two more IEP meetings, \nwhich were held on October 14 and 20, 2015.  At the \nOctober 14 meeting, AT asked if the school would \nprovide support in the evening and was told that the \nschool did \u201cnot provide both homebound and school \nsupport (modified).\u201d  (Pl. Ex. D at 2.)  The District\u2019s \nnotes from the October 14, 2015 IEP team meeting \nstate that AT said that he felt the District\u2019s failure to \nprovide educational support in the evening \u201cmight \n\n10a \n \nconflict with the ADA.  He wants statute.  His position \n[was] that [AJT] can handle a full day, it just can\u2019t \nstart until noon.\u201d  (Id.) \nFollowing those meetings, the District proposed an \nIEP that accepted the goals and objectives from AJT\u2019s \nKentucky IEP and included minutes of special \neducation service commensurate with those in the \nKentucky IEP.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, \nat *4.  The Kentucky IEP called for 125 minutes of \nspecial education in school daily and 90 minutes of in-\nhome special education daily, for a total of 215 \nminutes of special education instruction per day.  \n(Def. Ex. 9 at 8.)  The District\u2019s IEP included 240 \nminutes of direct special education daily and 20 \nminutes of direct speech services weekly.  (Def. Ex. \n11.) \nDuring AJT\u2019s years in the District, the Parties had \nseveral IEP meetings and the District issued more \nPWNs.  At one point, AJT\u2019s parents complained \u201cthe \nDistrict has not scheduled sufficient IEP team \nmeetings to discuss appropriate accommodations . . . \nand/or engage[d] in the interactive process\u201d to meet \nAJT\u2019s needs.  (Def. Ex. 10 at 1.)  After negotiation, the \nParties agreed that AJT\u2019s school day would be from \nnoon to 4:15 p.m., which was extended after the usual \nelementary school day ended at 4:00 p.m.  The IEP \ncontaining this schedule was the last-agreed upon \nIEP between the Parties\u2014the \u201cstay-put\u201d IEP that \nremained in place during the pendency of disputes \nbetween the Parties.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *5.  Thus, AJT\u2019s school days have been \n4.25 hours rather than the 6.50 hours her parents \nrequested. \nBeginning in February 2018, in preparation for \nAJT\u2019s transition from elementary school to middle \n\n11a \n \nschool, AJT\u2019s parents met with Former District \nSpecial Education Site Coordinator Joy Fredrickson \nto discuss AJT\u2019s middle school day.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 27.)  A \ntypical middle school day ends at 2:40 p.m. and AJT\u2019s \nparents were \u201cdistraught\u201d to learn that AJT would \nhave shorter school days in middle school.  (Id.)  On \nMarch 16, AJT\u2019s parents again met with Fredrickson \nand provided six options for 4.25-hour middle school \ndays for AJT.  (Id. \u00b6 28.)  On April 3, the District sent \nAT and GT a PWN proposing a noon to 3:00 p.m. \nschool day.  (Id. \u00b6 29.)  At an April 5, 2018 IEP \nmeeting, AJT\u2019s parents found it \u201cincredible\u201d that the \nDistrict \u201cmade the decision to reduce hours before \n[they] had an IEP Team meeting to discuss program \ngoals and objectives for the next year, [AJT\u2019s] needs \nor whether she needed a shortened day.\u201d  (Id. \u00b6 30.)  \nIn the end, AJT\u2019s middle school day schedule \ncontinued to be from 12:00 to 4:15 p.m. under the \nstay-put IEP.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, \nat *5. \nOn April 23, 2018, AT sent an email to the District \nstating that he felt the District\u2019s acts were \ndiscriminatory and retaliatory based, in part, on \nAJT\u2019s \u201cdisability . . . and or parental protected \nactivity\u201d of advocating for AJT during the IEP \nprocess.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 31.)  AT attested that \u201cjust as in \nyears prior,\u201d the District did not investigate or resolve \nhis complaints and did not provide him with its \nnondiscrimination policy or complaint procedures.  \n(Id. \u00b6 32.)  He avers that this is when the District \nbegan treating him differently.  (Id. \u00b6 33.)  On April \n30, 2018, AT sent an email to Fredrickson stating, \ninter alia, that he had filed complaints with the \nMinnesota Department of Education (\u201cMDE\u201d), the \nU.S. Department of Education Office for Civil Rights, \n\n12a \n \nand the U.S. Department of Justice Civil Rights \nDivision.  (Id. \u00b6 35; Def. Ex. 23.)  This dispute was \napparently resolved by \u201cthe Parties agreeing to an \nIndependent Education Evaluation (IEE) of [AJT by \nDr. Reichle], and a later triennial evaluation, and \nusing these materials to guide later educational \nplanning.\u201d  (Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 3-4.) \nThroughout the process, the District has refused \nto provide evening instruction because, variously, the \nDistrict does not provide \u201cboth homebound and school \nsupport\u201d (Pl. Ex. D (Dist. Oct. 14, 2015 IEP meeting \nnotes) at 2); state law does not mandate it (Def. Ex. \n16 (Oct. 16, 2015 PWN) at 2); and/or the District was \nworried about the precedent it would start not only in \nthe District, but for area school districts (Def. Ex. 18 \n(June 6, 2016 PWN) at 1). \nEach year, AJT\u2019s parents provide the District with \na letter from AJT\u2019s treating neurologist requesting \nthat she be \u201cexempted from school attendance before \nnoon in order to manage her seizure activity.\u201d  Osseo \nArea Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, at *5 (cleaned up).  The \nDistrict offers to serve AJT whenever she is available \nduring the regular school day, including before 12:00 \np.m.  (See, e.g., Def. Ex. 22 (April 2, 2018 PWN) at 2.) \nC. Dr. Joe Reichle\u2019s IEE and Trial Tests \nIn 2019, at the Parties\u2019 request, Dr. Joe Reichle \nconducted an independent educational evaluation \n(\u201cIEE\u201d) of AJT.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, \nat *7.  Among Dr. Reichle\u2019s recommendations was as \nmuch instruction time as possible \u201cduring [AJT\u2019s] \nalert \nhours,\u201d \nwhich \noptimally \nare \n\u201cbetween \napproximately noon and 6:00 p.m.\u201d  Id. (brackets in \noriginal). \n\n13a \n \nIn autumn 2020, AJT\u2019s parents hired Dr. Reichle \nto conduct a series of discrete trial tests \u201cto assess how \ninterventions in the mid and late afternoons might \nimpact [AJT\u2019s] learning.\u201d  Id. (brackets in original). \nDr. Reichel performed trials of late afternoon \ninstruction from 4:15 to 5:30 p.m. in AJT\u2019s home, \nwhich he compared to instruction conducted in AJT\u2019s \nhome from noon to 1:15 p.m.  Id.  During the trials, \nAJT made gains on skills she was learning in school. \nId. \nD. Statements Made by Special Education \nDirector Katheryn (\u201cKate\u201d) M. Emmons \nAJT\u2019s parents have participated in many meetings \nwith her IEP team and District officials, including the \nDistrict\u2019s highest special education administrator, \nSpecial Education Director Kate Emmons, to ask that \nAJT receive a full day of school beginning at noon. \n(Amend. Compl. \u00b6 59; AT Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 17-32.) \nIn her role, Emmons develops and promotes \nsuitable procedures for \u201cidentification, evaluation, \nand instructional programming of children eligible for \nSpecial Education . . . services\u201d and evaluates \u201cthe \nschool system\u2019s approaches and students\u2019 responses to \nspecialized programs for children not achieving in \nspecial . . . education programs,\u201d among other duties.  \n(Pl. Ex. G at 3 (Emmons\u2019 Position Description).)1  She \nis also \u201cresponsible for program development, \ncoordination, and evaluation; in-service training; and \ngeneral \nspecial \neducation \nsupervision \nand \nadministration.\u201d  (Id. at 15 (District Total Special \n \n1  Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit G contains many documents and is \ndivided into several parts (G1, G2, G3, etc.) in the Court\u2019s \nCMECF filing system. \n\n14a \n \nEducation System).)  Emmons is not only responsible \nfor the District\u2019s special education programs but also \noversees implementation and enforcement of Section \n504, which prohibits a federally-funded program from \ndiscriminating against a disabled individual solely by \nreason of that person\u2019s disability.  (Def. Ex. 1 \n(Emmons Dep.) at 41-42)2; 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).)  She \nsupervises Coordinators who, among other things, \nensure compliance with policies, procedures, and \nrules.  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons Dep.) at 15-26.) \nEmmons testified that District policy requires \ninvestigation \nof \nall \ncomplaints \nof \ndisability \ndiscrimination but that she was unaware of any \ninvestigation regarding AJT.  (Id. at 70-71.)  The \nDistrict\u2019s Nondiscrimination Policy 102 requires \ndiscrimination complaints be reported to the \u00a7 504 \nCoordinator, whom Emmons testified was Jill Lesn\u00e9.  \n(Id. at 48-49; Pl. Ex. G2 (Osseo Area Schools \nEmployee Handbook) at 50.) \nAlthough the Employee Handbook listed Emmons \nas the \u00a7 504 Coordinator in 2020-21, she testified she \nwas not and did not know why the Handbook stated \nshe was.  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons Dep.) at 49.)  Emmons \ntestified that she would report any discrimination she \nbecame aware of to Ms. Lesn\u00e9.  (Id. at 48-49.)  \nEmmons \nnoted \nthat \nit \nis \nevery \nemployee\u2019s \nresponsibility \nto \ncomply \nwith \nthe \nDistrict\u2019s \nnondiscrimination \npolicies \nand \neveryone\u2019s \nresponsibility to report noncompliance with \u00a7 504 \n \n2  Plaintiffs cited pages of Plaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit G that did not \ncontain this information.  (See Doc. 38 at 11 n.20.)  It was obvious \nto the Court that this and other information cited to Plaintiffs\u2019 \nExhibit G came from Emmons\u2019 deposition, which is Defendants\u2019 \nExhibit 1.  The Court has corrected the citations. \n\n15a \n \nonce they are aware of it.  (Id. at 44-45, 56.)  On the \nother hand, she testified that IDEA disputes would be \nhandled via other avenues such as conciliation \nconferences and mediation.  (Id. at 48.) \nAt Emmons\u2019 deposition, Plaintiffs\u2019 Counsel noted \nthat the District\u2019s Total Special Education System \n(\u201cTSES\u201d) says that \u201cstudents can have a combination \nof alternate methods of instruction, including \nhomebound and in-person instruction.\u201d  (Id. at 176-\n77.)  Emmons responded, \u201cNo, where is that?  We \nmight have to modify that.\u201d  (Id. at 177; see also Pl. \nEx. G at 23 (TSES) (\u201cProgram alternatives are \ncomprised of the type of services provided, the setting \nin which services occur. . . .  A pupil may receive \nspecial education services in more than one \nalternative based on the IEP.\u201d) (emphasis added).) \nWhen asked about a discrimination investigation \ninvolving AJT in her deposition, Emmons stated she \nknew nothing about it.  However, AT attests that he \nand GT met with her more than once to complain \nabout discriminatory treatment toward AJT.  (AT Aff. \n\u00b6 50.)  He states that Emmons\u2019 response was to tell \nthem to hire a personal care attendant (\u201cPCA\u201d) after \nschool hours instead of extending AJT\u2019s school day, \nwhich \u201creflect[ed] stereotyped misperceptions that \n[AJT] was not worthy of a full day of instruction.\u201d  \n(Id.)  Plaintiffs assert that other school employees also \ndisclaimed knowledge of AJT\u2019s parents\u2019 complaints \nregarding the number of hours of instruction she \nreceived every day.  (Doc. 38 at 11 (citing AT Aff; \nEmmons Dep.; Ex. G to Goetz Aff., all without \npinpoint citations).)  The only support for this \nstatement in AT\u2019s Affidavit is AT\u2019s assertion that he \nand GT met with Emmons.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 50.) \n\n16a \n \nE. Expert Reports \nAJT filed one expert report and updates thereto \nand the District filed three expert reports.  In relevant \npart, the reports provide the following opinions. \n1. Dr. Joe Reichle\u2019s Expert Reports \nDr. Joe Reichle, opined, in brief, \u201cthe lack of a full \nschool day has significantly contributed to limit \n[AJT\u2019s] learning opportunities\u201d and that there was a \nlack \nof \na \ncomprehensive \naugmentative \ncommunication plan resulting from a comprehensive \nassessment of AJT\u2019s needs both prior to his 2019 \nassessment and after the ALJ\u2019s 2021 Decision.  (Pl. \nEx. F at 3-4.)  He explained that when he designed his \nDecember 2019 communication trial, he considered \nmorning, early afternoon, and late afternoon sessions \nto compare \u201cperformance as a function of time of day,\u201d \nbut AJT\u2019s parents were unwilling to take this \n\u201csubstantial health risk\u201d based on their physicians\u2019 \nopinions \u201cregarding the potential danger of disrupting \nAJT\u2019s sleep pattern.\u201d   (Pl. Ex. F2 at 12.)  He noted \nthat \u201cDr. Breningstall and his predecessors are \nphysicians directed by medical knowledge and \nexperience.  Their recommendations and support of \nthe parents\u2019 position . . . led to [him conducting] only \nearly p.m. and late p.m. . . . sessions.\u201d  (Id. at 13.) \n2. The District\u2019s Experts \na)  Dr. Wills\u2019 Expert Reports \nDr. Karen Wills is a neuropsychologist and is \nlicensed to practice clinical psychology in Minnesota.  \n(Def. Ex. 2 at 1.)  Dr. Wills stated that parents \nperceive their children \u201cthrough rose colored glasses\u201d \nand overestimate their competencies.  (Id. at 3.)  In \nrelevant part, Dr. Wills opined that AJT\u2019s rate of \nprogress was not demonstrably better in Kentucky \n\n17a \n \nthan in the District, that AJT has not regressed since \nenrolling in the District, and that most of AJT\u2019s fellow \nstudents\u2019 instructional days include non-instructional \ntime.  (Id. at 3-7, 11, 15). \nb)  Marcy Doud\u2019s Expert Report \nThe District did not provide Marcy Doud\u2019s \ncredentials.  (Def. Ex. 28.)  Doud opined that \u201cgiven \n[AJT\u2019s] disabilities and abilities and her medical \nneeds,\u201d the District chose a reasonable course of \neducation \nand \n1:1 \ninstruction \nwith \nlimited \ndistractions was the \u201csingle common denominator\u201d for \nAJT\u2019s optimal learning environment, regardless of \nthe time.  (Id. \u00b6 6.)  She also stated that AT was at the \nIEP meeting where the IEP with the 12:00 to 4:15 \nschool day was proposed, that AJT\u2019s parents received \nthe PWN stating that the IEP would be implemented \nunless they objected, and that they did not do so.  (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 12-13.) \nc)  Howard C. Shane, Ph.D\u2019s Expert \nReport \nDr. \nShane \nis \nan \nassociate \nprofessor \nof \notolaryngology at Harvard Medical School.  (Def. Ex. \n29 at 1.)  Dr. Shane stated that the central question \nin this case is how AJT\u2019s school day is divided between \nhome and school.  (Id.)  He opined that without a \nsystematic review of AJT\u2019s seizure pattern across \nseveral different weekdays and weekend days over \ntime, it is impossible to make definitive conclusions \nabout the best times for AJT to learn.  (Id. at 2.)  He \nnotes that a table by school staff tracking AJT\u2019s \nseizures during school hours for a month in 2021 \nshowed AJT had multiple seizures in the afternoons \nat school, some so severe that she could not return to \ninstruction.  (Id. at 2-3.)  Since AJT has regular \n\n18a \n \nafternoon seizures at school, Dr. Shane states that \u201cit \ndoes not seem practical\u201d to base AJT\u2019s schedule \u201con \nparental \nreporting \n(or \npreference) \nof \nseizure \nfrequency and severity during the morning and \ncertainly not without a careful analysis of the \noccurrence and severity of seizure activity in the \n[morning].\u201d  (Id. at 4, 16.) \nOther facts will be discussed as necessary \nE. Desired Relief \nThe District has filed a motion for summary \njudgment.  Although Plaintiffs have not filed a similar \nmotion, they nonetheless assert they are entitled to \nsummary judgement.  In the alternative, Plaintiffs \nargue that issues of material fact exist that make \nsummary judgment for the District inappropriate. \nIII. DISCUSSION \nA. Summary Judgment Standard \nSummary judgment is appropriate if, viewing all \nfacts in the light most favorable to the non-moving \nparty, there is no genuine dispute as to any material \nfact, and the moving party is entitled to judgment as \na matter of law.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 56(a); Celotex Corp. \nv. Catrett, 477 U.S. 317, 322-23 (1986).  The party \nseeking summary judgment bears the burden of \nshowing that there is no disputed issue of material \nfact.  Celotex, 477 U.S. at 323.  \u201cA dispute is genuine \nif the evidence is such that it could cause a reasonable \njury to return a verdict for either party; a fact is \nmaterial if its resolution affects the outcome of the \ncase.\u201d  Amini v. City of Minneapolis, 643 F.3d 1068, \n1074 (8th Cir. 2011) (citation omitted). \n\n19a \n \nB. ADA and Rehabilitation Act Claims \n1. Legal Standards \nTitle II of the ADA prohibits public entities \nfrom discriminating based on disability in \nservices, programs, or activities. Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act provides that \u201c[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability \n. . . shall, solely by reason of her or his \ndisability, be excluded from the participation \nin, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination under any program or activity \nreceiving Federal financial assistance.\u201d  These \nstatutes provide[] the same rights, procedures, \nand remedies against discrimination. \nI.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple Valley-Eagan Pub. Schs., \n863 F.3d 966, 972 (8th Cir. 2017) (alterations in \noriginal) (internal citations omitted). Claims under \nthe ADA and Section 504 are analyzed using the same \nstandard.  See AP v. Anoka-Hennepin ISD No. 11, 538 \nF. Supp. 2d 1125, 1139 (D. Minn. 2008). \nA plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case . . . requires a \nshowing that the plaintiff (1) was a qualified \nindividual with a disability; (2) was denied the \nbenefits of a program or activity of a public \nentity receiving federal funds; and (3) was \ndiscriminated against based on [her] disability.  \nMore specifically, we have said that a claim \nunder \u00a7 504 in the context of education of \nhandicapped children requires parents to show \nthat the school district acted in bad faith or \nwith \ngross \nmisjudgment \nby \ndeparting \nsubstantially \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, \npractice \nor \nstandards \nas \nto \n\n20a \n \ndemonstrate that those responsible actually did \nnot base the decision on such a judgment. \nEst. of Barnwell v. Watson, 880 F.3d 998, 1004 (8th \nCir. 2018) (citations omitted). \nIn this case, there is no dispute that AJT is a \nqualified individual with a disability.  In addition, \nelements 2 and 3 are inextricably intertwined because \nPlaintiffs assert AJT was denied the same length \nschool day as her nondisabled peers based on her \ndisability.  However, even assuming AJT was denied \nthe benefits of a program or activity of a public entity \nreceiving federal funds and discriminated against \nbased on her disability, Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments fail \nbecause the District did not act with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment. \n2. Bad Faith or Gross Misjudgment \n\u201c[W]here alleged ADA and \u00a7 504 violations are \nbased on educational services for disabled children, \nthe plaintiff must prove that school officials acted in \nbad faith or with gross misjudgment.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. \nMiller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, \n887 (8th Cir. 2013) (quotation omitted).  Something \nmore than a \u201cmere violation of the IDEA must be \nshown to demonstrate a violation of \u00a7 504.\u201d  Brantley \nex rel. Brantley v. ISD No. 625, 936 F. Supp. 649, 657 \n(D. Minn. 1996). \na) Plaintiffs\u2019 Arguments \nPlaintiffs argue that intent should not be required \nin failure to accommodate claims for disability \ndiscrimination in elementary or secondary education \nbecause (1) intent is not a burden imposed by \u00a7 504 or \nthe ADA or their interpretive regulations and is not \nrequired in all circuits; (2) requiring intent is contrary \nto Supreme Court precedent stating that intent is not \n\n21a \n \na required element of disability discrimination claims \n(citing Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295, 309 \n(1985) (a case dealing with reduction in Medicaid \nbenefits); (3) Eighth Circuit precedent does not \nrequire intent in employment or post-secondary \neducation reasonable accommodation claims and \nthere is no reason to treat elementary and secondary \neducation claims differently; and (4) proof of intent is \nnot required in other jurisdictions (citing Ability Ctr. \nv. City of Sandusky, 385 F.3d 901, 912 (6th Cir. 2004); \nHenrietta D. v. Bloomberg, 331 F.3d 261, 277-78 (2d \nCir. 2003); Ridgewood Bd. of Educ. v. N.E. ex rel. \nM.E., 172 F.3d 238, 253 (3d Cir. 1999); Washington v. \nInd. High Sch. Athletic Ass\u2019n Inc., 181 F.3d 840, 846 \n(7th Cir. 1999)). (Doc. 38 at 31-33.) \nWhile Plaintiffs admit that the Eighth Circuit \nrequires proof of intent in disability discrimination in \neducation cases based on failure to accommodate and \ndisparate treatment claims, they argue that in failure \nto accommodate claims, the standard is \u201csoftened,\u201d \nrequiring \u201conly notice of the need for a reasonable \naccommodation and school district inaction, delay, or \nineffective action.\u201d  (Id. (citing M.P. v. ISD No. 721, \n326 F.3d 975, 982-83 (8th Cir. 2003)). \nIn M.P., the court held that a jury could find that \na school district acted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment when it failed to answer a mother\u2019s \ndaily phone calls about bullying her son suffered due \nto a district employee making his schizophrenia \ndiagnosis public and never taking steps to protect the \nboy\u2019s safety and academic interests after knowing \nabout the bullying. 326 F.3d at 982-83.  Plaintiffs \nassert that M.P. is similar to this case because \nPlaintiffs also raised issues of \u201cfailure to provide \nreasonable accommodations at school, failure to \n\n22a \n \ninvestigate complaints of disability discrimination, \nand failure to take appropriate and effective remedial \nmeasures upon notice to school authorities.\u201d  (Doc. 38 \nat 37.)  Plaintiffs note that in M.P., the court held that \n\u201c[u]nder some circumstances, notice of a student\u2019s \ndisability coupled with delay in implementing \naccommodations can show bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  (Id. at 38.) \nPlaintiffs argue that under either a disparate \ntreatment theory or failure to accommodate approach, \nthe District discriminated against them with bad \nfaith, a gross departure from professional standards, \nand deliberate indifference.  (Id. at 37 (citing, inter \nalia, M.P., 326 F.3d at 982; Monahan v. State of Neb., \n687 F.2d 1164, 1171 (8th Cir. 1982).)  Plaintiffs assert \nthat \u201cignoring six years of disability discrimination \ncomplaints by A.T. and G.T. was not within the scope \nof professionally acceptable choices because the \nDistrict\u2019s own policies expressly prohibit that \nresponse.\u201d  (Id. at 34-35.)  Plaintiffs state that the \nDistrict fails to meet its initial burden to establish a \nlack of discriminatory intent. \nPlaintiffs also argue that the familiar McDonnell \nDouglas burden-shifting analysis used in employment \ndiscrimination cases is appropriate in this case and \nthat they have evidence sufficient to survive \nsummary judgment under this analysis.  (Id. at 39.) \nb) Analysis \nBefore \nreaching \nthe \nmerits \nof \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \narguments, two threshold issues must be decided: \n(1) whether the employment cases cited by Plaintiffs \nare inapposite and (2) whether the \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard championed by Plaintiffs is \n\n23a \n \nproper for a challenge to a student\u2019s educational \nprogramming. \ni. Plaintiffs\u2019 Employment Cases are \nInapposite \nPlaintiffs cite several employment cases that only \nrequire plaintiffs to prove defendants failed to provide \na \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d to survive summary \njudgment.  (Id. at 27, 32.)  It is inappropriate to rely \non these cases.  See Frequently Asked Questions \nAbout Section 504 and the Education of Children with \nDisabilities, 111 LRP 76408 (OCR 2011) at 11 \n(courtesy copy provided as attachment to Defendant\u2019s \nReply).  The Department of Education (\u201cthe DOE\u201d) \ncautions that the term \u201creasonable accommodation\u201d is \n\u201ca term used in the employment context\u201d that is \n\u201csometimes used incorrectly to refer to related aids \nand services in the elementary and secondary school \ncontext . . . .\u201d  Id.  Opinions from agencies are entitled \nto at least some deference. Doe v. Osseo Area Sch. \nDist., 296 F. Supp. 3d 1090, 1098 (D. Minn. 2017) \n(citing Thomas Jefferson Univ. v. Shalala, 512 U.S. \n504, \n512 \n(1994)) \n(holding \nthat \nan \nagency\u2019s \ninterpretation of its own regulations is entitled to \n\u201csubstantial deference\u201d); see also 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33 \n(schools are required to provide a free appropriate \npublic education (\u201cFAPE\u201d) to disabled students, not \n\u201creasonable accommodations\u201d).  Deference to the DOE \nis especially reasonable here where the McDonnell \nDouglas analysis from employment law could have \nbeen adopted into the education discrimination \ncontext and the courts declined to do so. \n\n24a \n \nii. The Correct Liability Standard is \n\u201cBad \nFaith \nor \nGross \nMisjudgment\u201d \nPlaintiffs assert they need only prove that \nPlaintiffs acted with \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d to \nestablish their prima facie case.  However, the Eighth \nCircuit \n. . . held in AP v. Anoka\u2013Hennepin Indep. \nSchool Dist. No. 11 that bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment is an element of a disability-\ndiscrimination claim only in the context of \nsubstantive challenges to a disabled child\u2019s \nindividualized education plan.  In cases not \ninvolving challenges to educational services, \na showing of deliberate indifference on the \ndefendant\u2019s \npart \nis \nnecessary\u2014and \nsufficient\u2014to recover the compensatory \ndamages under the ADA or \u00a7 504 . . . . \nHough v.

Mar. 26, 2020) (applying deliberate \nindifference \nstandard \nin \nclaim \nfor \nmedical \naccommodation in school). \nThis case is based on Plaintiffs\u2019 dissatisfaction \nwith AJT\u2019s educational services.  Even the retaliation \n\n25a \n \nclaim, discussed below, is inextricably intertwined \nwith the provision of educational services.  M.P., cited \nby Plaintiffs is distinguishable because that case \ninvolved a school district\u2019s deliberate indifference to a \nmother\u2019s pleas for help for her bullied son.  326 F.3d \nat 982-83.  The Eighth Circuit found the \u201calleged \nfailure to protect M.P. from unlawful discrimination \non the basis of his disability is a claim . . . wholly \nunrelated to the IEP process.\u201d  M.P. v. ISD No. 721, \n439 F.3d 865, 868 (8th Cir. 2006) [M.P. II] (\u201cAlthough \nthe Eighth Circuit applied the bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment standard in M.P., the court only did so \nbecause the parties assumed that to be the standard \nand the court never discussed the deliberate \nindifference standard that has been applied to claims \nof student-on-student harassment since M.P. was \ndecided.\u201d). \niii. The District did not Act with Bad \nFaith or Gross Misjudgment \nIn order to establish bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment, a plaintiff must show that the \ndefendant\u2019s conduct departed substantially \nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice \nor standards so as to demonstrate that the \npersons responsible actually did not base the \ndecision on such a judgment.  Because the ADA \nand \u00a7 504 do not create general tort liability for \neducational malpractice, bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment requires \u201csomething more\u201d than \nmere non-compliance with the applicable \nfederal statutes.  The defendant\u2019s statutory \nnon-compliance must deviate so substantially \nfrom accepted professional judgment, practice, \nor standards as to demonstrate that the \ndefendant acted with wrongful intent. \n\n26a \n \nB.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (cleaned up) (citations omitted). \nPlaintiffs argue that when the District ignored six \nyears of disability discrimination complaints by AJT\u2019s \nparents, it violated the District\u2019s own policies and its \nactions \nwere \nnot \nwithin \nthe \nscope \nof \nany \nprofessionally-acceptable choices available to the \nDistrict.  As evidence, Plaintiffs state, without \ncitation, that \u201call\u201d District officials testified regarding \ntheir professional obligations to know and comply \nwith the law and to ensure that all discrimination \nclaims are investigated and resolved \u201cpursuant to \ntheir licenses, position descriptions, and District \npolicies.\u201d  (Doc. 38 at 4.)  They also aver that while the \nDistrict\u2019s \nSuperintendent, \nEmmons, \nand \n\u00a7 504 \nCoordinator all expressed ignorance of the Plaintiffs\u2019 \ndiscrimination complaints; lack of District response; \nand even any knowledge of the dispute, the following \nevidence undermines those claims: \n1) The professional licensing obligations of each \nofficial to know and comply with the IDEA, \n\u00a7 504, and the ADA; \n2)  The position descriptions of each official that \nrequires them to know and comply with the \nIDEA, \u00a7 504 and the ADA and to supervise and \nensure compliance by other staff, including \nCoordinators; \n3)  District \npolicies \nrequiring \ninvestigation, \nparental notice of rights, and correction of any \ndiscrimination complaint, formal or informal, \nwritten or verbal, by every District employee; \nand \n4)  The documentation of disability complaints \nand credible testimony of AT that he met with \nand communicated directly with various \n\n27a \n \nCoordinators, \nthe \nSuperintendent, \nand \nEmmons about complaints. \n(Id. at 6-7 (emphasis in original).)  Plaintiffs further \nassert, without support, \u201cThe testimony at [the \nadministrative] \nhearing \nestablished \nthat \nthe \nDistrict\u2019s [Special Education Site] Coordinator, Joy \nFredrickson, acted for years at the direction of a \nsource outside of the IEP Team as corroborated by all \nIEP Team members including AJT\u2019s teachers and \nParents.\u201d  (Id. at 5 (emphasis in original).) \nRegarding licensing, position descriptions, and \ndistrict policies, other than information related to \nEmmons, Plaintiffs only state, \nEach \nDistrict \nofficial \ndid \ntestify \nto \nestablished \nprofessional \nstandards, \nincluding licensing obligations and position \ndescriptions that require knowledge of the \nlaws that prohibit disability discrimination, \nand of their professional obligations to \nensure compliance with District policies that \nrequire reporting, investigation, notice to \nparents of rights, and correction of disability \ndiscrimination complaints, written or verbal, \nformal or informal. \n(Doc. 38 at 11-12 n.21 (emphasis in original) \n(\u201cDeposition of Kate Emmons, Ex. G to Goetz \nAffidavit; and Tharpe Affidavit.\u201d).)  The Court is \nunable to find support for these claims in the \nvoluminous documents Plaintiffs cite to support \nthem. See Gardner v. First Am. Title Ins. Co., 218 \nF.R.D. 216, 218 n.2 (D. Minn. 2003) (\u201c[J]udges are not \nlike pigs, hunting for truffles buried in [exhibits] and \nneed not excavate masses of papers in search of \nrevealing tidbits . . . .\u201d) (cleaned up) (citations \n\n28a \n \nomitted).  The Employee Handbook, which is part of \nPlaintiffs\u2019 Exhibit G, is not evidence of what District \nofficials testified to actually knowing. \nRegarding documentation of disability complaints, \nAT\u2019s affidavit states that during the October 14, 2015 \nIEP meeting, he told \u201cthe District\u201d that its decision to \ngive AJT less than a full day of school did not comply \nwith the ADA and that this statement was \ndocumented in the meeting notes of Dan Wold, Cedar \nIsland Elementary School Principal and Amy \nStafford, Coordinator.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 19.)  Plaintiffs\u2019 \nExhibit D is a copy of meeting notes from the October \n14, 2015 meeting.  They are unattributed/unsigned. \nHowever, it seems clear the notes were written by \nsomeone in the District because the notes originally \nhad AJT\u2019s name incorrect and later corrected with a \npen or pencil.  (Pl. Ex. D at 1.) \nAT attests that he again complained that the \nDistrict\u2019s refusal to provide AJT with a full day of \ninstruction was discriminatory on October 19 or 20, \n2015.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 21.)  There is no citation to this \ncomplaint.  AT further attests, \nFor the next six years, in countless IEP Team \nmeetings, Conciliation Conferences, and \nother school meetings with District officials, \nwe \nconsistently \ncomplained \nthat \nour \ndaughter was being discriminated against, \nregressing (or not progressing at the same \nrate as when she was in Kentucky), and that \nshe deserved a full school day similar to \ntypical students and as she received in \nKentucky. \n(Id. \u00b6 25.)  He also attests that although Emmons \ndenied knowing anything about this dispute in her \n\n29a \n \ndeposition, he and GT met with Emmons more than \nonce to complain about the District\u2019s discriminatory \ntreatment of AJT.  (Id. at 50.)  AT believes that the \nCoordinators Emmons supervises dictated AJT\u2019s \nshortened day \u201cand heard but ignored [Plaintiffs\u2019] \ndiscrimination complaints.\u201d \nA properly supported motion for summary \njudgment is not defeated by self-serving \naffidavits.  Rather, the plaintiff must \nsubstantiate \nallegations \nwith \nsufficient \nprobative evidence that would permit a \nfinding in the plaintiff\u2019s favor.  A plaintiff \nmay not merely point to unsupported self-\nserving allegations, but must substantiate \nallegations \nwith \nsufficient \nprobative \nevidence that would permit a finding in the \nplaintiff\u2019s \nfavor. \n \nMere \nallegations, \nunsupported by specific facts or evidence \nbeyond \nthe \nnonmoving \nparty\u2019s \nown \nconclusions, are insufficient to withstand a \nmotion for summary judgment. \nHoeft v. Eide, No. 17-CV-2526 (MJD/LIB), 2018 WL \n6991103, at *4 (D. Minn. Oct. 25, 2018) (cleaned up; \ncitations omitted), R&R adopted, 2018 WL 6523450 \n(D. Minn. Dec. 12, 2018), aff\u2019d, 784 F. App\u2019x 967 (8th \nCir. 2019). \nHere, Plaintiffs paint with too broad a brush when \nthey discuss \u201call\u201d District officials or Fredrickson, \ntheir licensing and professional obligations, and who \ncontrolled their professional decision-making.  The \nonly evidence Plaintiffs cite in the record is the \ndeposition testimony of Emmons. Plaintiffs cite \ngenerously to this document. Plaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.  The only \u201cpolicy\u201d \nin evidence is the TSES, which, in part, details Due \n\n30a \n \nProcess in IDEA cases.  (Pl. Ex. G at 24-25 (TSES).) \nThe District appears to have followed this system by \nproviding prior written notices and offering a \nconciliation conference, mediation, a facilitated IEP \nmeeting, or a due process hearing.  (Id.; AT Aff. \u00b6 49 \n(AT stating that instead of offering a second IEP team \nmeeting on July 11, 2022, Emmons offered Plaintiffs \nthe options listed above).) \nEven though Emmons was surprised by the \nDistrict policy that states \u201c[a] pupil may receive \nspecial education services in more than one \nalternative based on the IEP,\u201d her lack of knowledge \ndid not rise to the level of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.  At most, she was negligent, which does \nnot \u201cclear the hurdle set by the explicit language of \nsection 504.\u201d  Bradley v. Arkansas Dep\u2019t of Educ., 301 \nF.3d 952, 956 (8th Cir. 2002) [Bradley I].  In addition, \nwhile the Court must accept AT\u2019s accusation that \nEmmons advised he and GT to hire a PCA for AJT \nrather than seek evening schooling, while insensitive, \nthis remark did not rise to the level of bad faith or \ngross misjudgment. \nIn addition, despite Plaintiffs\u2019 statement that \n\u201cdirect, specific and repeated Parent complaints to the \nDistrict that failure to provide A.J.T. a full school day \nis disability discrimination, documented in its own \nrecords\u201d  (Doc. 38 at 6), Plaintiffs have only provided \nevidence of two documented complaints.  The October \n14, 2015 IEP meeting notes state, \u201cDad asked if we \nwill provide support in the evening.  Amy shared that \nwe don\u2019t provide both homebound and school support \n(modified).  Dad felt that this might conflict with \nADA. He wants Statute.  His position is that she can \nhandle a full day, it just can\u2019t start until Noon.\u201d  (Pl. \nEx. G at 14.)  The ADA is mentioned again in the \n\n31a \n \nNovember 16, 2015 PWN, which states that the IEP \nwill remain in effect no later than January 14 when \nthe team will re-evaluate and AT \u201cwill have the \nopportunity to look in a [sic] modified schedule \nthrough state, IDEA and ADA laws.\u201d  (Id. at 29.)  \nPlaintiffs include several IEPs and PWNs in Exhibit \nG. (Pl. Ex. G1 at 28-51.)  However, Plaintiffs do not \ncite to them. Even if Plaintiffs had done so, none of \nthe \nIEPs \nand \nPWNs \nappear \nto \nmention \ndiscrimination. \nLikewise, the District has included 11 IEPs and \nPWNs in its exhibits but Plaintiffs do not cite them.  \n(See Def. Exs. 4, 11, 16-22, 26, 31-32.)  Even if \nPlaintiffs had cited to these exhibits, they would not \nsupport their allegations.  Except for the two \nmentions of the ADA already discussed, none of these \nIEPs and PWNs state that Plaintiffs expressed \nconcern that the District was violating the ADA or \ndiscriminating against AJT.  One complaint is \ncontained in the April 30, 2018 email AT sent to \nFredrickson stating that he had sent complaints \nabout the District to various state and federal \nagencies.  (Def. Ex. 23.)  The other complaint that \nmentions discrimination was apparently resolved by \nthe appointment of Dr. Reichle to conduct an IEE. \n(Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 3-4.) \nOn the other hand, the District provides support \nfor its arguments that it has \u201cfollowed acceptable \nprofessional judgement and standards\u201d as it made \neducational decisions.  (Doc. 34 at 22.)  In response to \nconcerns from AJT\u2019s parents, the District lengthened \nAJT\u2019s school day past the ordinary 4:00 p.m. \nconclusion in elementary school and the ordinary 2:40 \np.m. conclusion in middle school.  The District also \nmodified AJT\u2019s IEPs in response to Dr. Reichle\u2019s IEE.  \n\n32a \n \n(Def. Ex. 7 (Dr. Reichle IEE), 31 (July 1, 2019 IEP \ncontaining Dr. Reichle sticky notes), 32 (Sept. 18, \n2019 IEP summarizing Dr. Reichle\u2019s IEE findings and \nincorporating several of his suggestions).)  The \nDistrict notes, however, that not even Dr. Reichle \ncollected any data about AJT\u2019s availability for \nlearning from 5:30 to 6:00 p.m.  Emmons also testified \nthat Fredrickson told her that AJT was making \nprogress when she was enrolled at Cedar Island and \nthat there were \u201ca lot of meetings with the parents or \nparent.\u201d  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons Dep.) at 98-99.) \nBoth Parties support their opinions regarding a \nreasonable number of hours for AJT\u2019s school day with \nExpert Reports.  Both Parties also cite testimony of \nDr. Breningstall.  The District cites testimony stating \nthat it would not hurt to ask if AJT\u2019s parents were \nwilling to try instruction earlier in the day.  (Def. Ex. \n6 (Breningstall Dep.) at 32.)  Plaintiffs cite Dr. \nBreningstall\u2019s administrative hearing testimony that \nstarting school before noon would lead to \u201can \ninevitable worsening of [AJT\u2019s] problems\u201d and that \nshe could not see \u201con an experimental basis exposing \n[AJT] to an inevitable worsening of her problems.\u201d  \n(Def. Ex. 5 (Breningstall Admin. Hr\u2019g Test.) at  \n273-74.) \nContrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion that Emmons \ndenied ever meeting AJT\u2019s parents, she admitted \nmeeting AT during a meeting that was also attended \nby Fredrickson where AT explained why he wanted \nservices for AJT in the home and Fredrickson \nexplained why she did not agree.  (Def. Ex. 1 (Emmons \nDep.) at 119-20.)  Emmons also stated that she \nattended \u201ca conciliation [conference]\u201d with AT.  (Id. at \n124.)  There is no mention of \u201cdiscrimination\u201d or \u201cthe \nADA\u201d in the August 25, 2020 Summary of \n\n33a \n \nConciliation \nConference \nthat \ndocuments \nthis \nencounter.  (Pl. Ex. G at 50-51 (Summ. of Conciliation \nConference).)  Thus, it seems that the disconnect \nbetween Emmons\u2019 statement that she knew nothing \nabout investigations regarding Plaintiffs\u2019 complaints \nand AT\u2019s attestation that he and GT were in meetings \nwith Emmons where they complained about AJT\u2019s \ninstruction can be resolved by this fact. \nEmmons admits being in two meetings with AT. \nThese meetings were focused on AJT\u2019s IEPs.  The \nconciliation conference was part of the District\u2019s IDEA \ndispute resolution process, which Emmons testified is \na different process from the one used to address \ndiscrimination complaints.  (Id. at 15 (TSES); Def. Ex. \n1 (Emmons Dep.) at 48.)  Therefore, the meetings she \nattended with AT likely focused on AJT\u2019s instruction \nand learning goals, not discrimination complaints.  In \naddition, resolution of this issue is not material to \nresolution of this motion.  See Amini, 643 F.3d at 1074 \n(explain that \u201ca fact is material if its resolution affects \nthe outcome of the case\u201d). \nRegarding the \u201cshifting reasons\u201d that the District \ngave for why they did not provide AJT instruction \nboth in school and in her home, in Osseo Area Schools, \nthe Court held that the services in AJT\u2019s IEP were \nlimited by the length of the traditional school day \nrather than by AJT\u2019s needs.  2022 WL 4226097, at \n*14.  However, looking at the facts in the light most \nfavorable to Plaintiffs, it is difficult to conclude that \nthe \nDistrict \nacted \nwith \nbad \nfaith \nor \ngross \nmisjudgment. \nToo \nmany \nof \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \narguments \nare \nunsupported and with all the District\u2019s attempts at \nconciliation, new IEPs, and inclusion of Dr. Reichel\u2019s \nsuggestions, the Court cannot attribute \u201cwrongful \n\n34a \n \nintent\u201d to the District.  See B.M., 732 F.3d at 887 (a \ndefendant\u2019s statutory noncompliance must reach a \nlevel of \u201cwrongful intent\u201d to establish \u00a7 504 or ADA \nliability); K.E. v. ISD No. 15, 647 F.3d 795, 805-06 \n(8th Cir. 2011) (under IDEA, IEP team must consider \nresults of evaluations when developing an IEP); (see \nalso Def. Exs. 7, 31, 32.)  Importantly, the District \nargues that AJT\u2019s school days are not shortened due \nto its decisions but due to AJT\u2019s health. \nLikewise, although the Court did not agree with \nthe District that the intense 1:1 and 2:1 services AJT \nreceives make up for the loss of instructional hours \nwhen the District made the same argument in Osseo \nArea Schools, 2022 WL 4226097, at *13, failure to \nprovide AJT a FAPE under the IDEA, alone, does not \nmean the District discriminated against her.3  \nBrantley, 936 F. Supp. at 657 (holding that a \u201cmere \nviolation of the IDEA\u201d does not violate \u00a7 504). \nWhile the District has not been perfect, \n[t]he reference in the Rehabilitation Act to \n\u201cdiscrimination\u201d must require, we think, \nsomething \nmore \nthan \nan \nincorrect \nevaluation, \nor \na \nsubstantively \nfaulty \nindividualized education plan, in order for \nliability to exist.  Experts often disagree on \nwhat the special needs of a handicapped \nchild are, and the educational placement of \nsuch children is often necessarily an \narguable matter.  That a court may, after \nhearing evidence and argument, come to the \nconclusion that an incorrect evaluation has \n \n3  The District\u2019s brief in this case was filed almost two \nmonths prior to the Court filing its decision in Osseo Area \nSchools. \n\n35a \n \nbeen made, and that a different placement \nmust be required under [the IDEA], is not \nnecessarily the same thing as a holding that \na handicapped child has been discriminated \nagainst solely by reason of his or her \nhandicap.  An evaluation, in other words, is \nnot discriminatory merely because a court \nwould have evaluated the child differently. \nMonahan, 687 F.2d at 1170 (deciding case based on \ncomparison to the Education for All Handicapped \nChildren \nAct \n(\u201cEAHCA\u201d), \nwhich \nis \nnow \nthe \nIndividuals \nwith \nDisabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(\u201cIDEA\u201d)). \nUnder the circumstances presented here, the \nDistrict\u2019s officials exercised professional judgment in \na way that did not depart grossly from accepted \nstandards \namong \neducational \nprofessionals \nby \nconvening multiple IEP meetings, extending AJT\u2019s \nschool day beyond the school day of her peers, \nimplementing many of Dr. Reichle\u2019s suggestions into \nAJT\u2019s IEPs, and by insuring that AJT always has at \nleast one and often two aids with her at school. \nFailure to provide extended schooling at home was \nat most negligent based on Emmons\u2019 apparent failure \nto understand the TSES.  The District states that \nAJT\u2019s day is shortened because LGS prevents her \nfrom attending school prior to noon and the District \nwill provide morning instruction should AJT\u2019s \nsituation change to allow her to attend school earlier \nin the day.4  Thus, Plaintiffs have failed to show the \n \n4  While not relevant to resolution of this motion, the Court \nnotes that although it has appealed the decision, the District has \ncomplied with its order in Osseo Area Schools insofar as it has \nbeen providing in-home instruction from 4:30 to 6:00 p.m.  See \n\n36a \n \nDistrict acted with bad faith or gross misjudgment. \nPlaintiffs have not only failed to state a prima facie \ncase under \u00a7 504 or the ADA but have also failed to \nprove there is a question of material fact regarding \nwhether they have stated such a prima facie case. \nC. Retaliation Claims \n1. Legal Standards \nTo establish a prima facie case of retaliation under \n\u00a7 504, AJT\u2019s parents must show (1) they were engaged \nin a protected activity, (2) the District took some \nadverse action, and (3) a causal connection between \nthe activity and the District\u2019s action.  Albright ex rel. \nDoe v. Mountain Home Sch. Dist., 926 F.3d 942, 953 \n(8th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted).  The Eighth Circuit \nhas not determined whether an adverse action \nagainst parents who exercised IDEA rights on behalf \nof their disabled child is an \u201cadverse action\u201d for a \n\u00a7 504 claim of retaliation.  See Bradley ex rel. Bradley \nv.

Plaintiffs\u2019 Arguments \nPlaintiffs assert that the District retaliated \nagainst AJT\u2019s parents by (1) conducting \u201crepeated, \nexcessive, and unnecessary meetings without any \ngood faith efforts to understand and serve AJT\u2019s \nindividual needs, but were instead intended merely to \nwear her Parents down and into submission\u201d (Amend. \nCompl. \u00b6 60); (2) offering opinions regarding AJT\u2019s \nschooling and abilities that \u201cwere intended to insult, \nharass, intimidate, and coerce [her parents] into \nrelinquishing AJT\u2019s right to a full school day in a \nmanner likely to interfere with the enjoyment or \nexercise of ADA rights\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 61-63); (3) suggesting \nthat the only way AJT could have a full school day \nwas if she could attend school on a standard school \nschedule, which was contrary to medical advice and \nwas \u201cwithout teacher or evaluation support\u201d (Id. \u00b6 64); \n(4) engaging in \u201cglaring procedural violations\u201d such as \nproviding a shortened school day by \u201cadministrative \nfiat\u201d without input from anyone who worked directly \nwith AJT and based on \u201cshifting excuses unrelated to \nher medical and educational needs,\u201d which were \nmotivated by an intention to punish AJT\u2019s parents for \ntheir advocacy on behalf of their daughter, \u201cto wear \nthem down, and to force them to abandon their \nadvocacy efforts in a manner likely to interfere  \nwith the enjoyment and exercise of ADA rights\u201d (Id. \n\u00b6 65-68); (5) refusing to implement Dr. Reichle\u2019s \nrecommendations \nmade \nafter \nhis \nindependent \neducational \nevaluation \ndespite \nnot \nexpressing \ndisagreement with his recommendations \u201cto spite \n[AJT\u2019s] parents\u201d (Id. \u00b6\u00b6 75-76); and (6) refusing to \nprovide AJT a full day of schooling when the District \n\n38a \n \nnever established that she needs a shortened day (Id. \n\u00b6\u00b6 77-79). \n3. Analysis \nThe Court assumes without deciding that AJT\u2019s \nparents were engaged in protected activity when they \nadvocated on behalf of AJT in the IEP process. \nHowever, the District\u2019s actions Plaintiffs assert were \nretaliatory were not.

Moreover, a closer look at \nPlaintiffs\u2019 arguments shows they do not establish a \nprima facie case because even if the District took \nnegative actions against Plaintiffs, there is no \nevidence the actions were taken because of their \nadvocacy. \nFirst, as the District argues, it was obligated \nand/or entitled by District policy and various laws and \nrules \nto \nconvene \nIEP \nmeetings, \nconciliation \nconferences, mediations, and other informal forms of \ndispute resolution to attempt to craft AJT\u2019s IEPs.  \n(Doc. 34 at 26-27 (citing Minn. R. 3525.2810 subpt. 3; \nBradley II, 443 F.3d at 977; Dr. Breningstall Admin. \nHr\u2019g Test: \u201cIt doesn\u2019t hurt to ask.\u201d).)  In addition, as \ndiscussed above, Plaintiffs insisted on more IEP \nmeetings at certain times relevant to this case.  See \nsupra part II.B. Moreover, to the extent AJT\u2019s parents \nwere upset by the early IEP proposals made by the \nDistrict in spring 2018 as the Parties were preparing \nfor AJT\u2019s transition to middle school (AT Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 27-\n30), the District was within its rights to propose draft \nIEPs \u201cfor review and discussion\u201d as long as AT and \n\n39a \n \nGT were allowed to comment on them.  See Blackmon \nex rel. Blackmon v. Springfield R-XII Sch. Dist., 198 \nF.3d 648, 657 (8th Cir. 1999).  Therefore, reason 1 \ndoes not establish a prima facie case of retaliation. \nMoreover, in the course of those meetings, IEP team \nmembers certainly discussed AJT\u2019s abilities and \neducational goals.  Thus, in the absence of any cited \nsupport \nfor \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \narguments \nregarding \nharassment, insults, and intimidation, reason 2 does \nnot support a prima facie case of retaliation. \nSecond, contrary to Plaintiffs\u2019 assertion, the \nDistrict \nadopted \nseveral \nof \nDr. \nReichle\u2019s \nrecommendations into AJT\u2019s IEP.  (Def. Exs. 7, 31, \n32.)  Therefore, reason 5 does not establish a prima \nfacie case of retaliation. \nThird, to the extent District employees were less \noutgoing and chatty after Plaintiffs filed their \nlawsuit, Plaintiffs provide no support for these \nstatements.  (AT Aff. \u00b6 47.)  Furthermore, it is human \nnature to be more circumspect when employees learn \nabout a lawsuit involving their employer and the \nsubject of their own work.  Emmons testified that she \ntold AJT\u2019s teacher \u201cto ignore the legal stuff that was \ngoing on, . . . to teach AJT well and do what she \nbelieved to be the right thing for AJT.\u201d  (Def. Ex. 1 \n(Emmons Dep.) at 104.) \nFinally, as the District asserts, even if District \nemployees stated \u201cthat the only way AJT could have \na full school day was if she could attend school on a \nstandard school schedule\u201d and the District provided a \nshortened school day by \u201cadministrative fiat\u201d without \ninput from anyone who worked directly with AJT, \nthere is no evidence these things were done in \nretaliation for AJT\u2019s parents\u2019 advocacy.  Likewise, \nthough Plaintiffs assert the District proffered \n\n40a \n \n\u201cshifting excuses unrelated to AJT\u2019s medical and \neducational needs,\u201d and the District refused to \nprovide AJT a full day of schooling when it never \nestablished that she needs one, there is no evidence \nthat the District was retaliating against AJT\u2019s \nparents for their advocacy on behalf of their daughter.  \nThroughout the briefs and voluminous exhibits \nassociated with this case, it is obvious the Parties \nhave fundamental differences of opinion regarding \nwhat constitutes a \u201cfull day\u201d of instruction for a \nstudent who does not start school until noon.  This \ndisconnect is based on the Parties\u2019 interpretations of \nthe facts and the law, not on the District\u2019s desire to \nretaliate against AJT\u2019s parents. \nEven if administrative expediency was top of mind \nfor the District when officials made scheduling \ndecisions\u2014as the Court found in Osseo Area \nSchools\u2014evidence does not support that the District \nprioritized expediency as a form of retaliation.  Thus, \nPlaintiffs have failed to prove there is a causal \nconnection between actions taken by the District and \ntheir advocacy.  Therefore, Plaintiffs have not only \nfailed to state a prima facie case of retaliation, \nBradley II, 443 F.3d at 976, but have also failed to \nprove there is a question of material fact regarding \nwhether they have stated such a case. \nD. IDEA Claims \nPlaintiffs have filed a claim for violations of the \nIDEA.  (Amend. Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 113-16.) As part of that \nclaim, they assert the District has refused to \nimplement the ALJ\u2019s Decision.  (Id. \u00b6 116.)  AT states \nthat the District failed to timely secure eye-gaze \ntechnology, assigned one of AJT\u2019s home-school \nteachers to another student and only re-instated her \n\n41a \n \nto AJT when AT told the District he felt the \nreassignment was \u201ccontinued animus and retaliation \nagainst our family,\u201d and attempted to create a home-\nschool record that will show little or no progress by \nallowing teachers to cancel or arrive late for several \nhome-school sessions and \u201csecretly tracking\u201d baseline \ndata to support that outcome.  (AT Aff. \u00b6\u00b6 39-47.) \nBecause the ALJ\u2019s Decision was not implemented, \nPlaintiffs filed the previously-mentioned complaint \nwith the MDE on June 9, 2021.  (Amend Compl. \n\u00b6 109.)  The MDE found the District did not violate \nthe ALJ\u2019s Decision. (Def. Ex. 27.) \nOn September 13, 2022, after briefing was \ncompleted in this case, the Court affirmed the ALJ\u2019s \nDecision.  Osseo Area Schs., 2022 WL 4226097, at *21.  \nAmong other things, the ALJ concluded that AJT \nestablished that adding \u201cthe provision of eye gaze \ntechnology . . . would result in an educational \nprogram that is responsive to her individual needs \n. . . .\u201d  (Def. Ex. 25 (ALJ Decision) at 20.) \nPlaintiffs have already filed one Motion for an \nOrder to Show Cause why [the District] Should Not \nbe Found in Contempt [of the Court\u2019s Order Affirming \nthe ALJ\u2019s Decision].  Osseo Area Schs. II, 2022 WL \n17082826, at *1.  Plaintiffs asserted that the District \nwas not complying with the Court\u2019s Order affirming \nthe ALJ\u2019s Decision regarding compensatory hours of \neducation.  Id. at *1-2.  Now that the Court has \naffirmed the ALJ\u2019s Decision, the appropriate way to \nseek relief for a violation of that Order is to file \nanother motion for an order to show cause. \nFiling a new IDEA claim in this or another case \nwas never the appropriate way to obtain relief.  As the \nDistrict states, Plaintiffs\u2019 IDEA claim \u201cis a thinly \nveiled attempt to re-litigate the issues . . . from the \n\n42a \n \ndue process hearing.\u201d  (Doc. 34 at 30.)  Except for \nlimited exceptions not relevant here, federal courts do \nnot have original jurisdiction over claims brought \npursuant to the IDEA.  Blackmon, 198 F.3d at 655-56 \n(discussing exhaustion); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A).   \nIn addition, the statute of limitations for filing \nappeals of IDEA decisions is 90 days.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(B).  Even assuming jurisdiction is proper \nin this Court, this \u201cappeal,\u201d filed 104 days after the \nALJ\u2019s Decision, is untimely. \nFinally, even assuming the Court had jurisdiction \nover this claim, to the extent Plaintiffs wished to \nassert the claim in this Court, they had to do so as a \ncompulsory counterclaim because the claim clearly \narises out of the same transaction or occurrence that \nwas the subject matter of Osseo Area Schools and no \nadditional parties are required over whom the Court \ncannot acquire jurisdiction.  See Fed. R. Civ. Pro. \n13(a)(1).  A compulsory counterclaim not asserted is \nwaived.  Schinzing v. Mid\u2013States Stainless, Inc., 415 \nF.3d 807, 813 (8th Cir. 2005).  Accordingly, Plaintiffs\u2019 \nclaim is barred. \nIV. \nORDER \nBased upon the files, records, and proceedings \nherein, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED: \nDefendants\u2019 Osseo Area Schools, Independent \nSchool District No. 279 and Osseo School Board\u2019s \nMotion for Summary Judgement (Doc. 31) is \nGRANTED. \n\n43a \n \nLET \nJUDGMENT \nBE \nENTERED \nACCORDINGLY. \nDated: February 1, 2023  \ns/Michael J.

Her parents asked Osseo Area \n\n50a \n \nSchools (the District) to provide evening instruction, \nbut believing it had no obligation to educate A.J.T. \noutside of regular school hours, the District refused. \nThe district court1 concluded that this denied A.J.T. a \n\u201cfree appropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  The \nDistrict appeals, and we affirm. \nI \nA.J.T. has a rare form of epilepsy and requires \nassistance with everyday tasks like walking and \ntoileting.  She has seizures throughout the day, and \nthey are so frequent in the morning that she can\u2019t \nattend school before noon.  But she\u2019s alert and able to \nlearn until about 6:00 p.m. \nBefore moving to Minnesota in 2015, A.J.T.\u2019s \nKentucky school district provided an individualized \neducation program (IEP), see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d), that \nincluded evening instruction at home.  But the \nDistrict wasn\u2019t as accommodating.  Year after year, it \ndenied \nA.J.T.\u2019s \nparents\u2019 \nrequests \nfor \nevening \ninstruction with a series of shifting explanations.  The \nfirst year, it claimed that state law does not require \nit.  The next year, it said it needed to avoid setting \nunfavorable precedent for itself and other districts. \nAnd later, it said that the home environment would \nbe too restrictive and that it needed \u201cdata to \nsubstantiate this programming change.\u201d \nFrom 2015 to 2018, while A.J.T. was in elementary \nschool, the District provided intensive one-on-one \ninstruction for 4.25 hours each school day.2  Then, in \n \n1  The Honorable Michael J. Davis, United States District \nJudge for the District of Minnesota. \n2  The District initially offered instruction from 12:00 p.m. \nto 4:00 p.m.\u2014the elementary school\u2019s standard end time.  But \n\n51a \n \n2018, the District prepared for A.J.T. to enter middle \nschool.  The middle school\u2019s standard day ended at \n2:40 p.m., so the District proposed cutting back her \nday to about 3 hours.  Despite the even shorter day, it \nagain rejected her parents\u2019 request for evening \ninstruction.  It also rejected their various proposals to \nat least maintain her 4.25-hour day, including a \nproposal to continue keeping her at the elementary \nschool. \nRealizing that an agreement was beyond reach, \nA.J.T.\u2019s parents filed a complaint with the Minnesota \nDepartment of Education.  Their complaint kept \nA.J.T.\u2019s 4.25-hour school day in place under the \u201cstay-\nput\u201d provision of the Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA), 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j); see also \nHale ex rel. Hale v. Poplar Bluff R\u2013I Sch. Dist., 280 \nF.3d 831, 833 (8th Cir. 2002) (per curiam), and led to \na due process hearing before an administrative law \njudge (ALJ), see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(1)(A). \nAfter a five-day evidentiary hearing, the ALJ \nconcluded that the District had denied A.J.T. a FAPE. \nThe ALJ found that District officials improperly made \n\u201cmaintain[ing] the regular hours of the school\u2019s \nfaculty\u201d \nthe \n\u201cprevailing \nand \nparamount \nconsideration\u201d over A.J.T.\u2019s needs and ordered the \nDistrict to provide 495 hours of compensatory \neducation and add certain services to her IEP, \nincluding at-home instruction from 4:30 p.m. to 6:00 \np.m. each school day. \n \nA.J.T.\u2019s parents picked her up at 3:30 p.m. each day because they \nwere concerned about her safety navigating the halls while other \nstudents were being dismissed, so the District later extended her \nschool day by 15 minutes. \n\n52a \n \nThe District sought judicial review, see id. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(A), and after receiving the administrative \nrecord and providing an opportunity to present \nadditional evidence, the district court agreed with the \nALJ, id. \u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C); see also Minnetonka Pub. \nSchs., Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 276 v. M.L.K. ex rel. S.K., \n42 F.4th 847, 852 (8th Cir. 2022) (standard of review \nin the district court).  Specifically, the court found \nthat after moving to the District, A.J.T. made \nprogress in several areas like her desire and intent to \ncommunicate, use of eye gaze technology, ability to \nfeed herself, and handwashing.  But her overall \nprogress was de minimis, and she regressed in other \nareas like communicating using hand signs, initiating \nand returning greetings using a prerecorded button \nswitch, and toileting.  The court also found that A.J.T. \nwould have made more progress if she had received \nevening instruction and that a three- or four-hour \nschool day was insufficient to pursue many expert-\nrecommended goals.  Ultimately, the court concluded \nthat the District did not meet its burden to show that \nthe ALJ erred in finding that the District denied \nA.J.T. a FAPE.  See E.S. v. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 196, \nRosemount\u2013Apple Valley\u2013Eagan, 135 F.3d 566, 569 \n(8th Cir. 1998) (burden of proof). \nII \nUnder the IDEA, children with disabilities are \nentitled to a FAPE.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(1)(A).  To get \nthere, school districts must identify and evaluate a \nstudent\u2019s need for special education services and work \nwith a team\u2014which typically includes teachers, \nschool officials, and the student\u2019s parents\u2014to create \nan annual IEP.  Id. \u00a7 1414(a)\u2013(d).  The IEP must \ninclude a statement of the student\u2019s academic and \nfunctional performance, describe how her disability \n\n53a \n \naffects her learning, set out measurable goals, and \ntrack her progress.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d)(1)(A)(i)(I)\u2013(III); \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE\u20131, 580 U.S. 386, 391, 137 S.Ct. 988, 197 L.Ed.2d \n335 (2017).  And to be substantively adequate, it must \nbe \u201ctailored to the unique needs\u201d of the individual \nstudent and \u201cappropriately ambitious,\u201d meaning it \nmust be \u201creasonably calculated to enable a child to \nmake \nprogress \nappropriate \nin \nlight \nof \n[her] \ncircumstances\u201d and give her a \u201cchance to meet \nchallenging objectives.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 401\u2013\n04, 137 S.Ct. 988 (citation omitted). \nJudicial review in IDEA cases \u201cis, in reality, quite \nnarrow.\u201d  Petersen v. Hastings Pub. Schs., 31 F.3d \n705, 707 (8th Cir. 1994). Courts are limited to \nreviewing whether the school district followed the \nIDEA\u2019s procedures and whether the student\u2019s IEP \nprovided a FAPE.  Id. (quoting Bd. of Educ. of \nHendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. Rowley, 458 U.S. \n176, 206\u201307, 102 S.Ct. 3034, 73 L.Ed.2d 690 (1982)).  \nA district court must \u201cmake an independent decision, \nbased on a preponderance of the evidence, whether \nthe IDEA was violated,\u201d but it \u201cmust nonetheless give \ndue weight to the administrative proceedings.\u201d  \nM.L.K., 42 F.4th at 852 (citation omitted).  On appeal, \nwe review the district court\u2019s factual findings for clear \nerror and its determination of whether the school \nprovided a FAPE de novo.  Id. \nAs an initial matter, we reject the notion that the \nIDEA\u2019s reach is limited to the regular hours of the \nschool day.  Neither the District nor amici identify \nanything in the IDEA implying\u2014let alone stating\u2014\nthat a school district is only obligated to provide a \nFAPE if it can do so between the bells.  So we wade \n\n54a \n \ninto the finer details of A.J.T.\u2019s IEPs to determine \nwhether she received a FAPE despite the short day. \nSeveral things convince us that she did not:  First, \nA.J.T. made de minimis progress overall.  Second, she \nregressed in toileting, and at one point, the District \neven removed the toileting goal from her IEP because \nthere was not enough time in the short school day.  \nAnd third, A.J.T. would have made more progress \nwith evening instruction. The District disputes each \npoint, so we discuss them in turn. \nA. \nThe District argues that the district court clearly \nerred in finding that A.J.T.\u2019s overall progress was de \nminimis.  It says that her progress was significant in \n\u201cmany\u201d areas and that even minimal progress was \n\u201cremarkable\u201d \ngiven \nher \ndisability. \n \nWe \nare \nunconvinced. \nThe District cites only slight progress in a few \nareas, and even one of the District\u2019s own experts \nagreed that A.J.T.\u2019s progress was minimal.  According \nto the District\u2019s progress reports, A.J.T. met none of \nher annual goals in 2016 or 2017.  By the end of 2018, \nshe had met a few short-term objectives3 but still \nhadn\u2019t met any annual goals.  The record contains no \nprogress reports for 2019.  And in 2020, she again met \nonly a few objectives and not a single goal.  Based on \nthis, the district court did not clearly err in finding \nthat A.J.T.\u2019s overall progress was de minimis. \n \n3  A.J.T.\u2019s progress reports consist of multiple \u201cannual \ngoals,\u201d each of which include several \u201cshort term objectives.\u201d \n\n55a \n \nA.J.T.\u2019s limited progress is strong evidence that \nthe District denied her a FAPE,4 as a student making \n\u201cmerely more than de minimis progress from year to \nyear can hardly be said to have been offered an \neducation at all.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 402\u201303, 137 \nS.Ct. 988 (cleaned up) (holding that the FAPE \nstandard is \u201cmarkedly more demanding\u201d). \nB. \nThe District also quibbles with the district court\u2019s \nfindings that A.J.T. regressed in toileting and that the \nDistrict removed her toileting goal for lack of time.  It \nquestions whether A.J.T. ever had success voiding on \nthe toilet and claims that the IEP team removed the \ntoileting goal in 2017 because it didn\u2019t expect that she \ncould make any progress.  The record tells a different \nstory. \n \n4  The District says that we should nonetheless ignore \nA.J.T.\u2019s de minimis progress overall and her regression in \ntoileting because \u201c[a]n IEP is a snapshot, not a retrospective, and \nwe must take into account what was, and was not, objectively \nreasonable when the snapshot was taken, that is, at the time the \nIEP was promulgated.\u201d  K.E. ex rel. K.E. v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. \n15, 647 F.3d 795, 808 (8th Cir. 2011) (cleaned up) (citation \nomitted).  But here, the District had more and more information \nabout A.J.T.\u2019s instructional needs and insufficient progress each \nyear.  This is not a case where it only became apparent that the \nstudent\u2019s IEP was inappropriate after the fact.  Cf. id. (holding \nthat \u201cit would be improper for us to judge [the student\u2019s] IEPs in \nhindsight\u201d because the school district had \u201ccontradictory \ninformation about whether [the student] suffered from bipolar \ndisorder\u201d when it drafted them).  Rather, A.J.T.\u2019s limited \nprogress and regression was both predictable and known, so it is \nproperly considered as an \u201cimportant factor\u201d in our analysis.  See \nC.B. ex rel. B.B. v. Special Sch. Dist. No. 1, 636 F.3d 981, 989 \n(8th Cir. 2011) (citations omitted). \n\n56a \n \nA behavior analyst who worked with A.J.T. in \nKentucky testified that she was voiding on the toilet \n45% of the time by the end of their work together, and \nA.J.T.\u2019s father testified that when they moved to the \nDistrict, she was voiding on the toilet 50% of the time \nat home and was making progress voiding on the \ntoilet at school.  By 2016, District records noted that \nA.J.T. was having \u201csome successes\u201d voiding on the \ntoilet but was not meeting her goal of a 50% success \nrate.  Then, in 2017, District officials observed that \nA.J.T.\u2019s success was \u201cinconsistent\u201d and decided to cut \nthe goal \u201cdue to the time constraint of [her] shortened \nday.\u201d  The next year, the District changed course and \nreinstated the goal, noting her \u201cneed for instruction in \nactivities of daily living\u201d and that \u201c[w]ith fewer trips \nto the bathroom,\u201d she was now having \u201cminimal \nsuccess.\u201d  The District\u2019s records are clear that A.J.T. \nregressed in toileting and that it removed her \ntoileting goal for lack of time in the short day\u2014not for \nlack of ability to improve. \nA.J.T.\u2019s toileting ability is essential for her to live \na healthy and dignified life, and the District\u2019s failure \nto take steps to address that goal violated its \nobligation to provide a FAPE. \nC. \nFinally, the District says that the district court \nerred by considering expert testimony that A.J.T. \nwould have benefitted from evening instruction \nbecause doing so amounted to requiring it to \n\u201cmaximize a student\u2019s potential or provide the best \npossible education at public expense.\u201d  Albright ex rel. \nDoe v. Mountain Home Sch. Dist., 926 F.3d 942, 950 \n(8th Cir. 2019) (citation omitted). \n\n57a \n \nBut asking whether A.J.T. would have made more \nprogress with evening instruction isn\u2019t about \nmaximizing her potential\u2014it\u2019s about whether the \nDistrict\u2019s purely administrative decision not to \nprovide evening education caused her de minimis \nprogress and regression.  Cf. M.L.K., 42 F.4th at 852\u2013\n54 (reasoning that the school district did not violate \nthe IDEA by failing to identify the student\u2019s most \ndebilitating disabilities because its failure did not \ncause any lack of progress); Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 283 \nv. S.D. ex rel. J.D., 88 F.3d 556, 562 (8th Cir. 1996) \n(holding that there is no IDEA violation when an \nIEP\u2019s procedural inadequacies are harmless).  The \nexpert testimony shows that the District\u2019s choice to \nprioritize its administrative concerns had a negative \nimpact on A.J.T.\u2019s learning. \nConsidering that A.J.T. made de minimis progress \noverall, that she regressed in toileting, and that she \nwould have made more progress with evening \ninstruction, we see no error in the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that the District denied her a FAPE.  None \nof the District\u2019s explanations for refusing to provide \nevening instruction have ever been grounded in \nA.J.T.\u2019s individual needs, as required by the IDEA.  \nAnd it still has not offered a \u201ccogent and responsive \nexplanation for [its] decisions\u201d showing that A.J.T.\u2019s \nIEPs were \u201creasonably calculated to enable [her] to \nmake \nprogress \nappropriate \nin \nlight \nof \n[her] \ncircumstances.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404, 137 S.Ct. \n988. \nIII. \nWe affirm the district court\u2019s judgment.",

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief was a state of complete uncertainty regarding the facts, precedents, and arguments in *A. J. T. v. Osseo Area Schools*. This observation has provided the first crucial piece of task-specific information: the precise legal question presented to the Court. I now know the case centers on whether the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and the Rehabilitation Act require plaintiffs to meet a \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard to prove discrimination in an educational context. This clarifies that the core issue is one of statutory interpretation concerning the standard of proof for a specific type of civil rights claim. My understanding remains incomplete regarding the specific arguments of the petitioner and respondent, the key precedents they will cite, and the detailed reasoning of the Eighth Circuit's decision that is being appealed.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief was a state of complete uncertainty about effective strategies for SCOTUS prediction. This internal reasoning provides a foundational set of hypotheses about effective design. I now believe that a highly efficient initial strategy for any SCOTUS case prediction is to locate and analyze the *petition for a writ of certiorari*. This document is a primary source that is dense with information relevant to both task and design beliefs.\n\nFurthermore, I have learned several key heuristics for this type of task:\n1.  **Identify Foundational Documents:** The cert petition is the most logical starting point as it frames the petitioner's argument and explains the case's significance.\n2.  **Look for Key Predictive Signals:** The presence of a *circuit split* is a powerful indicator that the Supreme Court may grant certiorari to resolve a legal inconsistency. This is a crucial piece of meta-knowledge for prediction, as it directly addresses the Court's role in ensuring uniform application of federal law. The position of the Solicitor General is another such signal to watch for.\n3.  **Categorize the Case:** Recognizing this as a \"statutory interpretation\" case involving \"civil rights statutes\" helps to narrow the search for relevant judicial patterns and philosophies (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism) that may influence the justices' decisions.\n4.  **Structure the Inquiry:** An effective approach involves a two-level inquiry: first, gathering case-specific facts (\u03b8), and second, understanding the broader patterns of judicial decision-making in this area of law (D). My next actions should be guided by this strategy, starting with the cert petition to gather information on both levels simultaneously."

It will either confirm the weakness of the lower court's position (if the arguments are poor or they waive a response) or introduce compelling counter-arguments that could significantly change my prediction on both the cert grant and the merits. For example, the respondent could argue the circuit split is shallow or that this case is a poor vehicle, directly challenging my current beliefs. \n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because it tests and refines a crucial step in a robust predictive methodology. My current strategy is to analyze the cert petition. This action evaluates the next logical step: 'Analyze the opposition to stress-test the petitioner's claims.' Observing how respondents counter arguments about circuit splits and textualism will build a more sophisticated, adversarial model for prediction, moving beyond simply accepting the petitioner's framing.

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *A. J. T. v. Osseo Area Schools* has significantly deepened. My prior knowledge consisted of the basic facts and the core legal question. The petition for certiorari has now provided critical details that sharpen my analysis. I can confirm the legal question is precisely: \"Whether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require children with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely stringent 'bad faith or gross misjudgment' standard when seeking relief for discrimination relating to their education.\"\n\nMy key task-specific updates are:\n1.  **Confirmation of a Deep Circuit Split:** The petitioner explicitly frames the case around a \"deep and entrenched 5-2 circuit split.\" This is a powerful reason for the Supreme Court to grant review.\n    *   **Circuits applying the stringent \"bad faith\" standard:** Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth.\n    *   **Circuits applying the more lenient general standard:** Third and Ninth.\n2.  **Petitioner's Core Arguments:** The petitioner's strategy is now clear. They argue the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard is:\n    *   **Atextual:** It has \"no anchor in statutory text,\" a powerful argument in the current Court.\n    *   **Arbitrary:** It creates a different, higher bar for children in schools compared to all other individuals protected by the same statutes.\n    *   **Flawed Precedent:** The original case establishing the standard, *Monahan v. Nebraska* (1982), is based on misguided speculation about congressional intent.\n3.  **Lower Court Instability:** I've learned that the Eighth Circuit panel, while ruling against A.J.T., was highly critical of its own binding precedent (*Monahan*), calling it a \"judicial gloss.\" Furthermore, three judges (Grasz, Stras, and Kobes) dissented from the denial of rehearing en banc. This internal division signals to the Supreme Court that the rule is unstable and ripe for review.\n4.  **Factual Strength:** The petition asserts that the Eighth Circuit acknowledged A.J.T. presented enough evidence to potentially show \"negligent or even deliberately indifferent\" conduct. This suggests her case was dismissed *only* because of the heightened standard, making this an ideal vehicle for the Court to address the legal question directly.\n5.  **Key Parties and Precedents:** I now know the petitioner's counsel is Roman Martinez of Latham & Watkins, a top-tier Supreme Court practice. I have also identified the seminal case being challenged (*Monahan v. Nebraska*) and recent cases showing judicial discomfort with the standard (*Knox County v. M.Q.*).\n\nBased on this, my confidence that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari has increased substantially. The combination of a clear, acknowledged circuit split, a question of statutory interpretation with a strong textualist argument, and internal disagreement in the lower court makes this a prime candidate for review. My initial prediction on the merits now leans in favor of the petitioner (reversal of the Eighth Circuit), as the arguments against the atextual, judge-made standard appear very strong.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial hypotheses about effective strategies have been strongly validated and refined by this observation. My methodology for SCOTUS prediction is becoming more robust.\n\n1.  **Primacy of the Cert Petition:** My belief that the *petition for a writ of certiorari* is the single most valuable initial document is confirmed. It efficiently provided a wealth of information for both task (\u03b8) and design (D) beliefs, including the petitioner's strategy, key precedents, and the all-important circuit split. This confirms the \"Identify Foundational Documents\" heuristic.\n2.  **Refining Predictive Signals:** My understanding of key signals has become more nuanced.\n    *   **Circuit Split Analysis:** It is not enough to know a split exists. An effective strategy is to *quantify* the split (e.g., 5-2) and identify the specific circuits on each side. This is a primary justification for a grant of certiorari under Supreme Court Rule 10(a).\n    *   **Internal Circuit Disagreement:** I have learned a new, powerful predictive signal: disagreement *within* the circuit that issued the opinion. A panel criticizing its own binding precedent or a dissent from a denial of rehearing en banc are strong indicators that a legal issue is unsettled and ready for Supreme Court resolution.\n    *   **Argument Framing:** The petitioner's heavy reliance on the \"atextual\" nature of the lower court's rule reinforces my heuristic to categorize cases. For \"statutory interpretation\" cases, identifying arguments based on the plain text (or lack thereof) is critical for predicting how textualist-leaning justices will vote.\n3.  **New Heuristics for Investigation:**\n    *   **Trace the Precedent:** The cert petition is an effective tool for identifying the foundational precedent being challenged (in this case, *Monahan v. Nebraska*). A good next step in a similar task would be to analyze that foundational case.\n    *   **Note the Counsel:** The identity and reputation of the Counsel of Record (e.g., an elite SCOTUS firm like Latham & Watkins) is a soft but relevant signal of the case's perceived importance and the quality of the arguments to come.\n4.  **Evolving Strategy:** My overall strategy remains sound, but is now more detailed. The process is: 1) Identify the legal question from the docket. 2) Secure and analyze the cert petition, specifically the \"Question Presented\" and \"Reasons for Granting the Writ\" sections. 3) From the petition, extract the circuit split, the core textual/structural arguments, any signs of internal lower court conflict, and the key precedent being challenged. This provides a strong foundation for both a cert grant prediction and an initial merits prediction."

My design model has been updated to recognize the importance of this dialectical process: Petition (thesis) -> Brief in Opposition (antithesis). The next logical and most informative step is to find the petitioner's reply brief, which serves as the rebuttal to the BIO and is the final document the Justices will read before deciding on certiorari.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has entered a new, more adversarial phase. The respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) provides a direct and powerful rebuttal to the petitioner's arguments, significantly complicating the predictive landscape. My beliefs are updated as follows:\n\n1.  **Confirmation of High Stakes:** The respondent, Osseo Area Schools, has retained Lisa S. Blatt of Williams & Connolly LLP. Blatt is one of the most prominent and successful advocates before the Supreme Court. The presence of elite counsel on both sides (Martinez for the petitioner, Blatt for the respondent) confirms that both parties view this case as exceptionally important with far-reaching implications. This neutralizes the predictive value of counsel and instead elevates the overall perceived significance of the legal question.\n2.  **The Circuit Split is Now Contested:** My prior belief in a \"deep and entrenched 5-2 circuit split\" is now challenged. The respondent argues this is a matter of \"form over substance.\"\n    *   **Respondent's Counter-Narrative:** They claim that while circuits use \"different verbal formulations,\" they all agree that a *high* standard of discriminatory intent is required for these types of claims, one that involves a significant deviation from accepted professional practices.\n    *   **Nuanced Distinction:** The respondent introduces a new distinction: they argue there is no split at all regarding claims for *injunctive relief*, only some semantic variation for *damages* claims. This is an attempt to narrow the scope and importance of any disagreement.\n    *   This direct assault on the petitioner's primary reason for granting the writ significantly lowers my confidence in a cert grant. The clarity of the split is now a central point of contention.\n3.  **Introduction of \"Vehicle Problems\":** The respondent argues forcefully that this case is a \"poor vehicle\" for resolving the legal question. This is a new and critical task-specific variable.\n    *   **Factual Weakness:** The BIO asserts that the school district made \"persistent efforts\" to accommodate A.J.T. and that the facts would not show discriminatory intent \"under any standard used in any circuit.\" This is an argument that even if the Court sides with the petitioner on the law, the petitioner would still lose on the facts, making a grant of certiorari an academic exercise.\n    *   **Mootness/Redundancy:** The BIO reveals that the petitioner has *already received* injunctive relief and compensation for the FAPE denial through a separate suit. This is a powerful argument that the current case is only about a specific type of damages, potentially diminishing its urgency and importance in the eyes of the Court.\n4.  **Respondent's Defense of the Merits:** I now have the respondent's substantive defense of the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard.\n    *   **Structural Argument:** They frame the standard not as an atextual judicial invention, but as a \"sensible remedial scheme\" necessary to balance the overlapping statutes of the IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act.\n    *   **Deference to Educators:** They argue the standard correctly gives deference to the \"expertise and the exercise of judgment by school authorities,\" citing the foundational case *Monahan v. Nebraska* and Supreme Court precedent like *Endrew F.* This provides a stronger theoretical grounding for the standard than I had previously considered.\n5.  **Revised Prediction:** My confidence that certiorari will be granted has decreased substantially. The respondent has effectively introduced doubt about the two most important factors for a grant: the existence of a clear circuit split and the suitability of the case as a clean legal vehicle. While the petitioner's textualist arguments remain strong, the respondent's counter-arguments are sophisticated and directly target the reasons the Court would take the case. The path to a cert grant is now much more contested.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been crucial for refining my methodology, emphasizing the adversarial nature of the cert stage and the need to analyze arguments dialectically.\n\n1.  **Primacy of Foundational Documents (Refined):** My belief in the importance of the cert petition is confirmed, but it is now clear that it represents only the first half of the story. The *Brief in Opposition* is an equally critical foundational document. An effective strategy *must* involve analyzing the petition (thesis) and the BIO (antithesis) in conjunction to form a complete picture (synthesis). The petitioner's Reply Brief will be the next logical document to seek out.\n2.  **Sophistication of Predictive Signals:** My understanding of key signals has become more advanced.\n    *   **Circuit Split Analysis 2.0:** A petitioner will always frame a split as deep and clear. An effective design must anticipate the respondent's counter-tactics: arguing the split is merely semantic (\"different verbal formulations\"), distinguishing between different forms of relief (damages vs. injunction), or re-characterizing the holdings of the \"opposing\" circuits. The real analysis lies in evaluating the credibility of these competing characterizations.\n    *   **\"Vehicle Problems\" as a Key Heuristic:** I have a new, essential heuristic: \"Always check for vehicle problems.\" The BIO is the primary source for this information. I must now actively search for arguments that the facts are messy, the petitioner might lose on remand regardless of the legal outcome, or that the relief sought is duplicative or already obtained. These are powerful, pragmatic reasons for the Court to deny a petition.\n    *   **Elite Counsel as a Symmetric Signal:** My heuristic about noting counsel is now more nuanced. When an elite SCOTUS advocate appears on one side, it's a signal of that side's strength and seriousness. When elite advocates appear on *both* sides, it signals the overall importance and high stakes of the legal question itself, but it may neutralize the signal's predictive value for a specific outcome.\n3.  **New Heuristics for Investigation:**\n    *   **Trace the Precedent (and its Defense):** I previously learned to trace the precedent being challenged (*Monahan*). Now I see the importance of analyzing how the respondent *defends* that precedent, often by linking it to broader principles of judicial deference or statutory structure.\n    *   **Compare the \"Questions Presented\":** A highly effective and efficient heuristic is to directly compare the \"Question Presented\" from the cert petition with the one from the BIO. The petitioner's version will be broad and abstract; the respondent's will be narrow and fact-specific. The delta between these two framings reveals the core strategic disagreement of the case.\n4.  **Evolving Strategy (Dialectical Approach):** My investigative process is now more robust and dialectical.\n    1.  **Thesis:** Analyze the cert petition to identify the petitioner's core arguments for review (split, importance, clean vehicle).\n    2.  **Antithesis:** Analyze the Brief in Opposition to identify the respondent's direct rebuttals (no real split, bad vehicle, lower court was correct).\n    3.  **Synthesis:** Form a prediction based on the collision of these arguments. Assess the credibility of the attacks on the circuit split and the severity of the alleged vehicle problems.\n    4.  **Next Step:** Actively look for the petitioner's Reply Brief, which is their opportunity to rebut the BIO and have the last word before the Justices consider the petition."

For four years, it \ndefended the Eighth Circuit\u2019s asymmetric Monahan \nrule as correctly interpreting Title II of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  The District consistently \nmaintained that Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 \n(8th Cir. 1982), \u201cappropriately developed\u201d a special \nrule applying only to a \u201cunique subset\u201d of claims \nbrought by children with disabilities against their \nschools.  BIO2.  The District won on that theory at \nevery stage below and tried to avoid certiorari on that \nbasis here too. \n \nThe District\u2019s problem is that this Court granted \nreview\u2014and \nMonahan\u2019s \nasymmetric \nrule \nis \nindefensible.  So now the game is up.  The District \nknows there is no way the Court will interpret the \nsame statutory provision to create a two-tier standard \nof justice imposing a uniquely stringent bad-faith-or-\ngross-misjudgment requirement only on vulnerable \nchildren who face disability discrimination at school. \n \nDesperate times call for desperate measures.  And \nso just four weeks before oral argument, the District \nconceded the question presented, abandoned its prior \narguments, and undertook a massive flip-flop.  \nBefore, the District defended imposing different \nstandards on different plaintiffs, BIO26-27\u2014but now \nit concedes that the same rules apply to everyone, \nResp.Br.2.  Before, the District acknowledged that \nboth statutes \u201ctarget[] unintentional discriminatory \nacts\u201d and thus require \u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d \nBIO7, 30\u2014but now it says these laws demand a \ndiscriminatory \n\u201cmotive\u201d \nand \nthus \nforeclose \nparadigmatic \nreasonable-accommodation \nclaims.  \n\n2 \n \nResp.Br.2.  Before, the District described Ava\u2019s \n\u201cquestion presented\u201d as \u201cnarrow\u201d and impacting only \nschool-age children with disabilities, BIO23\u2014but now \nit asks this Court to embrace a new \u201cacross the board\u201d \nrule that would impair the rights of all victims of \ndisability discrimination, Resp.Br.2. \nThis Court should not bless the District\u2019s tactics.  \nThis case has always been about whether Monahan\u2019s \n\u201cuniquely stringent\u201d rule for school children with \ndisabilities is a valid exception to the baseline \nstandards that apply to all other plaintiffs.  Pet.i.  The \nDistrict now concedes no exception is warranted.  The \nCourt should accept that concession and overturn the \ndecision below. \n \nThis Court should not entertain the District\u2019s new \narguments for applying Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-\ngross-misjudgment test to everyone.  Judicial \nestoppel and this Court\u2019s rules bar the District from \noverhauling its longstanding position and expanding \nthe question presented.  Enforcing these procedural \ndoctrines \nis \nespecially \nimperative \ngiven \nthe \nrevolutionary\u2014and uniformly harmful\u2014impact of \nthe District\u2019s new theory.   \n \nIf the District\u2019s new theory is considered, the \nCourt should reject it.  The District\u2019s approach would \ngut the ADA and Rehabilitation Act in their most \nparadigmatic applications.  It would violate the text, \nflout precedent, and upend settled law across the \ncountry.  This Court should answer Ava\u2019s question \npresented and vacate the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment. \n\n3 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. The \nDistrict \nConcedes \nThe \nQuestion \nPresented \nThis Court granted certiorari to decide whether \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act1 must \nsatisfy a heightened, context-specific test (as five \ncircuits have held), or meet the same standards as \neveryone else suing under these statutes (as two \ncircuits have held).  Pet.i.  The District now concedes \nthat the former asymmetric regime cannot stand.  \nResp.Br.2.  That should end this case. \n1.  The Eighth Circuit denied Ava relief under \nMonahan\u2019s exception to the general rules governing \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  Pet.App.4a-5a & \nn.2.  \u201c[W]hen the alleged ADA and [Rehabilitation \nAct] violations are \u2018based on educational services for \ndisabled children,\u2019\u201d the Eighth Circuit explained, \u201ca \nschool district\u2019s simple failure to provide a reasonable \naccommodation is not enough to trigger liability.\u201d  Id. \nat 3a.  Instead, under Monahan, children with \ndisabilities \u201cmust prove that school officials acted \nwith \u2018either bad faith or gross misjudgment,\u2019\u201d even \nthough \u201cmuch less\u201d is required \u201cin other disability-\ndiscrimination contexts.  Id. at 3a & 5a n.2.2 \nAva accordingly sought certiorari on whether \nMonahan properly subjects education-related claims \n \n1   Unless otherwise noted, \u201cADA\u201d refers to Title II, and \n\u201cRehabilitation Act\u201d refers to Section 504. \n2   Monahan itself unmistakably established a special rule \nfor \u201cthe context of handicapped children,\u201d as courts have \nrecognized.  687 F.2d at 1170-71 (also noting desire to \n\u201charmonize\u201d the Rehabilitation Act and the IDEA\u2019s predecessor \nstatute); Pet.15-17 (citing cases); contra Resp.Br.2, 24-25. \n\n4 \n \nbrought by children with disabilities to a \u201cuniquely \nstringent\u201d standard.  Pet.i, 2-3, 13, 15-16, 22, 24, 27.  \nAva described the 5-2 circuit split as involving \nwhether \u201cthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s generally \napplicable provisions\u201d impose \u201ca heightened standard \non children with disabilities and no one else.\u201d  Id. at \n14-21.  On the merits, Ava argued that applying this \n\u201cuniquely stringent\u201d test in one factual context \n\u201ccannot be squared with statutory text, structure, or \npurpose.\u201d  Id. at 22-30.  Her supplemental and reply \nbriefs likewise took aim at Monahan\u2019s asymmetric \nregime.  Suppl.Br.1, 3-5; Cert.Reply.1-8. \nThe District\u2019s brief opposing certiorari understood \nthis framing and joined issue only on Ava\u2019s narrow \nquestion \npresented. \n \nThe \nDistrict \ndefended \nMonahan\u2019s asymmetry by arguing that primary and \nsecondary education is a \u201cunique context\u201d giving rise \nto a \u201cunique subset\u201d of ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims calling for a \u201cdifferent standard,\u201d even as \ncompared to \u201ccollege students.\u201d  BIO2-3, 31 n.3; \nsee, e.g., id. at 1, 7, 27-28.  And the District justified \nMonahan as an \u201cappropriate[]\u201d attempt to fashion \u201ca \n\u2018sensible remedial scheme\u2019\u201d for \u201cthe education \ncontext.\u201d  Id. at 26-27.   \nAva\u2019s merits brief then comprehensively explained \nwhy statutory text, structure, history, and purpose \ndemonstrate that the \u201csame standards apply to \neveryone.\u201d  Pet.Br.2; see id. at 23-47.  That submission \nemphasized that her question presented \u201cdoes not ask \nthe Court to decide what standard should uniformly \ngovern all claims.\u201d  Id. at 30 n.7. \n2.  Unable \nto \ndefend \nMonahan\u2019s \ntwo-tiered \napproach, the District now agrees with Ava that the \nsame standards apply \u201cacross the board.\u201d  Resp.Br.2.  \nIt accepts \u201cthe usual rule that statutory provisions \n\n5 \n \nshould carry a consistent meaning,\u201d no matter who a \nplaintiff is or how her claims arose.  Id. at 24.  And it \ndoes not contest Ava\u2019s dozens of pages of argument \nattacking Monahan\u2019s asymmetric standard.  See \nPet.Br.23-47.  \nThe District\u2019s eleventh-hour concession resolves \nthe question presented.  As all parties now agree, the \nsame rules apply to everyone:  Children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims are not \nsubject to a \u201cuniquely stringent\u201d test for liability.  \nPet.i.  The Court should accept the District\u2019s \nconcession and issue a straightforward decision \nrejecting Monahan\u2019s two-tiered approach. \nII. The District\u2019s Radical New Argument Is \nProcedurally Improper  \nRather than defend Monahan\u2019s asymmetry, the \nDistrict now advances a radical new interpretation of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The District argues \nthat all plaintiffs\u2014not just children with disabilities \nbringing education-related claims\u2014must satisfy \nMonahan\u2019s \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \ntest.  \nResp.Br.2.  That reading would upend longstanding \nprecedent from this Court and every circuit, while \ngutting core ADA and Rehabilitation Act protections.  \nIt also directly contradicts the District\u2019s position \nbelow and at the certiorari stage.  The Court should \nrefuse to consider the District\u2019s new theory. \nA. The \nDistrict\u2019s \nNew \nTheory \nWould \nRevolutionize Anti-Discrimination Law  \n \nPreviously, the District called this a \u201cnarrow\u201d case \naffecting only a limited \u201cuniverse of plaintiffs,\u201d \nnamely school-age children with disabilities.  BIO23.  \nNow, the District advances a sweeping argument \nthreatening to eviscerate protections for every \n\n6 \n \nAmerican who endures disability discrimination\u2014\nand quite possibly other kinds of discrimination too.  \nNo court has ever embraced anything close to the \nDistrict\u2019s new rule. \n \n1.  For decades, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nhave been understood to target not just \u201cinvidious \nanimus\u201d against people with disabilities, but also \n\u201cthoughtlessness and indifference\u201d toward their \nunique needs.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985).  With most forms of discrimination\u2014such as \ndiscrimination based on race, sex, or religion\u2014the \nprotected characteristic is usually \u201cnot relevant\u201d to a \ndefendant\u2019s decisionmaking, and the statutory goal is \nto \neliminate \nthat \nimpermissible \nconsideration.  \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  \nBut disability discrimination is different.  A disability \noften itself precludes \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to programs \nor services.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 301.  As a result, \n\u201cdiscrimination against the handicapped is primarily \nthe result of apathetic attitudes rather than \naffirmative animus.\u201d  Id. at 296.  People with \ndisabilities are \u201cshunted aside, hidden, and ignored\u201d \nmore frequently than they are hated, threatened, or \nharassed.  Id. at 295-96.  \n \nEradicating these \u201cshameful oversights\u201d requires \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d even without evidence \nof intentional discrimination.  Id. at 295-96, 300 n.20.  \nMerely treating disability as an impermissible \nconsideration does not solve the problem.  Rather, it \nis \u201cnecessary to dispense with formal equality of \ntreatment\u201d and instead \u201crequire changes in otherwise \nneutral policies that preclude the disabled from \nobtaining\u201d equal access to \u201copportunities that those \nwithout disabilities automatically enjoy.\u201d  Cinnamon \nHills Youth Crisis Ctr., Inc. v. Saint George City, 685 \n\n7 \n \nF.3d 917, 923 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.) (emphasis \nomitted); accord 42 Fed. Reg. 22676 (May 4, 1977).   \n \nAccordingly, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act have \nalways \nrequired \n\u201creasonable \naccommodations,\u201d \nregardless of a covered entity\u2019s intent.  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 301.  And a \u201crefusal to accommodate the needs \nof a disabled person amounts to discrimination \nagainst the handicapped\u201d whenever the denial is \n\u201cunreasonable.\u201d  Se. Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. \n397, 412-13 (1979); accord Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty. v. \nArline, 480 U.S. 273, 287-88 & n.17 (1987); Fry v. \nNapoleon Cmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 159-60 (2017).   \n \nDiscriminatory intent or animus need not be \nshown to establish an ADA or Rehabilitation Act \nviolation.  On the contrary, \u201c[r]ecognizing that failure \nto accommodate persons with disabilities will often \nhave the same practical effect as outright exclusion, \nCongress required the States to take reasonable \nmeasures\u201d to remove \u201cbarriers to accessibility.\u201d  \nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531 (2004).  And the \nparadigmatic application of these laws is mandating \nthe removal of \u201carchitectural barriers\u201d that \u201cwere \nclearly not erected with the aim or intent of excluding \nthe handicapped.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.   \n \nConsistent with these precedents, every circuit \nhas held, as a general rule, that a plaintiff can \nestablish a statutory violation without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Pet.Br.8-9 & n.1.  And the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s regulations have \nalways required \u201creasonable modifications\u201d when \n\u201cnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of \ndisability.\u201d  56 Fed. Reg. 35694, 35718-19 (July 26, \n1991) (ADA) (now codified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7)); \nsee 42 Fed. Reg. at 22680-81 (Rehabilitation Act) (now \ncodified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 41.53, .56).   \n\n8 \n \n \nThe District once conceded these points.  In \nopposing certiorari, it acknowledged that by requiring \n\u201creasonable \naccommodations,\u201d \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \n\u201ctarget[] \nunintentional \ndiscriminatory acts.\u201d  BIO7, 30.  And it defended \nMonahan as applying only in the \u201cunique context\u201d of \nclaims against schools.  Supra 4. \n \n2.  The District\u2019s new argument throws all this out \nthe window.  Now, the District says that all ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs must show \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and \nobtain injunctive relief, such that the statutes do not \n\u201ccreate \nintent-free \nreasonable \naccommodation \nclaims.\u201d  Resp.Br.38.3  According to the District, the \nstatutes cover only actions based on \u201can improper \npurpose\u201d\u2014i.e., a discriminatory \u201cmotive.\u201d  Id. at 2.  \nAnd the same conduct can be \u201clawful if taken for one \nreason, but unlawful if taken for another.\u201d  Id. at 16.  \nWhat matters is whether the defendant acted \u201cfor \nimproper, \nbad-faith \nreasons\u201d \ndemonstrating \n\u201cintentional discrimination\u201d against people with \ndisabilities.  Id. at 18. \n \nThe District\u2019s \u201cmotive-focused\u201d test, id. at 36, \nwould revolutionize the settled understandings of the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act.  It would overturn the \nunanimous circuit consensus that, outside the school \nsetting, reasonable-accommodation claims are viable \nwithout intentional discrimination.  Pet.Br.8-9.  More \n \n3  Contrary to the District (Resp.Br.2, 37-38), a \u201cclaim \nbased on a denial of a reasonable accommodation differs from a \ndisparate-impact claim.\u201d  Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tenn., \nInc., 926 F.3d 235, 243 (6th Cir. 2019) (Sutton, J.); accord \nCinnamon Hills, 685 F.3d at 922 (Gorsuch, J.).  The former is \npermitted, even in the one circuit holding that the latter is not.  \nDoe, 926 F.3d at 243-45. \n\n9 \n \nimportantly, the District\u2019s theory would immunize \n\u201cmuch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in \npassing\u201d those statutes, Choate, 469 U.S. at 296-97\u2014\nwith shocking consequences.   \n \nConsider some examples.  People \u201cwho use \nwheelchairs for mobility\u201d could not establish a \nstatutory violation when a courthouse has \u201cno \nelevator\u201d or other means of access\u2014even if forced to \n\u201ccrawl[] up two flight of steps\u201d\u2014unless they could \nprove that the architectural design constituted \nintentional discrimination.  Lane, 541 U.S. at 513-14.  \nSo too for someone with \u201ccerebral palsy\u201d if \u201ca public \nlibrary or theater had refused admittance\u201d to her \n\u201cservice dog\u201d based on a generally applicable rule \nprohibiting animals.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161-62, 175.  \nWithout proof of prejudice against blind people, a \nvisually impaired voter would have no recourse for \nlacking \u201cmeaningful access to absentee voting.\u201d  Nat\u2019l \nFed\u2019n of the Blind v. Lamone, 813 F.3d 494, 498 \n(4th Cir. 2016).  And \u201cdeaf individuals\u201d would be out \nof luck, even if a public hospital inexcusably \u201cfailed to \nprovide effective communication\u201d necessary for safe \nand effective medical treatment.  Liese v. Indian River \nCnty. Hosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 338 (11th Cir. 2012).  \n \nThe District\u2019s argument would also jack up the \nstandard\u2014\u201cacross the board\u201d\u2014for obtaining damages \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Resp.Br.2; \nsee id. at 30-34.  Nine circuits currently hold that \n\u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is enough to establish an \n\u201cintentional \nviolation[]\u201d \nof \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act and thus trigger damages liability \noutside the educational context.  Loeffler v. Staten \nIsland Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 (2d Cir. 2009); \nsee Pet.7.  This well-established intent standard \u201cdoes \nnot require a showing of personal ill will or animosity \n\n10 \n \ntoward the disabled person.\u201d  Meagley v. City of Little \nRock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011).  The District\u2019s \nnew theory, by contrast, would extend Monahan\u2019s \n\u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d to all ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct plaintiffs, Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, \n1002 (6th Cir. 2023), even though no court has ever \napplied that standard outside the education context.   \n \n3.  Adopting the District\u2019s motive-focused test \nwould also threaten settled interpretations of other \nanti-discrimination statutes.  The District insists that \nMonahan\u2019s standard flows from the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s requirement that a defendant\u2019s \naction was made \u201cby reason of\u201d the \u201cstatutorily \nprohibited \nconsideration\u201d\u2014here \n\u201cdisability.\u201d  \nResp.Br.16.  But as the District itself emphasizes, \nother anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI, \nTitle VII, and Title IX, use \u201cmaterially identical\u201d \nlanguage.  Id. at 35, 41; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d, \n2000e-2; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a).  If the District is right \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \u201cby reason of\u201d \nlanguage requires bad faith, the District\u2019s logic would \nsuggest that these other statutes demand the same.  \nSee Resp.Br.31-32.   \n \nThis Court has never embraced a bad faith \nstandard under these laws.  It has rejected the \nDistrict\u2019s position (Resp.Br.43) that a \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmotive can excuse liability.  See, e.g., Int\u2019l Union, \nUnited Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers \nv. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199 (1991); \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & \nFellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 289 (2023) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring).  And contrary to the \nDistrict\u2019s claim that \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d cannot \n\u201cbe the appropriate standard,\u201d Resp.Br.31-32, this \nCourt has repeatedly embraced that test under \n\n11 \n \nTitle IX.  See Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n524 U.S. 274, 289-91 (1998); Davis v. Monroe Cnty. \nBd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 642-43 (1999).   \n \nFor all these reasons, the District\u2019s position would \ntransform this narrow dispute about the rights of \nschool-age \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \ninto \na \nrevolutionary case that could redefine not just the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act, but also numerous other \ncivil-rights laws. \nB.

For four years, it \ndefended the Eighth Circuit\u2019s asymmetric Monahan \nrule as correctly interpreting Title II of the Americans \nwith Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act.  The District consistently \nmaintained that Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 \n(8th Cir. 1982), \u201cappropriately developed\u201d a special \nrule applying only to a \u201cunique subset\u201d of claims \nbrought by children with disabilities against their \nschools.  BIO2.  The District won on that theory at \nevery stage below and tried to avoid certiorari on that \nbasis here too. \n \nThe District\u2019s problem is that this Court granted \nreview\u2014and \nMonahan\u2019s \nasymmetric \nrule \nis \nindefensible.  So now the game is up.  The District \nknows there is no way the Court will interpret the \nsame statutory provision to create a two-tier standard \nof justice imposing a uniquely stringent bad-faith-or-\ngross-misjudgment requirement only on vulnerable \nchildren who face disability discrimination at school. \n \nDesperate times call for desperate measures.  And \nso just four weeks before oral argument, the District \nconceded the question presented, abandoned its prior \narguments, and undertook a massive flip-flop.  \nBefore, the District defended imposing different \nstandards on different plaintiffs, BIO26-27\u2014but now \nit concedes that the same rules apply to everyone, \nResp.Br.2.  Before, the District acknowledged that \nboth statutes \u201ctarget[] unintentional discriminatory \nacts\u201d and thus require \u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d \nBIO7, 30\u2014but now it says these laws demand a \ndiscriminatory \n\u201cmotive\u201d \nand \nthus \nforeclose \nparadigmatic \nreasonable-accommodation \nclaims.  \n\n2 \n \nResp.Br.2.  Before, the District described Ava\u2019s \n\u201cquestion presented\u201d as \u201cnarrow\u201d and impacting only \nschool-age children with disabilities, BIO23\u2014but now \nit asks this Court to embrace a new \u201cacross the board\u201d \nrule that would impair the rights of all victims of \ndisability discrimination, Resp.Br.2. \nThis Court should not bless the District\u2019s tactics.  \nThis case has always been about whether Monahan\u2019s \n\u201cuniquely stringent\u201d rule for school children with \ndisabilities is a valid exception to the baseline \nstandards that apply to all other plaintiffs.  Pet.i.  The \nDistrict now concedes no exception is warranted.  The \nCourt should accept that concession and overturn the \ndecision below. \n \nThis Court should not entertain the District\u2019s new \narguments for applying Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-\ngross-misjudgment test to everyone.  Judicial \nestoppel and this Court\u2019s rules bar the District from \noverhauling its longstanding position and expanding \nthe question presented.  Enforcing these procedural \ndoctrines \nis \nespecially \nimperative \ngiven \nthe \nrevolutionary\u2014and uniformly harmful\u2014impact of \nthe District\u2019s new theory.   \n \nIf the District\u2019s new theory is considered, the \nCourt should reject it.  The District\u2019s approach would \ngut the ADA and Rehabilitation Act in their most \nparadigmatic applications.  It would violate the text, \nflout precedent, and upend settled law across the \ncountry.  This Court should answer Ava\u2019s question \npresented and vacate the Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment. \n\n3 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. The \nDistrict \nConcedes \nThe \nQuestion \nPresented \nThis Court granted certiorari to decide whether \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act1 must \nsatisfy a heightened, context-specific test (as five \ncircuits have held), or meet the same standards as \neveryone else suing under these statutes (as two \ncircuits have held).  Pet.i.  The District now concedes \nthat the former asymmetric regime cannot stand.  \nResp.Br.2.  That should end this case. \n1.  The Eighth Circuit denied Ava relief under \nMonahan\u2019s exception to the general rules governing \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  Pet.App.4a-5a & \nn.2.  \u201c[W]hen the alleged ADA and [Rehabilitation \nAct] violations are \u2018based on educational services for \ndisabled children,\u2019\u201d the Eighth Circuit explained, \u201ca \nschool district\u2019s simple failure to provide a reasonable \naccommodation is not enough to trigger liability.\u201d  Id. \nat 3a.  Instead, under Monahan, children with \ndisabilities \u201cmust prove that school officials acted \nwith \u2018either bad faith or gross misjudgment,\u2019\u201d even \nthough \u201cmuch less\u201d is required \u201cin other disability-\ndiscrimination contexts.  Id. at 3a & 5a n.2.2 \nAva accordingly sought certiorari on whether \nMonahan properly subjects education-related claims \n \n1   Unless otherwise noted, \u201cADA\u201d refers to Title II, and \n\u201cRehabilitation Act\u201d refers to Section 504. \n2   Monahan itself unmistakably established a special rule \nfor \u201cthe context of handicapped children,\u201d as courts have \nrecognized.  687 F.2d at 1170-71 (also noting desire to \n\u201charmonize\u201d the Rehabilitation Act and the IDEA\u2019s predecessor \nstatute); Pet.15-17 (citing cases); contra Resp.Br.2, 24-25. \n\n4 \n \nbrought by children with disabilities to a \u201cuniquely \nstringent\u201d standard.  Pet.i, 2-3, 13, 15-16, 22, 24, 27.  \nAva described the 5-2 circuit split as involving \nwhether \u201cthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s generally \napplicable provisions\u201d impose \u201ca heightened standard \non children with disabilities and no one else.\u201d  Id. at \n14-21.  On the merits, Ava argued that applying this \n\u201cuniquely stringent\u201d test in one factual context \n\u201ccannot be squared with statutory text, structure, or \npurpose.\u201d  Id. at 22-30.  Her supplemental and reply \nbriefs likewise took aim at Monahan\u2019s asymmetric \nregime.  Suppl.Br.1, 3-5; Cert.Reply.1-8. \nThe District\u2019s brief opposing certiorari understood \nthis framing and joined issue only on Ava\u2019s narrow \nquestion \npresented. \n \nThe \nDistrict \ndefended \nMonahan\u2019s asymmetry by arguing that primary and \nsecondary education is a \u201cunique context\u201d giving rise \nto a \u201cunique subset\u201d of ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims calling for a \u201cdifferent standard,\u201d even as \ncompared to \u201ccollege students.\u201d  BIO2-3, 31 n.3; \nsee, e.g., id. at 1, 7, 27-28.  And the District justified \nMonahan as an \u201cappropriate[]\u201d attempt to fashion \u201ca \n\u2018sensible remedial scheme\u2019\u201d for \u201cthe education \ncontext.\u201d  Id. at 26-27.   \nAva\u2019s merits brief then comprehensively explained \nwhy statutory text, structure, history, and purpose \ndemonstrate that the \u201csame standards apply to \neveryone.\u201d  Pet.Br.2; see id. at 23-47.  That submission \nemphasized that her question presented \u201cdoes not ask \nthe Court to decide what standard should uniformly \ngovern all claims.\u201d  Id. at 30 n.7. \n2.  Unable \nto \ndefend \nMonahan\u2019s \ntwo-tiered \napproach, the District now agrees with Ava that the \nsame standards apply \u201cacross the board.\u201d  Resp.Br.2.  \nIt accepts \u201cthe usual rule that statutory provisions \n\n5 \n \nshould carry a consistent meaning,\u201d no matter who a \nplaintiff is or how her claims arose.  Id. at 24.  And it \ndoes not contest Ava\u2019s dozens of pages of argument \nattacking Monahan\u2019s asymmetric standard.  See \nPet.Br.23-47.  \nThe District\u2019s eleventh-hour concession resolves \nthe question presented.  As all parties now agree, the \nsame rules apply to everyone:  Children with \ndisabilities bringing education-related claims are not \nsubject to a \u201cuniquely stringent\u201d test for liability.  \nPet.i.  The Court should accept the District\u2019s \nconcession and issue a straightforward decision \nrejecting Monahan\u2019s two-tiered approach. \nII. The District\u2019s Radical New Argument Is \nProcedurally Improper  \nRather than defend Monahan\u2019s asymmetry, the \nDistrict now advances a radical new interpretation of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The District argues \nthat all plaintiffs\u2014not just children with disabilities \nbringing education-related claims\u2014must satisfy \nMonahan\u2019s \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \ntest.  \nResp.Br.2.  That reading would upend longstanding \nprecedent from this Court and every circuit, while \ngutting core ADA and Rehabilitation Act protections.  \nIt also directly contradicts the District\u2019s position \nbelow and at the certiorari stage.  The Court should \nrefuse to consider the District\u2019s new theory. \nA. The \nDistrict\u2019s \nNew \nTheory \nWould \nRevolutionize Anti-Discrimination Law  \n \nPreviously, the District called this a \u201cnarrow\u201d case \naffecting only a limited \u201cuniverse of plaintiffs,\u201d \nnamely school-age children with disabilities.  BIO23.  \nNow, the District advances a sweeping argument \nthreatening to eviscerate protections for every \n\n6 \n \nAmerican who endures disability discrimination\u2014\nand quite possibly other kinds of discrimination too.  \nNo court has ever embraced anything close to the \nDistrict\u2019s new rule. \n \n1.  For decades, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nhave been understood to target not just \u201cinvidious \nanimus\u201d against people with disabilities, but also \n\u201cthoughtlessness and indifference\u201d toward their \nunique needs.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985).  With most forms of discrimination\u2014such as \ndiscrimination based on race, sex, or religion\u2014the \nprotected characteristic is usually \u201cnot relevant\u201d to a \ndefendant\u2019s decisionmaking, and the statutory goal is \nto \neliminate \nthat \nimpermissible \nconsideration.  \nBostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  \nBut disability discrimination is different.  A disability \noften itself precludes \u201cmeaningful access\u201d to programs \nor services.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 301.  As a result, \n\u201cdiscrimination against the handicapped is primarily \nthe result of apathetic attitudes rather than \naffirmative animus.\u201d  Id. at 296.  People with \ndisabilities are \u201cshunted aside, hidden, and ignored\u201d \nmore frequently than they are hated, threatened, or \nharassed.  Id. at 295-96.  \n \nEradicating these \u201cshameful oversights\u201d requires \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d even without evidence \nof intentional discrimination.  Id. at 295-96, 300 n.20.  \nMerely treating disability as an impermissible \nconsideration does not solve the problem.  Rather, it \nis \u201cnecessary to dispense with formal equality of \ntreatment\u201d and instead \u201crequire changes in otherwise \nneutral policies that preclude the disabled from \nobtaining\u201d equal access to \u201copportunities that those \nwithout disabilities automatically enjoy.\u201d  Cinnamon \nHills Youth Crisis Ctr., Inc. v. Saint George City, 685 \n\n7 \n \nF.3d 917, 923 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.) (emphasis \nomitted); accord 42 Fed. Reg. 22676 (May 4, 1977).   \n \nAccordingly, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act have \nalways \nrequired \n\u201creasonable \naccommodations,\u201d \nregardless of a covered entity\u2019s intent.  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 301.  And a \u201crefusal to accommodate the needs \nof a disabled person amounts to discrimination \nagainst the handicapped\u201d whenever the denial is \n\u201cunreasonable.\u201d  Se. Cmty. Coll. v. Davis, 442 U.S. \n397, 412-13 (1979); accord Sch. Bd. of Nassau Cnty. v. \nArline, 480 U.S. 273, 287-88 & n.17 (1987); Fry v. \nNapoleon Cmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 159-60 (2017).   \n \nDiscriminatory intent or animus need not be \nshown to establish an ADA or Rehabilitation Act \nviolation.  On the contrary, \u201c[r]ecognizing that failure \nto accommodate persons with disabilities will often \nhave the same practical effect as outright exclusion, \nCongress required the States to take reasonable \nmeasures\u201d to remove \u201cbarriers to accessibility.\u201d  \nTennessee v. Lane, 541 U.S. 509, 531 (2004).  And the \nparadigmatic application of these laws is mandating \nthe removal of \u201carchitectural barriers\u201d that \u201cwere \nclearly not erected with the aim or intent of excluding \nthe handicapped.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.   \n \nConsistent with these precedents, every circuit \nhas held, as a general rule, that a plaintiff can \nestablish a statutory violation without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Pet.Br.8-9 & n.1.  And the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s regulations have \nalways required \u201creasonable modifications\u201d when \n\u201cnecessary to avoid discrimination on the basis of \ndisability.\u201d  56 Fed. Reg. 35694, 35718-19 (July 26, \n1991) (ADA) (now codified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7)); \nsee 42 Fed. Reg. at 22680-81 (Rehabilitation Act) (now \ncodified at 28 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 41.53, .56).   \n\n8 \n \n \nThe District once conceded these points.  In \nopposing certiorari, it acknowledged that by requiring \n\u201creasonable \naccommodations,\u201d \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \n\u201ctarget[] \nunintentional \ndiscriminatory acts.\u201d  BIO7, 30.  And it defended \nMonahan as applying only in the \u201cunique context\u201d of \nclaims against schools.  Supra 4. \n \n2.  The District\u2019s new argument throws all this out \nthe window.  Now, the District says that all ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs must show \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and \nobtain injunctive relief, such that the statutes do not \n\u201ccreate \nintent-free \nreasonable \naccommodation \nclaims.\u201d  Resp.Br.38.3  According to the District, the \nstatutes cover only actions based on \u201can improper \npurpose\u201d\u2014i.e., a discriminatory \u201cmotive.\u201d  Id. at 2.  \nAnd the same conduct can be \u201clawful if taken for one \nreason, but unlawful if taken for another.\u201d  Id. at 16.  \nWhat matters is whether the defendant acted \u201cfor \nimproper, \nbad-faith \nreasons\u201d \ndemonstrating \n\u201cintentional discrimination\u201d against people with \ndisabilities.  Id. at 18. \n \nThe District\u2019s \u201cmotive-focused\u201d test, id. at 36, \nwould revolutionize the settled understandings of the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act.  It would overturn the \nunanimous circuit consensus that, outside the school \nsetting, reasonable-accommodation claims are viable \nwithout intentional discrimination.  Pet.Br.8-9.  More \n \n3  Contrary to the District (Resp.Br.2, 37-38), a \u201cclaim \nbased on a denial of a reasonable accommodation differs from a \ndisparate-impact claim.\u201d  Doe v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tenn., \nInc., 926 F.3d 235, 243 (6th Cir. 2019) (Sutton, J.); accord \nCinnamon Hills, 685 F.3d at 922 (Gorsuch, J.).  The former is \npermitted, even in the one circuit holding that the latter is not.  \nDoe, 926 F.3d at 243-45. \n\n9 \n \nimportantly, the District\u2019s theory would immunize \n\u201cmuch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in \npassing\u201d those statutes, Choate, 469 U.S. at 296-97\u2014\nwith shocking consequences.   \n \nConsider some examples.  People \u201cwho use \nwheelchairs for mobility\u201d could not establish a \nstatutory violation when a courthouse has \u201cno \nelevator\u201d or other means of access\u2014even if forced to \n\u201ccrawl[] up two flight of steps\u201d\u2014unless they could \nprove that the architectural design constituted \nintentional discrimination.  Lane, 541 U.S. at 513-14.  \nSo too for someone with \u201ccerebral palsy\u201d if \u201ca public \nlibrary or theater had refused admittance\u201d to her \n\u201cservice dog\u201d based on a generally applicable rule \nprohibiting animals.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161-62, 175.  \nWithout proof of prejudice against blind people, a \nvisually impaired voter would have no recourse for \nlacking \u201cmeaningful access to absentee voting.\u201d  Nat\u2019l \nFed\u2019n of the Blind v. Lamone, 813 F.3d 494, 498 \n(4th Cir. 2016).  And \u201cdeaf individuals\u201d would be out \nof luck, even if a public hospital inexcusably \u201cfailed to \nprovide effective communication\u201d necessary for safe \nand effective medical treatment.  Liese v. Indian River \nCnty. Hosp. Dist., 701 F.3d 334, 338 (11th Cir. 2012).  \n \nThe District\u2019s argument would also jack up the \nstandard\u2014\u201cacross the board\u201d\u2014for obtaining damages \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Resp.Br.2; \nsee id. at 30-34.  Nine circuits currently hold that \n\u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is enough to establish an \n\u201cintentional \nviolation[]\u201d \nof \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation Act and thus trigger damages liability \noutside the educational context.  Loeffler v. Staten \nIsland Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 (2d Cir. 2009); \nsee Pet.7.  This well-established intent standard \u201cdoes \nnot require a showing of personal ill will or animosity \n\n10 \n \ntoward the disabled person.\u201d  Meagley v. City of Little \nRock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011).  The District\u2019s \nnew theory, by contrast, would extend Monahan\u2019s \n\u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d to all ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct plaintiffs, Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, \n1002 (6th Cir. 2023), even though no court has ever \napplied that standard outside the education context.   \n \n3.  Adopting the District\u2019s motive-focused test \nwould also threaten settled interpretations of other \nanti-discrimination statutes.  The District insists that \nMonahan\u2019s standard flows from the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s requirement that a defendant\u2019s \naction was made \u201cby reason of\u201d the \u201cstatutorily \nprohibited \nconsideration\u201d\u2014here \n\u201cdisability.\u201d  \nResp.Br.16.  But as the District itself emphasizes, \nother anti-discrimination laws, including Title VI, \nTitle VII, and Title IX, use \u201cmaterially identical\u201d \nlanguage.  Id. at 35, 41; see 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2000d, \n2000e-2; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1681(a).  If the District is right \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \u201cby reason of\u201d \nlanguage requires bad faith, the District\u2019s logic would \nsuggest that these other statutes demand the same.  \nSee Resp.Br.31-32.   \n \nThis Court has never embraced a bad faith \nstandard under these laws.  It has rejected the \nDistrict\u2019s position (Resp.Br.43) that a \u201cgood faith\u201d \nmotive can excuse liability.  See, e.g., Int\u2019l Union, \nUnited Auto., Aerospace & Agric. Implement Workers \nv. Johnson Controls, Inc., 499 U.S. 187, 199 (1991); \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & \nFellows of Harvard Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 289 (2023) \n(Gorsuch, J., concurring).  And contrary to the \nDistrict\u2019s claim that \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d cannot \n\u201cbe the appropriate standard,\u201d Resp.Br.31-32, this \nCourt has repeatedly embraced that test under \n\n11 \n \nTitle IX.  See Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n524 U.S. 274, 289-91 (1998); Davis v. Monroe Cnty. \nBd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 642-43 (1999).   \n \nFor all these reasons, the District\u2019s position would \ntransform this narrow dispute about the rights of \nschool-age \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \ninto \na \nrevolutionary case that could redefine not just the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act, but also numerous other \ncivil-rights laws. \nB. The District\u2019s New Theory Is Not Properly \nPresented \n \nThis Court should not address the District\u2019s new \nargument \nthat \nMonahan\u2019s \nbad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard applies to all ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  That radical contention \ngoes beyond the question presented and directly \ncontradicts the District\u2019s position throughout this \ncase.  Under this Court\u2019s rules, it should not be \nconsidered.  See Stephen M. Shapiro et al., Supreme \nCourt Practice \u00a7 6.26(a)-(c) (11th ed. 2019). \n \n1.  Settled principles of judicial estoppel foreclose \nthe District\u2019s about-face in this Court.  That doctrine \n\u201cprevents a party from prevailing in one phase of a \ncase on an argument and then relying on a \ncontradictory argument to prevail in another phase.\u201d  \nNew Hampshire v. Maine, 532 U.S. 742, 749 (2001).  \nJudicial estoppel \u201cprotect[s] the integrity of the \njudicial process\u201d by \u201cprohibiting parties from \ndeliberately changing positions according to the \nexigencies of the moment.\u201d  Id. at 749-50.  Such \ntactics are an \u201cimproper use of judicial machinery.\u201d  \nId. at 750. \n \nThis is a textbook case for judicial estoppel.  Below, \nthe District ducked en banc review by defending \n\n12 \n \nMonahan\u2019s asymmetry, without ever hinting that its \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment test should apply \nacross the board.  The District argued that Monahan\u2019s \nstandard \n\u201ccorrectly\u201d \naddresses \n\u201cunique \nconsiderations\u201d raised by education-related claims \nunder \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct.  \nCA8.Resp.Reh\u2019g.Opp.2.  And it conceded that both \nstatutes \nrequire \n\u201c\u2018reasonable \naccommodations\u2019\u201d \noutside the school setting\u2014regardless of intent.  Id. \nat 15.  On that basis, the District accused Ava of \nseeking to overturn \u201c40 years of precedent,\u201d while \ninsisting that Monahan\u2019s two-tiered approach \u201cwas \nappropriate when it was adopted and remains \nappropriate today.\u201d  Id. at 1. \n \nThat argument paid off.  Over three dissents, the \nEighth Circuit denied en banc review and left \nMonahan undisturbed.  Pet.App.44a.  But because the \nDistrict\u2019s \u201cinterests have changed\u201d after the grant of \ncertiorari, it has suddenly \u201cassume[d]\u201d a contrary \nposition at the merits stage.  New Hampshire, 532 \nU.S. at 749.  The District concedes the same \nstandards govern \u201cacross the board,\u201d while asserting \nthat \u201cintent-free reasonable-accommodation claims\u201d \ndo not exist.  Resp.Br.2, 24.   \n \nHad the District straightforwardly told the Eighth \nCircuit what it now says here\u2014that Monahan\u2019s \nasymmetric \nregime \nis \nwrong\u2014Ava\u2019s \nrehearing \npetition would surely have been granted.  This Court \nshould \nnot \nreward \nthe \nDistrict\u2019s \n\u201cintentional \nself-contradiction.\u201d  New Hampshire, 532 U.S. at 751. \n \n2.  The Court\u2019s rules and basic forfeiture principles \nlikewise bar the District\u2019s sweeping new arguments.  \nRule 15.2 requires respondents to address\u2014\u201cin the \nbrief in opposition, and not later\u201d\u2014\u201cany perceived \nmisstatement of fact or law in the petition that bears \n\n13 \n \non what issues properly would be before the Court if \ncertiorari were granted.\u201d  A respondent\u2019s merits brief, \nlike a petitioner\u2019s, may \u201cnot raise additional questions \nor change the substance of the questions already \npresented.\u201d  Sup. Ct. R. 24.1(a), 24.2.  And this Court \ngenerally \u201cwill not entertain arguments not made \nbelow,\u201d even when asserted by respondents.  OBB \nPersonenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 577 U.S. 27, 37-38 \n(2015).   \n \nThese rules \u201creflect[] the fact that our adversarial \nsystem assigns both sides responsibility for framing \nthe issues,\u201d and they serve important purposes.  \nGranite Rock Co. v. Int\u2019l Bhd. of Teamsters, 561 U.S. \n287, 306 n.14 (2010).  For one thing, they \u201chelp to \nmaintain the integrity of the process of certiorari.\u201d  \nTaylor v. Freeland & Kronz, 503 U.S. 638, 646 (1992).  \nLetting parties \u201calter\u201d the question presented or \n\u201cdevise additional questions at the last minute\u201d would \n\u201cthwart this system.\u201d  Id.  The Court thus consistently \nrefuses to consider \u201calternative grounds to affirm\u201d \nthat fall \u201coutside the question[] presented.\u201d  Glover v. \nUnited States, 531 U.S. 198, 205 (2001); see, e.g., West \nv. Gibson, 527 U.S. 212, 223 (1999).   \n \nFurthermore, \u201c[b]ecause this is \u2018a court of review, \nnot of first view,\u2019\u201d the Court considers it \u201cgenerally \nunwise to consider arguments in the first instance.\u201d  \nByrd v. United States, 584 U.S. 395, 404 (2018).  When \nthe lower courts \u201cdid not have occasion to address\u201d an \nissue or \u201cwhat consequences might follow from\u201d \ndeciding it, this Court\u2019s decisionmaking lacks the \nbenefit of their analysis\u2014and suffers as a result.  Id.  \nThis rule, too, applies with full force to respondents.  \nSee, e.g., United States v. Miller, 145 S. Ct. 839, 856 \n(2025); OBB, 577 U.S. at 37-38. \n\n14 \n \n \nUnder these bedrock principles, the Court should \nnot countenance the District\u2019s eleventh-hour assault \non the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act.  Ava\u2019s petition \nnoted that \u201c[a]s a general matter,\u201d plaintiffs suing \nunder those statutes can establish a violation and \n\u201cobtain injunctive relief without proving intentional \ndisability discrimination,\u201d and can obtain damages \n\u201cby proving that the defendant was deliberately \nindifferent to their federally protected rights.\u201d  Pet.2.  \nIt repeatedly referenced these \u201cbaseline standards.\u201d  \nId. at 18-21, 23-24, 27, 31-32.  It also attacked \nMonahan as adopting an \u201casymmetric interpretation \ndisfavoring children with disabilities.\u201d  Id. at 3; see id. \nat 13-14, 22-29.   \n \nYet the District\u2019s opposition to certiorari did not \nchallenge the baseline standards or contest Ava\u2019s \naccount of Monahan.  It did the opposite:  The District \nsteadfastly defended Monahan\u2019s two-tiered regime.  \nSupra 4.  It accepted that \u201cless-demanding standards\u201d \napply in other settings.  BIO23.  And it admitted that \nboth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201crequire covered \nentities to make reasonable accommodations\u201d in other \ncontexts, even in the absence of \u201c\u2018discriminatory \nintent.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 7, 30 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 297).  \nAll this mirrors what the District told the Eighth \nCircuit. \n \nSee \nCA8.Resp.Reh\u2019g.Opp.1-2, \n15; \nCA8.Resp.Br.22, 25.  And it directly contradicts the \nDistrict\u2019s merits brief here.  Supra 4-5, 8-10. \n \n This Court has repeatedly rejected materially \nidentical maneuvers.  For example, in Travelers \nCasualty & Surety Co. of America v. Pacific Gas & \nElectric Co., 549 U.S. 443 (2007), the Court granted \ncertiorari to review the so-called Fobian rule, \u201cwhich \nheld that \u2018where the litigated issues\u2019\u201d in bankruptcy \nproceedings involve \u201cissues peculiar to federal \n\n15 \n \nbankruptcy law, attorney\u2019s fees will not be awarded \nabsent bad faith or harassment.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 447 (quoting \nIn re Fobian, 951 F.2d 1149, 1153 (9th Cir. 1991)).  In \nits merits brief, the respondent \u201cma[de] no effort to \ndefend the Fobian rule\u201d and instead advanced a \nbroader \nargument \n\u201ccategorically \ndisallow[ing] \nunsecured claims for contractual attorney\u2019s fees.\u201d  Id. \nat 454.  This Court declined \u201cto affirm on that basis\u201d \nbecause the respondent \u201cdid not raise these \narguments below\u201d or in its \u201cbrief in opposition.\u201d  Id. \nat 454-55.  \nLikewise, in Norfolk Southern Railway Co. v. \nSorrell, 549 U.S. 158 (2007), the Court granted \ncertiorari to decide whether \u201cthe causation standard \nfor employee contributory negligence under [the \nFederal Employer\u2019s Liability Act] differs from the \ncausation standard for railroad negligence.\u201d  Id. at \n162 (emphasis omitted).  At the merits stage, the \npetitioner \u201cattempted to expand the question \npresented to encompass what the standard of \ncausation under FELA should be, not simply whether \nthe standard should be the same for railroad \nnegligence and employee contributory negligence.\u201d  \nId. at 163 (emphasis omitted).  This Court refused to \nconsider that argument.  Id. at 164-65.  The petitioner \nwas \u201cnot only enlarging the question presented, but \ntaking a position on that enlarged question that is \ncontrary to the position it litigated below.\u201d  Id. at 164.  \nMoreover, the Court emphasized, \u201cthe issue of the \nsubstantive content of the causation standard [wa]s \nsignificant enough\u201d that the Court \u201cprefer[red] not to \naddress it\u201d because it had \u201cnot been fully presented.\u201d  \nId. at 164-65.   \n3.  The District offers no \u201cconvincing reason to \ndepart\u201d from these settled estoppel and forfeiture \n\n16 \n \nprinciples.  S. Cent. Bell Tel. Co. v. Alabama, 526 U.S. \n160, 171 (1999).  On the contrary, there are especially \ngood reasons not to let the District \u201cswitch gears\u201d and \n\u201csmuggle additional questions\u201d into this case \u201cafter \nthe grant of certiorari.\u201d  Norfolk, 549 U.S. at 164-65. \nFirst, as explained, the District\u2019s broadside attack \non intent-free reasonable-accommodation claims has \n\u201cfar-reaching\u201d implications.  S. Cent. Bell, 526 U.S. \nat 171; see supra 5-11.  Even more so than in Norfolk, \n\u201cthe issue of the substantive content of the causation \nstandard\u201d required by the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct is \u201csignificant.\u201d  549 U.S. at 164-65.  It covers the \nfull universe of all victims of discrimination, not just \nthe subset of children with disabilities bringing \neducation-based claims.  Supra 5-11. \nSecond, \u201cno other court has ever considered\u201d the \nDistrict\u2019s revolutionary new theory.  Miller, 145 S. Ct. \nat 856.  Nor has it \u201cbeen adequately briefed\u201d here.  Id.  \nBecause the District did not \u201cmake clear it intended \nto make [its new] argument until it filed its brief on \nthe merits,\u201d S. Cent. Bell., 526 U.S. at 171, Ava\u2019s brief \ndid not address that theory.  See Pet.Br.30 n.7.  Nor \ndid her amici. \nThird, it would be \u201cunfair at this point to allow \n[the District] to switch gears and seek a ruling from \n[this Court] that the standard should be [bad faith or \ngross misjudgment] across the board.\u201d  Norfolk, 549 \nU.S. at 165.  For years, the District successfully \ndefended \nMonahan\u2019s \nasymmetry, \nover \nAva\u2019s \npersistent opposition.  The District should not get a \ndo-over just because it finally sees the writing on the \nwall.  Blessing the District\u2019s gambit would invite \nsimilar gamesmanship in future cases. \n\n17 \n \nThe bottom line is that the Court \u201cdid not grant \ncertiorari\u201d on the District\u2019s radical new argument, \nand \u201cwithout adequate briefing, it would not be \nprudent\u201d\u2014or fair\u2014\u201cto decide it here.\u201d  Food & Drug \nAdmin. v. Wages & White Lion Invs., LLC, 145 S. Ct. \n898, 916 (2025).  The Court should \u201cstick to the \nquestion on which certiorari was sought and granted.\u201d  \nNorfolk, 549 U.S. at 164.  As both parties now agree, \nAva\u2019s answer to that question is correct.4 \nIII. The District\u2019s Radical Theory Is Wrong \n \nThe District\u2019s revolutionary interpretation of the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act does not withstand \nscrutiny.  The settled interpretation of these statutes \nembraced by this Court, every circuit, and the United \nStates should not be cast aside.  Supra 6-8; see \nU.S.Br.12-20.  Intentional discrimination is not \nrequired to establish a reasonable-accommodation \nclaim, and damages are available based on a showing \nof deliberate indifference.   \n \n1.  As explained, it has long been understood that \nthe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprohibit \ndiscrimination resulting from \u201cbenign neglect\u201d of \npeople with disabilities, not just \u201cconduct fueled by a \ndiscriminatory intent.\u201d  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295-97; \nsupra 6-7.  Statutory text and history fully support \nthat result.   \n \nThe Rehabilitation Act provides that \u201c[n]o \notherwise qualified individual with a disability\u201d shall, \n \n4  The District urges the Court to address the substantive \nstandards because merely overturning Monahan would \u201cleave \nnothing in its place.\u201d Resp.Br.27.  That\u2019s wrong:  Monahan \ncreated a limited exception to the baseline rules otherwise \ngoverning ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims; eliminating that \nexception would leave those baseline rules intact.  Pet.Br.8-10. \n\n18 \n \n\u201csolely by reason of her or his disability, be excluded \nfrom the participation in, be denied the benefits of, or \nbe subjected to discrimination under any program or \nactivity receiving\u201d federal funds.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a) \n(emphasis added).  The ADA\u2019s similarly worded \nprohibition uses the same \u201cby reason of\u201d language, \nminus the \u201csolely\u201d modifier.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.   \n \nNeither statute requires improper motive or \nintent.  \u201cThe phrase \u2018by reason of\u2019 denotes some form \nof causation,\u201d not an intent or motive requirement.  \nHusted v. A. Philip Randolph Inst., 584 U.S. 756, 769 \n(2018); accord Univ. of Texas Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, \n570 U.S. 338, 350 (2013).  The use of the \u201cpassive \nvoice\u201d reinforces that the by-reason-of-disability \nelement \u201cdoes not require proof of intent.\u201d  Dean v. \nUnited States, 556 U.S. 568, 572 (2009).   \n \nInstead, the text demands a causal link between a \nperson\u2019s disability and the complained-of action.  The \nfailure to provide a reasonable accommodation \nreadily satisfies this \u201ccausation requirement,\u201d even \nwithout proof of animus or intentional discrimination.  \nHusted, 584 U.S. at 769.  In countless situations\u2014\nsuch as stairs preventing a physically impaired \nperson from accessing a courthouse, a no-animals \npolicy barring someone with a service dog from a \nmunicipal library, or braille-free ballots precluding a \nblind person from voting absentee\u2014a person can lose \naccess to benefits and services \u201cby reason of\u201d his or \nher disability, without any harmful intent.  Supra 9.  \nAs Justice Gorsuch has explained, victims are harmed \nby the denial of reasonable accommodations \u201cbecause \n\n19 \n \nof conditions created by their disabilities.\u201d  Cinnamon \nHills, 685 F.3d at 923.5   \n \nOther textual features confirm that a \u201crefusal to \naccommodate the needs of a disabled person\u201d may \nitself \u201camount[] to discrimination against the \nhandicapped.\u201d  Davis, 442 U.S. at 413; accord Doe, \n926 F.3d at 243 (Sutton, J.).  For example, the ADA \nexpressly contemplates such claims by creating an \nexception from the duty to \u201cprovide a reasonable \naccommodation\u201d in certain circumstances.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12201(h).  Its definition of \u201cqualified individual[s]\u201d \nextends to individuals with disabilities who, with \n\u201creasonable modifications,\u201d can meet the relevant \n\u201cessential eligibility requirements.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12131(2); see id. \u00a7 12132.  And the Rehabilitation \nAct makes clear that it sometimes requires structural \nalterations to buildings \u201cfor the purpose of assuring \nprogram accessibility.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(c).     \n \nThese statutory references reinforce that both the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act create affirmative duties \nto provide reasonable accommodations in certain \ncircumstances.  And as Choate makes clear, the \nfailure to provide such accommodations typically \nstems from \u201cthoughtlessness,\u201d \u201cindifference,\u201d and \n\u201cbenign neglect\u201d\u2014not  \u201caffirmative animus.\u201d  469 U.S. \nat 295-96.  Requiring harmful intent would neuter \n \n5  Under other anti-discrimination statutes, by contrast, \nintentional discrimination is usually the only way to satisfy the \nstatutory causation requirement.  It thus makes sense for the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act to prohibit discrimination \nstemming from \u201capathetic attitudes,\u201d even if Title VI and other \nlaws \u201creach only instances of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nChoate, 469 U.S. at 293, 295-96; see U.S.Br.26-29, CVS \nPharmacy, Inc. v. Doe, One, 142 S. Ct. 480 (2021) (No. 20-1374) \n(distinguishing Title VI from disability statutes). \n\n20 \n \nboth statutes in a wide swath of their core \napplications.   \n \nRelevant history confirms that intent is not \nrequired.  Congress enacted the Rehabilitation Act in \n1973 to end the \u201cglaring neglect\u201d of people with \ndisabilities.  118 Cong. Rec. 526 (Jan. 20, 1972); see \nPet.Br.37-38.  Soon after, the Department of Health, \nEducation, and Welfare promulgated longstanding \nregulations requiring \u201creasonable accommodation[s],\u201d \nregardless of intent.  42 Fed. Reg. at 22680-81.  In the \nensuing years, this Court repeatedly treated the \nRehabilitation Act as imposing liability for failure to \nprovide a reasonable accommodation\u2014with no hint of \nany intent requirement.  Supra 7 (citing Davis, \nChoate, and Arline). \n \nIn \n1990, \nthe \nADA \nratified \nthis \nsettled \ninterpretation by providing that \u201cnothing in [Title II] \nshall be construed to apply a lesser standard than the \nstandards applied under [the Rehabilitation Act]\u201d or \nits \u201cregulations.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12201; see id. \u00a7 12133 \n(incorporating Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \u201crights\u201d).6  The \nHouse Judiciary Committee Report on the ADA also \nexpressly \nstated \nthat \nthe \nstatute \nshould \nbe \n\u201cinterpreted consistent with\u201d Choate.  H.R. Rep. No. \n101-485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990).  And, consistent with this \ntext and history, ADA regulations have also always \nrequired \u201creasonable modifications,\u201d regardless of \nintent.  28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7); see 56 Fed. Reg. at \n35718. \n \n6    Based on this incorporation, Congress \u201cchose[] not to list \nall the types of actions that are included within the term \n\u2018discrimination,\u2019 as was done in [T]itles I and III, because \n[Title II] simply extends the anti-discrimination prohibition \nembodied in [the Rehabilitation Act] to all actions of state and \nlocal governments.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 101-485, pt. 2, at 84 (1990). \n\n21 \n \n \n2.  As for damages, common-law principles suggest \nthat an ADA or Rehabilitation Act plaintiff should be \nable to recover whatever relief is necessary to put her \n\u201cin the position\u201d she \u201cwould have occupied if the \n[District\u2019s] wrong had not occurred.\u201d  Babb v. Wilkie, \n589 U.S. 399, 413-14 (2020).  That would include \ncompensatory damages, without any additional proof \nof wrongful intent. \n \nBut as the Solicitor General notes, different rules \noften govern claims for damages under Spending \nClause legislation like the Rehabilitation Act.  \nU.S.Br.15-16.  And because the ADA incorporates the \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s \u201cremedies, procedures, and \nrights,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133, the same logic applies to \nthat statute as well.  See Barnes v. Gorman, 536 U.S. \n181, 189 n.3 (2002).   \n \nIn the Spending Clause context, this Court \n\u201cregularly\u201d relies on a \u201ccontract-law analogy\u201d to define \n\u201cthe scope of conduct for which funding recipients \nmay be held liable for money damages.\u201d  Cummings v. \nPremier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. 212, 219 \n(2022).  The \u201ccentral concern\u201d is to ensure that a \nfunding recipient has \u201cnotice that it will be liable for \na monetary award\u201d\u2014which cannot happen when a \nrecipient is \u201cunaware of the discrimination\u201d alleged.  \nGebser, 524 U.S. at 287.  \n \nApplying these principles in the Title IX context, \nthis Court has allowed damages claims only when the \ndefendant had \u201cactual notice of,\u201d but remained \n\u201cdeliberately indifferent to,\u201d conduct violating the \nstatute.  Id. at 277; see id. at 285-90.  And it has \nconsistently held \u201cmonetary damages\u201d unavailable for \n\u201cunintentional\u201d violations.  Franklin v. Gwinnett \nCnty. Pub. Schs., 503 U.S. 60, 74 (1992).   \n\n22 \n \n \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act can likewise \nsensibly be read to require \u201cdeliberate indifference.\u201d  \nGebser, 524 U.S. at 290.  Here too, that standard \nresolves Spending Clause concerns about \u201cunaware\u201d \ndefendants being held liable for damages.  Id. at \n287-88; see U.S.Br.16-18.  This Court has previously \nrelied on its Title IX precedents to assess damages \nremedies available under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185-89.  Heeding these \ninstructions, \nnine \ncircuits \nhave \nadopted \nthe \ndeliberate-indifference standard for damages claims \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Supra 9.   \n \n3.  The District offers no sound basis to reject the \nlong-settled understanding in favor of its new \ninterpretation that no court has ever embraced.  \nLimited space precludes a comprehensive rebuttal, \nbut a few points bear emphasis. \n \nFirst, the District offers no serious textual case \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \u201cby reason of\u201d \nlanguage somehow limits liability to defendants who \nact with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Contra \nResp.Br.15-19.  That position defies plain meaning \nand this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cby reason of\u201d \nis a causation standard, not a motive requirement.  \nSupra 18-19 & n.5.  It fails to grapple with the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act\u2019s interlocking statutory and \nregulatory history, which confirm that neither statute \nrequires intentional misconduct.   And it is internally \ninconsistent: The District previously acknowledged \nthat \u201cgross misjudgment\u201d under Monahan has always \nencompassed \u201cunintentional yet harmful conduct,\u201d \nBIO30\u2014but now the District reverses course and \ninsists that \u201cgross misjudgment\u201d entails \u201cimproper, \nbad faith reasons,\u201d Resp.Br.18-19, 42 & n.7.   \n\n23 \n \n \nSecond, the District disparages this Court\u2019s \nunanimous decision in Choate, which carefully \nconsidered \nunique \nfeatures \nof \ndisability \ndiscrimination that provide essential context for \ninterpreting the statutory text.  Resp.Br.44.  This \nmarks yet another flip-flop from its brief opposing \ncertiorari, which endorsed Choate\u2019s \u201cinstruction\u201d that \n\u201cconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u2018fueled by a discriminatory intent.\u2019\u201d  BIO30 \n(describing this as Choate\u2019s \u201ch[o]ld[ing]\u201d); see \nResp.Br.42 n.7. \n \nThird, \nthe \nDistrict \nis \nwrong \nto \nargue \n(Resp.Br.31-32) that \u201cdeliberate indifference c[annot] \nbe the appropriate standard\u201d for damages claims \nbecause it falls short of \u201cintentional discrimination.\u201d  \nSee U.S.Br.16-20.  This Court has made clear that \n\u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is a species of \u201cintentional\u201d \nconduct.  Jackson v. Birmingham Bd. of Educ., 544 \nU.S. 167, 173 (2005).  And while it\u2019s true that Gebser \nand Davis involved funding recipients being held \ndirectly liable for their alleged deliberate indifference \nto \n\u201csomeone \nelse\u2019s \nintentional \ndiscrimination,\u201d \nResp.Br.32, this Court has applied that same test \nwhen assessing a party\u2019s own \u201cfailure to attend to \n[someone\u2019s] medical needs.\u201d  Wilson v. Seiter, 501 U.S. \n294, 303 (1991) (Eighth Amendment).  The deliberate-\nindifference standard is equally appropriate for \nassessing failures to accommodate disability-related \nneeds.   \n \nFourth, \nthe \nDistrict\u2019s \ngrab-bag \nof \nnew \nconstitutional \narguments \n(Resp.Br.19-23) \nonly \nunderscores why this Court should not entertain the \nDistrict\u2019s current theory in the first instance.  See \nPa. Dep\u2019t of Corr. v. Yeskey, 524 U.S. 206, 212-13 \n(1998) (refusing to address belatedly raised ADA \n\n24 \n \nconstitutional challenge).  In any event, the courts of \nappeals have consistently rejected Spending Clause \nchallenges to the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Miller \nv. Tex. Tech Univ. Health Scis. Ctr., 421 F.3d 342, \n348-52 & n.19 (5th Cir. 2005) (collecting cases).  And \nthey have upheld the ADA as valid enforcement \nlegislation in the educational context under Section 5 \nof the Fourteenth Amendment.  See, e.g., Toledo v. \nS\u00e1nchez, 454 F.3d 24, 36-40 (1st Cir. 2006); \nConstantine v. Rectors & Visitors of George Mason \nUniv., 411 F.3d 474, 486-90 (4th Cir. 2005).  Those \ndecisions are correct for reasons the United States has \nexplained elsewhere.  See, e.g., U.S.Br.6-35, Danny R. \nv. Spring Branch Indep. Sch. Dist., 124 F. App\u2019x 289 \n(5th Cir. 2005) (No. 02-20816); U.S.Br.9-45, Bowers v. \nNCAA, 475 F.3d 524 (3d Cir. 2007) (No. 05-2426). \n \nFinally, the District ignores the elephant in the \nroom.  Accepting the District\u2019s across-the-board \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment test would cause a \nsea change in disability law\u2014and quite possibly \nanti-discrimination law more generally.  Supra 5-11.  \nOvernight, victims of discrimination would lose \nprotections they have enjoyed for decades.  It is \nshocking that the District does not acknowledge\u2014let \nalone justify\u2014the radical consequences of its new \ntheory.  One way or another, that theory should be \nrejected. \n\n25 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be vacated \nand the case remanded for further proceedings. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nNICHOLAS ROSELLINI \nLATHAM & WATKINS LLP \n505 Montgomery Street \nSuite 2000 \nSan Francisco, CA 94111 \n \nAMY J.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been consolidated and the key points of contention are now sharply in focus. While this observation was an internal synthesis rather than new external evidence, it has clarified the precise nature of my uncertainty and what information is needed next.\n\n1.  **Stable Core Beliefs:** My core understanding remains unchanged from the analysis of the Brief in Opposition (BIO).\n    *   **High Stakes Confirmed:** The presence of elite counsel (Martinez for petitioner, Blatt for respondent) continues to signal the case's high importance, neutralizing the predictive value of counsel for either side.\n    *   **Contested Circuit Split:** The respondent's argument that the 5-2 circuit split is a matter of \"form over substance\" or \"different verbal formulations\" remains the primary challenge to the petitioner's request for certiorari. The distinction between standards for injunctive relief versus damages is a key part of this challenge.\n    *   **Significant \"Vehicle Problems\":** The respondent's arguments that this case is a \"poor vehicle\" are a major obstacle for the petitioner. The two key problems are: (1) the factual record allegedly shows the school made \"persistent efforts,\" meaning the petitioner might lose on the facts regardless of the legal standard, and (2) the petitioner has already received injunctive relief and compensation through a separate FAPE suit, potentially rendering this case moot or less urgent.\n    *   **Robust Defense of the Merits:** The respondent's defense of the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard as a necessary tool to harmonize the IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act, and to provide deference to educators, remains a credible counter-narrative to the petitioner's textualist argument.\n\n2.  **Crystallization of Uncertainty (New Synthesis):** This period of reflection has synthesized the adversarial arguments and pinpointed the exact questions that will determine the cert outcome. My prediction of a decreased likelihood of a cert grant holds, but it is now contingent on how the petitioner addresses two specific challenges in their Reply Brief:\n    *   **Rebutting the \"Illusory Split\":** Can the petitioner demonstrate that the differences between the circuits are substantive and lead to different real-world outcomes, not just semantic variations?\n    *   **Neutralizing the \"Poor Vehicle\" Claims:** How will the petitioner argue that this case is still a vital and appropriate vehicle for review, despite the respondent's claims about the factual record and the relief already granted? The credibility of their response to the mootness/redundancy argument will be particularly critical.\n\n3.  **Next Predictive Inflection Point:** The Petitioner's Reply Brief is now the single most important document for my prediction. It represents the final word to the Justices and is the petitioner's only chance to rebut the powerful arguments raised in the BIO. My confidence in a cert grant will rise or fall significantly based on the strength of this forthcoming document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal synthesis, has been exceptionally valuable for validating and formalizing my investigative methodology. It demonstrates the importance of pausing to integrate information before seeking more.\n\n1.  **Primacy of Foundational Documents (Formalized):** My strategy of analyzing foundational documents is now a formalized, sequential process. The dialectical approach is confirmed as the most effective heuristic for the cert stage.\n    1.  **Thesis:** The Petition for Certiorari.\n    2.  **Antithesis:** The Brief in Opposition.\n    3.  **Synthesis/Rebuttal:** The Petitioner's Reply Brief.\n    This three-step model (Petition -> BIO -> Reply) is now my default strategy for evaluating any petition for certiorari. The next action must be to acquire and analyze the Reply Brief.\n\n2.  **Sophistication of Predictive Signals (Stable):** My more nuanced understanding of key signals remains robust.\n    *   **Circuit Split Analysis 2.0:** Always anticipate and evaluate the respondent's counter-characterization of any alleged split.\n    *   **\"Vehicle Problems\" as a Key Heuristic:** The BIO is the primary source for these problems; the Reply Brief is the source for the rebuttal.\n    *   **Elite Counsel as a Symmetric Signal:** When present on both sides, this signals case importance, not outcome direction.\n\n3.  **New Heuristics for Investigation (Refined):**\n    *   **Trace the Precedent (and its Defense):** This remains a core heuristic for understanding the merits.\n    *   **Compare the \"Questions Presented\":** This delta-analysis heuristic remains a powerful shortcut to the core of the dispute.\n    *   **(New) The Role of Synthesis:** A `THINK` or synthesis step is a crucial part of the experimental design process. It is not passive. Its function is to integrate prior observations, identify the most salient points of uncertainty (in \u03b8), and use that uncertainty to guide the next information-gathering action. This explicitly links the design-level strategy (D) to the task-level goal of reducing uncertainty (\u03b8), which is the essence of optimal experimental design.\n\n4.  **Evolving Strategy (Formalized Dialectical Approach):** My investigative process has matured into a clear, repeatable model.\n    1.  **Thesis:** Analyze the cert petition for its core arguments (split, importance).\n    2.  **Antithesis:** Analyze the BIO for its direct rebuttals (no split, bad vehicle).\n    3.  **Synthesize & Plan:** Integrate the arguments to identify the key points of contention and determine the next most informative document.\n    4.  **Rebuttal:** Analyze the Reply Brief to see how the petitioner addresses the BIO's challenges. This step is now identified as the next logical action."

This makes the Task EIG very high. Concurrently, this action provides a perfect test case for my newly formulated 'Inference from Rebuttal' heuristic.

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The Eighth Circuit further held \nthat petitioner had failed to make that showing on the \nfacts of this case.  The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has undergone a significant and clarifying transformation. I now realize that certiorari has already been granted, and the task is to predict the final ruling on the merits, not the likelihood of a cert grant. The Petitioner's Reply Brief has provided a powerful signal that dramatically increases the probability of a ruling in favor of the petitioner, A.J.T.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** My previous analysis was incorrectly focused on predicting a cert grant. The observation of the \"Reply Brief for Petitioner\" filed \"On Writ of Certiorari\" confirms the Court has already taken the case. This shifts the entire predictive focus to the merits of the legal question. The \"vehicle problems\" and the nature of the circuit split, while crucial for the cert grant, are now background context for the substantive legal arguments.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (New Core Belief):** The most critical piece of new information is the respondent's (Osseo Schools) apparent change in legal strategy.\n    *   **At the Cert Stage (inferred from Reply):** The respondent defended the Eighth Circuit's `Monahan` rule as a correct, context-specific standard for K-12 education claims, creating an *asymmetric* system where students face a higher bar (\"bad faith or gross misjudgment\") than other disability plaintiffs.\n    *   **At the Merits Stage (inferred from Reply):** The respondent has seemingly abandoned that defense. They now argue for a \"radical new\" and *symmetric* rule: that *all* plaintiffs under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act must prove \"bad faith or gross misjudgment.\"\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Off-Ramp\" (New Core Belief):** The petitioner's reply brief masterfully exploits this strategic pivot. Their argument now rests on two powerful pillars:\n    *   **Procedural Forfeiture:** They argue the respondent has *conceded the question presented*. Since the Court granted cert to decide if the asymmetric `Monahan` rule was correct, and the respondent no longer defends that asymmetry, the petitioner claims victory on the original question. They argue the Court should not consider the respondent's new, broader argument because it is procedurally improper (violating Supreme Court Rule 15.2) and barred by doctrines like judicial estoppel.\n    *   **Substantive Weakness:** They provide the Court with a clear \"off-ramp\": rule narrowly on the conceded question and vacate the Eighth Circuit's decision. This allows the Court to correct the error below without having to engage with the respondent's \"revolutionary\" and \"uniformly harmful\" new theory, which the petitioner argues would gut reasonable accommodation law by requiring proof of discriminatory motive, contrary to decades of precedent like *Alexander v. Choate*.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction:** My prediction has shifted strongly in favor of the petitioner. The respondent's abandonment of the legal ground on which they won below is a profound signal of weakness. It suggests they concluded the Eighth Circuit's reasoning was indefensible before the Supreme Court. The petitioner's strategy of boxing them in procedurally while offering the Court an easy, narrow path to reversal is highly likely to be persuasive. A vacatur of the Eighth Circuit's judgment seems much more probable now.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, forcing a critical correction to my model of the litigation process and adding several powerful new heuristics for merits-stage analysis.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Corrected & Expanded):** My previous three-step model was correct in principle but misapplied. I now have a more sophisticated, two-stage dialectical model for Supreme Court prediction:\n    *   **Cert Stage:** Petition (Thesis) \u2192 BIO (Antithesis) \u2192 Cert Reply (Rebuttal). Goal: Predict grant/denial.\n    *   **Merits Stage:** Petitioner's Merits Brief (Thesis) \u2192 Respondent's Merits Brief (Antithesis) \u2192 Petitioner's Merits Reply Brief (Rebuttal). Goal: Predict the final ruling.\n    This observation underscores the absolute necessity of first identifying the correct litigation stage before beginning analysis.\n\n2.  **New Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction:**\n    *   **(New) The \"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic:** A party significantly changing its core legal argument between the cert stage (BIO) and the merits stage is a major red flag. It signals a lack of confidence in the lower court's reasoning and creates a significant vulnerability. The Petitioner's Reply Brief is the primary document for detecting and evaluating the impact of this pivot.\n    *   **(New) The \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** When analyzing merits briefs, actively look for the party that provides the Court with the narrowest, least disruptive path to a favorable ruling. Arguments like \"the respondent has conceded the question presented\" or \"this argument is not properly before the Court\" are powerful off-ramps that allow the Court to resolve a case without making sweeping new law. These are often highly effective.\n    *   **(New) The \"Inference from Rebuttal\" Heuristic:** It is possible and highly effective to reconstruct the core arguments of an unseen brief (the Respondent's Merits Brief) by carefully analyzing the counter-arguments and characterizations in the Reply Brief.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Formalized Merits Approach):** My investigative process for a case where cert has been granted is now much clearer.\n    1.  **Establish the Baseline:** Analyze the cert-stage briefs (Petition and BIO) to understand the question the Court agreed to answer and the arguments that persuaded them to do so.\n    2.  **Trace the Theses:** Analyze the Petitioner's and Respondent's merits briefs to see how those arguments have evolved. Specifically, look for any \"Argument Pivot\" by the respondent.\n    3.  **Analyze the Rebuttal:** The Petitioner's Reply Brief is the critical document for assessing the state of play before oral argument. Look for procedural attacks on any argument pivots and for the presence of a clean \"off-ramp\" being offered to the Court. The strength of this final brief is a high-value predictor of the final outcome."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case's core dynamic is now supported by direct evidence, significantly increasing my confidence in the predicted outcome. The central theory of a strategic \"flip-flop\" by the respondent, previously inferred, is now confirmed by analysis of their cert-stage arguments.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief) My analysis remains correctly focused on predicting the final ruling on the merits, not the cert grant. The case is at the merits stage.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Confirmed & Solidified):** My previous belief, inferred from the Petitioner's Reply Brief, was that the respondent (Osseo Schools) dramatically changed their argument between the cert and merits stages. I have now directly observed the Respondent's **Brief in Opposition (BIO)** to the petition for certiorari, which provides the crucial \"before\" picture of their legal strategy.\n    *   **Cert Stage Argument (Directly Observed):** The BIO confirms the respondent's original defense. They argued that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard is a correct and necessary rule specifically for the \"unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims directly challenging IDEA educational services.\" They presented this as a special, context-specific standard developed over 40 years to balance anti-discrimination law with the deference owed to educators. They explicitly argued *against* a uniform standard, stating this \"conceptual peculiarity\" exists *only* in this context.\n    *   **Merits Stage Argument (Inferred):** This direct observation makes the respondent's alleged pivot\u2014arguing at the merits stage that *all* ADA/Rehab Act plaintiffs must prove \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\"\u2014even more stark and procedurally questionable.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Off-Ramp\" (Strengthened Belief):** The confirmation of the respondent's original argument makes the petitioner's counter-attack even more powerful.\n    *   **Procedural Forfeiture:** The petitioner's claim that the respondent has conceded the question presented (i.e., whether the *asymmetric* `Monahan` rule for education cases is correct) is now on much firmer ground. The respondent's BIO is a clear record of them defending that very rule. By allegedly abandoning it, they have created a powerful procedural opening for the petitioner.\n    *   **Substantive Weakness:** The respondent's pivot strongly suggests they recognized their original, context-specific argument was unlikely to succeed before the Supreme Court. This is a significant signal of weakness. The petitioner's strategy of offering the Court a narrow \"off-ramp\"\u2014vacating the Eighth Circuit's decision based on this procedural concession\u2014appears even more attractive and likely to succeed.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction (Higher Confidence):** My prediction remains strongly in favor of the petitioner, but my confidence has increased. The direct evidence from the BIO solidifies the narrative of a respondent who abandoned the very legal reasoning they used to win below. This makes a vacatur based on procedural grounds, as argued by the petitioner, a highly probable outcome. The respondent appears to be caught between defending an unpopular circuit-specific rule and advancing a radical new theory that the Court is unlikely to adopt.",
          "design_beliefs": "This update cycle has provided powerful validation for my recently developed heuristics and added a crucial layer of procedural discipline to my analytical framework.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Stable & Reinforced):** My two-stage model for Supreme Court prediction remains the core of my methodology. This observation confirms the importance of correctly identifying the litigation stage of any document. The search for a \"merits brief\" returned a \"Brief in Opposition,\" highlighting the danger of misinterpreting a document's role.\n    *   **Cert Stage:** Petition (Thesis) \u2192 BIO (Antithesis) \u2192 Cert Reply (Rebuttal).\n    *   **Merits Stage:** Petitioner's Merits Brief (Thesis) \u2192 Respondent's Merits Brief (Antithesis) \u2192 Petitioner's Merits Reply Brief (Rebuttal).\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Validated & Refined):**\n    *   **The \"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic (Validated):** This heuristic has proven highly effective. A party changing its core argument between the BIO and the merits brief is a major signal of weakness. The BIO I just observed provides the essential \"baseline\" or \"before\" snapshot against which to measure the pivot.\n    *   **The \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Stable):** The value of looking for narrow, procedurally-based paths to victory remains a key analytical lens.\n    *   **The \"Inference from Rebuttal\" Heuristic (Validated):** This observation provided a powerful test and validation of this heuristic. I had previously inferred the contents of the BIO by reading the Petitioner's Reply Brief. My direct observation of the BIO confirmed that my inferences were accurate. This proves that a rebuttal document can be used to reliably reconstruct the arguments of the brief it is responding to.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Refined with a New Principle):** My formalized merits approach is now more robust.\n    1.  **Establish the Baseline:** Analyze the cert-stage briefs (Petition and BIO) to understand the question the Court agreed to answer.\n    2.  **Trace the Theses:** Analyze the merits briefs to detect any \"Argument Pivot.\"\n    3.  **Analyze the Rebuttal:** Use the Petitioner's Reply Brief to assess the state of play and identify any \"Procedural Off-Ramps.\"\n    4.  **(New Principle) Document Verification:** Before any analysis, *always* verify a document's role and litigation stage by examining its title, headers (e.g., \"On Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" vs. \"On Writ of Certiorari\"), and the framing of the \"Question Presented.\" This is a critical, non-negotiable first step to prevent catastrophic misinterpretation."

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

My central theory is strong but rests on a key inference that now requires direct verification.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief) My analysis remains correctly focused on predicting the final ruling on the merits, not the cert grant. The case is at the merits stage.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Theory Clarified):** My confidence in this theory is high, but the latest observation forces me to be more precise about what is confirmed versus what is still inferred.\n    *   **\"Before\" Picture (Confirmed):** I have directly observed the Respondent's **Brief in Opposition (BIO)**. It confirms they argued at the cert stage that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard was a special, context-specific rule applicable *only* to claims challenging IDEA educational services. This baseline is now established fact.\n    *   **\"After\" Picture (Inferred, Pending Verification):** My belief that the respondent pivoted at the merits stage to argue that *all* ADA/Rehab Act plaintiffs must prove \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" is still an *inference*. This inference was drawn from the Petitioner's Reply Brief, which attacks this alleged new argument. The current `THINK` observation makes it clear that confirming this pivot by analyzing the actual **Respondent's Brief on the Merits** is the single most important next step for my analysis.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Off-Ramp\" (Contingent Belief):** My belief in the strength of the petitioner's strategy is unchanged, but I now recognize its contingency. The effectiveness of the \"procedural forfeiture\" argument and the attractiveness of the \"off-ramp\" for the Court depend entirely on the respondent having actually made the argument pivot I infer they did. If the Respondent's Merits Brief does not contain this pivot, my central theory of the case will be invalidated.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Qualified):** My prediction remains a vacatur in favor of the petitioner. My confidence also remains high, but it is now explicitly qualified. It is *contingent upon the verification of the respondent's argument pivot*. The `THINK` observation has not introduced new evidence to change my prediction, but it has highlighted the linchpin assumption upon which it rests. The entire case narrative I have constructed\u2014a respondent abandoning their winning argument below for a new, weaker one before the Supreme Court\u2014needs to be confirmed with the final key document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while containing no new case facts, is a crucial moment of internalizing a lesson learned from a prior mistake. It solidifies a recent refinement to my methodology, moving it from a reactive correction to a proactive principle.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Stable & Reinforced):** My two-stage model of cert-stage and merits-stage briefing remains the essential framework. This observation reinforces its importance by highlighting the analytical chaos that results from confusing a document's stage (e.g., mistaking a BIO for a merits brief).\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Validated & Refined):**\n    *   **The \"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic (Validated):** This remains a powerful heuristic. The current `THINK` action shows I am now using it as a hypothesis-driver, structuring my information-gathering around confirming or disconfirming a suspected pivot.\n    *   **The \"Inference from Rebuttal\" Heuristic (Validated):** This heuristic proved its value by allowing me to accurately reconstruct the BIO's argument from the Petitioner's Cert Reply. However, the current situation also reveals its limitation: while useful for generating a strong hypothesis, an inference from a rebuttal is not a substitute for direct observation of the primary source document, especially when it forms the core of the entire case theory.\n    *   **The \"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Stable):** This remains a key lens for analysis.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Principle Internalized):** My formal methodology is becoming more robust and self-aware. The `THINK` action demonstrates the internalization of the new verification principle.\n    1.  **Establish the Baseline:** Analyze cert-stage briefs (Petition, BIO). (Completed)\n    2.  **Trace the Theses:** Analyze merits briefs to detect any \"Argument Pivot.\" (Partially complete; Respondent's brief is the key missing piece).\n    3.  **Analyze the Rebuttal:** Use the Petitioner's Reply Brief to assess the state of play. (Completed, leading to the current hypothesis).\n    4.  **Document Verification (Internalized Principle):** The previous error of misidentifying the BIO is now fully integrated as a critical lesson. The `THINK` action shows I am now proactively applying this principle by planning a targeted search for the *correct* document, using precise identifiers to distinguish between litigation stages. This is no longer just a rule, but a core part of my analytical process.\n    5.  **(New Insight) Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry:** This observation highlights a higher-level strategy: once analysis generates a high-confidence theory that hinges on a single piece of unconfirmed evidence, the immediate priority must be to design an action that directly targets that linchpin evidence. My next planned action\u2014a precise search for the Respondent's Merits Brief\u2014is a direct implementation of this principle."

          "task_beliefs": "The search for the Respondent's Brief on the Merits has failed, returning only the previously analyzed Brief in Opposition (BIO). This observation provides no new information about the case itself, but it critically underscores the primary point of uncertainty in my analysis. My beliefs about the case's trajectory remain the same, but the foundation for those beliefs is now explicitly marked as unverified.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief) My analysis remains correctly focused on the merits stage. This failed search reinforces the importance of distinguishing between cert-stage and merits-stage documents.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Theory Unverified):** My central theory of the case remains unchanged, but this failed observation highlights that it is still a hypothesis, not a confirmed fact.\n    *   **\"Before\" Picture (Confirmed Fact):** I have repeatedly observed the Respondent's **Brief in Opposition (BIO)**. It is now an established fact that at the cert stage, the respondent argued that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard was a special rule for the unique context of IDEA-related claims. They framed it as a sensible, context-specific standard that did not create a meaningful circuit split. The BIO states, \"For more than forty years, courts of appeals considering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims directly challenging IDEA educational services have widely recognized that plaintiffs must establish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.\"\n    *   **\"After\" Picture (Unverified Inference):** My belief that the respondent pivoted at the merits stage to a much broader argument\u2014that *all* ADA/Rehab Act plaintiffs must prove \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\"\u2014remains an inference drawn from the petitioner's rebuttal. The failure of my targeted search to locate the Respondent's Merits Brief means I cannot yet confirm this crucial pivot. The entire narrative hinges on this missing piece of evidence.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Off-Ramp\" (Contingent Belief):** The perceived strength of the petitioner's \"procedural forfeiture\" argument remains entirely contingent. If the respondent did not, in fact, make the broad argument pivot I suspect, then the petitioner's counter-attack is irrelevant, and the \"off-ramp\" I theorized for the Court does not exist. This failed search leaves this entire line of reasoning in a state of suspension.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Contingent):** My prediction remains a vacatur in favor of the petitioner, with high confidence. However, this confidence is explicitly and critically *contingent upon the verification of the respondent's argument pivot*. This observation's failure to produce the key document has not changed my prediction, but it has magnified the importance of the single assumption upon which it rests. My entire analytical structure is waiting for this linchpin.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful lesson in the execution of information-gathering strategies. While my high-level analytical framework proved robust, the tactical implementation of my search failed, providing a crucial opportunity to refine my methodology for acquiring specific legal documents.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Stable & Reinforced):** The two-stage (cert vs. merits) model remains the cornerstone of my analysis. This observation, a failed attempt to get a merits brief that instead returned a cert brief, is a perfect illustration of why this distinction is non-negotiable.\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Validated & Refined):**\n    *   **The \"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic (Validated):** This heuristic remains the central driver of my analysis, correctly focusing my attention on the most likely source of leverage for the petitioner.\n    *   **The \"Inference from Rebuttal\" Heuristic (Refined):** This heuristic successfully generated a powerful and plausible hypothesis about the respondent's strategy.

(Completed, hypothesis generated).\n    4.  **Document Verification (Principle Validated):** This principle was a success. I immediately recognized the returned document as the BIO and correctly identified it as the *wrong document*. This prevented me from repeating my earlier error of misinterpreting a cert-stage brief. The principle has been successfully integrated.\n    5.  **Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry (Principle Validated):** The high-level strategy of identifying the linchpin evidence (the Respondent's Merits Brief) and designing an action to acquire it was correct. The failure was not in the strategy, but in the tactics.\n    6.  **(New Principle) Refinement of Search Tactics:** The `CLOSED_SEARCH` action failed. The query `{'query': 'respondent brief on the merits', 'field_filters': {'proceeding_title': 'brief of respondent'}}` was not specific enough to distinguish a merits brief from a BIO. This reveals a limitation in either the tool's metadata or my query design. **A new, more robust search principle is needed:** When searching for stage-specific documents, relying on titles alone is insufficient. A better tactic is to use **chronological filtering**. I should first establish the date certiorari was granted and then design searches for documents filed *after* that date. This adds a timeline-aware dimension to my search strategy, making it less susceptible to ambiguous document titles."

This is a stable, known fact.\n    *   **\"After\" Picture (Unverified Inference):** The crucial inference that the respondent broadened this argument in their merits brief remains a hypothesis.\n    *   **Key Missing Evidence (Unchanged):** I still lack the two most critical documents for advancing my analysis: the Supreme Court's order granting certiorari (which would anchor the timeline) and the Respondent's Brief on the Merits (which would confirm or deny the argument pivot).\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Off-Ramp\" (Contingent Belief):** The entire line of reasoning concerning the petitioner's \"procedural forfeiture\" argument remains on hold. This argument is only relevant *if* the respondent changed their position. Without confirmation of that pivot, the \"off-ramp\" it might offer the Court is a purely theoretical construct.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Stagnant):** My prediction of a vacatur in favor of the petitioner remains unchanged, as does my high confidence *in that prediction's contingency*.

Instead of trying a \"precision strike\" with a specific query string *and* a filter, a more robust method is to use a broad filter to retrieve a small, manageable set of candidate documents, and then inspect them.\n            *   **Next Action Hypothesis:** A search using *only* the filter `proceeding_title: 'Order List'` (or a similar document type filter) should return *all* such documents in the docket.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being a record of my own internal reasoning, adds no new substantive information about the case itself. My understanding of the legal facts and arguments remains static. However, it marks a crucial shift in my *process* for acquiring the necessary information, moving from a state of being blocked to having a clear, tactical plan to overcome the obstacle.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief) The Supreme Court's decision to grant certiorari remains the central fact driving my analysis. It signals the Court's intent to scrutinize the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard applied by the lower courts. My immediate task remains unchanged: to locate the official order granting cert.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Theory Unverified & Logjam Persists):** My core hypothesis\u2014that Osseo Area Schools abandoned the \"bad faith\" standard after cert was granted\u2014is still the unconfirmed linchpin of my entire prediction. This observation confirms my diagnosis of the previous failures and solidifies my plan to resolve this uncertainty.\n    *   **\"Before\" Picture (Confirmed Fact):** The respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO) defended the \"bad faith\" standard. This is a stable data point.\n    *   **\"After\" Picture (Unverified Inference):** The theory of an argument pivot, inferred from the petitioner's reply, remains unsubstantiated.\n    *   **Key Missing Evidence (Path Forward Clarified):** I still lack the Respondent's Brief on the Merits and, most critically, the cert grant order. The previous two observations showed my attempts to find this order were based on a faulty premise. This observation represents the formulation of a specific, targeted plan to correct that premise and successfully retrieve the document. The analytical logjam is still in place, but I am now actively building the tool to break it.\n\n3.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Off-Ramp\" (Contingent Belief):** The petitioner's \"procedural forfeiture\" argument remains a powerful but dormant weapon. Its relevance is wholly contingent on confirming the respondent's argument pivot, the verification of which is the goal of my current procedural focus.\n\n4.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Stable, Process Confidence Restored):** My prediction of a vacatur in favor of the petitioner remains unchanged, as does its high dependency on verifying the argument pivot. While the previous observation decreased my confidence in my methodology, this one restores it by replacing a failed tactic with a more robust, systematic approach. My confidence in the eventual outcome hasn't changed, but my confidence in my ability to navigate the immediate information-gathering challenge has significantly increased.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a powerful reinforcement of my evolving methodology. It represents the formal adoption and execution of a strategy developed in response to a prior failure, demonstrating a maturing, self-correcting research process.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Stable & Reinforced):** The two-stage (cert vs. merits) analytical framework remains the correct model. My current focus on finding the cert grant order\u2014the precise dividing line between these two stages\u2014continues to validate the importance of this model.\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Value Stable):**\n    *   **\"Argument Pivot\" & \"Inference from Rebuttal\" Heuristics (Stable):** These remain excellent for generating high-value hypotheses. This observation underscores that hypothesis generation is only the first step, and robust verification methods are equally critical.\n    *   **\"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Stable):** Remains a key analytical tool, waiting to be activated by new evidence.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Principle Operationalized):** My methodology for document retrieval has now formally incorporated the lessons from my recent failure. This observation is the first concrete application of the refined process.\n    1.  **Establish the Baseline:** Analyze cert-stage briefs. (Completed)\n    2.  **Trace the Theses:** Analyze merits briefs to detect pivots. (Blocked)\n    3.  **Analyze the Rebuttal:** Use the Reply Brief to generate hypotheses. (Completed)\n    4.  **Document Verification (Principle Validated):** The need to verify document chronology remains paramount.\n    5.  **Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry (Principle Validated & Executed):** The cycle of \"hypothesize -> test -> analyze result -> refine test\" is working perfectly. The previous search was a failed test of the hypothesis \"the filter is `proceeding_title: 'Order List'`.\" This THINK action is the \"analyze result\" and \"refine test\" phase, where I explicitly diagnose the failure and plan the next, more informed experiment.\n    6.  **Refinement of Search Tactics (New Tactic Canonized):** The \"Schema Probe -> Broaden -> Refine\" tactic, developed in the last update, is now being actively deployed. This observation marks its transition from a theoretical solution to a practical, operational step.\n        *   **Schema Probe (In Progress):** I have formally recognized that before using a database filter, I must first probe the database's schema to understand its structure. This THINK action articulates the plan to conduct this probe by searching for the docket number without filters to inspect the resulting metadata. This is a crucial evolution, making my strategy more resilient and adaptable to unfamiliar information environments. It is a shift from assuming a system works a certain way to actively investigating how it works. This metacognitive step of planning the probe is a valuable design element in itself."

A successful search would provide the highest possible task-relevant information, immediately breaking the analytical logjam. Even if the search fails, it provides strong evidence that this document is not in the 'docket_files' database, which is crucial for redirecting my strategy and preventing wasted effort, thus providing significant indirect task value.\n\nDesign EIG (0.9): This action is a critical test of my evolving database schema model. My last observation led me to hypothesize that 'docket_files' is for ancillary documents, not primary briefs. This highly specific, filtered search is the definitive test of that hypothesis. Success would teach me that precise filters are necessary for finding briefs in this search type. Failure would confirm my hypothesis with high certainty. Either outcome provides a fundamental, high-value insight into the environment's structure, which will govern all future search strategies.\n\nJoint EIG (1.8): The action is exceptionally valuable because it simultaneously probes my most important task-level hypothesis and my most important design-level hypothesis about the environment's structure.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky sch\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The question presented is: \n \nWhether the court of appeals erred in concluding \nthat respondents were entitled to summary judgment on \npetitioner\u2019s discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act because petitioner failed to establish a \ngenuine dispute about whether respondents had \ndiscriminatory intent. \n \n \n\nII \n \n \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \n \nINTRODUCTION ......................................................................... 1 \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED ............................... 4 \nSTATEMENT ................................................................................ 5 \n Legal Background ............................................................. 5 \n Factual Background .......................................................... 8 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION ..................... 13 \nI.

The Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation \nAct \n(IDEA) \nguarantees \nappropriate \neducational services to students with physical or mental \ndisabilities.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act protect \nstudents from disability discrimination.  As applied to the \nprovision of IDEA services, the overlap between these \nstatutes leads to a \u201cconceptual peculiarity\u201d that exists \nonly in this context.  Timms v. Metro. Sch. Dist., 722 F.2d \n\n2 \n \n \n1310, 1318 (7th Cir. 1983).  Specifically, it is possible for a \nstudent with a disability to bring a claim under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act alleging that a school has \ndiscriminated against her by not developing and \nimplementing an appropriate special education program \nunder the IDEA\u2014a program that she is only entitled to \nbecause of the IDEA.       \nFor more than forty years, courts of appeals \nconsidering this unique subset of ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims directly challenging IDEA educational \nservices have widely recognized that plaintiffs must \nestablish more than a bare violation of the IDEA.  \nInstead, those courts have appropriately developed a \n\u201csensible remedial scheme that best comports with\u201d the \nimplied causes of action in the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  See Gebser v. Largo Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. \n274, 284 (1998).  That scheme requires plaintiffs to show \nthat school professionals acted with discriminatory intent \nby demonstrating that their decisions were premised on \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d   \nThis Court should decline petitioner\u2019s request to \noverturn these longstanding precedents.  To start, \npetitioner fails to show any meaningful disagreement in \nthe circuits over the appropriate discriminatory intent \nstandard.  As to damages claims, petitioner elevates form \nover substance.  While the circuits sometimes use \ndifferent verbal formulations to describe the intent \nstandard, they agree an intent standard exists; that it is \nhigh; and that it requires a deviation from accepted \nprofessional practices.  As to injunctive relief claims, \nthere is no disagreement at all.  No opinion of any court of \nappeals embraces petitioner\u2019s view that plaintiffs alleging \nthe kind of discrimination claim at issue here\u2014i.e., an \neducational-services discrimination claim based on \n\n3 \n \n \ndisagreement with an IEP\u2014can succeed without proving \ndiscriminatory intent.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary argument \nrelies on cases involving entirely different kinds of \ndiscrimination claims and out-of-context snippets of dicta.  \nMoreover, petitioner fails to show that courts\u2019 \ndifferences in wording routinely lead them to reach \ndifferent results under these two statutes.  Certainly that \nwas not the case here.  As both courts below found, the \nDistrict did not ignore petitioner\u2019s needs.  To the \ncontrary, the evidence demonstrates that the District \nreasonably responded to the disagreement over the \nlength of petitioner\u2019s school day by making persistent \nefforts through the IDEA process, all while petitioner was \nmaking progress.  Although petitioner\u2019s parents disagree \nwith \nsome \ndecisions \nthe \nDistrict \nmade, \nthose \ndisagreements do not evince discriminatory intent under \nany standard used in any circuit.  In any event, through a \nseparate suit petitioner has already received injunctive \nrelief and compensation for her FAPE denial.  A decision \nin her favor would make little difference, and this case is \naccordingly a very poor vehicle for addressing the \nquestion presented. \nFinally, the decision below does not warrant review \nbecause it is correct.  This Court has repeatedly cautioned \ncourts against \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  \nEndrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. \nRE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017).  In this unique context, \ncourts must balance the Rehabilitation Act and ADA\u2019s \nprohibition on disability discrimination with educators\u2019 \nresponsibility for determining appropriate special \neducation services, which is \u201coften necessarily an \narguable matter.\u201d  See Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d \n1164, 1170-71 (8th Cir. 1982), cert. denied, 460 U.S. 1012 \n(1983).  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \n\n4 \n \n \nproperly accounts for the need for \u201cdeference\u201d \u201cbased on \nthe application of expertise and the exercise of judgment \nby school authorities,\u201d id., while still reining in abuses by \neducators \nwho \nviolate \nprofessional \nstandards, \ndeliberately \ntarget \nstudents \nwith \ndisabilities, \nor \ncompletely ignore their needs.  This is not such a case, and \nthe court of appeals rightly affirmed judgment in favor of \nthe District.      \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe IDEA, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l), provides: \nNothing in this chapter shall be construed to restrict \nor limit the rights, procedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the Americans with Disabilities \nAct of 1990 [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12101 et seq.], title V of the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973 [29 U.S.C. \u00a7 790 et seq.], or \nother Federal laws protecting the rights of children with \ndisabilities, except that before the filing of a civil action \nunder such laws seeking relief that is also available under \nthis subchapter, the procedures under subsections (f) and \n(g) shall be exhausted to the same extent as would be \nrequired had the action been brought under this \nsubchapter. \nThe Rehabilitation Act, 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794, provides in \nrelevant part: \nNo otherwise qualified individual with a disability in \nthe United States, as defined in section 705(20) of this \ntitle, shall, solely by reason of her or his disability, be \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination under any program \nor activity receiving Federal financial assistance or under \nany program or activity conducted by any Executive \nagency or by the United States Postal Service.  \nThe ADA, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132, provides: \n\n5 \n \n \nSubject to the provisions of this subchapter, no \nqualified individual with a disability shall, by reason of \nsuch disability, be excluded from participation in or be \ndenied the benefits of the services, programs, or activities \nof a public entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity. \nSTATEMENT \n \nLegal Background \n1.  Originally titled the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act, the IDEA requires public \nschools to provide students with disabilities a \u201cfree \nappropriate public education\u201d (FAPE).  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  That education must be tailored to meet \nthe student\u2019s \u201cunique needs,\u201d rather than conform to what \nis provided to the broader student body.  Id.  Accordingly, \nthe IDEA requires that educators, parents, and the \nstudent collaborate annually to develop an \u201cindividualized \neducation program\u201d (IEP), which the school must then \nimplement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  Each IEP has different goals, \nservices, and modifications to the student\u2019s education, \nbecause an appropriate education \u201cturns on the unique \ncircumstances of the child for whom it was created.\u201d  \nEndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404. \nRecognizing that the prompt resolution of educational \nconcerns is critical for positive outcomes, Congress set \nforth \n\u201celaborate \nand \nhighly \nspecific \nprocedural \nsafeguards\u201d that must be followed when a student (or her \nparents) alleges that a public school is failing to provide a \nFAPE.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. \nv. Rowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nThese procedural safeguards provide multiple avenues \nfor the timely resolution of IDEA claims.   \nA complaint from a student or her parents usually \ntriggers a \u201c[p]reliminary meeting,\u201d where the parties can \n\n6 \n \n \ndiscuss the student\u2019s needs and come to consensus about \nthe contents of an appropriate IEP.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(f)(1)(B)(i).  Alternatively, the parties can choose \nformal mediation.  Id. \u00a7 1415(e).  If the school has not \nresolved the complaint within 30 days, the matter \nproceeds to a \u201cdue process hearing\u201d before an impartial \nhearing officer.  Id. \u00a7 1415(f).  At the conclusion of the \nhearing, the hearing officer may order injunctive relief, \nsuch as the implementation of a new IEP, and equitable \nrelief, such as monetary compensation for past \neducational expenses or \u201ccompensatory education\u201d funds \nfor future educational expenses.  See Strawn ex rel. Karl \nC. v. Mo. State Bd. of Educ., 210 F.3d 954, 957 (8th Cir. \n2000).   \nOnly after the hearing can an aggrieved party \nchallenge the hearing officer\u2019s order in federal court, \nwhere the reviewing court \u201cshall grant such relief as the \ncourt \ndetermines \nis \nappropriate.\u201d \n \n20 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii); \nsee \nalso \nid. \nat \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(b) \n(attorney\u2019s fees); Sch. Comm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of \nEduc. of Mass., 471 U.S. 359, 369-70 (1985) (compensation \nfor educational expenditures).  During the pendency of \nthe administrative hearing or federal judicial review, the \nstudent\u2019s current IEP remains in effect unless the school \nand parents agree otherwise.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j). \n2.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act offer broad \nantidiscrimination protections for both children and \nadults with disabilities.  The Rehabilitation Act forbids \nany federally funded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d from \n\u201cdiscriminat[ing]\u201d based \u201csolely\u201d on disability; the ADA \napplies the same prohibition to any \u201cpublic entity.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12131-12132.  Courts agree \nthat claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act \ngenerally \u201clive and die together, as \u2018the enforcement, \nremedies, and rights are the same under both.\u2019\u201d  \n\n7 \n \n \nPet.App.2a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12133); see also, e.g., \nMcDonald v. Pa. Dep\u2019t of Pub. Welfare, 62 F.3d 92, 95 (3d \nCir. 1995); Myers v. Hose, 50 F.3d 278, 281 (4th Cir. 1995). \nIn the employment and post-secondary education \ncontexts, both statutes require covered entities to make \nreasonable accommodations to prevent discrimination, \nsuch as by adjusting an employee\u2019s work schedule or \nallowing for service animals.  See 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) \n(ADA); Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 300-01 (1985) \n(Rehabilitation Act); see also Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., \n580 U.S. 154, 170 (2017).  In elementary and secondary-\nschool contexts, however, the Rehabilitation Act requires \nschool districts to provide students with a disability a \nFAPE.  34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33.  While this obligation is \ncommonly (and incorrectly) referred to as providing \n\u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d it is, in fact, a different \nstandard.  One way that a school district can satisfy its \nFAPE obligation under the Rehabilitation Act is to \ncomply with the IDEA\u2019s IEP requirements.  Id. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nUnlike the IDEA, the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct do not set forth prerequisites to judicial review; \nplaintiffs suing under these latter statutes (outside of the \neducational context) generally go straight to court.  And \nwhen they do, they can seek two types of relief: \n\u201ccompensatory damages\u201d and an \u201cinjunction.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 186-87 (2002). \nThe educational context gives rise to a subset of ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act discrimination complaints that \nsubstantially overlaps with\u2014and is often \u201cvirtually \nidentical\u201d to\u2014IDEA complaints.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160 \n(citation omitted).  In these complaints, students with \ndisabilities allege that their school discriminated against \nthem because of the \u201cdenial of an appropriate public \neducation (much as an IDEA claim would).\u201d  Id. at 161. \n\n8 \n \n \nIn \nthese \ncases, \nthe \nstudents \ncan \nreceive \ncompensatory damages and, theoretically, injunctive \nrelief.  Compensatory damages are not covered by the \nIDEA, so a student bringing such a claim need not \nexhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  See Perez \nv. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 151 (2023).  But \nbecause injunctive relief would require the school district \nto develop and implement an alternative IEP, the student \nmust first exhaust the IDEA\u2019s administrative procedures.  \nSee 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  As this Court has explained, this \nIDEA-prescribed process is necessary to avoid courts \n\u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of sound educational \npolicy for those of the school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 \nU.S. at 404. \n Factual Background \n1.  Petitioner A.J.T. (\u201cAva\u201d) has a rare form of \nepilepsy that causes daily seizures and impairs her \ncognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava \ncommunicates inconsistently using limited signs and \ncannot independently walk, feed herself, or use the \nbathroom.  Id.; Pet.App.52a.  As such, she qualifies for, \nand undisputedly requires, individualized educational \nservices under the IDEA.  \nAva became an Osseo Area School District student as \na fourth grader in 2015, when her family moved to \nMinnesota from Kentucky.  Pet.App.50a.  In accordance \nwith the IDEA\u2019s procedural requirements, before Ava \nstarted at Cedar Island Elementary School, the District \nheld multiple IEP team meetings with her parents to \ndiscuss Ava\u2019s academic services, consider input from her \nmedical providers, and address potential revisions to her \neducation program.  Pet.App.9a-10a.     \nAs part of the IEP process, the District considered \nand adopted many of the accommodations that Ava had \n\n9 \n \n \nreceived at her previous school in Kentucky.  Id.  There, \nAva\u2019s school had provided for a noon start time.  Id.  The \nDistrict adopted that accommodation, which was \nproposed by Ava\u2019s parents and her treating neurologist.  \nId.; Pet.App.12a.  The District\u2019s initial IEP also offered \n240 daily minutes of direct special-education instruction, \nwhich exceeded the 215 daily minutes provided by Ava\u2019s \nKentucky IEP.  Pet.App.10a.  At all times at her \nKentucky school, where the typical school day lasted 7 \nhours, Ava received at most 5.75 hours of total \ninstructional time.  Resp. C.A. Br. at 7-8; see also Pet. C.A. \nApp. 302-03.  \nAva\u2019s daily schedule at Cedar Island initially ran from \nnoon to 4:00 p.m.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Although Ava had \nnever received a \u201cregular\u201d-length school day in Kentucky, \nAva\u2019s parents requested an extended school day.  See \nPet.App.8a-10a.  Because of Ava\u2019s demonstrated progress \nwhile attending Cedar Island, the District denied this \nrequest.  Pet. C.A. App. 332.  A few months later, however, \nin March 2016, the District offered to adjust Ava\u2019s school \nday to end at 4:15 p.m.\u2014beyond the end of the regular \nschool day\u2014to provide her extra time to safely navigate \nthe halls at school dismissal.  Pet.App.50a n.2.  Ava\u2019s \nparents accepted that proposal, which extended Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time to 4.25 hours.  Pet.App.10a.  The \nDistrict proposed a new IEP with equivalent hours in the \nspring of 2017, and Ava\u2019s parents gave implied consent.  \nSee id.; Resp. C.A. App. 144-45; Pet. C.A. App. 242-43. \n2.  In 2018, the District began preparing for Ava\u2019s \ntransition to Maple Grove Middle School, where the \nschool day ended at 2:40 p.m.  After reviewing Ava\u2019s \ncurrent seizure plan and medical needs, the District \nproposed a revised schedule that would have ended Ava\u2019s \nschool day at 3:00 p.m.  Pet.App.10a-11a; Pet. C.A. App. \n335-37.  This time, Ava\u2019s parents objected to the proposal \n\n10 \n \n \nand instead requested \u201c[h]ours of instruction similar to \nthose currently provided\u201d at Ava\u2019s elementary school.  \nPet. C.A. App. 341.  The District also offered Ava \nadditional extended-school-year services during the \nsummer, which Ava\u2019s parents likewise rejected.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Because Ava\u2019s parents refused to approve the \nDistrict\u2019s proposal, Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in effect \npursuant \nto \nthe \nIDEA\u2019s \n\u201cstay-put\u201d \nprovision.  \nPet.App.10a; see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j) (providing that \n\u201cduring the pendency of any proceedings\u201d under the \nIDEA, \u201cthe child shall remain in the then-current \neducational placement\u201d).  As a result, Ava continued \nreceiving 4.25 hours of daily instruction, which included \nspecialized educational services during the regular school \nday \nand \ndirect \none-to-one \neducational \nand \nparaprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to 4:15 p.m. each \nday.  Pet.App.4a; Pet. C.A. App. 94-95, 258.   \nPursuant to the IDEA, the District repeatedly \noffered to engage in mediation, conciliation, and \nfacilitated IEP meetings to resolve the disagreement, but \nAva\u2019s parents rejected those offers.  Pet. C.A. App. 97, \n182-83, 338.  Through her parents, Ava subsequently \nbrought an administrative IDEA claim challenging her \nIEP\u2019s adequacy.  Pet.App.7a.  She alleged that by \nproviding her with 4.25 hours of dedicated educational \ninstruction instead of the 6.5 hours of school time \ngenerally available to other students, the District had \ndeprived her of a FAPE.  See Pet.10-11.   \nThe ALJ ordered the District to increase Ava\u2019s daily \ninstructional hours from 4.25 to 5.75\u2014the same hours she \nhad received in Kentucky\u2014and also ordered 495 hours of \ncompensatory education instruction.  Pet.10; Pet. C.A. \nApp. 344, 366-69.  The District appealed that order, but \nthe United States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota affirmed.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 2022 WL \n\n11 \n \n \n4226097, at *21 (D. Minn. Sept. 13, 2022).  The District \nappealed again, but the Eighth Circuit also affirmed the \nALJ\u2019s order.  Osseo Area Schs. v. A.J.T., 96 F.4th 1062, \n1064 (8th Cir. 2024).  As a result, there is an ongoing \ninjunction requiring the District to \u201c[e]xtend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby meeting the \nstandard for \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21. \n3.  Ava separately brought a parallel claim for \ndisability discrimination under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act based on the same factual assertions.  \nPet.10.  She alleged that \u201c[t]he District\u2019s violations of the \nIDEA also violated [her] rights under\u201d the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act, and sought injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 106, 121, A.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., \n2023 WL 2316893 (D. Minn. Feb. 1, 2023).  Specifically, \nshe sought an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and \nto require the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures \nand standards required by federal special education and \nanti-discrimination laws.\u201d  Id. at 24-25.  Her complaint \nsuggested that, without an injunction, the IEP she \n\u201cobtained from the IDEA administrative hearing [was] \ninsufficient to permanently secure [her] rights to a full \nschool day equal to her peers,\u201d id. \u00b6\u00b6 109, 124 (emphasis \nadded), because the \u201cIDEA permit[s] school officials to \nrevise IEPs \u2018periodically,\u2019\u201d Pet.10 (quoting 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1414(d)(4)).  Ava additionally sought damages to \nreimburse her for the money she spent on disability \n\u201cevaluations,\u201d \u201cspecial education,\u201d and \u201crelated services,\u201d \nremedies also available under the IDEA.  Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 117-\n19, 132-34; see Sch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371. \nThe district court rejected Ava\u2019s discrimination \nclaims, finding that she had failed to show that the District \n\n12 \n \n \nhad acted with \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  \nPet.App.30a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1170-71.   \nThe district court explained that Ava provided no \nevidence supporting her assertion that the District \n\u201cexpressed ignorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  \nPet.App.26a; see Pet.App.27a (\u201cThe Court is unable to \nfind support for these claims in the voluminous documents \nPlaintiffs cite.\u201d); Pet.App.28a (\u201cThere is no citation to this \ncomplaint.\u201d); Pet.App.29a (\u201cPlaintiffs cite no other \nevidence relating to other officials.\u201d); Pet.App.33a (\u201cToo \nmany of Plaintiffs\u2019 arguments are unsupported.\u201d). \nThe district court further concluded that the District \nhad \u201cfollowed acceptable professional judgement and \nstandards,\u201d Pet.App.31a, and that any \u201c[f]ailure to \nprovide extended schooling at home was at most \nnegligent,\u201d Pet.App.35a.  Indeed, the court explained, the \nDistrict \n\u201cconven[ed] \nmultiple \nIEP \nmeetings,\u201d \n\u201clengthened AJT\u2019s school day\u201d in \u201cresponse to concerns \nfrom [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cmodified [Ava]\u2019s IEP in response \nto\u201d Ava\u2019s doctor\u2019s educational evaluation, and \u201cinsur[ed] \nthat [Ava] always has at least one and often two aids with \nher at school.\u201d  Pet.App.31a-32a, 35a.  In other words, \nwhile the district court agreed that petitioner\u2019s IEP was \nnot sufficient under the IDEA, it concluded that the \nDistrict\u2019s attempts to meet that standard did not evince \nany discriminatory animus under the ADA or the \nRehabilitation Act. \n4.  The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  The court agreed \nwith the district court that Ava had failed to demonstrate \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  It also \nagreed that \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s needs or \ndelay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  In \nparticular, the court explained, District officials \u201cmet with \n[Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \u201cupdated\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP each year, \nprovided Ava with \u201cintensive one-on-one instruction and \n\n13 \n \n \na 15-minute extension of her school day so that she could \nsafely leave after the halls cleared,\u201d and offered Ava \u201c16 \nthree-hour sessions at home each summer.\u201d  Id. \n5.  The Eighth Circuit denied rehearing en banc.  \nA.J.T. v. Osseo Area Schs., 2024 WL 2845774, at *1 (8th \nCir. June 5, 2024).   \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe Court should deny the petition for multiple \nreasons. \nTo start, there is no circuit conflict worthy of the \nCourt\u2019s review.  With respect to claims for damages, only \nthe Third and Fifth Circuits have suggested a standard \nother than \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  But all \ncircuits to consider the question agree that an intent \nstandard exists for damages claims, and they all agree \nthat standard is a demanding one.  Whether the standard \nis phrased as requiring \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d or \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d has little practical effect.  \nAnd while petitioner suggests that she would prevail \nunder a \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard, the record \nhere demonstrably proves otherwise. \nPetitioner\u2019s claim of a circuit split with respect to \nclaims for injunctive relief is even weaker.  No court of \nappeals decision has addressed the discriminatory intent \nstandard to obtain injunctive relief.  That is not \nsurprising.  Injunctive relief in this context requires \nIDEA exhaustion, see supra p.8, sparing courts the need \nto address the standard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases.  \nEven if there were a substantial circuit split, this case \nwould be a poor vehicle to address it.  Petitioner\u2019s claims \nfor damages and for injunctive relief would both fail under \nany conceivable standard.  The District repeatedly sought \n\n14 \n \n \nto meet petitioner\u2019s needs.  That petitioner\u2019s parents \ndisagree with the decisions the District made may be the \nbasis for a claim under the IDEA\u2014a claim petitioner \nbrought and won\u2014but it is not the basis for a claim of \ndiscrimination under the Rehabilitation Act or the ADA.  \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applied \nbelow \ncorrectly \nimplements \nthis \ncommon-sense \nconclusion, and thereby avoids the need for judges to play \nthe role of school administrator.    \nI. This Case Does Not Implicate Any Meaningful Circuit \nSplit. \nPetitioner (at 14) asserts that the circuits have split \nover the standard for imposing liability under the ADA \nand the Rehabilitation Act for educational-services \nclaims.  She (at 17) characterizes the split as courts \ndisagreeing in two ways: the \u201cintent required for \ninjunctive relief,\u201d and that for \u201cdamages.\u201d  But there is \nlittle daylight between the circuits\u2019 standards for \ndamages.  And no circuits have ruled on the standard for \nclaims seeking injunctive relief in this context, so there is \nno circuit split at all.   \n \nThere Is No Meaningful Circuit Split Over the \nStandard for ADA and Rehabilitation Act Damages \nClaims in Education Settings.  \nAs petitioner (at 7) acknowledges, \u201cevery circuit \nrequires \u2018a showing of intent\u2019\u201d for ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct damages claims in educational settings.  And despite \npetitioner\u2019s assertions (at 7-8, 17-18) to the contrary, \nthere is no material distinction between the circuits\u2019 \nformulations of that intent requirement. \n1.  The Third and Ninth Circuits apply a \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d standard to damages claims.  See Pet.17.  \nPlaintiffs in these circuits can recover only if the \ndefendant \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d after the plaintiff \u201calerted\u201d the \n\n15 \n \n \ndefendant to their \u201cneed for accommodation,\u201d or where \n\u201cthe need for accommodation was obvious, or required by \nstatute or regulation.\u201d  A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified \nSch. Dist. No. 69, 815 F.3d 1195, 1207 (9th Cir. 2016) \n(citation omitted); see also S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower \nMerion Sch. Dist., 729 F.3d 248, 263-65 (3d Cir. 2013).   \nThe Second, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits \napply a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard.  See \nPet.15.  Under that standard, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages only if the defendant acted in \u201cbad faith\u201d or \n\u201csubstantially departed\u201d from \u201caccepted professional \njudgment, practice or standards.\u201d  B.M. ex rel. Miller v. \nS. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, 887-88 (8th Cir. \n2013). \nWhile this language is different, the substance is not.  \nIndeed, \ncourts \nrecognize \nthat \nan \neducational \nprofessional\u2019s failure to act upon being alerted of a child\u2019s \nneed is a substantial deviation from accepted professional \njudgment and practice.  For example, in M.P. ex rel. K. v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 721, 326 F.3d 975 (8th Cir. 2003), the \nEighth Circuit held that a district court could find the \nschool district \u201cacted in bad faith or with gross \nmisjudgment on the basis of its failure to return [the \nstudent]\u2019s mother\u2019s repeated phone calls\u201d regarding her \nson\u2019s safety and \u201crequired modifications to his \naccommodation plan.\u201d  Id. at 982; see also D.L. v. District \nof Columbia, 730 F. Supp. 2d 84, 100 (D.D.C. 2010) \n(holding that defendants acted with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment where they \u201cknew that their actions were \nlegally insufficient, yet failed to bring themselves into \ncompliance\u201d).  \nThat overlap is consistent with the rule in other \ncontexts involving state-provided services, where \u201cto be \nheld liable under the deliberate indifference standard, \n[the provider] must make a decision that is such a \n\n16 \n \n \nsubstantial \ndeparture \nfrom \naccepted \nprofessional \njudgment, practice, or standards\u201d that the decision must \nhave been based on something else.  60 Am. Jur. 2d Penal \n& Corr. Insts. \u00a7 89 (2024); accord Pearson v. Prison \nHealth Serv., 850 F.3d 526, 539 (3d Cir. 2017) (citing \nYoungberg v. Romeo, 457 U.S. 307, 323 (1982)); see also \nBd. of Cnty. Comm\u2019rs of Bryan Cnty. v. Brown, 520 U.S. \n397, 410 (1997) (finding that deliberate indifference \nrequires \u201cproof that a municipal actor disregarded a \nknown or obvious consequence of his action\u201d). \nPetitioner insists (at 2, 3, 13, 15, 16, 22, 24, 27, 30) that \nthe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \n\u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d is also \na \u201cstringent standard of fault,\u201d Bryan Cnty., 520 U.S. at \n410, that imposes a \u201chigh bar\u201d for plaintiffs to clear, \nCsutoras v. Paradise High Sch., 12 F.4th 960, 966, 969 \n(9th Cir. 2021).  Courts thus routinely dismiss deliberate \nindifference claims where the facts alleged are \u201cnot \negregious enough\u201d to warrant relief.  D.E. v. Cent. \nDauphin Sch. Dist., 765 F.3d 260, 271 n.10 (3d Cir. 2014).  \nIn that respect, \u201c[d]eliberate indifference is similar to \nthe bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u201d  Alex G. ex \nrel. Dr. Steven G. v. Bd. of Tr. of Davis Joint Unified Sch. \nDist., 387 F. Supp. 2d 1119, 1124 (E.D. Cal. 2005).  Even \ncourts that petitioner claims acknowledge a circuit split \nhave difficulty parsing the difference, if any, between the \nstandards.  See, e.g., Myslow v. New Milford Sch. Dist., \n2006 WL 473735, at *9 (D. Conn. Feb. 28, 2006) (assuming \nthat \u201cthe standards are identical\u201d); J.L. ex rel. J.P. v. \nN.Y.C. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 324 F. Supp. 3d 455, 468 (S.D.N.Y. \n2018) (\u201cequat[ing] gross misjudgment with deliberate or \nreckless indifference\u201d).  These courts again and again find \nthat plaintiffs failed to meet either standard, or met both \nstandards.  See, e.g., A.S. v. Mamaroneck Union Free Sch. \nDist., 2024 WL 308211, at *9 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 26, 2024); \n\n17 \n \n \nE.M. ex rel. Guerra v. San Benito Consol. Indep. Sch. \nDist., 374 F. Supp. 3d 616, 625-26 (S.D. Tex. 2019); Est. of \nA.R. v. Muzyka, 543 F. App\u2019x 363, 365 (5th Cir. 2013); A. \nv. Hartford Bd. of Educ., 976 F. Supp. 2d 164, 194 (D. \nConn. 2013); Schreiber v. E. Ramapo Cent. Sch. Dist., 700 \nF. Supp. 2d 529, 564 (S.D.N.Y. 2010). \n2.  Unsurprisingly and critically, petitioner identifies \nno case where the difference between bad faith and \ndeliberate indifference was outcome determinative.  This \ncase is no exception.  Petitioner (at 32) claims the decision \nbelow \u201cexplicitly acknowledged\u201d that she \u201chad presented \nevidence showing deliberate indifference,\u201d so her claims \n\u201cwould have survived summary judgment\u201d had the \nEighth Circuit adopted the deliberate indifference \nstandard.  But the decision below did not so hold.  \nThe Eighth Circuit explained that petitioner \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute\u201d about whether the \nDistrict \nwas \n\u201cnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately \nindifferent\u201d\u2014not that she had indeed established such a \ndispute.  Pet.App.3a (emphasis added).  Indeed, the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava]\u2019s \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a \n(emphasis added).  As discussed, plaintiffs can recover \ndamages based on deliberate indifference only if the \neducational professional \u201cfail[ed] to act\u201d on a known or \nobvious \u201cneed for accommodation.\u201d  Paradise Valley, 815 \nF.3d at 1207 (citation omitted).  Because the District \nacknowledged and acted promptly to address the need, \nthe District could not have acted indifferently. \nAs the district court held, any \u201c[f]ailure to provide \nextended schooling at home was at most negligent,\u201d \nPet.App.35a (emphasis added), because the District \nreadily \u201crespon[ded] to concerns from [Ava]\u2019s parents,\u201d \nPet.App.31a.  The District held IEP meetings and \nexchanged numerous emails with Ava\u2019s parents.  Pet. C.A. \n\n18 \n \n \nApp. 341.  It extended offers for mediation, conciliation \nconferences, and facilitated IEP meetings to better \nunderstand their concerns.  Id. at 97, 182-83, 338-39.  It \neven proposed providing Ava with additional home \ninstruction over the summer on top of the three daily \n\u201cextended school year\u201d hours she already received.  Id. at \n246-47, 331.  Ava\u2019s parents rejected all of this.  Because \n\u201cdeliberate indifference must be a \u2018deliberate choice, \nrather than negligence or bureaucratic inaction,\u2019\u201d \npetitioner cannot show that her damages claim would \nhave been resolved differently in a different circuit.  \nLoeffler v. Staten Island Univ. Hosp., 582 F.3d 268, 275 \n(2d Cir. 2009) (citation omitted). \n There Is No Circuit Split Over the Standard for \nInjunctive \nRelief \nUnder \nthe \nADA \nand \nthe \nRehabilitation Act for Educational-Services Claims. \nWith respect to petitioner\u2019s request for injunctive \nrelief, there is no circuit conflict at all.  Indeed, there \ncannot be.  As discussed below, infra p.24, there is no \ninjunctive relief available in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases that challenge an IEP because an IDEA-compliant \nIEP meets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard.  See \nParadise Valley, 815 F.3d at 1203; 34 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 104.33(b)(2).  None of the IEP-related ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases petitioner cites resolved an \ninjunctive relief claim.  Thus, no circuit has opined on the \nstandard for injunctive relief in these cases.    \n1.  The Third Circuit has not addressed the standard \ngoverning education-related ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims that seek injunctive relief.  All three cases on which \npetitioner (at 18) relies resolve only damages claims under \nthose Acts. \nIn S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion School \nDistrict, 729 F.3d 248 (3d Cir. 2013), the Third Circuit \n\n19 \n \n \naddressed only claims seeking \u201ccompensatory education \nand monetary damages\u201d\u2014not claims seeking injunctive \nrelief\u2014because the plaintiff \u201cadmitted that she is not \ndisabled and never has been disabled.\u201d  Id. at 255.  In D.E. \nv. Central Dauphin School District, 765 F.3d 260 (3d Cir. \n2014), the plaintiff sought \u201conly compensatory damages,\u201d \nand because the plaintiff had not demonstrated a genuine \nissue of material fact with respect to that claim, the Third \nCircuit did not \u201cbelabor [its] analysis\u201d by addressing the \nshowing a plaintiff would need to make to establish a \nprima facie case under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 269 n.9.  Finally, in School District of \nPhiladelphia v. Kirsch, 722 F. App\u2019x 215 (3d Cir. 2018) \n(unpublished), the plaintiffs \nsought only \u201ctuition \nreimbursement\u201d\u2014again, not injunctive relief.  Id. at 227.   \n2.  The same is true in the Seventh Circuit.  In the only \ncase petitioner (at 19) cites, the plaintiffs \u201chad moved to a \ndifferent school district [by the time the case reached the \nSeventh Circuit], mooting their request for an injunction.\u201d  \nC.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. Ashland Sch. Dist., 743 F.3d \n524, 528 (7th Cir. 2014).  As a result, \u201c[t]he Seventh Circuit \nin CTL did not address the issue of bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  C.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of Chi., Dist. \n299, 624 F. Supp. 3d 898, 919 (N.D. Ill. 2022). \nTo support her claim to the contrary, petitioner (at \n19) plucks from a footnote that the Seventh Circuit \u201cdoes \n\u2018not require a showing of intentional discrimination\u2019\u201d for \neducation-related injunctive relief claims.  But that \nfootnote merely states that failure-to-accommodate \nclaims \u201cgenerally\u201d do not require such a showing, citing a \nsingle case from outside of the education context.  C.T.L., \n743 F.3d at 528 n.4.  Petitioner\u2019s \u201cdiscussion of CTL\u201d is \ntherefore nothing more than \u201ca red herring.\u201d  C.B., 624 F. \nSupp. 3d at 919. \n\n20 \n \n \nIf anything, after C.T.L., the Seventh Circuit appears \nto have adopted the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard for injunctive relief claims under the ADA and \nthe Rehabilitation Act in education settings.  In Stanek v. \nSt. Charles Community Unit School District No. 303, 783 \nF.3d 634 (7th Cir. 2015), the Seventh Circuit held that \n\u201csomething more than a bare violation of IDEA is \nrequired to establish disability discrimination in an \neducational program,\u201d citing Fourth Circuit precedent \nthat applied the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard.  Id. at 641 (citing Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of the City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 528-29 (4th Cir. 1998)).  The \nSeventh Circuit went on to explain that the plaintiff in \nStanek had \u201calleged enough to state a plausible claim\u201d \nbecause \u201chis teachers tried to push him out of their classes \n[and] refused to comply with his IEP\u201d because of \u201chis \nautism and the extra attention he needed\u201d\u2014an indication \nof bad faith, if not gross misjudgment.  Id. \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s three Ninth Circuit cases (at 18-19) \nface the same problem.  In Mark H. v. Hamamoto, the \nNinth Circuit never addressed injunctive relief because \nthe \u201csole remaining question [wa]s whether Plaintiffs \n[we]re entitled to money damages.\u201d  Mark H. v. \nLemahieu, 372 F. Supp. 2d 591, 593 (D. Haw. 2005) \n(emphasis added), rev\u2019d sub nom. Mark H. v. Hamamoto, \n620 F.3d 1090 (9th Cir. 2010).   \nIn A.G. v. Paradise Valley Unified School District \nNo. 69, 815 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2016), the court was \npresented with whether an IDEA settlement agreement \nwaived all claims under the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct.  Id. at 1205-06.  In answering no, the Ninth Circuit \ndiscussed the standard for injunctive relief, but never \n\u201cevaluate[d] in the first instance whether plaintiffs ha[d] \na valid [injunctive] claim,\u201d because the issue was not \nbefore the court.  Id. at 1206. \n\n21 \n \n \nAnd in R.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington School \nDistrict, 843 F. App\u2019x 80 (9th Cir. 2021) (unpublished), the \nNinth Circuit did not rule on the standard for injunctive \nrelief because it was not raised below.  See id. at 83.  The \ndistrict court noted that the \u201cstandard applicable to \nSection 504 claims for equitable relief\u201d was not in question \nand that the deliberate indifference inquiry would not \nresolve all potential ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims.  \nR.D. ex rel. Davis v. Lake Washington Sch. Dist., 2019 \nWL 2475001, at *4 (W.D. Wash. June 13, 2019).  \n4.  Petitioner (at 19, 20 & n.3) also relies on district \ncourt cases in the First, Tenth, and Eleventh Circuits.  \nBut those decisions obviously do not bind their respective \ncircuits (or even judges in the same district), and thus \ncannot create the kind of conflict that would warrant this \nCourt\u2019s review.  And in any event, many of those cases do \nnot resolve ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims that seek \ninjunctive relief.  See, e.g., Swenson v. Lincoln Cnty. Sch. \nDist. No. 2, 260 F. Supp. 2d 1136, 1147 (D. Wyo. 2003) \n(only damages because plaintiff had already \u201cgraduated \n[high school]\u201d); Compl. \u00b6\u00b6 19, 23, Miles v. Cushing Pub. \nSchs., 2008 WL 4619857 (W.D. Okla. Oct. 16, 2008) (only \n\u201cphysical and emotional damages\u201d).1 \nII. This Case Is A Poor Vehicle to Resolve the Question \nPresented. \nEven were there a circuit conflict worthy of this \nCourt\u2019s consideration, this case would be a poor vehicle to \naddress it.   \n                                                            \n1 In its Statement of Interest in Robertson v. District of Columbia, \nNo. 24-0656 (D.D.C. Sept. 30, 2024), ECF No. 62, the United States \n\u201c[r]el[ied] on the same cases cited in Ava\u2019s petition\u201d and adopted \nAva\u2019s understanding of the circuit split.  Pet. Supp. Br. at 3.  For the \nreasons stated above, the United States is similarly mistaken. \n\n22 \n \n \nAs explained above, supra pp.17-18, the question of \nwhether \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d differs from \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d for purposes of damages claims is \nirrelevant here because the District would prevail under \neither standard.   \nPetitioner also fails to show that adopting a different \nstandard would make a difference in her claim for \ninjunctive relief.  Petitioner won her IDEA claim.  See \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to revise petitioner\u2019s IEP to include, among other \nthings, at-home instruction after the regular school day, \nand to provide 495 hours of compensatory education.  Pet. \nC.A. App. 366-69.  Both the district court and the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed.  See A.J.T., 2022 WL 4226097, at *1; \nOsseo Area Schs., 96 F.4th at 1064.   \nAs a result, there is already an ongoing injunction in \nplace requiring the District to \u201cextend[] [Ava\u2019s] \ninstructional day until 6:00 p.m.,\u201d thereby affording Ava a \nFAPE, or \u201can educational program that is sufficiently \nambitious in light of her circumstances.\u201d  A.J.T., 2022 WL \n4226097, at *21.  A FAPE under the IDEA satisfies the \nDistrict\u2019s obligation to provide a FAPE under the \nRehabilitation Act as well.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2). \nIn her ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, petitioner \nasks for an injunction to enforce the ALJ\u2019s order, and to \nrequire the District to \u201ccomply[] with the procedures and \nstandards required by federal special education and anti-\ndiscrimination laws.\u201d  Compl. at 25.  The way petitioner \nstructured these claims \u201cshows that what she is really \nseeking is a FAPE.\u201d  Cooper v. Sch. City of Hammond, \n2023 WL 5898438, at *14 (N.D. Ind. Sept. 8, 2023).  There \nis no additional injunctive relief available to her under the \nADA or the Rehabilitation Act that she has not already \nobtained through her IDEA claim.  See Paradise Valley, \n815 F.3d at 1203 (holding that an IDEA-compliant IEP \n\n23 \n \n \nmeets the Rehabilitation Act\u2019s FAPE standard); 34 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 104.33(b)(2).   \nPetitioner (at 10) suggests that because the IDEA \npermits periodic revisions of IEPs, she might lose her \ncurrent injunctive relief in the future.  But under the \nIDEA\u2019s stay-put provision, once the ALJ-ordered IEP is \nin place, Ava \u201cshall remain in\u201d that IEP \u201cunless the \n[District] and the parents otherwise agree.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(j). In other words, even if the District sought to \nalter Ava\u2019s current IEP due to changing circumstances, \nher parents already have veto power that allows them to \npreserve her current IEP.  In these circumstances, a \npermanent injunction would add nothing to the relief Ava \nhas already obtained. \nIII. The Question Presented Does Not Demand This Court\u2019s \nIntervention.  \nPetitioner (at 30) overstates the importance of the \nquestion presented and the consequences of a decision in \nher favor.  \nTo start, the universe of plaintiffs with claims affected \nby the question presented is narrow.  For educational \ndiscrimination plaintiffs not covered by the IDEA, such as \ncollege students, a \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard does not apply (as petitioner herself points out).  \nSee Pet.29; e.g., Halpern v. Wake Forest Univ. Health \nScis., 669 F.3d 454, 461 (4th Cir. 2012); Swanson v. Univ. \nof Cincinnati, 268 F.3d 307, 314 (6th Cir. 2001); \nMershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d 1069, 1076-77 (8th \nCir. 2006).  And for IDEA-covered plaintiffs bringing \nclaims not covered by the IDEA\u2014i.e., non-FAPE \ndiscrimination claims\u2014courts apply less-demanding \nstandards even if they apply a \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard to educational-services cases.  \nSee, e.g., Arc of Iowa v. Reynolds, 24 F.4th 1162, 1177-78 \n\n24 \n \n \n(8th Cir. 2022), vacated as moot, 33 F.4th 1042 (8th Cir. \n2022) (reasonable accommodation); Stewart v. Waco \nIndep. Sch. Dist., 711 F.3d 513, 517 (5th Cir. 2013) \n(deliberate indifference); S.B. ex rel. A.L. v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Harford Cnty., 819 F.3d 69, 76 (4th Cir. 2016) (same). \nMoreover, in most cases, separate discrimination \nclaims challenging educational services will not offer \nplaintiffs relief beyond what is already available under the \nIDEA.  Plaintiffs covered by the IDEA generally must \nexhaust administrative avenues under that statute before \nsuing under either the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act.  See \nFry, 580 U.S. at 157-58; 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); supra p.8.  An \neducational-services plaintiff awarded injunctive relief \nunder the IDEA has no remaining injunctive relief to \npursue, because the implementation of an IDEA-\ncompliant IEP fulfills compliance with the FAPE \nstandard under the Rehabilitation Act.  See, e.g., Paradise \nValley, 815 F.3d at 1203.2   \nAlthough plaintiffs seeking only compensatory \ndamages may bypass the IDEA administrative process, \nsee Perez, 598 U.S. at 148, in the educational-services \ncontext, damages available under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act will frequently mirror relief also \navailable under the IDEA, i.e., compensatory education \n                                                            \n2  Conversely, if an IDEA claim is unsuccessful, an ADA or \nRehabilitation Act discrimination claim arising from the same facts is \nlikely to be either wholly precluded or meritless, regardless of which \nstandard of review is applied.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. Rosemount-Apple \nValley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d 966, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017) \n(holding that preclusion of ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims was \nappropriate where claims \u201cgrew out of or were intertwined with \n[IEP] allegations\u201d); S.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., \n729 F.3d 248, 251 (3d Cir. 2013) (affirming summary judgment for \nschool district on discrimination claims where parallel IDEA claim \nhad been dismissed). \n\n25 \n \n \nfunds, expense reimbursement, and attorney\u2019s fees.  See \nSch. Comm. of Burlington, 471 U.S. at 371; 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B); see also McDaniel v. Syed, 115 F.4th 805, \n821 n.9 (7th Cir. 2024) (precluding double recovery for the \nsame harm).  That is because neither punitive damages \nnor damages for emotional distress are recoverable for \neducational discrimination.  Barnes, 536 U.S. at 189; \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 U.S. \n212, 142 (2022), reh\u2019g denied, 142 S. Ct. 2853 (2022).  The \ndamages available under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct are, instead, compensatory: \u201cgiven as a compensation, \nrecompense, or satisfaction to the plaintiff\u201d for actual \ndamages incurred.  Birdsall v. Coolidge, 93 U.S. 64, 64 \n(1876).  In an educational-services case, actual damages \nrelate to the denial of a FAPE\u2014precisely the harm that \nthe IDEA\u2019s remedies are designed to recompense.  \nAccordingly, if a successful IDEA plaintiff brings \nseparate discrimination claims arising from the same \nfacts, the additional relief she stands to gain is minimal at \nbest.  \nThe facts of this case well illustrate the point.  \nPetitioner does not identify any additional compensatory \ndamages she would be entitled to receive beyond a \ntemporal extension of the IDEA compensation she has \nalready received.  See Pet.10.  Indeed, in almost any case, \nrecovering compensatory damages in excess of relief \navailable under the IDEA would be the result of an end \nrun around the IDEA\u2019s two-year statute of limitations in \norder to recover over more time\u2014here, six years.  See \nGaona v. Town & Country Credit, 324 F.3d 1050, 1056 \n(8th Cir. 2003).   \nBecause the substantive damages available to \neducational-services plaintiffs are functionally the same, \nregardless of the statute or standard of review, there is no \npressing need for the Court to take up the question of the \n\n26 \n \n \nprecise standard to apply to discrimination claims like \npetitioner\u2019s.   \nIV. The Decision Below Is Correct. \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \napplied by the decision below is both consistent with the \nADA and the Rehabilitation Act, and appropriate in the \neducation context. \n1.  The ADA and the Rehabilitation Act prohibit \nschools from discriminating against students with \ndisabilities \u201csolely by reason of [a student\u2019s] disability.\u201d  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794; 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Although neither \nstatute explicitly references an intent requirement, courts \nagree that to obtain compensatory damages, the student \nmust make \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDurrell, 729 F.3d at 262 (emphasis added) (collecting \ncases).  That is because the ADA and the Rehabilitation \nAct expressly incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, \nPet.App.2a, and under Title VI, \u201ccompensatory damages\u201d \nare unavailable \u201cexcept for intentional discrimination,\u201d \nAlexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 282-83 (2001); see \nalso Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 (8th \nCir. 2011). \nMoreover, the private right of action petitioner seeks \nto enforce under Title II of the ADA and Section 504 of \nthe Rehabilitation Act is judicially implied.  See \nCummings, 596 U.S. at 212.  As a result, courts retain \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial scheme \nthat best comports with the statute.\u201d  Gebser, 524 U.S. at \n284.  Exercising that latitude entails examining the \n\u201cstatute to ensure that [this Court] do[es] not fashion the \nscope of an implied right in a manner at odds with the \nstatutory structure and purpose.\u201d  Id.  It also requires \nensuring that the private right of action does not permit \nfederal courts to intrude too far into the \u201cvital relations\u201d \n\n27 \n \n \namong states, schools, and students.  Davis ex rel. \nLaShonda D. v. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, \n685 (1999) (Kennedy, J., dissenting).  Having \u201cembarked \non\u201d the \u201cendeavor\u201d of allowing a private right of action \nthat Congress did not create, courts are \u201cduty bound to \nexercise [their] discretion with due regard for federalism \nand the unique role of the States in our system.\u201d  Id. \n2.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard is \nan appropriate exercise of that discretion.  Most \nimportantly, it accounts for the unique nature of claims \nlike petitioner\u2019s\u2014that is, claims by students with \ndisabilities regarding the appropriateness of their IEPs.   \nAs courts have recognized, discrimination claims \nbased on an IEP\u2019s adequacy are a \u201cconceptual \npeculiarity\u201d that \u201cexists in the primary and secondary \neducation context\u201d because IDEA-funded schools must \ntailor education services to the needs of each student with \na disability.  Timms, 722 F.2d at 1318.  In that context, \nsimply alleging disparate treatment of a student with a \ndisability is insufficient to prove discrimination because \nthe IDEA inherently requires disparate treatment of \neach student with a disability.  Instead, claims like \npetitioner\u2019s rest on allegations that otherwise-legitimate \nIEP services are not being provided in an adequate \nmanner.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \npermits courts to adjudicate these novel claims without \nrequiring judges to \u201csubstitute their own notions of sound \neducational policy for those of the school authorities which \nthey review.\u201d  Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 (citation \nomitted).  The standard furthers this Court\u2019s directive \nthat in cases involving IEPs, \u201cdeference\u201d is required \n\u201cbased on the application of expertise and the exercise of \njudgment by school authorities.\u201d  Id.; see also Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1171 (discussing the need for \u201ca proper \n\n28 \n \n \nbalance between the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields\u201d).   \n3.  Petitioner\u2019s contrary rule, under which plaintiffs \ncould obtain injunctive relief (and potentially damages) \nwithout any showing of intentional discrimination at all, \nwould open the door for plaintiffs to end-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school \ndistricts\u2019 facilitation of the IDEA.  And it would transform \nevery successful educational-services claim into an open-\nand-shut discrimination claim under the ADA and the \nRehabilitation Act.  \nPetitioner\u2019s approach would frustrate the \u201cfederal \npolicy embodied in the IDEA\u201d of collaboration between \neducators, parents, and students and the \u201cquick \nresolution of IDEA claims.\u201d  Strawn, 210 F.3d at 957-58.  \nUnder \npetitioner\u2019s \nrule, \nplaintiffs \ncould \nlitigate \ndiscrimination \nclaims \nthat \nare \neffectively \nindistinguishable from IDEA claims, but without having \nto first follow the IDEA\u2019s collaborative process.  And they \ncould do so well after the expiration of the IDEA\u2019s \nlimitations period, which was created to eliminate the \n\u201cunreasonably long threat of litigation\u201d that \u201craises the \ntension level,\u201d \u201cbreeds an attitude of distrust\u201d between \nschools and parents, and inhibits the ability of schools and \nparents to \u201cwork[] cooperatively to find the best education \nplacement and services for the child.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 108-\n77, at 115-16 (2003).   \nThis case is a clear example of the pitfalls of \npetitioner\u2019s approach.  The District\u2019s alleged deliberate \nindifference reflects a disagreement between Ava\u2019s \neducators and Ava\u2019s parents over the amount of IDEA \nservices Ava needs to make appropriate progress.  That is \nan IDEA claim, not a discrimination claim.  Cf. Fry, 580 \n\n29 \n \n \nU.S. at 172-73 (describing process of evaluating whether \na \nFAPE \nis \n\u201creally \nthe \ngravamen \nof \nthe \nplaintiff\u2019s \u2026 complaint\u201d).  And adjudicating it would \nrequire courts to \u201csecond-guess the expert administrators \non matters on which they are better informed.\u201d  Bell v. \nWolfish, 441 U.S. 520, 531 (1979) (citation omitted).    \nConsider petitioner\u2019s request for a \u201cpermanent\u201d \ninjunction.  Pet.10.  Petitioner essentially asks the courts \nto find that the provision of a school day shorter than the \ndefault provided to other students is automatically an act \nof discrimination\u2014regardless of whether that decision \nwas made as a matter of judgment pursuant to the IEP \nprocess.  But there are many valid reasons why a \nstudent\u2019s IEP might require a school day that is shorter \nthan the default, and courts have previously recognized \nthat the ADA and the Rehabilitation Act do not \ncategorically require schools to modify their policies to \nallow students with disabilities to attend school for a full, \nor \u201cregular,\u201d school day.  See, e.g., DeBord v. Bd. of Educ. \nof Ferguson-Florissant Sch. Dist., 126 F.3d 1102 (8th Cir. \n1997).  \nMoreover, the IEP that the ALJ devised and the \ndistrict court affirmed complies with the IDEA\u2019s related \n\u201cleast restrictive environment\u201d requirement.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1412(a)(5).  That provision requires institutions, \nwhere possible, to educate students with IEPs alongside \nother students in a typical classroom environment.  Id.  \nThus, a school district is already obligated to align a \nstudent\u2019s school day to the default standard to the fullest \nextent possible.  Id.  Implementing a firm \u201cinstructional \nhours\u201d \nrequirement \nwould \npotentially \nintroduce \nconfusion, supplant educators\u2019 judgment, and make \nschool districts likely to err on the side of more \ninstruction\u2014even if possibly harmful to a student\u2014in \norder to avoid the threat of litigation.   \n\n30 \n \n \n4.  The \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \ndoes not yield the parade of horribles that petitioner (at \n30-32) invokes.  The IDEA instructs parents and schools \nto counsel together about adequately meeting the child\u2019s \nneeds.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  School districts cannot hide \nbehind the IDEA to discriminate at will:  They must \nengage in the IEP process and make decisions consistent \nwith professional standards.  But neither can parents \nstrongarm school districts by disguising their IEP \ndisputes as discrimination claims.   \nAgain, the facts of this case are instructive.  As the \nEighth Circuit held, \u201cthe District did not ignore [Ava\u2019s] \nneeds or delay its efforts to address them.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe District repeatedly engaged with Ava and her \nparents and tailored the IEP to Ava\u2019s needs.  Pet.App.4a, \n31a, 32a, 35a.  The negotiations may give rise to a dispute \nabout which actions were best or most appropriate, but \nthere is no evidence of deliberate indifference.   \nNor does the \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \nstandard sanction \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as petitioner claims.  \nPet.27 (quoting Choate, 469 U.S. at 295).  In fact, Choate \nunderscores that gross misjudgment, not deliberate \nindifference, is the appropriate standard.  As the Court \nexplained in that case, the Rehabilitation Act targeted \nunintentional discriminatory acts, like \u201carchitectural \nbarriers,\u201d that were clearly not erected with the aim or \nintent of excluding persons with disabilities, yet had that \nresult.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 297.  The Court thus held that \nconduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \n\u201cfueled by a discriminatory intent.\u201d  Id.   \nThe \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard takes \nthis instruction into account by proscribing intentional \nconduct, bad faith, in addition to unintentional yet \nharmful conduct, gross misjudgment.  By contrast, the \n\n31 \n \n \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d \nstandard \nstill \nrequires \ndiscriminatory intent, even if lower than bad faith.3   \n5.  Petitioner (at 25-26) argues that Congress \nrepudiated Monahan\u2019s reasoning when it passed 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But section 1415(l) overruled Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), not Monahan, and the two \ncases are distinct.  This Court in Smith held that plaintiffs \ncould not seek relief under the ADA or the Rehabilitation \nAct when an IDEA claim was available.  See 468 U.S. at \n1019-20.  Section 1415(l) overruled that holding by \nmaking clear that the IDEA cannot limit the relief \navailable under the ADA or the Rehabilitation Act:  Those \nclaims are separately available.  Section 1415(l) does not, \nhowever, opine on the standard governing those claims.  \nSee Fry, 580 U.S. at 172-73 (discussing distinction \nbetween the IDEA and the Rehabilitation Act under \nsection 1415(l)).   \nIf any doubt remains, every circuit to adopt the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment standard\u201d has continued \napplying \nthe \nstandard \nafter \nCongress \nenacted \nsection 1415(l).  See Pet.16-17.  Thus, neither Smith nor \nsection 1415(l) addressed the standard governing each \ncause of action\u2014the question in Monahan.   \n                                                            \n3 Petitioner (at 28-29) asserts it is \u201cbizarre\u201d that the Eighth Circuit \nimposes a different standard of liability on elementary and secondary \nstudents than on college students.  But colleges are not covered by \nthe IDEA.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 300.2.  Nor are colleges subject to the \ndetailed FAPE requirements present for elementary and secondary \nstudents under Section 504 regulations.  Compare 34 C.F.R. Part 104, \nSubpart D, with id. Subpart E.  The \u201cblueprints\u201d for those \nregulations \u201ccome from\u201d the IDEA.  C.T.L. ex rel. Trebatoski v. \nAshland Sch.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, while not resolving my primary question, has significantly deepened my understanding of the case's dynamics by revealing the involvement of a major new actor: the United States Solicitor General (SG).\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief, Significance Enhanced) The Supreme Court's decision to hear the case remains the central fact. The new observation that the U.S. Solicitor General has entered the case as an *amicus curiae* and seeks to participate in oral argument dramatically underscores the case's national importance. The SG's office does not expend such resources lightly; their involvement confirms that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard has significant implications for the nationwide enforcement of federal disability statutes.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Theory Unverified, but Timeline Clarified):** My core hypothesis\u2014that Osseo Area Schools abandoned the \"bad faith\" standard on the merits\u2014remains unconfirmed. The analytical logjam on this specific point persists. However, the new documents provide a clearer timeline for the merits-stage briefing:\n    *   **March 13, 2025:** The SG files a motion to participate in oral argument.\n    *   **April 7, 2025:** An *amici* brief is filed in support of the Respondents.\n    *   **April 18, 2025:** The Petitioner's Reply Brief is filed.\n    *   This timeline logically places the filing of the Respondent's Brief on the Merits (the document I need to test my hypothesis) between mid-March and mid-April 2025. The logjam is still in place, but the path to breaking it is becoming more defined.\n\n3.  **New Major Factor: The Solicitor General's Intervention.** (New Belief) The discovery of the SG's \"MOTION... FOR LEAVE TO PARTICIPATE IN ORAL ARGUMENT\" is the most significant finding from this observation. This introduces a powerful new predictive variable. The SG's view is highly influential with the Court. While the motion itself doesn't state which party the U.S. supports, the federal government has a strong interest in ensuring that federal anti-discrimination laws are not interpreted in a way that creates an insurmountable bar for plaintiffs. This leads to a strong inference that the SG will argue against the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard, thus supporting the petitioner's position, at least in principle. Finding the SG's amicus brief is now a co-equal priority alongside finding the Respondent's merits brief.\n\n4.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Off-Ramp\" (Contingent Belief):** The petitioner's \"procedural forfeiture\" argument remains a powerful but dormant weapon. Its relevance is still wholly contingent on confirming the respondent's argument pivot.\n\n5.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Increased):** My prediction of a vacatur in favor of the petitioner is strengthened. The SG's intervention makes it much more likely that the Court will view this case as an opportunity to set a clear, uniform national standard, and it is improbable that the standard they set would be the high \"bad faith\" bar used by the Eighth Circuit. While my primary hypothesis about the respondent's pivot is unproven, the SG's involvement provides an independent and powerful reason to expect a ruling favorable to the petitioner.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a crucial success for my evolving research methodology, validating a new tactic and generating a powerful new heuristic for prediction.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Stable & Reinforced):** The two-stage (cert vs. merits) analytical framework remains essential. The discovery of merits-stage filings from the SG and other amici reinforces the importance of tracking how the cast of characters and arguments evolves after the cert grant.\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Value Reinforced & Expanded):**\n    *   **\"Argument Pivot\" & \"Inference from Rebuttal\" Heuristics (Stable):** Remain high-value tools for generating testable hypotheses.\n    *   **\"Procedural Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Stable):** Remains a key contingent tool.\n    *   **\"The SG Signal\" (New Heuristic):** The involvement of the Solicitor General is a powerful predictive signal. When the SG seeks oral argument time in a statutory interpretation case, it indicates the issue has major implications for federal law administration. The SG's position is a strong leading indicator of the eventual outcome, and it is highly probable they will support a standard that facilitates, rather than hinders, the enforcement of the federal statutes in question (ADA and Rehabilitation Act).\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Principle Validated & Refined):** My self-correcting research process is proving highly effective.\n    *   **Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry (Cycle Confirmed):** The \"hypothesize -> test -> analyze -> refine\" loop is working. The failure of my previous, overly specific search led me to correctly diagnose a schema problem and design a new test (this broad search), which succeeded in its diagnostic purpose and yielded unexpected, high-value information.\n    *   **\"Schema Probe -> Broaden -> Refine\" Tactic (Validated):** This observation is a perfect case study in the value of this tactic. The broad, unfiltered search was executed as a \"Schema Probe.\" It revealed that the `docket_files` search type is a repository for ancillary documents (certificates, service lists), not primary briefs. This is an invaluable insight into the database's structure. The serendipitous discovery of the SG's motion also validates the \"Broaden\" step as a method for uncovering unknown unknowns. The next step is to \"Refine\" my search, now armed with new keywords (\"Solicitor General,\" \"amicus curiae,\" \"United States\") and a better understanding of what this search tool does *not* provide."

It confirms that at the certiorari stage, the respondent (Osseo Area Schools) explicitly argued that the 'bad faith or gross misjudgment' standard was correct and that there was no meaningful circuit split. The Supreme Court's decision to grant certiorari in the face of these arguments from elite counsel is a powerful signal of its intent to scrutinize and likely reject this standard. My predictive model now hinges on one critical question: Did the respondent maintain this argument in their merits-stage brief, or did they pivot? This is the 'Argument Pivot' heuristic in action. Finding the respondent's merits brief is therefore the highest priority action to resolve the primary uncertainty in my task-specific beliefs (\u03b8).

          "task_beliefs": "This observation has been a breakthrough, confirming a critical piece of my central hypothesis and dramatically clarifying the strategic landscape of the case. While I did not find the merits-stage brief I was looking for, I found something arguably more valuable at this juncture: the Respondent's cert-stage Brief in Opposition (BIO).\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief, Significance Massively Enhanced) The Court's decision to grant certiorari now appears even more deliberate and significant. I have now seen the Respondent's BIO, filed by top-tier Supreme Court advocate Lisa S. Blatt. In it, the Respondent forcefully argued that the Court should *deny* the petition because there was \"No Meaningful Circuit Split\" and that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard was correct and appropriate. The Court's decision to take the case *despite* these strong arguments from elite counsel signals a profound disagreement with the Respondent's position and a clear intent to rule on the validity of the \"bad faith\" standard.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Hypothesis Half-Confirmed, Stakes Raised):** My core hypothesis is now halfway to being proven. The BIO provides definitive evidence that the Respondent, Osseo Area Schools, explicitly and vigorously defended the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard as the correct one at the certiorari stage. On page 2 of their BIO, they state that courts have \"appropriately developed\" a scheme requiring plaintiffs to show \"bad faith or gross misjudgment.\" This establishes the crucial baseline. The entire predictive model now hinges on a single, verifiable question: Did they maintain this argument in their merits brief? The logjam on the merits brief itself persists, but the strategic importance of finding it has grown exponentially.\n\n3.  **New Major Factor: The Solicitor General's Intervention.** (Stable Belief, Contextualized) The SG's decision to intervene is now cast in a new light. The SG would have seen the Respondent's BIO arguing that all circuits effectively apply a similar high-intent standard. The SG's subsequent intervention strongly implies the U.S. government disagrees with that characterization and believes the issue requires clarification from the Court, likely in favor of a more uniform and less burdensome standard for plaintiffs.\n\n4.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Procedural Forfeiture\" Argument (Belief Solidified & Sharpened):** My previous \"dormant weapon\" belief is now an active and powerful predictive factor. With the BIO in hand, the Petitioner has a devastating rebuttal if the Respondent pivots away from the \"bad faith\" standard in their merits brief. They can argue that the Respondent engaged in a \"bait-and-switch,\" urging the Court not to take the case on the grounds that the \"bad faith\" standard was correct, only to abandon that argument once review was granted. This type of procedural argument can be very persuasive to the Court, as it suggests the Respondent is not arguing in good faith.\n\n5.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Substantially Increased):** My prediction of a vacatur in favor of the petitioner is now held with much higher confidence. The discovery of the BIO reveals the Respondent is in a strategic trap. **Path A:** They defend the \"bad faith\" standard on the merits, an argument the Court seems to have already rejected by granting cert over their express opposition. **Path B:** They abandon the \"bad faith\" standard, conceding the central point of the case and opening themselves up to a powerful \"procedural forfeiture\" argument from the Petitioner. Both paths point toward a victory for the Petitioner on the legal question.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a \"successful failure\" that validates my iterative research process and provides critical new insights into both predictive heuristics and database navigation.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Cert vs. Merits):** (Stable & Validated) This model is proving to be the most powerful analytical framework for this task. The discovery of the Brief in Opposition provides the cert-stage \"thesis\" from the Respondent. The grant of cert was the \"challenge.\" The yet-to-be-found merits brief is the \"response.\" This observation confirms that obtaining briefs from *both* stages is essential to understanding the strategic evolution of a case.\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Value Reinforced & Expanded):**\n    *   **\"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic (Stable & Confirmed as Central):** This is no longer just a speculative tool; it is the central dynamic of this case. The BIO provides the concrete \"before\" picture against which any \"after\" picture (the merits brief) can be compared.\n    *   **\"The SG Signal\" (Stable):** Remains a powerful leading indicator.\n    *   **\"Procedural Forfeiture/Bait-and-Switch\" Heuristic (New & Refined):** I can now name this heuristic more precisely. It describes the specific tactical argument a party can make when an opponent changes its core legal position between the cert and merits stages. The BIO's discovery makes this a primary heuristic to watch for in the Petitioner's Reply Brief.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Principle Validated & Refined):**\n    *   **Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry (Cycle Confirmed):** The \"hypothesize -> test -> analyze -> refine\" loop continues to be highly effective. My hypothesis about the Respondent's cert-stage argument led me to search for their brief, and while the search was imperfect, it yielded the correct document type from an earlier stage, which was even more valuable for confirming the hypothesis's premise.\n    *   **\"Schema Probe -> Broaden -> Refine\" Tactic (Validated by Serendipity):** My attempt to execute a \"Schema Probe\" with the `CLOSED_SEARCH` action was both a failure and a stunning success. It failed to retrieve the *merits* brief, but it serendipitously retrieved the *cert-stage* BIO. This teaches me two things:\n        1.  **Database Schema Insight:** The `docket_files` search type contains a mix of documents, including key cert-stage briefs like the BIO. The filter `proceeding_title: 'brief of respondent'` is too ambiguous as it matches both the \"Brief in Opposition\" (a cert-stage respondent brief) and, presumably, the \"Brief for the Respondents\" (a merits-stage brief). Future searches must be more specific to differentiate these stages, perhaps by using more precise titles or date filters.\n        2.  **Value of Imperfect Searches:** Even a flawed or overly broad search can uncover \"unknown unknowns\" of immense value. The accidental discovery of the BIO is a testament to this principle. It has advanced my understanding more than finding the merits brief at this stage might have. My next step is to \"Refine\" my search for the merits brief, now armed with this new knowledge."

The outcome of this search will either confirm my model and lock in a prediction for the petitioner (via concession/forfeiture), or it will show the Respondent doubling down, which also leads to a loss for them on the merits. In either scenario, my uncertainty about the case outcome will be drastically reduced, bringing me to the brink of a final answer. The Design EIG is also very high.

The court\u2019s denial of \nrehearing en banc (Pet.App.44a-45a) is not published, \nbut available at 2024 WL 2845774.  The opinion of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota \ngranting \nrespondents\u2019 \nmotion \nfor \nsummary judgment (Pet.App.6a-43a) is not published \nbut available at 2023 WL 2316893.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nentered \njudgment \non \nMarch 21, 2024 (Pet.App.1a-5a) and denied A.J.T.\u2019s \ntimely petition for rehearing en banc on June 5, 2024 \n(Pet.App.44a-45a).  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe addendum (Add. 1a-5a). \n \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case raises a simple question:  Do children \nwith disabilities seeking relief for education-related \ndiscrimination need to satisfy a more stringent legal \ntest than all other plaintiffs suing under Title II of the \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct \n(ADA) \nand \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act?  The answer to \nthat question is emphatically no.  The same standards \napply to everyone. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act can establish a statutory \nviolation and obtain injunctive relief without proving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But over four decades ago, \nin Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. \n1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a more stringent \ntest for children with disabilities who suffer \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Those \nplaintiffs\u2014and only those plaintiffs\u2014must prove that \nschool officials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and obtain any \nkind of relief whatsoever.  Id. at 1170-71; Pet.App.5a \nn.2. \nSince then, four other circuits and many district \ncourts have reflexively adopted Monahan\u2019s rule and \nrequired children with disabilities to show \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d to prove education-related \nviolations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nHundreds of children with disabilities have seen their \nclaims \nrejected \nunder \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard. \n\n3 \n \n \nThat standard has absolutely no basis in the \nrelevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor the \nRehabilitation Act authorizes courts to impose a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, both statutes broadly prohibit disability \ndiscrimination and provide relief to \u201cany person\u201d \nsubjected to it.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 794(a), 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133.  Nothing in that text \npermits exceptions or special rules making it more \ndifficult for children with disabilities to prove \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Indeed, this \nCourt has firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle \nthat judges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Yet that is exactly what \nMonahan requires.   \nIt is inconceivable that when Congress enacted \nlaws to combat disability discrimination, it silently \nsingled out school-age children\u2014perhaps the most \nvulnerable subset of people with disabilities\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment.  And there is no reason to think \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are violated only \nif the defendant acts with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment given Congress\u2019s explicit recognition \nthat disability discrimination is \u201cmost often the \nproduct, not of invidious animus\u201d or egregious \nmisconduct, \u201cbut rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(Ava), a teenage girl who suffers from severe epilepsy \nand \ncognitive \ndeficits. \n \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nacknowledged that Ava presented evidence showing \n\n4 \n \n \nthat her Minnesota school district had been \n\u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \nsteadfastly refusing reasonable accommodations that \nher prior Kentucky school district had provided for \nyears.  Pet.App.3a.  Nonetheless, the court rejected \nher claims because it was \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan.  \nId. at 4a-5a.  Under the baseline standards that the \nEighth Circuit applies in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases outside the school setting, Ava\u2019s evidence would \nhave been sufficient to survive summary judgment.  \nId. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan,\u201d her evidence was \n\u201cjust not enough.\u201d  Id. \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit sharply criticized \nMonahan\u2014its own precedent\u2014for jacking up the \nstandard for school-age children to prove violations of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The court observed \nthat Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act lacked \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext\u201d \nand \nwas \nbuilt \ninstead \non \nmisguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own uncritical embrace of \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d for education-\nrelated claims brought by children with disabilities.  \nKnox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. \n2023).  Nevertheless, the decision below concluded \nthat \nMonahan \n\u201cremains \nthe \nlaw\u201d \nin \nthe \nEighth Circuit and must be followed.  Pet.App.5a n.2. \nMonahan should not be the law anywhere.  This \nCourt should enforce the plain meaning of the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct\u2014and \nrestore \nthe \nfull \nprotections against discrimination that Congress \ngranted children with disabilities.  The decision below \ncannot stand. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis case involves Ava\u2019s claims of disability \ndiscrimination against respondents Osseo Area \nSchools, Independent School District No. 279, and its \nboard (together, the District) under the ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).  The district court and \nEighth Circuit held that the District violated Ava\u2019s \nrights under the IDEA by denying her a full day of \neducation based on \u201cshifting,\u201d \u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d reasons.  JA468, 471, 498, 544; see \nPet.App.49a-50a.  But both courts rejected Ava\u2019s \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because \nshe could not satisfy Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \nfor establishing a violation of those statutes. \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe IDEA\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildr\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In the \ndecision below, the Eighth Circuit held that for \ndiscrimination claims \u201cbased on educational services\u201d \nbrought by children with disabilities, these statutes \nare violated only if school officials acted with \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a.  That test \narbitrarily departs from the more lenient standards \nthat all courts\u2014including the Eighth Circuit\u2014apply \nto ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought by \nother plaintiffs outside the school setting.   \nThe question presented is: \nWhether the ADA and Rehabilitation Act require \nchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard \nwhen seeking relief for discrimination relating to \ntheir education. \n \n\nii \n \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThe following proceedings are directly related to \nthis petition under Rule 14.1(b)(iii): \n\u2022 A.J.T. v.

The court\u2019s denial of \nrehearing en banc (Pet.App.44a-45a) is not published, \nbut available at 2024 WL 2845774.  The opinion of the \nUnited States District Court for the District of \nMinnesota \ngranting \nrespondents\u2019 \nmotion \nfor \nsummary judgment (Pet.App.6a-43a) is not published \nbut available at 2023 WL 2316893.   \nJURISDICTION \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nentered \njudgment \non \nMarch 21, 2024 (Pet.App.1a-5a) and denied A.J.T.\u2019s \ntimely petition for rehearing en banc on June 5, 2024 \n(Pet.App.44a-45a).  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nRelevant statutory provisions are reproduced in \nthe addendum (Add. 1a-5a). \n \n\n2 \n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case raises a simple question:  Do children \nwith disabilities seeking relief for education-related \ndiscrimination need to satisfy a more stringent legal \ntest than all other plaintiffs suing under Title II of the \nAmericans \nwith \nDisabilities \nAct \n(ADA) \nand \nSection 504 of the Rehabilitation Act?  The answer to \nthat question is emphatically no.  The same standards \napply to everyone. \nAs a general matter, plaintiffs suing under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act can establish a statutory \nviolation and obtain injunctive relief without proving \nintentional disability discrimination, and they can \nrecover compensatory damages by proving that the \ndefendant was deliberately indifferent to their \nfederally protected rights.  But over four decades ago, \nin Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. \n1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a more stringent \ntest for children with disabilities who suffer \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Those \nplaintiffs\u2014and only those plaintiffs\u2014must prove that \nschool officials acted with \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to establish a violation and obtain any \nkind of relief whatsoever.  Id. at 1170-71; Pet.App.5a \nn.2. \nSince then, four other circuits and many district \ncourts have reflexively adopted Monahan\u2019s rule and \nrequired children with disabilities to show \u201cbad faith \nor gross misjudgment\u201d to prove education-related \nviolations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  \nHundreds of children with disabilities have seen their \nclaims \nrejected \nunder \nMonahan\u2019s \nheightened \nstandard. \n\n3 \n \n \nThat standard has absolutely no basis in the \nrelevant statutory text.  Neither the ADA nor the \nRehabilitation Act authorizes courts to impose a \nuniquely stringent standard on children with \ndisabilities bringing claims against their schools.  On \nthe contrary, both statutes broadly prohibit disability \ndiscrimination and provide relief to \u201cany person\u201d \nsubjected to it.  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 794(a), 794a(a)(2); \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12132, 12133.  Nothing in that text \npermits exceptions or special rules making it more \ndifficult for children with disabilities to prove \ndiscrimination in the school setting.  Indeed, this \nCourt has firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle \nthat judges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  Yet that is exactly what \nMonahan requires.   \nIt is inconceivable that when Congress enacted \nlaws to combat disability discrimination, it silently \nsingled out school-age children\u2014perhaps the most \nvulnerable subset of people with disabilities\u2014for \ndisfavored treatment.  And there is no reason to think \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act are violated only \nif the defendant acts with bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment given Congress\u2019s explicit recognition \nthat disability discrimination is \u201cmost often the \nproduct, not of invidious animus\u201d or egregious \nmisconduct, \u201cbut rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit rejected ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims brought by petitioner A.J.T. \n(Ava), a teenage girl who suffers from severe epilepsy \nand \ncognitive \ndeficits. \n \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nacknowledged that Ava presented evidence showing \n\n4 \n \n \nthat her Minnesota school district had been \n\u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \nsteadfastly refusing reasonable accommodations that \nher prior Kentucky school district had provided for \nyears.  Pet.App.3a.  Nonetheless, the court rejected \nher claims because it was \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan.  \nId. at 4a-5a.  Under the baseline standards that the \nEighth Circuit applies in ADA and Rehabilitation Act \ncases outside the school setting, Ava\u2019s evidence would \nhave been sufficient to survive summary judgment.  \nId. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan,\u201d her evidence was \n\u201cjust not enough.\u201d  Id. \nRemarkably, the Eighth Circuit sharply criticized \nMonahan\u2014its own precedent\u2014for jacking up the \nstandard for school-age children to prove violations of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  The court observed \nthat Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act lacked \u201cany anchor in statutory \ntext\u201d \nand \nwas \nbuilt \ninstead \non \nmisguided \n\u201cspeculat[ion]\u201d about Congress\u2019s intent.  Id. at 5a n.2.  \nThat criticism echoed the Sixth Circuit\u2019s recent \ndiscomfort with its own uncritical embrace of \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cimpossibly high bar\u201d for education-\nrelated claims brought by children with disabilities.  \nKnox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 (6th Cir. \n2023).  Nevertheless, the decision below concluded \nthat \nMonahan \n\u201cremains \nthe \nlaw\u201d \nin \nthe \nEighth Circuit and must be followed.  Pet.App.5a n.2. \nMonahan should not be the law anywhere.  This \nCourt should enforce the plain meaning of the ADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct\u2014and \nrestore \nthe \nfull \nprotections against discrimination that Congress \ngranted children with disabilities.  The decision below \ncannot stand. \n\n5 \n \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nThis case involves Ava\u2019s claims of disability \ndiscrimination against respondents Osseo Area \nSchools, Independent School District No. 279, and its \nboard (together, the District) under the ADA, \nRehabilitation Act, and Individuals with Disabilities \nEducation Act (IDEA).  The district court and \nEighth Circuit held that the District violated Ava\u2019s \nrights under the IDEA by denying her a full day of \neducation based on \u201cshifting,\u201d \u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d reasons.  JA468, 471, 498, 544; see \nPet.App.49a-50a.  But both courts rejected Ava\u2019s \nclaims under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act because \nshe could not satisfy Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \nfor establishing a violation of those statutes. \nA. Legal Background \n1.  Multiple federal laws protect children with \ndisabilities from education-related discrimination.  \nThe IDEA\u2014like its predecessor, the Education for All \nHandicapped Children Act (EHA)\u2014guarantees all \nchildren a \u201cfree appropriate public education \n[or FAPE].\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  To that end, \nthe IDEA ensures that children with disabilities \nreceive \nan \n\u201c\u2018individualized \neducation \nprogram \n[or IEP]\u2019\u201d that \u201cspells out a personalized plan to meet \nall of the child\u2019s \u2018educational needs.\u2019\u201d  Fry v. Napoleon \nCmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 158 (2017).   \nThe IDEA creates specialized procedures for \nresolving IEP-related disputes between families and \nschools, 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415, but it allows courts to \naward only limited \u201cequitable relief,\u201d Florence Cnty. \nSch. Dist. Four v. Carter ex rel. Carter, 510 U.S. 7, \n15-16 (1993).  Such relief may include an \u201cinjunction\u201d \nor \u201creimbursement\u201d for educational expenses, Sch. \n\n6 \n \n \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 \nU.S. 359, 369-70 (1985).  But the IDEA \u201cd[oes] not \nallow for damages.\u201d  Fitzgerald v. Barnstable Sch. \nComm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009). \nThe \nADA \nand \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \nadditional protections to victims of disability \ndiscrimination.  Unlike the IDEA, which applies only \nto the education of school-age children, the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act protect all Americans, both inside \nand outside the school setting.  As relevant here, the \nADA states that \u201cno qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act contains a similarly phrased \nprohibition that applies to recipients of federal \nfunding.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).   \nDespite some \u201coverlap in coverage\u201d with the IDEA, \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act do different work \nwhen it comes to primary and secondary schools\u2019 \ntreatment of children with disabilities.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat \n170-71. \n \nWhereas \n\u201cthe \nIDEA \nguarantees \nindividually tailored educational services\u201d\u2014namely, \nan IEP designed to ensure that the child receives a \nFAPE\u2014the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cpromise \nnon-discriminatory access\u201d to education.  Id.  A school \ndistrict can therefore \u201cestablish a FAPE in compliance \nwith the IDEA, while nevertheless engaging in \ndiscriminatory \nconduct \nunder \nthe \nADA \n[and \nRehabilitation Act].\u201d  Lartigue v. Northside Indep. \nSch. Dist., 100 F.4th 510, 521 (5th Cir. 2024); accord \nLe Pape v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 103 F.4th 966, \n981 (3d Cir. 2024). \n\n7 \n \n \nThe ADA and Rehabilitation Act both recognize \nthat failing to provide \u201creasonable accommodations\u201d \nthat would enable people with disabilities to \n\u201cparticipate equally\u201d in a given service or program is \ndisability discrimination.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 170; see \nalso id. at 159-60.  Indeed, since the Rehabilitation \nAct became law in 1973, courts have uniformly \nunderstood that \u201ca refusal to accommodate the needs \nof a disabled person\u201d can \u201camount[] to discrimination \nagainst \nthe \nhandicapped\u201d \nif \nthe \nrequested \naccommodations are reasonable.  Se. Cmty. Coll. v. \nDavis, 442 U.S. 397, 412-13 (1979); accord Choate, \n469 U.S. at 300-01 & n.21. In 1990, Congress \nreaffirmed and adopted this longstanding principle \nwhen enacting the ADA.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2) \n(providing that people with disabilities are \u201cqualified\u201d \nfor public services, programs, or activities if they can \nparticipate \nwith \n\u201creasonable \nmodifications\u201d);  \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.130(b)(7) (requiring \u201creasonable \nmodifications\u201d \nwhen \n\u201cnecessary \nto \navoid \ndiscrimination on the basis of disability\u201d).    \nUnder both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, \naccommodations are reasonable so long as they do not \nentail \u201ca fundamental alteration\u201d of the service in \nquestion \nor \nimpose \n\u201cundue \nfinancial \n[or] \nadministrative burdens\u201d on the regulated party.   \n28 C.F.R. \u00a7 35.150(a)(3) (ADA); see also id. \u00a7 41.53 \n(Rehabilitation Act); Choate, 469 U.S. at 300 & n.20; \nK.M. ex rel. Bright v. Tustin Unified Sch. Dist., 725 \nF.3d 1088, 1097 (9th Cir. 2013); Gorman v. Bartch, \n152 F.3d 907, 912 (8th Cir. 1998). \n2.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cexpressly \nincorporate[]\u201d the same \u201crights and remedies provided \nunder Title VI\u201d of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.  \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 \n\n8 \n \n \nU.S. 212, 218 (2022).  The ADA provides that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth in\u201d the \nRehabilitation Act \u201cshall be the remedies, procedures, \nand rights this subchapter provides to any person \nalleging discrimination on the basis of disability in \nviolation of [the ADA].\u201d  42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133.  And the \nRehabilitation Act, in turn, states that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth\u201d in Title VI \n\u201cshall be available to any person aggrieved by\u201d \ndisability discrimination inflicted by a person or \nentity subject to the Rehabilitation Act.  29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).   \nAccordingly, both the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nfollow Title VI in \u201cauthoriz[ing] individuals,\u201d \nincluding children with disabilities, \u201cto seek redress \nfor violations\u201d by \u201cbringing suits\u201d for both \u201cinjunctive \nrelief\u201d and \u201cmoney damages.\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 160; \nsee also Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, 279-80 \n(2001) (observing that \u201cprivate individuals may sue\u201d \nunder \u201cTitle VI and obtain both injunctive relief and \ndamages\u201d).  In cases outside the educational context, \nthe courts of appeals unanimously agree that ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs can establish a \nstatutory violation\u2014and with it, eligibility for \ninjunctive relief\u2014if they show, on the merits, that the \ndefendant \nfailed \nto \nprovide \na \nreasonable \naccommodation to a covered person with a disability.1  \n \n1   See, e.g., Sosa v. Mass. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 80 F.4th 15, 30 (1st \nCir. 2023); Hamilton v. Westchester County, 3 F.4th 86, 91 \n(2d Cir. 2021); Durham v. Kelley, 82 F.4th 217, 225-26 \n(3d Cir. 2023); Richardson v. Clarke, 52 F.4th 614, 619 \n(4th Cir. 2022); Bennett-Nelson v. La. Bd. of Regents, 431 F.3d \n448, 455 (5th Cir. 2005); Finley v. Huss, 102 F.4th 789, 820-21 \n(6th Cir. 2024); Wis. Cmty. Servs., Inc. v. City of Milwaukee, \n \n\n9 \n \n \nSuch plaintiffs need not make any specific showing of \nwrongful intent to prove a statutory violation and \nobtain injunctive relief.   \nFor compensatory damages, however, every circuit \nrequires \u201ca showing of intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nS.H. ex rel. Durrell v. Lower Merion Sch. Dist., 729 \nF.3d 248, 262 (3d Cir. 2013) (collecting cases).  \nBecause \u201cprivate individuals [may] not recover \ncompensatory damages under Title VI except for \nintentional discrimination,\u201d Sandoval, 532 U.S. \nat 282-83, and because the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct incorporate Title VI\u2019s rights and remedies, supra \nat 7-8, ADA and Rehabilitation Act plaintiffs may not \nobtain damages without proving that the defendant \nacted with a wrongful state of mind.  See S.H., 729 \nF.3d at 262.   \nThe \u201cvast majority\u201d of courts hold that this intent \nrequirement for damages demands proof that the \ndefendant \nwas, \nat \na \nminimum, \n\u201cdeliberately \nindifferent\u201d to the plaintiff\u2019s federally protected \nrights.  Pierce v. District of Columbia, 128 F. Supp. 3d \n250, 278-79 (D.D.C. 2015) (Jackson, J.) (collecting \ncases).  Those courts have done so based on this \nCourt\u2019s precedent adopting a deliberate indifference \nstandard under Title IX, which was likewise \u201cmodeled \nafter Title VI.\u201d  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., \n \n465 F.3d 737, 750-51 (7th Cir. 2006) (en banc); Hall v. Higgins, \n77 F.4th 1171, 1180-81 (8th Cir. 2023); Payan v. L.A. Cmty.

George \nWashington Univ., 847 F.3d 740, 746-47 (D.C. Cir. 2017).  \n\n10 \n \n \n524 U.S. 274, 286, 290 (1998).2  This \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d test requires that a defendant ignore a \n\u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that the challenged action \n(or inaction) would \u201cresult in a violation of federally \nprotected rights.\u201d  Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 \nF.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011). \n3.  Although the circuits largely agree on the \nstandards governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims outside the educational setting, they are \ndivided over whether those same standards apply to \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related \nclaims.   \nThe Third and Ninth Circuits apply the same \nstandards in these cases as they do in all others. \nPet.17-19.3  So do various district courts sitting in \nother circuits.  Pet.20 n.3.4  Five circuits, though, hold \nthat children with disabilities seeking relief for \neducation-related discrimination cannot establish a \n \n2   See, e.g., Loeffler v.

Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982).  There, the court \naffirmed the dismissal without prejudice of a \u201ccryptic\u201d \nRehabilitation Act claim alleging an \u201cimproper \neducational placement.\u201d  Id. at 1169-70.  To offer \u201ca \nfew words [of] guidance\u201d on remand, the court opined \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment should be \nshown\u201d before a Rehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be \nmade out\u201d in \u201cthe context of education of handicapped \nchildren.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71.  This heightened standard \nrequires proof that school officials departed so \n\u201csubstantially from accepted professional judgment, \npractice or standards as to demonstrate\u201d that they \n\u201cactually did not base the decision on [professional] \njudgment.\u201d  Est. of Barnwell ex rel. Barnwell v. \nWatson, 880 F.3d 998, 1004 (8th Cir. 2018). \nMonahan justified this harsh test based on a \nperceived \u201cduty to harmonize the Rehabilitation Act\u201d \nwith the IDEA\u2019s predecessor\u2014the EHA\u2014given that \nthe EHA specifically addressed the educational needs \nof children with disabilities.  687 F.2d at 1171.  \nAccording to Monahan, a heightened standard was \nnecessary to \u201cgive each of these statutes the full play \n \n5  See, e.g., C.L. v. Scarsdale Union Free Sch. Dist., 744 \nF.3d 826, 841 (2d Cir. 2014); Sellers ex rel. Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of \nthe City of Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir. 1998); D.A. ex \nrel. Latasha A. v. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 629 F.3d 450, 454-55 \n(5th Cir. 2010); G.C. v. Owensboro Pub. Schs., 711 F.3d 623, 635 \n(6th Cir. 2013); Pet.App.5a & n.2. \n\n12 \n \n \nintended by Congress\u201d and achieve \u201cwhat [the court] \nbelieve[d] to be a proper balance between the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state \neducational officials, and the competence of courts to \nmake judgments in technical fields.\u201d  Id.  Monahan \ntherefore construed the EHA to limit the relief \navailable to school-age children with disabilities \nunder the Rehabilitation Act.  Id.   \nThe \nEighth \nCircuit \nsubsequently \nextended \nMonahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard \nto claims brought by children under the ADA.  See \nHoekstra ex rel. Hoekstra v. Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 283, \n103 F.3d 624, 626-27 (8th Cir. 1996).   \n4.  Two years after Monahan, Congress amended \nthe EHA by enacting what is now Section 1415(l) of \nthe IDEA.  See Fry, 580 U.S. at 161.  That provision, \nas amended, states in relevant part:  \nNothing \nin \n[the \nIDEA] \nshall \nbe \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, \nprocedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the [ADA], \n[Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal \nlaws protecting the rights of children \nwith disabilities . . . .   \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  In other words, Congress \ndeclared that the IDEA does not \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the \nability of children with disabilities to obtain relief \nunder the ADA or Rehabilitation Act.  Id.   \n \nNevertheless, the Eighth Circuit has continued to \nrely on the IDEA to restrict ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct relief for school-age children with disabilities by \nlimiting liability to cases involving \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d by school officials.  See, e.g., B.M. ex rel. \nMiller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. Dist., 732 F.3d 882, \n\n13 \n \n \n887 (8th Cir. 2013); M.P. ex rel. K. v. Indep. Sch. Dist. \nNo. 721, 326 F.3d 975, 981-82 (8th Cir. 2003).  So have \nthe Second, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits.  Supra \nat 10-11 & n.5 (collecting cases).  \nB. Factual Background \nBecause this case comes to the Court on the \nDistrict\u2019s motion for summary judgment, the evidence \nmust be viewed \u201cin the light most favorable to [Ava].\u201d  \nTolan v. Cotton, 572 U.S. 650, 657 (2014) (per curiam).  \nThat \nevidence \nshows \nthat \nthe \nDistrict \nhas \nsystematically discriminated against Ava in violation \nof the IDEA, ADA, and Rehabilitation Act.  \nSince Ava was six months old, she has suffered \nfrom \u201ca rare form of epilepsy\u201d known as Lennox-\nGastaut Syndrome.  Pet.App.6a, 50a.  Ava\u2019s condition \nseverely impacts her ability to function.  For example, \nAva \nhas \n\u201csignificantly \ndiminished \nintellectual \ncapacities\u201d and she requires \u201cassistance with \neveryday tasks like walking and toileting.\u201d  Id.  Ava \nalso suffers from \u201cseizures throughout the day.\u201d  Id. \nat 50a.  Her seizures \u201ccreat[e] safety concerns and \ninterfer[e] with her capacity to learn.\u201d  JA515.  The \nseizures \u201care so frequent in the morning that [Ava] \ncan\u2019t attend school before noon.\u201d  Pet.App.50a.  From \nthen on, however, Ava is \u201calert and able to learn until \nabout 6:00 p.m.\u201d  Id.   \nAva\u2019s parents and physicians recognized this \npattern early on and developed a plan to help her \nachieve her educational and personal goals.  JA479-\n81, 510-16.  Since preschool, Ava has slept late and \navoided activities before midday.  JA479-81.  And \nuntil Ava was 10 years old, educational professionals \nrespected these limitations.  See, e.g., JA497-507.  \nIndeed, Ava\u2019s public school district in Kentucky \n\n14 \n \n \nadequately addressed her needs, including by \nproviding \n\u201cevening \ninstruction \nat \nhome.\u201d  \nPet.App.50a.   \nIn 2015, when Ava was ten years old, her family \nmoved to Minnesota.  But her new school district \nthere, respondent Osseo Area Schools, refused to \nprovide her with the same accommodation.  Id.  \u201cYear \nafter year,\u201d the District \u201cdenied [Ava\u2019s] parents\u2019 \nrequests for evening instruction\u201d based on \u201ca series of \nshifting explanations.\u201d  Id.  Initially, the District \n\u201cclaimed that state law d[id] not require\u201d adjusting \nAva\u2019s instructional hours.  Id.  Then, the District \u201csaid \nit needed to avoid setting unfavorable precedent for \nitself and other districts.\u201d  Id.  \u201cAnd later, it said that \nthe home environment would be too restrictive,\u201d while \ndemanding more \u201cdata\u201d to justify a \u201cprogramming \nchange.\u201d  Id.   \nAll told, over her first three years in Minnesota, \nAva received only 4.25 hours of instruction per day\u2014\njust 65% of what her non-disabled peers received.  Id.; \nsee id. at 8a.  Rather than provide a full day of \nprofessional instruction by a teacher, the District \nopined that Ava\u2019s parents \u201cshould hire a personal care \nattendant after school hours.\u201d  JA495. \nIn 2018, the District insisted on truncating Ava\u2019s \ninstructional time even further.  As Ava prepared to \nenter middle school, the District abruptly amended \nher IEP to \u201ccut[] back her day to about 3 hours\u201d\u2014less \nthan half of what her peers would receive.  \nPet.App.51a; see id. at 8a.  Despite this latest setback, \nAva\u2019s parents continued to seek a workable \ncompromise with the District.  They made \u201cvarious \nproposals to at least maintain [Ava\u2019s] 4.25-hour day,\u201d \nincluding keeping her at the elementary school, \n\n15 \n \n \nwhere the school day was longer.  Id. at 51a. The \nDistrict rejected all of their proposals.  Id.   \nThroughout this period, Ava\u2019s parents repeatedly \ncomplained to the District that its refusal to provide \nAva \u201ca full day of school equal to her peers was \ndiscriminatory and did not comply with\u201d the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  JA484, 440-41.  But despite \nfederal regulatory requirements and a written \nDistrict policy requiring investigation of such \ncomplaints, the District refused to investigate or \nresolve these complaints.  See 34 C.F.R. \u00a7 104.7; 28 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 35.107; JA80-83, 485. \nInstead, the District claimed credit for supposedly \ngiving Ava an \u201cequal opportunity\u201d to other students, \nbased on its willingness to tolerate Ava\u2019s delayed start \nto the school day and its restraint in not filing a \njuvenile \u201ctruancy action\u201d against her parents.  JA70-\n73, 84. \nC. Procedural History \n1. After years of frustration, Ava\u2019s parents \n\u201c[r]ealiz[ed] that an agreement [with the District] was \nbeyond reach,\u201d so they filed an IDEA complaint with \nthe \nMinnesota \nDepartment \nof \nEducation.  \nPet.App.51a.  An administrative law judge (ALJ) held \na five-day hearing and concluded that the District had \nviolated the IDEA by depriving Ava of a FAPE.  See \nJA450-78. \nThe ALJ found that the District\u2019s \u201cproffered \nreasons\u201d for denying her a full school day were \u201cnot \ncredible\u201d and \u201cmore pretextual than real.\u201d  JA468, \n471.  It explained that the District\u2019s \u201cprevailing and \nparamount consideration\u201d had never been Ava\u2019s \u201cneed \nfor instruction,\u201d but rather its own desire \u201cto \n\n16 \n \n \nsafeguard the ordinary end-of-the-workday departure \ntimes for its faculty and staff.\u201d  JA468, 471-72, 475.   \nThe ALJ accordingly ordered the District to \n\u201crevise\u201d Ava\u2019s IEP to include evening instruction and \nother services.  JA476-77.  In so doing, the ALJ \nrejected the District\u2019s proposal of providing a mere \nthree hours of daily instructional time and instead \ndirected the District to provide 5.75 hours, which is \nwhat Ava had received in Kentucky.  JA444, 473-78.  \nThe ALJ also ordered \u201c495 hours of compensatory \neducational instruction,\u201d limiting relief to what the \nALJ believed was the proper two-year \u201climitations \nperiod\u201d under the IDEA.  JA474, 477.6 \n2. The parties then proceeded to federal court.  \nThe District challenged the ALJ\u2019s IDEA ruling.  For \nher part, Ava sued the District under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.   \nAva\u2019s lawsuit under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct sought an injunction that would \u201cpermanently \nsecure [her] rights to a full school day.\u201d  JA21, 24-25; \nsee also JA496.  That injunction would also give her \n\u201cthe opportunity\u201d to participate in non-instructional \nservices \nthat \n\u201ctypical \nkids \nget,\u201d \nsuch \nas \nextracurricular \nactivities, \nwhere \nfeasible \nwith \nreasonable accommodations for her disability.  JA2, \n20-25, 27-28, 318; see also 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1414(d)(4) \n(permitting \nschool \nofficials \nto \nrevise \nIEPs \n\u201cperiodically\u201d).   \n \n6  The District continued to evade its obligations after the \nALJ\u2019s order.  For example, the District \u201cconsistently cancelled \ninstructional sessions,\u201d and its instructors were regularly \u201clate.\u201d  \nJA491.  The District also took six months to comply with the \nALJ\u2019s order to provide eye-gaze technology, Ava\u2019s \u201cmost efficient \nand versatile means of communication.\u201d  JA464, 491. \n\n17 \n \n \nIn \naddition, \nAva \nrequested \n\u201ccompensatory \ndamages\u201d for the entire duration of her mistreatment, \ninvoking the six-year limitations period governing \nADA and Rehabilitation Act claims brought in \nMinnesota.  JA2, 24, 28; see also Gaona v. Town & \nCountry \nCredit, \n324 \nF.3d \n1050, \n1054-56 \n(8th Cir. 2003) (noting absence of express statute of \nlimitations under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nand applying Minnesota\u2019s \u201csix-year limitations period \nfor personal injury actions\u201d); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(f)(3)(C) \n(establishing a two-year statute of limitations under \nthe IDEA).  Those damages included expenses that \nwould \u201cnot be fully reimbursed in the IDEA \nproceedings,\u201d such as costs of hiring outside \nspecialists to assist Ava with speech, walking, and \ntoileting.  JA23-24.   \nThe district court upheld Ava\u2019s victory on her \nIDEA claim before the ALJ.  See JA542-95.  The court \nagreed with the ALJ that \u201cthe District\u2019s shifting \nreasons for denying the in-home instruction [Ava] \nseeks to make up for the morning hours she is not in \nschool were never based on [Ava]\u2019s needs.\u201d  JA544.  \nRather, \u201cwhen there was a conflict between [Ava\u2019s] \nneed for instruction and the school\u2019s regular hours, \nthe regular hours of the faculty were always the \nprevailing consideration.\u201d  JA574.  The court \ncriticized the District\u2019s \u201csteadfast[] refusal\u201d to extend \nAva\u2019s school day, noting that \u201c[a]dministrative \nconvenience is not an excuse for impermissibly \nshortening the instructional time a disabled child \nreceives.\u201d  JA574-75. \nThe district court further noted the harm \nassociated with the District\u2019s unwillingness to provide \nAva a full day of instruction.  It emphasized that Ava \nhad \u201clost the capacity\u201d to \u201cuse a variety of signs that \n\n18 \n \n \nshe had used in Kentucky,\u201d to \u201cvoid on the toilet 50% \nof the time,\u201d and to \u201cinteract with peers by using \nassistive technology to initiate or return a greeting.\u201d  \nJA582-83.    \nThe court ultimately held that Ava \u201crequires more \nthan 4.25 hours of schooling a day to have an \neducational program\u201d that \u201cwill allow her to meet \nchallenging objectives.\u201d  JA595.  It thus agreed that \n\u201c[e]xtending [Ava\u2019s] instructional day until 6:00 pm \nand including compensatory hours of instruction\u201d was \n\u201cthe appropriate remedy\u201d under the IDEA.  Id.  \nAs to the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, however, \nthe district court granted summary judgment against \nAva and in favor of the District.  The court explained \nthat to prove a violation of those statutes under \nMonahan, Ava had to show that the District had acted \nwith \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.24a-\n25a; see Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171.  Applying \nMonahan\u2019s heightened standard, the district court \nconcluded that the District\u2019s actions \u201cdid not rise to \nth[at] level.\u201d  Pet.App.30a. \n3. In two published opinions by Judge Kobes \nissued \nin \nMarch \n2024, \nthe \nEighth \nCircuit \nunanimously affirmed both rulings.  See id. at \n49a-57a (IDEA decision); id. at 1a-5a (ADA and \nRehabilitation Act decision). \nIn the IDEA ruling, the Eighth Circuit agreed that \nAva had not received a FAPE based on \u201c[s]everal\u201d \nfacts.  Id. at 54a.  First, Ava had made \u201conly slight \nprogress in a few areas\u201d while in the District\u2019s care.  \nId.  Second, Ava \u201cregressed in toileting\u201d so drastically \nthat the District had \u201cremoved her toileting goal\u201d \naltogether, citing only a \u201clack of time in the short \nday\u2014not [a] lack of ability to improve.\u201d  Id. at \n\n19 \n \n \n55a-56a.  Third, \u201cexpert testimony\u201d confirmed that \nAva \u201cwould have made more progress\u201d with \u201cevening \ninstruction.\u201d  Id. at 56a-57a.  The court also sharply \ncriticized the District, emphasizing that its decisions \nhad \u201c[n]ever been grounded in [Ava]\u2019s individual \nneeds.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  \nDespite ruling for Ava on her IDEA claim, the \nEighth Circuit regretfully rejected her ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.  Like the district court, the \nEighth Circuit found itself \u201cconstrained\u201d by Monahan, \nwhich required Ava to establish \u201c\u2018bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u2019\u201d by the District.  Id. at 3a-4a (quoting \n687 F.2d at 1171).  The court recognized that Ava \n\u201cmay have established a genuine dispute about \nwhether \nthe \ndistrict \nwas \nnegligent \nor \neven \ndeliberately indifferent.\u201d  Id. at 3a.  \u201c[B]ut under \nMonahan,\u201d the court explained, \u201cthat\u2019s just not \nenough.\u201d  Id.  Because her case involved \u201c\u2018educational \nservices for disabled children,\u2019\u201d Ava had to \u201cprove that \nschool officials acted with \u2018either bad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u2019\u201d  Id.  The court held that Ava \u201cha[d] \nfailed to identify conduct clearing Monahan\u2019s bar\u201d\u2014\nand thus could not obtain any relief as a matter of law.  \nId. at 4a-5a.   \nNotably, the Eighth Circuit expressed deep \ndiscomfort with Monahan imposing \u201csuch a high bar \nfor claims based on educational services\u201d brought by \nchildren with disabilities.  Id. at 5a n.2.  The court \nemphasized that \u201cmuch less\u201d is required \u201cin other \ndisability-discrimination contexts.\u201d  Id.  In every \nother scenario, the court observed, \u201cno intent [is] \nrequired\u201d to establish liability and obtain injunctive \nrelief on a \u201cfailure-to-accommodate claim,\u201d while \n\u201cdamages\u201d \nclaims \nrequire \nonly \n\u201cdeliberate \nindifference.\u201d  Id.   \n\n20 \n \n \nThe Eighth Circuit conceded that Monahan\u2019s \ncarve-out for school-age children with disabilities \nlacks \u201cany anchor in statutory text.\u201d  Id.  Rather, \nMonahan had \u201cspeculated that Congress intended the \nIDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \nRehabilitation Act]\u2019s protections\u201d (and thus the \nADA\u2019s).  Id.  But the court pointed out that \u201cCongress \nrejected [that] premise\u201d in amendments to the EHA \nenacted \u201cjust a few years later.\u201d  Id. (citing \nHandicapped Children\u2019s Protection Act of 1986, Pub. \nL. No. 99-372, 100 Stat. 796 (codified at 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l))).  Despite those amendments, the Eighth \nCircuit lamented, Monahan\u2019s heightened standard \n\u201cspread like wildfire\u201d across other courts.  Id. \nThe Eighth Circuit concluded that Monahan has \n\u201cbeen questioned\u201d by courts and commentators alike.  \nId.  It declared that the decision stands as \u201ca lesson in \nwhy\u201d courts should not \u201c\u2018add provisions\u2019\u201d to \u201c\u2018federal \nstatute[s]\u2019\u201d that aren\u2019t there.  Id. (alteration in \noriginal) (quoting Alabama v. North Carolina, 560 \nU.S. 330, 352 (2010)).  Nevertheless, the court \nobserved that Monahan \u201cremains the law of [this] \ncircuit\u201d\u2014at least \u201cfor the time being.\u201d  Id. \n4.  In June 2024, the Eighth Circuit denied Ava\u2019s \npetition for rehearing en banc.  Id. at 44a-45a.  Judges \nGrasz, Stras, and Kobes dissented, noting that they \nwould grant the petition.  Id. at 44a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nIn Monahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 \n(8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth Circuit invented a rule \nstating that, unlike all other ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct plaintiffs, children with disabilities seeking relief \nfor education-related discrimination must prove \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d to establish a statutory \n\n21 \n \n \nviolation. Id. at 1170-71.  Monahan is wrong.  The \nADA and Rehabilitation Act require courts to apply \nthe same legal standards to all plaintiffs, including \nchildren with disabilities bringing claims arising in \nthe educational setting.  \nA.  Nothing in the ADA or Rehabilitation Act \nremotely suggests that those statutes apply different \nlegal standards to different categories of plaintiffs.  \nThe statutes\u2019 substantive prohibitions establish \nuniform, \nacross-the-board \nprotections \nagainst \ndisability discrimination.  See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132; \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  And their remedial provisions \nstate that \u201cany person\u201d who suffers disability \ndiscrimination may obtain the same relief\u2014without \nexceptions or limitations for school-age children or \nanyone else.  See 42 U.S.C \u00a7 12133; 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).   \n \nBy reading the same operative language in the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act to establish a different \nstandard in this single factual context, Monahan \nengaged \nin \nnothing \nless \nthan \n\u201cinterpretive \ncontortion.\u201d  United States v. Santos, 553 U.S. 507, \n522 (2008).  This Court has firmly rejected the \n\u201cdangerous principle that judges can give the same \nstatutory text different meanings in different cases.\u201d  \nClark v. Martinez, 543 U.S. 371, 386 (2005).  So the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s plain text forecloses \nMonahan\u2019s bespoke standard uniquely disfavoring \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nvictimized \nby \ndiscrimination at school. \nB.  Monahan adopted its atextual rule because the \nEighth Circuit perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the \nIDEA and the Rehabilitation Act, so as to \u201cgive each \nof these statutes the full play intended by Congress.\u201d  \n687 F.2d at 1170-71.  That reasoning violates \n\n22 \n \n \nCongress\u2019s later unambiguous command in 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l) that \u201c[n]othing in [the IDEA] shall be \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, procedures, \nand remedies available\u201d to children with disabilities \nunder the ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and other federal \nlaws.  Construing the IDEA to restrict the relief \navailable to school-age children with disabilities \nunder other statutes is exactly what Section 1415(l) \nforbids. \nC.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s history and \npurposes confirm that Monahan is deeply misguided.  \nCongress enacted these laws to protect \u201call disabled \nindividuals\u201d\u2014equally.  135 Cong. Rec. 19895 (Sept. 7, \n1989) (Statement of Sen. Joe Lieberman) (emphasis \nadded); see, e.g., 119 Cong. Rec. 29632 (Sept. 13, \n1973).  And Congress recognized that disability \ndiscrimination is \u201cmost often the product, not of \ninvidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness and \nindifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Alexander v. Choate, \n469 U.S. 287, 295 (1985).   \nGiven those legislative goals, it is clear that the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act do not treat school-age \nchildren with disabilities worse than other plaintiffs.  \nAnd the statutes were not meant to condition \nliability\u2014for anyone\u2014on a showing of outright \nanimus or severe misconduct.  Monahan was plainly \nwrong to require children to prove \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d to prove disability discrimination, \nparticularly given their special vulnerabilities and \nthe acute risks of lifelong harms in the educational \ncontext. \nD.  Monahan\u2019s rule is unfair and leads to bizarre \nresults.  Its additional barrier to relief senselessly \ndisadvantages vulnerable children like Ava by \nmaking it harder for them to prove ADA and \n\n23 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act claims.  In doing so, Monahan \nundermines incentives for schools to comply with \ntheir statutory obligations in the first place.  And \ndespite \nseverely \ndisadvantaging \nprimary \nand \nsecondary \nstudents \nin \nthis \nway, \nMonahan \ninexplicably excuses from its heightened standard \ncollege students bringing education-related claims for \ndisability discrimination.  That disparate treatment \nmakes no sense. \nE.  At its core, Monahan\u2019s asymmetric standard is \nbased on flawed policy, not law.  Monahan purported \nto seek \u201ca proper balance between the rights of \nhandicapped children, the responsibilities of state \neducational officials, and the competence of courts to \nmake judgments in technical fields.\u201d  687 F.2d at \n1171.  But Congress itself struck that proper balance \nby granting broad relief to all plaintiffs under the \nuniform standards set forth in the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  In any event, Monahan\u2019s policy \nconcerns are themselves misguided:  There is no \nsound basis for singling out school-age children with \ndisabilities for disfavored treatment under those \nstatutes.   \nARGUMENT \nMONAHAN\u2019S ATEXTUAL AND ASYMMETRIC \nRULE SHOULD BE REJECTED \nForty-three years ago, in Monahan v. Nebraska, \n687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), the Eighth Circuit \noffered this \u201cguidance\u201d to lower courts:  Before a \nRehabilitation Act \u201cviolation can be made out\u201d in \u201cthe \ncontext of education of handicapped children,\u201d the \nplaintiff must show that the defendant acted with \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 1170-71.  \nMonahan is wrong.  Courts must apply the same legal \n\n24 \n \n \nstandards to all claims brought under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act, regardless of who the plaintiff is \nor how her claims arose. \nA. The Statutory Text Establishes Uniform \nRules Governing All Claims  \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision below correctly \nrecognized that Monahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial gloss\u201d on the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act is \u201cwithout any anchor in \nstatutory text.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s substantive prohibitions and \nremedial provisions offer \u201cno indication that Congress \nintended\u201d for the legal standard a plaintiff must \nsatisfy \u201cto turn on the type of [claim] being [brought].\u201d  \nAli v. Fed. Bureau of Prisons, 552 U.S. 214, 220-21 \n(2008).  Rather, they establish uniform standards \nthat courts must apply even-handedly\u2014to everyone.  \nSo the baseline rules that govern in all other ADA and \nRehabilitation Act cases must govern claims brought \nby \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \nchallenging \ndiscrimination at school. \n1.  The ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s substantive \nprohibitions create a single standard governing all \nclaims brought under each statute.  Section 202 of the \nADA provides that \u201cno qualified individual with a \ndisability shall, by reason of such disability, be \nexcluded from participation in or be denied the \nbenefits of the services, programs, or activities of a \npublic entity, or be subjected to discrimination by any \nsuch entity.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  Section 504 of the \nRehabilitation Act establishes a materially identical \nprohibition for recipients of federal funding.  See 29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).   \nThese expansive prohibitions forbid not just \nactions motivated by \u201cinvidious animus\u201d or other \n\n25 \n \n \negregious misconduct toward people with disabilities, \nbut \nalso \nconduct \nstemming \nfrom \nmere \n\u201cthoughtlessness and indifference\u201d toward their \nunique needs.  Alexander v. Choate, 469 U.S. 287, 295 \n(1985) \n(addressing \nRehabilitation \nAct). \n \nThe \nprovisions \naccordingly \nrequire \n\u201creasonable \naccommodations\u201d in order \u201cto assure meaningful \naccess\u201d to public or federally funded services, \nprograms, and activities to which \u201cotherwise qualified \nhandicapped individuals\u201d are \u201centitled.\u201d  Id. at 301.  \nFailure to provide such accommodations violates both \nstatutes.  See Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., 580 U.S. \n154, 170 (2017); supra at 7.  And contrary to \nMonahan, nothing in either law remotely suggests \nthat \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d must be \nshown\u2014by anyone\u2014before a statutory \u201cviolation\u201d can \nbe \u201cmade out.\u201d  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  \nThe text of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nprohibitions gives no hint that education-related \nclaims brought by children with disabilities should be \ntreated differently from all other claims seeking relief \nunder the same operative provision.  And this Court \nhas firmly rejected the \u201cdangerous principle that \njudges can give the same statutory text different \nmeanings in different cases.\u201d  Clark v. Martinez, 543 \nU.S. 371, 386 (2005).  The \u201csame word[s]\u201d in the \u201csame \nstatutory provisions\u201d must have the same meaning, \neven \u201cin different factual contexts.\u201d  United States v. \nSantos, 553 U.S. 507, 522 (2008) (emphasis omitted). \nBy reading the same operative language to \nestablish \na \ndifferent \nstandard \nin \njust \none \ncircumstance, Monahan engaged in nothing less than \n\u201cinterpretive contortion.\u201d  Id.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act are not \u201cchameleon[s].\u201d  Id. \n(quoting Clark, 543 U.S at 382).  Their meaning \n\n26 \n \n \n\u201ccannot change\u201d whenever a child with disabilities \nalleges discrimination at the hands of school officials.  \nId.  Accordingly, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nacross-the-board prohibitions apply equally in all \ncases seeking relief under these statutes, no matter a \nplaintiff\u2019s age, the nature of her disability, or whether \nshe suffered discrimination in a school setting. \n2.  The statutes\u2019 remedial provisions reinforce that \nall plaintiffs must be treated equally.  Section 203 of \nthe ADA states that \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and \nrights set forth in\u201d the Rehabilitation Act \u201cshall be the \nremedies, procedures, and rights\u201d that the ADA \n\u201cprovides to any person alleging discrimination on the \nbasis of disability in violation of [the ADA].\u201d  42 U.S.C \n\u00a7 12133 (emphasis added).  And Section 505 of the \nRehabilitation Act, in turn, provides that \u201c[t]he \nremedies, procedures, and rights set forth in \n[T]itle VI\u201d are \u201cavailable to any person aggrieved\u201d by \ndisability discrimination under the Rehabilitation \nAct.  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2) (emphasis added).  \n\u201cAny person\u201d means just that\u2014any person.  This \nlanguage requires equal treatment of all ADA and \nRehabilitation Act plaintiffs.  It leaves no room for \nexceptions or special rules making it more difficult for \ncertain classes of plaintiffs to prove their claims.  \n\u201cWhen used (as here) with a \u2018singular noun in \naffirmative contexts,\u2019 the word \u2018any\u2019 ordinarily \n\u2018refer[s] to a member of a particular group or class \nwithout distinction or limitation\u2019 and in this way \n\u2018impl[ies] every member of the class or group.\u2019\u201d  SAS \nInst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 363 (2018) \n(alterations in original) (quoting Oxford English \nDictionary (3d ed. 2016)).   \nMonahan thus had no textual basis \u201cto restrict the \nunqualified language\u201d of the ADA and Rehabilitation \n\n27 \n \n \nAct\u2019s remedial provisions by making it more difficult \nfor children with disabilities to prove discrimination \nin the educational context.  Brogan v. United States, \n522 U.S. 398, 403 (1998); accord Pet.App.5a n.2; Mark \nC. Weber, Accidently on Purpose: Intent in Disability \nDiscrimination Law, 56 B.C. L. Rev. 1417, 1455-61 \n(2015); Thomas Simmons, The ADA Prima Facie \nPlaintiff: A Critical Overview of Eighth Circuit Case \nLaw, 47 Drake L. Rev. 761, 822-23 & nn.370-71 \n(1999).  Like the statutes\u2019 substantive prohibitions, \nthe remedial provisions expressly incorporating \nTitle VI\u2019s rights and remedies apply equally to victims \nof disability discrimination \u201cof whatever kind.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Gonzales, 520 U.S. 1, 5 (1997).   \nAs for Title VI itself, that landmark civil-rights \nlaw likewise demands evenhanded enforcement.  \nTitle VI provides that \u201c[n]o person in the United \nStates shall, on the ground of race, color, or national \norigin, be excluded from participation in, be denied \nthe benefits of, or be subjected to discrimination \nunder any program or activity receiving Federal \nfinancial assistance.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000d.  This Court\u2019s \n\u201cprior decisions have found an implied right of action\u201d \nfor anyone who suffers such discrimination under \nTitle VI, which \u201cCongress has acknowledged\u201d in \nsubsequent \u201camendments to the statute.\u201d  Barnes v. \nGorman, 536 U.S. 181, 185 (2002). \nTitle \nVI\u2019s \nacross-the-board \nban \non \nracial \ndiscrimination supplies no basis for imposing a \nuniquely stringent standard on any class of plaintiffs, \nlet alone school-age children.  And no Title VI case has \never adopted a Monahan-like \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d rule for establishing a statutory \nviolation or obtaining any form of relief in the school \nsetting.  See Alexander v. Sandoval, 532 U.S. 275, \n\n28 \n \n \n279-80 (2001) (noting that \u201cboth injunctive relief and \ndamages\u201d are available under Title VI).  It follows \nthat courts \u201ccannot curate\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct claims and treat some differently from others.  \nSAS Inst., 584 U.S. at 359-60.  Rather, courts \u201cmust \ndecide them all\u201d under the same legal standards.  Id.   \n3.  This is not the only case this Term where the \nCourt will address whether to impose a more \nstringent\u2014and non-textual\u2014legal standard on only a \nsubset of anti-discrimination plaintiffs under the \nsame statute.  In Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth \nServices, No. 23-1039, the Sixth Circuit held that \nTitle VII plaintiffs who are members of a majority \ngroup\u2014but not members of minority groups\u2014must \nsatisfy not only \u201cthe usual [requirements] for \nestablishing a prima-facie case\u201d of discrimination, but \nalso \nan \nadditional \nrequirement \nof \nshowing \n\u201c\u2018background circumstances to support the suspicion \nthat the defendant is that unusual employer who \ndiscriminates against the majority.\u2019\u201d  Ames v. Ohio \nDep\u2019t of Youth Servs., 87 F.4th 822, 825 (6th Cir. \n2023).  This Court granted certiorari to decide \nwhether that extra requirement is correct.   \nNotably, \nthe \nAmes \nrespondent \nhas \nnow \nabandoned the Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule and conceded that \n\u201cthe same legal standard applies to all Title VII \nplaintiffs,\u201d  Ames Resp. Br. 1, and that \u201cit is wrong to \nhold some litigants to a higher standard\u201d than others,  \nAmes Oral Argument Tr. 39.  Both parties in Ames, \nalong with the United States, are thus \u201cin radical \nagreement\u201d that Title VII \u201capplies the same to \neverybody,\u201d no matter who they are or the nature of \ntheir discrimination claim.  Ames Oral Arg. Tr. 39; \nAmes U.S. Amicus Br. 11-31.  This Court seems \nsimilarly inclined.  See Ames Oral Arg. Tr. 43-45, \n\n29 \n \n \n49-51, 54-56, 58-60.  The same even-handed approach \nshould govern the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, too. \n4.  Neither the ADA nor the Rehabilitation Act \nexpressly sets forth an intent requirement for proving \na statutory violation or for obtaining particular kinds \nof relief.  And while this Court has not squarely \naddressed the issue, the lower courts generally agree \non the baseline standards governing ADA and \nRehabilitation Act claims.   \nOutside the educational context, the courts of \nappeals uniformly hold that plaintiffs can show a \nviolation of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2014and by \nextension, establish eligibility for injunctive relief\u2014if \nthey prove that the defendant failed to provide a \nreasonable accommodation to a covered person with a \ndisability.  Supra at 8-9 & n.1.  No showing of \nwrongful intent is required.  Id.   \nFor damages, though, virtually all courts have \nheld that plaintiffs outside the educational setting \nmust prove a form of wrongful intent, consistent with \nthis Court\u2019s case interpreting Title VI.  Supra at 9; \nsee also Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 282-83 (requiring \nwrongful intent for damages claims under Title VI).  \nThe overwhelming majority have held that plaintiffs \nmay satisfy this intent requirement by proving that \nthe defendant acted with deliberate indifference\u2014i.e., \nignored a \u201cstrong likelihood\u201d that its conduct would \n\u201cresult in a violation of federally protected rights.\u201d  \nMeagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 F.3d 384, 389 \n(8th Cir. 2011); see also supra at 10 & n.2; Gebser v. \nLago Vista Indep. Sch. Dist., 524 U.S. 274, 290 (1998) \n(holding that deliberate indifference is sufficient to \nshow such intent under Title IX, which was likewise \n\u201cmodeled after Title VI\u201d); Barnes, 536 U.S. at 185-89 \n(looking to Title IX precedent in determining the \n\n30 \n \n \nscope of private damages remedies available under \nthe ADA, Rehabilitation Act, and Title VI). \n \nFor the reasons explained above, the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct \nsubject \nall \ndiscrimination \nplaintiffs to the same legal standards.  As the United \nStates has noted, \u201cwhere courts have interpreted\u201d the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act \u201cto require proof of \ncertain elements for claims outside of the school \ncontext, they must do the same with claims in the \nschool context.\u201d  Suppl.Br.Add.11a (filed Oct. 7, 2024).  \nSo whichever baseline legal standards apply under \nthese statutes in other contexts must apply in this one \ntoo.  There is no textual basis for disfavoring children \nwith \ndisabilities \nwho \nsuffer \neducation-related \ndiscrimination.7 \nB. Monahan Violates Section 1415(l) \n \nMonahan justified its atextual rule primarily by \n\u201cspeculat[ing] that Congress intended the IDEA\u2019s \npredecessor\u201d \nstatute\u2014the \nEHA\u2014\u201cto \nlimit \n[the \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s] protections.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  \nTwo years later, Congress refuted that reasoning by \nproviding that \u201c[n]othing\u201d in the IDEA \u201crestrict[s] or \nlimit[s]\u201d relief available under the ADA and \n \n7  Ava\u2019s question presented focuses only on whether \nchildren with disabilities bringing education-related claims \nshould be subject to a heightened, context-specific standard for \nproving violations of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Supra \nat i.  It does not ask the Court to decide what standard should \nuniformly govern all claims.  That said, the courts of appeals are \nclearly correct that intentional discrimination is not required to \nestablish a violation of either statute, especially when the claim \nalleges that the defendant failed to provide a reasonable \naccommodation.  Supra at 8-9 & n.1. \n\n31 \n \n \nRehabilitation Act.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  Monahan \ndirectly violates Section 1415(l)\u2019s command.   \n1.  Monahan perceived a need to \u201charmonize\u201d the \nEHA (now the IDEA) and Rehabilitation Act and \nprevent the latter from becoming a cause of action \u201cfor \neducational malpractice\u201d that would supplant the \nEHA.  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  In other words, Monahan \nconstrued the EHA as an implicit constraint on \nRehabilitation Act claims brought in the school \nsetting\u2014one limiting liability and restricting relief to \nrare cases where children with disabilities can prove \n\u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d by school officials.  \nId.  According to Monahan, this step was needed to \n\u201cgive each of these statutes the full play intended by \nCongress.\u201d  Id. at 1171.   \nTwo years after Monahan was decided, this Court \nembraced a version of Monahan\u2019s logic.  In Smith v. \nRobinson, 468 U.S. 992 (1984), the Court held that the \nEHA provided the \u201cexclusive avenue\u201d for children \nwith disabilities to bring discrimination claims \nrelated to their education.  Id. at 1009 (emphasis \nadded).  The Court reasoned that the EHA establishes \n\u201ca comprehensive scheme\u201d that focused directly on \n\u201cpublic education for handicapped children.\u201d  Id.  \nBecause \nthat \nscheme \ngives \n\u201clocal \nand \nstate \neducational agencies the primary responsibility for \ndeveloping a plan to accommodate the needs of each \nindividual handicapped child,\u201d the Court found it \n\u201cdifficult to believe that Congress also meant to leave \nundisturbed the ability of a handicapped child\u201d to \nassert other \u201cvirtually identical\u201d causes of action.  Id. \nat 1009, 1011.  Smith thus decreed that the EHA did \nnot just limit Rehabilitation Act relief for school-age \nchildren \nwith \ndisabilities \n(as \nMonahan \nhad \n\n32 \n \n \nconcluded), but fully displaced that statute in the \nschool setting. \nCongress swiftly repudiated Smith\u2019s reasoning\u2014\nand with it, Monahan\u2019s as well.  In 1986, Congress \namended the EHA (now the IDEA) to \u201c\u2018reaffirm[] the \nviability\u2019 of federal statutes like the ADA [and \nRehabilitation Act] \u2018as separate vehicles,\u2019 no less \nintegral than the IDEA, \u2018for ensuring the rights of \nhandicapped children.\u2019\u201d  Fry, 580 U.S. at 161 (quoting \nH.R. Rep. No. 99-296, at 4, 6 (1985)); see also S. Rep. \nNo. 99-112, at 2 (1985).  Now codified at 20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(l), this IDEA amendment provides in relevant \npart: \nNothing \nin \n[the \nIDEA] \nshall \nbe \nconstrued to restrict or limit the rights, \nprocedures, and remedies available \nunder the Constitution, the [ADA], \n[Rehabilitation Act], or other Federal \nlaws protecting the rights of children \nwith disabilities . . . .   \n20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); see also Handicapped Children\u2019s \nProtection Act of 1986, Pub. L. No. 99-372, \u00a7 3, 100 \nStat. 796, 797 (HCPA).   \nCongress thus expressly established a rule of \nconstruction under which the IDEA cannot be \ninterpreted to \u201crestrict or limit\u201d the ability of children \nwith disabilities to obtain relief under the ADA or \nRehabilitation Act.  Id.  In doing so, Congress made \nclear that while these various statutes \u201coverlap\u201d in \nsome respects, they are different in important ways \nand retain full independent force.  Fry, 580 U.S. \nat 171.  \u201cThe IDEA offers federal funds to States in \nexchange for a commitment: to furnish a \u2018free \nappropriate public education\u2019\u201d to \u201call children with \n\n33 \n \n \ncertain physical or intellectual disabilities.\u201d  Id. at \n158.  By contrast, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \neach \nguarantee \n\u201cnon-discriminatory \naccess \nto\u201d \neducational services for children with disabilities, as \ncompared to their non-disabled peers.  Id. at 170-71.  \nSection 1415(l) establishes that the latter guarantee \ncoexists with, and cannot be subordinated to, the \nformer. \nSection 1415(l)\u2019s drafters repeatedly emphasized \nwhat the text makes clear.  One HCPA co-sponsor, for \nexample, declared that the IDEA was never \u201cintended \nto \nin \nany \nway \nlimit \nhandicapped \nchildren\u2019s \neducational rights or the remedies for protecting \nthose rights.\u201d  131 Cong. Rec. 21391 (July 30, 1985) \n(statement of Sen. Ted Kennedy) (emphasis added).  \nAnother explained that Section 1415(l) commands \nthat the IDEA must be interpreted to \u201cenhance\u201d the \nremedies available to children with disabilities \n\u201cunder other laws\u201d\u2014not to \u201climit[]\u201d or \u201creplace\u201d them.  \nId. at 21392 (statement of Sen. Paul Simon).  And the \nreport from the House Committee on Education and \nLabor reiterated that the IDEA may not \u201cbe construed \nto modify traditional standards used by the courts for \ndetermining\u201d when relief \u201cis appropriate\u201d under the \nRehabilitation Act and other federal laws (such as the \nlater-enacted ADA).  H.R. Rep. No. 99-296, at 7.  \nThese sources confirm the statutory text\u2019s plain \nmeaning. \n2.  Monahan violates Section 1415(l)\u2019s directive.  \nMonahan held that the IDEA (formerly the EHA) \nrequires interpreting the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nto require children with disabilities to show bad faith \nor gross misjudgment to prevail on education-related \ndiscrimination claims.  687 F.2d at 1170-71.  That is, \nMonahan interpreted the IDEA to \u201crestrict\u201d and \n\n34 \n \n \n\u201climit\u201d the \u201crights\u201d and \u201cremedies\u201d available to \nchildren like Ava under the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct by requiring them to satisfy a more stringent \nstandard than anyone else suing under these \nstatutes.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  That is precisely what \nSection 1415(l) forbids.  See Howell ex rel. Howell v. \nWaterford Pub. Schs., 731 F. Supp. 1314, 1318 (E.D. \nMich. 1990) (criticizing Monahan for violating Section \n1415(l)). \nThe \nDistrict \nresisted \nthis \nstraightforward \nconclusion in its brief opposing certiorari.  There, the \nDistrict asserted that Section 1415(l) \u201coverruled \nSmith\u201d\u2014\u201cnot Monahan\u201d\u2014and did not \u201copine on the \nstandard governing\u201d ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims.  BIO31.  That misses the point.  Congress \nundoubtedly sought to reject Smith, but Smith and \nMonahan both adopted the same flawed view that the \nIDEA implicitly restricts the scope of other federal \nanti-discrimination statutes, as applied to children \nwith disabilities suffering from discrimination in the \neducational context.   \nWhatever particular precedent Congress had in \nmind, Section 1415(l)\u2019s text flatly prohibits Monahan\u2019s \nconstruction of the IDEA to limit relief available \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  So even \nthough Section 1415(l) does not set forth legal \nstandards governing ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims, it still squarely \u201creject[s] Monahan\u2019s premise\u201d \nthat the IDEA requires a uniquely stringent standard \nfor ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims, as the Eighth \nCircuit recognized in its decision below.  Pet.App.5a \nn.2.  Section 1415(l) leaves no doubt that Monahan\u2019s \natextual and asymmetric rule is wrong. \n\n35 \n \n \nC. Monahan Undermines The Core Goals Of \nThe ADA And Rehabilitation Act \nMonahan\u2019s judicially invented rule requiring only \nschool-age children with disabilities to prove bad faith \nor gross misjudgment violates the central purpose of \nboth the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.  Congress \nenacted those statutes to protect all Americans living \nwith disabilities from discrimination.  Nothing \nsuggests that Congress wanted to diminish the extent \nof that protection for anyone with a disability\u2014let \nalone for school-age children, who are perhaps the \nmost vulnerable subset of such people.  And because \nboth statutes were designed to remedy passive \nneglect, it is clear Congress did not intend to limit \nrelief solely to cases involving outright animus or \negregious misconduct for any class of plaintiffs. \n1.  The goal of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nwas, as Senator Ted Kennedy explained, \u201cnothing less \nthan to give every disabled American a fair share of \nthe American Dream.\u201d  Americans With Disabilities \nAct of 1989: Hearing on S. 933 Before the Subcomm. \non the Handicapped of the S. Comm. On Labor & \nHum. Res., 101st Cong. 223 (1989) (emphasis added) \n(discussing ADA).  The legislative history of both \nstatutes confirms Congress\u2019s desire to promote equal \ntreatment of all Americans with disabilities, across \nthe board. \nFor example, in enacting the Rehabilitation Act, \nSenator Alan Cranston described Congress\u2019s goal as \nprotecting all of the \u201c9.8 million handicapped persons\u201d \nthen living in the United States.  119 Cong. Rec. at \n29631-32; see also S. Rep. No. 93-391, at 45 (1973) \n(observing that the statute prohibits the denial of \nservices to \u201cany handicapped individual\u201d based on the \nindividual\u2019s disability).  And later, when Congress \n\n36 \n \n \namended the Act to codify a private right of action, \nSenator Cranston emphasized that the statute was \nmeant to \u201cto remedy violations of [S]ection 504\u2014with \nno exception.\u201d  132 Cong. Rec. S15104 (Oct. 3, 1986) \n(emphasis added).  Other legislators reiterated that, \n\u201c[s]ince initial passage of this law, Congress has\u201d \nsought to protect \u201cthe quality of life for all \nhandicapped persons.\u201d  132 Cong. Rec. 28090 (Oct. 2, \n1986) (statement of Representative Mario Biaggi, \nco-sponsor of 1986 amendments) (emphasis added); \nsee also 131 Cong. Rec. at 21391 (statement of Sen. \nJohn Kerry, another co-sponsor) (similar). \nSo too for the ADA.  Representative Tony Coelho\u2014\nwho sponsored the legislation and, like Ava, suffers \nfrom epilepsy\u2014observed that the statute would also \nprotect \n\u201c[e]very \nAmerican,\u201d \nwithout \nexception.  \nAmericans With Disabilities Act of 1988: Joint \nHearing on S. 2345 Before the Subcomm. on the \nHandicapped of the S. Comm. on Labor & Hum. \nResources & the Subcomm. on Select Educ. of the H. \nComm. on Educ. & Labor, 100th Cong. 938 (1988).  \nHis colleagues agreed that the ADA was meant to \n\u201cbring equality to the lives of all Americans with \ndisabilities.\u201d  136 Cong. Rec. 17376 (July 13, 1990) \n(statement of Senator Bob Dole, an ADA sponsor) \n(emphasis added); see, e.g., 135 Cong. Rec. 19895 \n(Sept. 7, 1989) (statement of Senator Warren \nRudman, another ADA sponsor, observing that the \nADA\u2019s \nprotections \n\u201cextend \nto \nall \ndisabled \nindividuals\u201d).   \n \nGiven these statements, it boggles the mind to \nthink that Congress wanted these important \nanti-discrimination statutes to disfavor certain \nclasses of plaintiffs with disabilities by requiring \nthem to satisfy a more stringent test than anyone \n\n37 \n \n \nelse.  Children with disabilities are among the most \nvulnerable members of our society.  Too often, they \nare \u201cshunted aside, hidden, and ignored\u201d while at \nschool.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 295-96 (quoting 117 Cong. \nRec. 45974 (Dec. 9, 1971)).  Such discrimination in the \neducational context can inflict severe, life-altering \nharm.  See, e.g., Perez v. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. \n142, 145 (2023) (school district denied deaf student a \nqualified \naide \nfor \ntwelve \nyears, \ndrastically \ndiminishing his ability to communicate with others \nand earn a living). \n \nWhen such discrimination happens, the ADA and \nRehabilitation \nAct \nprovide \ncrucial \nmeans \nof \n\u201cprotecting [victims\u2019] interests,\u201d just as those statutes \nassist other plaintiffs facing disability discrimination \nin other contexts.  Fry, 580 U.S. at 159.  There is no \nreason to think that the ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nsaddle children with disabilities\u2014and nobody else\u2014\nwith \u201can impossibly high bar\u201d for proving a statutory \nviolation.  Knox County v. M.Q., 62 F.4th 978, 1002 \n(6th Cir. 2023); see also Pet.App.5a n.2.  The ADA and \nRehabilitation Act were meant to ensure equality, \nand their guarantees apply equally. \n \n2.  Even clearer is that Congress never wanted \ncourts to impose an intent requirement for liability on \nanyone suing under the ADA and Rehabilitation Act, \nespecially for failure to accommodate a disability.   \n \n\u201cDiscrimination against the handicapped was \nperceived by Congress to be most often the product, \nnot of invidious animus, but rather of thoughtlessness \nand indifference\u2014of benign neglect.\u201d  Choate, 469 \nU.S. at 295.  Congress thus enacted the Rehabilitation \nAct to remedy \u201cshameful oversights\u201d and \u201cthe \ninvisibility of the handicapped in America.\u201d  Id. \nat 295-96 (first quoting 117 Cong. Rec. 45974 \n\n38 \n \n \n(Dec. 9, 1971); and then quoting, 118 Cong. Rec. \n525-26 (Jan. 20, 1972)).  The ADA was likewise \nenacted \nto \naddress \nhow \n\u201csociety \nhas \nbeen \ninadvertently structured in a way that unnecessarily \ndenies innumerable opportunities, great and small, to \npeople with disabilities.\u201d  Joint Hearing on S. 2345, \n100th Cong. at 941 (emphasis added).  The central \ngoal of these statutes, in other words, was to guard \nagainst \u201capathetic attitudes\u201d toward people with \ndisabilities.  Choate, 469 U.S. at 296.   \n \nMonahan\u2019s directive that a Rehabilitation Act \n\u201cviolation can be made out\u201d in the educational context \nonly by showing bad faith or gross misjudgment, 687 \nF.2d at 1171\u2014rather than mere \u201cbenign neglect,\u201d as \nrequired from all other plaintiffs, Choate, 469 U.S. at \n295\u2014defies that objective.  With Congress so \nunmistakably focused on the widespread passive \nneglect of people with disabilities, it is inconceivable \nthat the ADA and Rehabilitation Act excuse liability \nin any category of cases, just because the alleged \ndisability discrimination falls short of outright \nanimus or especially severe mistreatment.  So by \ngiving a free pass to actions driven by educational \nofficials\u2019 \u201capathetic attitudes,\u201d Monahan immunized \n\u201cmuch of the conduct that Congress sought to alter in \npassing the Rehabilitation Act,\u201d as well as the ADA.  \nId. at 296-97.  Monahan is at odds with the core \npurpose of both statutes. \nD. Monahan \nIs \nUnfair \nAnd \nLeads \nTo \nArbitrary Results \nMonahan singles out school-age children with \ndisabilities for disfavored treatment under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act.  Beside openly defying the \nstatutory \ntext \nand \npurpose, \nthis \nasymmetric \n\n39 \n \n \ntreatment is fundamentally unfair and leads to \nbizarre results. \n1.  Whereas Monahan establishes an exceedingly \n\u201chigh bar for claims based on educational services\u201d \nbrought by children with disabilities, courts \u201crequire \nmuch \nless \nin \nother \ndisability-discrimination \ncontexts.\u201d  Pet.App.5a n.2.  That disparity matters, as \nthis case illustrates.   \nIt is hard enough for parents to muster the \nresources needed to fight for their child\u2019s federally \nprotected rights while simultaneously trying to \nremediate life-altering educational gaps in the \nmeantime.  Yet Monahan\u2019s heightened standard lets \nschool districts off the hook even when they act with \ndeliberate \nindifference \nto \nstudents\u2019 \nfederally \nprotected rights.  That additional barrier makes it \nexceedingly difficult for children with disabilities to \nobtain much-needed relief under the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act.  It also blunts incentives for \nschools to fulfill their statutory responsibilities in the \nfirst place. \nHere, for example, Ava\u2019s parents spent years \nfighting for the District to give her the same \nreasonable accommodations that her prior school \ndistrict in Kentucky had provided without issue.  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  But over and over again, the \nDistrict refused, offering a series of \u201cshifting,\u201d \n\u201cpretextual,\u201d and \u201cnot credible\u201d explanations that had \nnothing to do with Ava\u2019s \u201cindividual needs.\u201d  Id. at \n50a, 57a; JA468, 471, 544; supra at 14-16.  Indeed, the \nDistrict\u2019s own Director of Student Services appeared \nunaware of the District\u2019s obligations under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act:  She repeatedly insisted\u2014\nincorrectly\u2014that providing a FAPE under the IDEA \nsatisfied the District\u2019s non-discrimination obligations \n\n40 \n \n \nunder these other statutes.  JA190 (rejecting notion \nthat \u201ca school district [can] provide a FAPE under \nIDEA and still discriminate on the basis of \ndisability\u201d); see also JA191-96, 208-09, 216-18, 240. \nBelow, the Eighth Circuit acknowledged the \nconsiderable evidence showing that the District had \nbeen \u201cnegligent or even deliberately indifferent\u201d in \ndenying \nthe \nreasonable \naccommodations \nshe \ndesperately needed.  Pet.App.3a.  The court also \npointedly criticized the District\u2019s deliberate \u201cchoice to \nprioritize its administrative concerns\u201d over Ava\u2019s \n\u201cindividual needs,\u201d while giving \u201ca series of shifting \nexplanations\u201d for failing to meet them.  Id. at 57a; see \nCA8 Appellant\u2019s Br.4-17, 50-55.  All this should have \nbeen more than sufficient for Ava to survive summary \njudgment and obtain both injunctive relief and \ndamages.  Pet.App.5a n.2.  \u201c[B]ut under Monahan, \n[i]t\u2019s just not enough.\u201d  Id. at 3a. \n2.  Ava\u2019s experience is all too common.  A Westlaw \nsearch reveals hundreds of district court decisions \napplying Monahan\u2019s bad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment \nstandard in ADA and Rehabilitation Act cases, with \nthe overwhelming majority denying relief.8  Many \n \n8  See, e.g., Parnes v. Orange Cnty. Sch. Bd., 2024 WL \n4290383, at *4-6 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 25, 2024); S.F. v. Union Cnty. \nBd. of Educ., 2024 WL 1316229, at *3-4 (W.D.N.C. Mar. 27, \n2024); Torres v. Stewart Cnty. Sch.

In Reid-Witt ex rel. C.W. \nv. District of Columbia, 486 F. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. \n2020), school officials refused to provide urgently \nneeded at-home instruction, even after a child \nsuffering from severe anxiety and depression \nexperienced \n\u201csuicidal \nideation \nthat \nrequired \nhospitalization.\u201d  Id. at 3-4.  The school baselessly \ninsisted that the child was \u201cineligible for special-\neducation services.\u201d  Id. at 4.  Yet the district court \ndenied relief, finding that the plaintiff could not \nsatisfy the \u201ctougher\u201d and \u201cmore stringent\u201d bad-faith-\nor-gross-misjudgment \nstandard, \nwhich \ncan \nbe \nsatisfied \u201c\u2018[o]nly in the rarest of cases.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 8-9 \n(quoting Walker v. District of Columbia, 157 F. Supp. \n2d 11, 36 (D.D.C. 2001)).  Because school officials were \nnot \u201ccompletely indifferent\u201d to the child\u2019s disability, \nthe court concluded, her ADA and Rehabilitation Act \nclaims failed as a matter of law.  Id. at 9; see also N.G. \nv. District of Columbia, 556 F. Supp. 2d 11, 18-21, 36 \n(D.D.C. 2008) (similar).   \n \n(W.D. Ark.

June 2, 2016). \n\n42 \n \n \nAnother example is D.A. v. Houston Independent \nSchool District, 716 F. Supp. 2d 603 (S.D. Tex. 2009), \nwhich involved school officials\u2019 years-long \u201cfailure to \ntest\u201d a young child for learning disabilities\u2014even \nthough he \u201cwas the lowest performing child\u201d in the \nfirst grade and had exhibited \u201c\u2018extreme behavior,\u201d \nsuch as \u201cfighting\u201d and \u201chav[ing] outbursts.\u201d  Id. at \n606-07.  School officials also ignored an independent \nexpert who warned\u2014in writing\u2014that the child was \n\u201cin desperate need of intervention.\u201d  Id. at 608.  And \nthe child reported \u201cbeing dragged around,\u201d \u201cput in a \ncloset,\u201d and called \u201ca lazy monkey\u201d by school staff.  Id.  \nNevertheless, the district court denied relief under \nMonahan, id. at 620, in a decision that the Fifth \nCircuit unanimously affirmed, D.A. ex rel. Latasha A. \nv. Houston Indep. Sch. Dist., 629 F.3d 450, 454-55 \n(5th Cir. 2010). \nOr take I.A. v. Seguin Independent School District, \n881 F. Supp. 2d 770 (W.D. Tex. 2012), where a school \nrepeatedly excluded a paralyzed student from \nextracurricular \nactivities\u2014including \nfield \ntrips, \nswimming classes, and band concerts\u2014despite \nobvious and readily available accommodations for his \ndisability.  See id. at 774-75.  The school also failed to \nprovide \nsuitable \n\u201cdesks\u201d \nand \n\u201can \naccessible \nbathroom,\u201d while failing to fix \u201cdangerous\u201d walkways \nto various facilities, despite the child falling multiple \ntimes.  Id. at 778.  There too, the court rejected the \nstudent\u2019s ADA and Rehabilitation Act claims under \nMonahan, reasoning that \u201c[a]lthough mistakes may \nhave been made, they d[id] not rise to the level of bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.\u201d  Id. at 784.   \nThese cases confirm that the \u201cadditional element\u201d \nimposed by Monahan is \u201cimpossibl[e]\u201d to satisfy \u201cfor \nmany plaintiffs.\u201d  Knox, 62 F.4th at 1002.  Congress \n\n43 \n \n \ndid not enact that unduly harsh regime, which \nsenselessly disadvantages some of society\u2019s most \nvulnerable members.   \n3.  Monahan\u2019s asymmetric rule also leads to \narbitrary and anomalous results.   It requires pre-K, \nelementary, middle, and high school students suing \nunder the ADA and Rehabilitation Act to prove bad \nfaith or gross misjudgment.  See, e.g., I.Z.M. v. \nRosemount- Apple Valley-Eagan Pub. Schs., 863 F.3d \n966, 968, 972-73 (8th Cir. 2017).  But college students \nbringing the exact same claims do not have to clear \nthat hurdle, even in circuits that apply Monahan\u2019s \nheightened standard.  See, e.g., Halpern v. Wake \nForest Univ. Health Scis., 669 F.3d 454, 461-62 \n(4th Cir. 2012); Mershon v. St. Louis Univ., 442 F.3d \n1069, 1076-77 (8th Cir. 2006); Gati v. W. Kentucky \nUniv., 762 F. App\u2019x 246, 250 (6th Cir. 2019).  Why \nshould a graduation ceremony drastically alter the \nstandard for demonstrating disability discrimination \nin the educational context?  Monahan doesn\u2019t say.   \nThe District asserts that this head-scratching \nregime was actually part of Congress\u2019s design because \n\u201ccollege students,\u201d unlike \u201celementary and secondary \nstudents, \u201care not covered by the IDEA.\u201d  BIO31 n.3.  \nBut again, Congress has made clear\u2014in unequivocal \nstatutory text\u2014that potential overlap with the IDEA \ndoes not \u201crestrict\u201d or \u201climit\u201d the ADA and \nRehabilitation Act\u2019s protections.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l); \nsee supra at 30-34.  Plus, courts apply Monahan\u2019s \nbad-faith-or-gross-misjudgment standard even in \ncases where school-age children with disabilities are \nbringing claims that do not involve the denial of a \nFAPE\u2014and thus lack any nexus with the IDEA.  \nSee, e.g., Baker v. Bentonville Sch. Dist., 75 F.4th 810, \n815-16 (8th Cir. 2023) (safety hazards at school for \n\n44 \n \n \nvisually impaired child); Hoekstra ex rel. Hoekstra v. \nIndep. Sch. Dist. No. 283, 103 F.3d 624, 626-27 (8th \nCir. 1996) (elevator access at school for physically \nimpaired child).   \nRequiring school-age children with disabilities \nwho suffer education-related discrimination to satisfy \na more stringent standard than college students who \nendured the same mistreatment makes no sense.  Yet \nthat unsound result flows directly from Monahan. \nE. Monahan \nRested \nOn \nFlawed \nPolicy \nAnalysis, Not Law \nAt its core, Monahan is a textbook example of \nlegislating from the bench.  The Eighth Circuit \nadmitted that it sought to achieve \u201cwhat we\u201d\u2014judges, \nnot legislators\u2014\u201cbelieve to be a proper balance \nbetween the rights of handicapped children, the \nresponsibilities of state educational officials, and the \ncompetence of courts to make judgments in technical \nfields.\u201d  Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171 (emphasis added).   \nMonahan was wrong to \u201creplace the actual text\u201d of \nthe ADA and Rehabilitation Act with judicial \n\u201cspeculation as to Congress\u2019 intent\u201d on matters of \npolicy.  Perez, 598 U.S. at 150.  It was especially wrong \nto do so in a case where the parties\u2019 briefs did not \naddress the proper standard for Rehabilitation Act \nclaims in the school setting\u2014let alone propose a \nbrand new \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d test.9  \nAnd even on its own terms, Monahan\u2019s speculation \nabout Congress\u2019s intent makes little sense. \n \n9  The Monahan briefs are available at the National \nArchives in Kansas City, and can be provided to the Court by \nAva\u2019s counsel upon request.  \n\n45 \n \n \n1.  Judges ordinarily do not claim broad authority \nto invent bespoke legal standards for federal statutes \nbased on pure policy grounds.  In Monahan, the \nEighth Circuit offered no persuasive basis for \nclaiming that policymaking authority.      \nThe District has now tried to fill in the gap.  In its \nbrief opposing certiorari, the District argued that \nbecause the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s private \nrights of action are \u201cjudicially implied,\u201d courts have \u201ca \nmeasure of latitude to shape a sensible remedial \nscheme.\u201d  BIO26 (quoting Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284).  \nThis post hoc defense of Monahan\u2019s self-described \npolicymaking does not withstand scrutiny. \nFor starters, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \nprivate rights of action are not implied.  Rather, the \nstatutes \u201cexpressly incorporate[]\u201d the preexisting \nright of action under Title VI, which was originally \njudicially implied and later congressionally ratified.  \nCummings v. Premier Rehab Keller, P.L.L.C., 596 \nU.S. 212, 218 (2022); see 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 \nU.S.C \u00a7 12133.  So whatever \u201cmeasure of latitude\u201d \ncourts might have to tinker with an implied private \nright of action is irrelevant.  Gebser, 524 U.S. at 284. \nRegardless, any such latitude is sharply limited.  \nCourts can only shape an implied right of action in the \nway that \u201cbest comports with the statute.\u201d  Id.  But \nhere, as explained, the ADA and Rehabilitation Act\u2019s \n\u201cgeneral language\u201d served to \u201cproduce general \ncoverage\u201d for all people with disabilities\u2014and does \nnot \u201cleave room for courts to recognize ad hoc \nexceptions\u201d for school-age children or anyone else.  \nAntonin Scalia & Bryan A. Garner, Reading Law:  \nThe Interpretation of Legal Texts 101 (2012); see supra \nat 24-30.  Indeed, the District has not mustered a \nsingle decision from this Court authorizing disfavored \n\n46 \n \n \ntreatment of different classes of plaintiffs asserting \nthe same private right of action, implied or otherwise.  \nMonahan\u2019s \u201cjudicial overreaching\u201d is clear as day.  \nDrew Millar, Judicially Reducing the Standard of \nCare: \nAn \nAnalysis \nof \nthe \nBad \nFaith/Gross \nMisjudgment \nStandard \nin \nSpecial \nEducation \nDiscrimination, 96 Ky. L.J. 711, 728-29 (2008). \n \n2.  Even on its own terms, Monahan\u2019s atextual \nappeal to policy does not hold up.  Monahan doubted \n\u201cthe competence of courts to make judgments\u201d about \ndecisions by \u201ceducational officials\u201d in this \u201ctechnical \nfield[].\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  But the IDEA demands \ninquiry into the \u201cadequacy of a given\u201d child\u2019s \neducation\u2014and thus judicial examination of the \n\u201cdecisions\u201d made by educational officials, with \nappropriate respect for the \u201cexpertise and the exercise \nof judgment by school authorities.\u201d  Endrew F. ex rel.  \nJoseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. Dist. RE-1, 580 U.S. \n386, 404 (2017).  Such respectful consideration of \nschools\u2019 decisionmaking is equally proper under the \nADA and Rehabilitation Act. \nMore fundamentally, just last Term this Court \nresoundingly rejected the notion, echoed in Monahan, \nthat some matters are simply too \u201ctechnical\u201d for \ncourts to review independently.  Loper Bright Enters. \nv. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 402 (2024).  Federal courts \nare surely capable of showing due respect for \neducational officials\u2019 experience and expertise while \nadjudicating discrimination claims in the school \nsetting\u2014just as they do in any other context.  It is a \nmistake to distort statutory text out of a misplaced \nfear that courts cannot responsibly decide cases \n\n47 \n \n \nimplicating sensitive or technical matters.  The ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act are no exception.10 \n3.  Rather than focus on policy, this Court should \napply the law.  In recent years, the Court has \nrepeatedly enforced the plain text of federal \ncivil-rights \nstatutes \nprotecting \nvulnerable \npopulations\u2014including children with disabilities\u2014\nfrom discrimination.  See, e.g., Perez, 598 U.S. at \n146-47; Fry, 580 U.S. at 158; Endrew F., 580 U.S. at \n399; see also Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, 601 U.S. \n346, 355 (2024); Groff v. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447, 468-70 \n(2023); Babb v. Wilkie, 589 U.S. 399, 402 (2020); \nMount Lemmon Fire Dist. v. Guido, 586 U.S. 1, 6-8 \n(2018).  These decisions vindicate textualism as a \nmethod of statutory interpretation that is \u201cneutral as \na matter of politics and policy.\u201d  Brett M. Kavanaugh, \nFixing Statutory Interpretation, 129 Harv. L. Rev. \n2118, 2135 (2016).   \n \nThis Court should embrace that same textualist \napproach here.  Monahan\u2019s \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment\u201d standard flunks every test of text, \nhistory, purpose, and policy.  This Court should now \nfix Monahan\u2019s error.  It should enforce the plain \nmeaning of the Nation\u2019s anti-discrimination laws and \nrestore the full protections Congress granted children \nwith disabilities. \n \n10  It would likewise be mistaken to distort the statutory \ntext out of fear that plaintiffs might try to \u201cend-run the \nstatutorily prescribed IEP process and preempt school districts\u2019 \nfacilitation of the IDEA.\u201d  BIO28.  The IDEA already addresses \npotential evasion:  It \u201cdemand[s]\u201d exhaustion of the IEP process \n\u201cwhen a plaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA can supply,\u201d like a \nFAPE-related injunction\u2014while \u201cexcusing exhaustion when a \nplaintiff seeks a remedy IDEA cannot provide,\u201d like damages.  \nPerez, 598 U.S. at 150. \n\n48 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe Eighth Circuit\u2019s judgment should be vacated \nand the case remanded for further proceedings. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nNICHOLAS ROSELLINI \nLATHAM & WATKINS LLP \n505 Montgomery Street \nSuite 2000 \nSan Francisco, CA 94111 \n \nAMY J.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation consists of my own internal reasoning, consolidating the dramatic shift from the last observation. No new external evidence was introduced, but my understanding of the case's core dynamics and the path forward has been significantly sharpened and formalized. My beliefs are now more structured, and the primary remaining uncertainty is precisely defined.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief, Significance Crystallized) My internal reasoning confirms the profound importance of the cert grant. The Court's decision to take the case, despite an elite Supreme Court advocate's forceful arguments in the Brief in Opposition (BIO) that the \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard was correct and there was no circuit split, remains the single strongest signal that the Court intends to reject that standard.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Hypothesis Half-Confirmed, Next Step Clarified):** This remains the central predictive model for the case. The BIO provided definitive proof of the first half: Respondent (Osseo Area Schools) argued *for* the \"bad faith\" standard at the cert stage. My internal reasoning has now crystallized the entire predictive exercise into a single, high-stakes question: Did they pivot away from this argument in their merits-stage brief? Answering this is now my highest priority.\n\n3.  **New Major Factor: The Solicitor General's Intervention.** (Stable Belief) The SG's intervention continues to be a strong corroborating signal. The SG's disagreement with the Respondent's cert-stage characterization of the law (that all circuits effectively use a high-intent standard) reinforces the likelihood that the Court will seek a unified, lower standard for plaintiffs.\n\n4.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Procedural Forfeiture\" Argument.** (Belief Solidified & Sharpened) My confidence in this factor is unchanged. The BIO provides the \"smoking gun\" evidence the Petitioner would need to deploy a \"bait-and-switch\" or procedural forfeiture argument if the Respondent changes their position on the merits. This remains a powerful checkmate-like feature of the case's strategic landscape.\n\n5.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Stable, Path to Verification Clear):** My high confidence in a vacatur for the petitioner is stable. The internal reasoning step has clarified the two likely paths for the Respondent and why both lead to a loss on the question presented. **Path A:** Defend the \"bad faith\" standard and lose on the merits. **Path B:** Abandon the standard and lose on procedural grounds (concession/forfeiture). The key uncertainty is which path they chose, and my next action is designed to resolve this.",
          "design_beliefs": "This `THINK` observation represents a critical metacognitive step, formalizing the lessons from the previous \"successful failure\" and refining my strategy for future actions. It demonstrates the value of pausing to synthesize and plan, turning a serendipitous discovery into a precise, hypothesis-driven inquiry.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Cert vs. Merits):** (Stable & Actively Deployed) This model is no longer just an analytical framework; it is now the direct driver of my action-selection process. My thinking explicitly framed the next step as finding the Respondent's \"response\" (merits brief) to the Court's \"challenge\" (cert grant) of their \"thesis\" (BIO).\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Value Reinforced & Expanded):**\n    *   **\"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic (Stable & Central):** My internal reasoning confirms this is the absolute core of the predictive task. The entire strategy is now built around verifying this pivot.\n    *   **\"The SG Signal\" (Stable):** Remains a key corroborating heuristic.\n    *   **\"Procedural Forfeiture/Bait-and-Switch\" Heuristic (Stable):** Remains a primary heuristic for evaluating the Petitioner's likely reply strategy.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Principle Validated & Refined):**\n    *   **Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry (Cycle Confirmed & Executed):** This observation is the embodiment of the \"analyze -> refine\" phase of the cycle. I have analyzed the result of my last action (finding the BIO) and am now refining my next action to be more precise.\n    *   **\"Schema Probe -> Broaden -> Refine\" Tactic (Refinement in Action):** This tactic has evolved significantly. The previous \"serendipitous\" discovery has now yielded a concrete, actionable insight into the database schema.\n        *   **Database Schema Insight (New & Actionable):** I have learned a critical distinction for querying docket files. The cert-stage brief is titled **\"BRIEF IN OPPOSITION,\"** while the merits-stage brief is likely titled **\"BRIEF FOR THE RESPONDENTS.\"** My previous, overly broad search (`proceeding_title: 'brief of respondent'`) failed to make this distinction. This new knowledge allows for a much more targeted and effective \"Refine\" step.\n        *   **Value of Imperfect Searches:** The principle that flawed searches can yield high-value, unexpected information is strongly validated.\n        *   **Metacognitive Value of `THINK`:** This observation demonstrates that the `THINK` action is a crucial tool for effective design. It allows for the explicit synthesis of lessons learned (like the database schema insight) and the formulation of a next action with maximal Expected Information Gain, preventing wasted effort on repeating flawed queries."

It will confirm or deny the 'Argument Pivot' hypothesis, which is the linchpin of my entire prediction. The change in my posterior belief about the Court's reasoning will be maximal.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because this action is a direct test of my evolving 'Schema Probe -> Broaden -> Refine' information-gathering tactic. My last action failed but provided crucial feedback on the search tool's behavior. This action operationalizes that feedback.

Sometimes those \nefforts will unfortunately fall short.  But Congress did not \nplausibly subject every public school in America\u2014and \nevery State, locality, and federal-funding recipient\u2014to \nfederal-court supervision, plus the potential loss of federal \nfunding and money damages, whenever good-faith efforts \nfail to satisfy everyone. \n\n2 \n \n \nInstead, as the Eighth Circuit correctly held in Mo-\nnahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), the text \nof Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits only in-\ntentional discrimination, i.e., actions taken in \u201cbad faith\u201d \nor based on \u201cgross misjudgment.\u201d  Section 504 prohibits \ndiscrimination only \u201csolely by reason of \u2026 disability.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  And Title II of the Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act (ADA) likewise prohibits discrimination only \n\u201cby reason of \u2026 disability.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.   \nBoth statutes\u2019 \u201cby reason of\u201d language focuses on the \ndefendant\u2019s motive.  \u201cBad faith\u201d is the traditional legal la-\nbel for actions taken for an improper purpose, with \u201cgross \nmisjudgment\u201d being one classic way of demonstrating im-\nproper purpose.  Monahan reflects a straightforward \ninterpretation of the statutory text, not a school-specific \nrule rooted in policy concerns.            \nPetitioner attacks Monahan\u2019s bad-faith standard as \n\u201catextual and asymmetric.\u201d  But Monahan is the correct \nstandard across the board, both in schools and out, be-\ncause \nevery \ntextual \nand \ncontextual \nindication \ndemonstrates that Section 504 and Title II cover only in-\ntentional discrimination.  The statutes do not impose \nliability for nondiscriminatory, good-faith denials of re-\nquested accommodations.   \nWhen Congress compels affirmative actions or au-\nthorizes \nintent-free \nreasonable-accommodation \nor \ndisparate-impact claims, it does so expressly, as shown by \nnumerous other carefully detailed provisions of the Reha-\nbilitation Act and ADA that do just that.  Petitioner and \nthe government\u2019s reading renders inexplicable Congress\u2019 \ndecision to omit similar language from Section 504 and Ti-\ntle II.  It likewise ascribes to Congress the implausible \nintent to expose the Nation\u2019s understaffed public schools \nto damages liability while exempting countless private \nschools from the same claims.   \n\n3 \n \n \nMonahan\u2019s longstanding bad-faith standard, by con-\ntrast, comports with foundational federalism principles.  \nIt ensures that liability and the potential loss of critical \nfederal funding attach only for what the statutory text ac-\ntually prohibits:  intentional discrimination.  Petitioner \nand the government\u2019s interpretation would permit federal \ncourts to second-guess the myriad nondiscriminatory, \ngood-faith decisions that public schools and other local en-\ntities make every day about how best to serve individuals \nwith disabilities.  \nPetitioner and the government offer an ode to text \nand symmetry.  But their approach defies both.  They en-\ndorse a reasonable-accommodation theory found nowhere \nin the text.  And they embrace an indefensible remedial \nregime whereby the exact same statutory text, which di-\nrects courts to follow Title VI\u2019s remedial scheme, means \ntwo different things depending on the relief sought.   \nIn their view, even though the same text governs all \nforms of relief, intent in this case is required for damages \nbut not injunctions or the withdrawal of federal funding.  \nThen they water down their intent requirement with an \ninapposite \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard imported \nnot from Title VI, but from Title IX sexual-harassment \ncases involving supervisory liability.  Worse, on petitioner \nand the government\u2019s telling, their supposed intent stand-\nard appears not to require intentional discrimination.  \nAny negligent or even good-faith violation of the Individ-\nuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) would \nseemingly put covered entities on the hook for potentially \ncrushing liability.   \nThis Court should not subject America\u2019s 100,000 pub-\nlic schools and countless other state and local entities and \nfederal-funding recipients to a manifestly incoherent re-\ngime when the plain statutory text demands intentional \ndiscrimination\u2014as Monahan rightly held.  \n\n4 \n \n \n Statutory Background \n1. Enacted in 1973, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct states that individuals with disabilities shall not \u201cbe \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination\u201d under any federally \nfunded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d \u201csolely by reason of her or \nhis disability.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  Included in a \u201cprogram \nor activity\u201d is the operation of state and local government \nentities that receive federal funds, like school districts.  \nId. \u00a7 794(b)(1).   \nIn 1990, Congress enacted the ADA.  The ADA has \nthree main titles.  Title II, at issue here, targets \u201cState \n[and] local government[s]\u201d and their instrumentalities, \nagain including school districts.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1).  Ti-\ntle II provides that individuals with disabilities shall not, \n\u201cby reason of such disability, be excluded from participa-\ntion in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimi-\nnation by any such entity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 12132. \nTitles I and III, respectively, regulate disability dis-\ncrimination \nin \n\u201cemployment\u201d \nand \nin \n\u201cpublic \naccommodations and services operated by private enti-\nties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12111-17, 12181-89.  Unlike Section 504 and \nTitle II, Titles I and III both bar \u201cstandards, criteria, or \nmethods of administration \u2026 that have the effect of dis-\ncrimination \non \nthe \nbasis \nof \ndisability.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(3)(A), 12182(b)(1)(D)(i).  And Titles I and III, \nagain unlike Section 504 and Title II, require \u201creasonable \naccommodations\u201d or \u201creasonable modifications.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).   \nTitle II incorporates the \u201cremedies, procedures, and \nrights set forth in [Section 504].\u201d  Id. \u00a7 12133.  And Section \n504 incorporates the \u201cremedies, procedures, and rights \nset forth in title VI\u201d of the Civil Rights Act.  29 U.S.C. \n\n5 \n \n \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).  Title VI contains no express cause of action, \nbut this Court has implied one for violations of Title VI\u2019s \nprohibition of intentional discrimination \u201con the ground \nof\u201d race, color, or national origin.  Alexander v. Sandoval, \n532 U.S. 275, 278-81 (2001).   \n2. The IDEA requires public schools to provide stu-\ndents with disabilities a \u201cfree appropriate public \neducation.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  Educators, par-\nents, and the student must collaborate annually to develop \nan \u201cindividualized education program\u201d (IEP), which the \nschool must implement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  The IDEA pro-\nvides States with IDEA-specific funds to fulfill the Act\u2019s \naffirmative-action requirements.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1411-12.       \nCongress prescribed \u201celaborate and highly specific \nprocedural safeguards\u201d under the IDEA to ensure that \nparents have a meaningful voice in their children\u2019s educa-\ntion.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. \nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nOnly after exhausting these requirements can aggrieved \nparties bring IDEA claims to federal court.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  And IDEA lawsuits permit only in-\njunctive relief, not compensatory damages.  Fitzgerald v. \nBarnstable Sch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); Pet. \nBr. 5-6; U.S. Br. 5-6.  This IDEA-prescribed process pre-\nvents courts from \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of \nsound educational policy for those of the school authori-\nties.\u201d  Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. \nDist. RE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017) (citation omitted).   \n Factual and Procedural Background \n1. Osseo Area School District is the fifth largest \nschool district in Minnesota.  The District provides pri-\nmary and secondary education to over 20,000 students \nacross suburban Hennepin County.  Like many of Amer-\nica\u2019s 19,000 school districts, the District faces perennial \n\n6 \n \n \nbudget shortfalls as it strives to serve a variety of stu-\ndents with unique needs.  Over 40% of the District\u2019s \nstudents receive free or reduced-price meals, and 11% are \nlearning English as a second language.  See Osseo Area \nSchs., Legislative Priorities 2 (2025), https://tinyurl.com\n/bdhcwhu5.  The District faces perpetual \u201cworkforce \nshortage[s]\u201d and concerns about obtaining \u201cnecessary \nfunds\u201d for students\u2019 \u201ccritical needs.\u201d  Id. at 1.  \nIn 2015, the District learned that petitioner A.J.T. \n(\u201cAva\u201d) was moving from Kentucky and would need spe-\ncial-education support.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava\u2019s parents told \nthe District that Ava has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a \nrare form of epilepsy that causes daily seizures and im-\npairs her cognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.6a.  \nBecause Ava\u2019s seizures are most frequent in the morning, \nAva\u2019s parents \u201crequested that [Ava] not attend school un-\ntil noon.\u201d  JA550.  The District always \u201cexcused [Ava]\u2019s \nabsence from school before noon.\u201d  JA548.    \nThe District also \u201cproposed an IEP that accepted the \ngoals and objectives from [Ava\u2019s] Kentucky IEP\u201d and pro-\nvided Ava with more special-education services than her \nKentucky IEP prescribed.  Pet.App.10a.  The District \nprovided \u201c240 minutes of direct special education daily\u201d \n(all in school), while Ava\u2019s Kentucky IEP provided only \n\u201c215 minutes\u201d per day (split between in-school and at-\nhome time).  Pet.App.10a. \nIn addition to those special-education services, Ava\u2019s \nparents \u201crequested that [Ava] receive paraprofessional \nsupport in her home from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.\u201d  JA550.  \nWhile the District declined to provide such regular, at-\nhome, after-school support, it offered a series of other \nmeasures to assist Ava.  \nFirst, Ava has received \u201cvery individualized, intense \nservices focused only on her\u201d that exceed those offered to \n\n7 \n \n \nany other student in the District.  JA192.  Before Ava\u2019s \narrival, the special-education program at Ava\u2019s school had \none full-time teacher and two paraprofessionals working \nwith a class of five to seven students with disabilities.  \nJA337.

Sometimes those \nefforts will unfortunately fall short.  But Congress did not \nplausibly subject every public school in America\u2014and \nevery State, locality, and federal-funding recipient\u2014to \nfederal-court supervision, plus the potential loss of federal \nfunding and money damages, whenever good-faith efforts \nfail to satisfy everyone. \n\n2 \n \n \nInstead, as the Eighth Circuit correctly held in Mo-\nnahan v. Nebraska, 687 F.2d 1164 (8th Cir. 1982), the text \nof Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act prohibits only in-\ntentional discrimination, i.e., actions taken in \u201cbad faith\u201d \nor based on \u201cgross misjudgment.\u201d  Section 504 prohibits \ndiscrimination only \u201csolely by reason of \u2026 disability.\u201d  29 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  And Title II of the Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act (ADA) likewise prohibits discrimination only \n\u201cby reason of \u2026 disability.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.   \nBoth statutes\u2019 \u201cby reason of\u201d language focuses on the \ndefendant\u2019s motive.  \u201cBad faith\u201d is the traditional legal la-\nbel for actions taken for an improper purpose, with \u201cgross \nmisjudgment\u201d being one classic way of demonstrating im-\nproper purpose.  Monahan reflects a straightforward \ninterpretation of the statutory text, not a school-specific \nrule rooted in policy concerns.            \nPetitioner attacks Monahan\u2019s bad-faith standard as \n\u201catextual and asymmetric.\u201d  But Monahan is the correct \nstandard across the board, both in schools and out, be-\ncause \nevery \ntextual \nand \ncontextual \nindication \ndemonstrates that Section 504 and Title II cover only in-\ntentional discrimination.  The statutes do not impose \nliability for nondiscriminatory, good-faith denials of re-\nquested accommodations.   \nWhen Congress compels affirmative actions or au-\nthorizes \nintent-free \nreasonable-accommodation \nor \ndisparate-impact claims, it does so expressly, as shown by \nnumerous other carefully detailed provisions of the Reha-\nbilitation Act and ADA that do just that.  Petitioner and \nthe government\u2019s reading renders inexplicable Congress\u2019 \ndecision to omit similar language from Section 504 and Ti-\ntle II.  It likewise ascribes to Congress the implausible \nintent to expose the Nation\u2019s understaffed public schools \nto damages liability while exempting countless private \nschools from the same claims.   \n\n3 \n \n \nMonahan\u2019s longstanding bad-faith standard, by con-\ntrast, comports with foundational federalism principles.  \nIt ensures that liability and the potential loss of critical \nfederal funding attach only for what the statutory text ac-\ntually prohibits:  intentional discrimination.  Petitioner \nand the government\u2019s interpretation would permit federal \ncourts to second-guess the myriad nondiscriminatory, \ngood-faith decisions that public schools and other local en-\ntities make every day about how best to serve individuals \nwith disabilities.  \nPetitioner and the government offer an ode to text \nand symmetry.  But their approach defies both.  They en-\ndorse a reasonable-accommodation theory found nowhere \nin the text.  And they embrace an indefensible remedial \nregime whereby the exact same statutory text, which di-\nrects courts to follow Title VI\u2019s remedial scheme, means \ntwo different things depending on the relief sought.   \nIn their view, even though the same text governs all \nforms of relief, intent in this case is required for damages \nbut not injunctions or the withdrawal of federal funding.  \nThen they water down their intent requirement with an \ninapposite \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard imported \nnot from Title VI, but from Title IX sexual-harassment \ncases involving supervisory liability.  Worse, on petitioner \nand the government\u2019s telling, their supposed intent stand-\nard appears not to require intentional discrimination.  \nAny negligent or even good-faith violation of the Individ-\nuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) would \nseemingly put covered entities on the hook for potentially \ncrushing liability.   \nThis Court should not subject America\u2019s 100,000 pub-\nlic schools and countless other state and local entities and \nfederal-funding recipients to a manifestly incoherent re-\ngime when the plain statutory text demands intentional \ndiscrimination\u2014as Monahan rightly held.  \n\n4 \n \n \n Statutory Background \n1. Enacted in 1973, Section 504 of the Rehabilitation \nAct states that individuals with disabilities shall not \u201cbe \nexcluded from the participation in, be denied the benefits \nof, or be subjected to discrimination\u201d under any federally \nfunded \u201cprogram or activity\u201d \u201csolely by reason of her or \nhis disability.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  Included in a \u201cprogram \nor activity\u201d is the operation of state and local government \nentities that receive federal funds, like school districts.  \nId. \u00a7 794(b)(1).   \nIn 1990, Congress enacted the ADA.  The ADA has \nthree main titles.  Title II, at issue here, targets \u201cState \n[and] local government[s]\u201d and their instrumentalities, \nagain including school districts.  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1).  Ti-\ntle II provides that individuals with disabilities shall not, \n\u201cby reason of such disability, be excluded from participa-\ntion in or be denied the benefits of the services, programs, \nor activities of a public entity, or be subjected to discrimi-\nnation by any such entity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 12132. \nTitles I and III, respectively, regulate disability dis-\ncrimination \nin \n\u201cemployment\u201d \nand \nin \n\u201cpublic \naccommodations and services operated by private enti-\nties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12111-17, 12181-89.  Unlike Section 504 and \nTitle II, Titles I and III both bar \u201cstandards, criteria, or \nmethods of administration \u2026 that have the effect of dis-\ncrimination \non \nthe \nbasis \nof \ndisability.\u201d \n \nId. \n\u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(3)(A), 12182(b)(1)(D)(i).  And Titles I and III, \nagain unlike Section 504 and Title II, require \u201creasonable \naccommodations\u201d or \u201creasonable modifications.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A), 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii).   \nTitle II incorporates the \u201cremedies, procedures, and \nrights set forth in [Section 504].\u201d  Id. \u00a7 12133.  And Section \n504 incorporates the \u201cremedies, procedures, and rights \nset forth in title VI\u201d of the Civil Rights Act.  29 U.S.C. \n\n5 \n \n \n\u00a7 794a(a)(2).  Title VI contains no express cause of action, \nbut this Court has implied one for violations of Title VI\u2019s \nprohibition of intentional discrimination \u201con the ground \nof\u201d race, color, or national origin.  Alexander v. Sandoval, \n532 U.S. 275, 278-81 (2001).   \n2. The IDEA requires public schools to provide stu-\ndents with disabilities a \u201cfree appropriate public \neducation.\u201d  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1400(d)(1)(A).  Educators, par-\nents, and the student must collaborate annually to develop \nan \u201cindividualized education program\u201d (IEP), which the \nschool must implement.  Id. \u00a7 1414(d).  The IDEA pro-\nvides States with IDEA-specific funds to fulfill the Act\u2019s \naffirmative-action requirements.  See id. \u00a7\u00a7 1411-12.       \nCongress prescribed \u201celaborate and highly specific \nprocedural safeguards\u201d under the IDEA to ensure that \nparents have a meaningful voice in their children\u2019s educa-\ntion.  Bd. of Educ. of Hendrick Hudson Cent. Sch. Dist. v. \nRowley, 458 U.S. 176, 205 (1982); see 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415.  \nOnly after exhausting these requirements can aggrieved \nparties bring IDEA claims to federal court.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1415(i)(2)(C)(iii).  And IDEA lawsuits permit only in-\njunctive relief, not compensatory damages.  Fitzgerald v. \nBarnstable Sch. Comm., 555 U.S. 246, 254 n.1 (2009); Pet. \nBr. 5-6; U.S. Br. 5-6.  This IDEA-prescribed process pre-\nvents courts from \u201csubstitut[ing] their own notions of \nsound educational policy for those of the school authori-\nties.\u201d  Endrew F. ex rel. Joseph F. v. Douglas Cnty. Sch. \nDist. RE-1, 580 U.S. 386, 404 (2017) (citation omitted).   \n Factual and Procedural Background \n1. Osseo Area School District is the fifth largest \nschool district in Minnesota.  The District provides pri-\nmary and secondary education to over 20,000 students \nacross suburban Hennepin County.  Like many of Amer-\nica\u2019s 19,000 school districts, the District faces perennial \n\n6 \n \n \nbudget shortfalls as it strives to serve a variety of stu-\ndents with unique needs.  Over 40% of the District\u2019s \nstudents receive free or reduced-price meals, and 11% are \nlearning English as a second language.  See Osseo Area \nSchs., Legislative Priorities 2 (2025), https://tinyurl.com\n/bdhcwhu5.  The District faces perpetual \u201cworkforce \nshortage[s]\u201d and concerns about obtaining \u201cnecessary \nfunds\u201d for students\u2019 \u201ccritical needs.\u201d  Id. at 1.  \nIn 2015, the District learned that petitioner A.J.T. \n(\u201cAva\u201d) was moving from Kentucky and would need spe-\ncial-education support.  Pet.App.50a.  Ava\u2019s parents told \nthe District that Ava has Lennox-Gastaut Syndrome, a \nrare form of epilepsy that causes daily seizures and im-\npairs her cognitive and physical functioning.  Pet.App.6a.  \nBecause Ava\u2019s seizures are most frequent in the morning, \nAva\u2019s parents \u201crequested that [Ava] not attend school un-\ntil noon.\u201d  JA550.  The District always \u201cexcused [Ava]\u2019s \nabsence from school before noon.\u201d  JA548.    \nThe District also \u201cproposed an IEP that accepted the \ngoals and objectives from [Ava\u2019s] Kentucky IEP\u201d and pro-\nvided Ava with more special-education services than her \nKentucky IEP prescribed.  Pet.App.10a.  The District \nprovided \u201c240 minutes of direct special education daily\u201d \n(all in school), while Ava\u2019s Kentucky IEP provided only \n\u201c215 minutes\u201d per day (split between in-school and at-\nhome time).  Pet.App.10a. \nIn addition to those special-education services, Ava\u2019s \nparents \u201crequested that [Ava] receive paraprofessional \nsupport in her home from 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.\u201d  JA550.  \nWhile the District declined to provide such regular, at-\nhome, after-school support, it offered a series of other \nmeasures to assist Ava.  \nFirst, Ava has received \u201cvery individualized, intense \nservices focused only on her\u201d that exceed those offered to \n\n7 \n \n \nany other student in the District.  JA192.  Before Ava\u2019s \narrival, the special-education program at Ava\u2019s school had \none full-time teacher and two paraprofessionals working \nwith a class of five to seven students with disabilities.  \nJA337.  The District \u201chire[d] an additional paraprofes-\nsional\u201d specifically \u201cto support Ava\u2019s needs.\u201d  JA337.  \nThus, while most special-education students are educated \nin an environment with more students than educators, \nAva always has at least one, and often two, educators fo-\ncused exclusively on her.  JA394; see also JA193.   \nThe District\u2019s intensive services mean that Ava\u2019s \nschool day looks very different from other students\u2019.  For \nmost students, much of the day is eaten up by \u201clots of \nbreaks\u201d for \u201clunch,\u201d \u201cpassing time,\u201d and \u201chomework.\u201d  \nJA193-94.  And even for students with disabilities, the \nschool day may include activities \u201cindependent of an \nadult,\u201d such as reading by themselves.  JA394.  But Ava\u2019s \nservices run continuously; she never has \u201ctimes independ-\nent of getting direct instruction from a licensed special \neducation teacher or reinforcing skills from a paraprofes-\nsional.\u201d  JA395.   \nSecond, \u201c[t]he District made repeated offers to serve \n[Ava] whenever she [was] available during the regular \nschool day, including before 12:00 p.m. on any days when \n[Ava] might be available to be in school earlier in the day.\u201d  \nJA554.  Ava\u2019s neurologist told the District that \u201ceducation \nearlier in the day would be a possibility\u201d and \u201creasonable\u201d \nto try.  JA594.  But Ava\u2019s parents declined.  JA278. \nThird, the District extended Ava\u2019s school day by 15 \nminutes to accommodate her parents\u2019 \u201cconcern[s] about \nher safety navigating the halls\u201d during the end-of-school-\nday exodus.  Pet.App.50a-51a n.2. \nFourth, the District provided Ava \u201c16 3-hour[] ses-\nsions in [Ava]\u2019s home by a licensed special education \n\n8 \n \n \nteacher\u201d from noon to 3:00 p.m. during the summers.  \nJA549.  The District typically only provides such services \nbefore noon, but made an exception for Ava.  See JA549. \nFifth, the District \u201coffered to provide additional\u201d at-\nhome instruction over the summer, but Ava\u2019s parents \u201cre-\njected this offer because June and August were times that \n[Ava] might try new medications and treatments and re-\nceive outside therapies.\u201d  JA549. \nThe District\u2019s specialized services resulted in Ava \n\u201cmaking progress on her IEP goals and objectives.\u201d  \nJA221-22; see also JA152, 196, 462.  The District shared \n\u201cdata on Ava\u2019s progress on her IEP goals\u201d \u201cat each [IEP] \nmeeting.\u201d  JA349.  Unfortunately, \u201c[m]uch like [her] ex-\nperience in Kentucky,\u201d Ava\u2019s progress was not uniformly \npositive or at the level the District and Ava\u2019s educators \ndesired.  JA462.  But it was not clear that further at-home \ninstructional time was the answer, particularly given that \nindividuals with Ava\u2019s condition \u201coften plateau in their \nfunctional and intellectual gains by middle school.\u201d  \nJA545.  Ava\u2019s own expert \u201cadmitted\u201d that recent litera-\nture \u201cindicates that less intensity of service may actually \nbe more successful because the learner\u2019s attention span \nwanes in longer sessions.\u201d  JA585.     \n2.  The District has consistently offered multiple, mu-\ntually compatible reasons for not going further.  The \nDistrict has always been focused on a combination of \nAva\u2019s needs, staff availability, and effectively utilizing \nscarce resources shared among all students, including \nothers with disabilities.  For example, the District consid-\nered Ava\u2019s documented progress, its legal obligations, \ngeneral practices, and concerns about the precedent \ngranting Ava\u2019s request would set.  See Pet.App.50a.  The \nDistrict also considered the lack of data demonstrating \nthat extending the school day would be beneficial for Ava \nand the fact that Ava was already \u201creceiving intensive \n\n9 \n \n \nprogram[m]ing from one to two adults throughout her day \nand continuing to show progress.\u201d  JA406; Pet.App.50a.1   \nWhen Ava graduated to middle school, the District \nproposed a new IEP to continue offering Ava special-ed-\nucation services from noon until shortly after the end of \nthe school day, which in middle school was 2:40 p.m.  \nPet.App.11a.  But the District and Ava\u2019s parents could not \nagree, so Ava\u2019s previous IEP remained in place.  See 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1415(j).  Ava thus continued to receive schooling \nfrom noon to 4:15 p.m., including specialized educational \nservices from noon to 3:00 p.m. and direct one-on-one ed-\nucational and paraprofessional services from 3:00 p.m. to \n4:15 p.m.  Pet.App.4a; JA232.  \n3.  In September 2020, Ava\u2019s parents filed an IDEA \ncomplaint with the Minnesota Department of Education.  \nJA453.  They argued that Ava was entitled to a 6.5-hour \nschool day and that her current 4.25-hour day failed to \nprovide the free appropriate public education required by \nthe IDEA.  JA444-45; Pet.10-11.  The ALJ ordered the \nDistrict to increase Ava\u2019s daily instructional hours from \n4.25 to 5.75 by providing at-home instruction from 4:30 \np.m. to 6:00 p.m.  JA477.  The ALJ also ordered 495 hours \nof compensatory education instruction.  JA477.  The dis-\ntrict court affirmed that order.  See Pet.App.52a. \n4. In August 2021, Ava\u2019s parents sued under Section \n504 of the Rehabilitation Act and Title II of the ADA.  \nJA1.  These claims were \u201cbased on the District\u2019s failure to \nprovide [Ava] a six-and-a-half-hour school day starting at \n                                                 \n1 Petitioner (at 5) incorrectly claims that \u201c[t]he district court and \nEighth Circuit held\u201d that the District\u2019s reasons for not providing Ava \nwith after school instruction were \u201cpretextual\u201d and \u201cnot credible.\u201d  \nThose quotations come only from the ALJ\u2019s opinion on Ava\u2019s IDEA \nclaim.  See JA468, 471.   \n\n10 \n \n \nnoon.\u201d  JA561; see JA23, 25.  Ava\u2019s parents sought dam-\nages and injunctive relief.  JA28-29. \nThe district court granted summary judgment to the \nDistrict.  The court concluded that it could not \u201cattribute \n\u2018wrongful intent\u2019 to the District\u201d as required to state a \nSection 504 or Title II claim under Monahan, 687 F.2d at \n1171. Pet.App.33a-35a.   \nIn particular, the court considered \u201call the District\u2019s \nattempts at conciliation,\u201d including \u201cconvening multiple \nIEP meetings,\u201d \u201cextending [Ava]\u2019s school day beyond the \nschool day of her peers,\u201d \u201cimplementing many of [Ava\u2019s \nexpert\u2019s] suggestions,\u201d and \u201c[e]nsuring that [Ava] always \nhas at least one and often two aid[e]s with her at school.\u201d  \nPet.App.33a-35a.  The court further found no merit in \nAva\u2019s parents\u2019 assertion that the District \u201cexpressed ig-\nnorance of [her] discrimination complaints.\u201d  Pet.App.26a-\n29a.  The court therefore held that \u201cthe District\u2019s officials \nexercised professional judgment\u201d and did not act \u201cwith \nbad faith.\u201d  Pet.App.35a-36a.   \n5. The Eighth Circuit affirmed.  Pet.App.5a.  The \ncourt first explained that, under Monahan, \u201ca school dis-\ntrict\u2019s \nsimple \nfailure \nto \nprovide \na \nreasonable \naccommodation is not enough to trigger liability\u201d under \nSection 504 or Title II.  Pet.App.3a (citation omitted).  In-\nstead, \u201ca plaintiff must prove that school officials acted \nwith \u2018either bad faith or gross misjudgment.\u2019\u201d  Pet.App.3a \n(quoting Monahan, 687 F.2d at 1171).   \nHere, the court concluded, \u201cthe District did not ignore \n[Ava]\u2019s needs or delay its efforts to address them,\u201d and \nAva thus failed to demonstrate \u201cbad faith or gross mis-\njudgment.\u201d  Pet.App.3a-4a.  In particular, the court \nexplained, District officials \u201cmet with [Ava]\u2019s parents and \nupdated her [IEP] each year,\u201d provided her \u201ca variety of \nservices, like intensive one-on-one instruction and a 15-\n\n11 \n \n \nminute extension of her school day so that she could safely \nleave after the halls cleared,\u201d and \u201coffered 16 three-hour \nsessions at home each summer.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe Eighth Circuit stated that Ava\u2019s parents \u201cmay \nhave established a genuine dispute about whether the dis-\ntrict was negligent or even deliberately indifferent.\u201d  \nPet.App.3a (emphasis added); contra Pet. Br. 3-4, 40 (sug-\ngesting that the court so concluded).  And in a footnote, \nthe court questioned Monahan\u2019s intent standard.  \nPet.App.5a n.2.  But given the District\u2019s extensive efforts, \nthe court concluded that Ava \u201cd[id] not show wrongful in-\ntent,\u201d as required by Eighth Circuit law.  Pet.App.4a.  \nThe court denied rehearing en banc.  Pet.App.44a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  Monahan\u2019s textual analysis is correct.  Section 504 \nand Title II prohibit only intentional discrimination. \nA.  Section 504 requires plaintiffs to show that they \nwere \u201cexcluded from participation in,\u201d \u201cdenied the bene-\nfits of,\u201d or \u201csubjected to discrimination under\u201d a federally \nfunded program or activity \u201csolely by reason of\u201d their dis-\nability.  Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 \nU.S. 397 (1979), held that Section 504\u2019s \u201csolely by reason \nof\u201d language bars liability where the defendant had a le-\ngitimate, nondiscriminatory purpose for the challenged \naction.  Three years later, Monahan relied on Davis to \ncorrectly interpret this motive-focused statutory lan-\nguage in Section 504, which Title II tracks, to require \ndiscriminatory intent.   \nMonahan also chose appropriate language to de-\nscribe that intent requirement:  \u201cbad faith or gross \nmisjudgment.\u201d  \u201cBad faith\u201d is the established legal term \nfor actions taken for an improper or unlawful purpose\u2014\nexactly the inquiry Section 504 and Title II command.  \n\n12 \n \n \nAnd \u201cgross misjudgment\u201d is a traditional way of demon-\nstrating improper purpose.  \nB.  Federalism principles support Monahan\u2019s statu-\ntory interpretation.  Under the Spending Clause, \nCongress needed to speak far more clearly if it wished to \nimpose liability on federal-funding recipients for nondis-\ncriminatory acts and good-faith disagreements.  And \nabsent the Spending Clause, Congress has no constitu-\ntional authority to require every State and locality to \nremedy every unintentional barrier to access facing indi-\nviduals with disabilities.   \nDoing away with Monahan\u2019s intent requirement \nwould threaten the States\u2019 historic powers in the disability \nand education contexts.  Monahan leaves intensely local \nquestions about how best to fulfill those obligations to lo-\ncal authorities.  And Monahan avoids the constitutionally \nsuspect result of forcing States to expend their own funds \nto affirmatively accommodate people with disabilities ac-\ncording to federal dictates under threat of potentially \nruinous damages claims or sweeping injunctions.   \nC.  Petitioner\u2019s attacks on Monahan lack merit.  Stat-\nutory text, not judicial policy-making, expressly drove \nMonahan\u2019s intent requirement.  That later courts have \nwrongly injected atextual liability theories outside the \nschool context is a reason to reaffirm Monahan, not to dis-\ncard it.  Petitioner also overstates the burden that \nMonahan imposes.  Plaintiffs can and do prove intent to \ndiscriminate through various direct or circumstantial evi-\ndence.  But Monahan properly bars claims like \npetitioner\u2019s, which seek to relitigate the wisdom of nondis-\ncriminatory decisions made by professionals acting in \ngood faith.   \nII.  This Court should reject petitioner and the gov-\nernment\u2019s atextual construction of the statutes.   \n\n13 \n \n \nA.  The Court should decide what standard governs \nSection 504 and Title II discrimination claims.  The peti-\ntion for certiorari cleanly presents that issue.  Petitioner\u2019s \neffort to duck it now is puzzling and rests on the faulty \nassertion that lower courts are aligned on the standard \noutside the school context.  In fact, courts are deeply di-\nvided over the proper standard for such claims.  The Sixth \nCircuit has squarely held that Section 504 \u201cdoes not en-\ncompass actions taken for nondiscriminatory reasons.\u201d  \nDoe v. BlueCross BlueShield of Tenn., Inc., 926 F.3d 235, \n242 (6th Cir. 2019) (Sutton, J.).  This Court should not up-\nset Monahan\u2019s long-settled rule only to leave confusion in \nits wake.   \nB.  Petitioner apparently embraces the notion that \nplaintiffs must establish deliberate indifference to obtain \ndamages.  But petitioner never explains textually how \ndamages and injunctive relief can be governed by two dif-\nferent standards, especially when Section 504 and Title II \nincorporate Title VI\u2019s remedies across the board, and Ti-\ntle VI requires intent for both forms of relief.   \nNor does petitioner explain why deliberate indiffer-\nence could possibly be the right test for damages.  Lower \ncourts that require deliberate indifference rely on this \nCourt\u2019s Title IX sexual-harassment cases.  But those \ncases use deliberate indifference to determine whether \nthe covered entity had adequate notice of someone else\u2019s \nintentional discrimination.  Absent intentional discrimina-\ntion somewhere in the picture, there is no liability under \nTitle IX.  Petitioner and the government\u2019s two-tier reme-\ndial scheme cannot be squared with Title VI and Title IX\u2019s \nrequirement of intentional discrimination for all forms of \nrelief.   \nThe government\u2019s defense of deliberate indifference \nis also deeply flawed.  The government would subject pub-\nlic entities to damages liability so long as they had \n\n14 \n \n \n\u201cknowledge of the substantial likelihood of discrimina-\ntion.\u201d  U.S. Br. 19 (citation omitted).  But the government \ndoes not explain how likely the discrimination must be.  Is \na 10% chance of a successful discrimination claim enough?  \n51%?  75%?  Congress did not plausibly leave public enti-\nties at the mercy of such amorphous damages liability \nwhen private entities\u2014including countless private \nschools\u2014would not face damages for identical conduct. \nC.  Petitioner and the government further err in con-\ntending that plaintiffs may obtain injunctive relief and the \ngovernment may withdraw all federal funding from an en-\ntire public entity based on any good-faith disagreement \nover the scope of the IDEA or what accommodations are \nreasonable.  Start with the text, which requires discrimi-\nnation \u201csolely by reason of\u201d or \u201cby reason of\u201d disability.  \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  By focusing on the \nreason for the challenged action, Congress necessarily in-\nstructed courts to consider the motive and purpose\u2014i.e., \nthe intent\u2014behind that action.  The word \u201cdiscrimina-\ntion\u201d likewise points toward intent; decisions made for \nimproper reasons, not good-faith ones, are the essence of \ndiscrimination.  The statutes\u2019 use of the passive voice does \nnot compel a different conclusion.  This Court has repeat-\nedly interpreted similarly phrased statutes to consider \nthe reason for a decision, notwithstanding the passive \nvoice.   \nStatutory structure confirms the point.  When Con-\ngress wanted to mandate affirmative obligations or \nimpose liability on good-faith failures to accommodate in \nother parts of the Rehabilitation Act and the ADA, it did \nso expressly.  Congress then defined the contours of the \nobligation and either placed limits on damages or fore-\nclosed them altogether.  Petitioner and the government\u2019s \nview fails to give effect to Congress\u2019 deliberate decision to \nomit similar provisions in Section 504 and Title II.   \n\n15 \n \n \nD.  The legislative history of Section 504 and Title II \ndoes not justify imposing antidiscrimination liability for \nnondiscriminatory acts.  To the extent Alexander v. Cho-\nate, 469 U.S. 287 (1985), suggests otherwise, those \nstatements were plainly dicta.  Policy arguments likewise \ndo not change the statutory text, and they are especially \nunpersuasive here.  A multitude of state and federal pro-\nvisions address unintentional barriers to access for \nindividuals with disabilities.  This Court should not distort \nSection 504 and Title II beyond recognition to achieve the \nsame aim.            \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nMonahan\u2019s Longstanding Rule Is Correct  \n \nMonahan Correctly Interpreted the Statutory Text \n1.  Monahan considered whether a school\u2019s decision \nnot to provide a requested accommodation violated Sec-\ntion 504.  In answering that question, the Eighth Circuit \nfocused on the statutory text.  Contra Pet. Br. 24-28; U.S. \nBr. 28-32.  The court found \u201cthe language of the statute \u2026 \ninstructive,\u201d emphasizing that Section 504 \u201cprohibits ex-\nclusion, denial of benefits, and discrimination\u201d only if done \n\u201c\u2018solely by reason of \u2026 handicap.\u2019\u201d  687 F.2d at 1170 (quot-\ning 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794 (1978)).  \u201cThe reference in the \nRehabilitation Act to \u2018discrimination\u2019 must require \u2026 \nsomething more than\u201d \u201ca mere failure to provide the \u2018free \nappropriate education\u2019 required by [the IDEA\u2019s predeces-\nsor].\u201d  Id.  Instead, Monahan concluded, \u201ceither bad faith \nor gross misjudgment should be shown before a \u00a7 504 vi-\nolation can be made out, at least in the context of \neducation of handicapped children.\u201d  Id. at 1171.  Lower \ncourts have consistently followed Monahan for decades.  \nSee Pet. 16-17. \nMonahan construed the text following this Court\u2019s \ndecision in Davis, which held that \u201c[n]either the language, \n\n16 \n \n \npurpose, nor history of \u00a7 504 reveals an intent to impose \nan affirmative-action obligation on all recipients of federal \nfunds.\u201d  Id. at 1170 (quoting 442 U.S. at 411).  Instead, \nSection 504 \u201crequires only that an \u2018otherwise qualified \nhandicapped individual\u2019 not be excluded from participa-\ntion in a federally funded program \u2018solely by reason of his \nhandicap.\u2019\u201d  442 U.S. at 405 (citation omitted).  While a \ncovered entity cannot deny an accommodation to someone \nbecause she has a disability, Section 504 does not \u201crefer at \nall to\u201d any freestanding \u201caffirmative action\u201d obligation.  \nId. at 410-11.  Davis thus rejected a Section 504 claim \nagainst a college because the college\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d in declin-\ning to accommodate an applicant with a disability was \nrooted in a \u201clegitimate academic policy,\u201d not \u201cany animus \nagainst handicapped individuals.\u201d  Id. at 413 & n.12.    \nConsistent with Davis, Monahan recognized that \nSection 504\u2019s text (like Title II\u2019s) cannot be \u201cread \u2026 as \ncreating general tort liability for educational malpractice\u201d \nwithout any showing of wrongful intent.  687 F.2d at 1170-\n71.  Both statutes zero in on the reason for the adverse \naction:  The plaintiff must show that the decision was \nmade \u201csolely by reason of\u201d (Section 504) or \u201cby reason of\u201d \n(Title II) the statutorily prohibited consideration (disabil-\nity), as opposed to legitimate reasons.  Absent such a \nshowing, Section 504 does not impose liability on federal-\nfunding recipients.  Nor does Title II\u2019s \u201cmaterially identi-\ncal prohibition.\u201d  Pet. Br. 24; accord U.S. Br. 3-4.   \n2.  Monahan also chose appropriate language to de-\nscribe the statutory intent requirement:  \u201cbad faith or \ngross misjudgment.\u201d   \n\u201cBad faith\u201d is the traditional legal label for actions \ntaken for an improper or unlawful reason.  When an action \nis lawful if taken for one reason, but unlawful if taken for \nanother, courts ask whether the action was taken in \u201cbad \n\n17 \n \n \nfaith.\u201d  A public law school acts in good faith when it de-\nnies admission to a blind applicant based on legitimate \ncriteria, for instance, his low LSAT score and GPA.  But \nthe law school acts in bad faith if it rejects the same appli-\ncant because of a statutorily forbidden reason\u2014his \nblindness.  Section 504 and Title II bar only such bad-faith \ndenials.    \nThe \u201cbad faith\u201d standard recurs throughout the law.  \nLegal dictionaries contemporaneous with Section 504\u2019s \npassage consistently equated bad faith with improper or \n\u201culterior purpose.\u201d  Ballentine\u2019s Law Dictionary 118 (3d \ned. 1969); see also, e.g., Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 176 (4th \ned. rev. 1968) (defining \u201cbad faith\u201d as \u201c[t]he opposite of \n\u2018good faith\u2019\u201d and \u201cnot prompted by an honest mistake as \nto one\u2019s rights or duties, but by some interested or sinister \nmotive\u201d). \nThis Court\u2019s cases reflect the same usage.  Take the \nredistricting context, where this Court asks whether dis-\ntrict lines were drawn for legitimate reasons or by \ndecisionmakers who \u201cacted in bad faith and engaged in in-\ntentional discrimination.\u201d  Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, \n607-08 (2018).  Similarly, when considering whether the \nIRS issued a summons for an \u201cimproper purpose\u201d or \u201cim-\nproper motive,\u201d this Court requires evidence indicating \n\u201cbad faith.\u201d  United States v. Clarke, 573 U.S. 248, 249-50, \n254-55 (2014).  And when determining whether improp-\nerly motivated court filings justify fee-shifting, courts \nagain look for \u201cbad faith.\u201d  Chambers v. NASCO, Inc., 501 \nU.S. 32, 46 & n.10 (1991) (citation omitted).  That use of \n\n18 \n \n \n\u201cbad faith\u201d to describe an improper purpose goes back \nover a century in the Federal Reporter.2 \nDemonstrating \u201cgross misjudgment\u201d is a traditional \nway of establishing that an action was taken for improper, \nbad-faith reasons.  As Monahan explained, standalone ev-\nidence that a decisionmaker made an incorrect decision \ndoes not typically demonstrate wrongful intent.  See 687 \nF.2d at 1170.  But the right facts can demonstrate \u201csuch \n[a] gross mistake as would necessarily imply bad \nfaith.\u201d  Sweeney v. United States, 109 U.S. 618, 620 (1883); \naccord Second Nat\u2019l Bank v. Pan-Am. Bridge Co., 183 F. \n391, 394-95 (6th Cir. 1910).  If a blind law-school applicant \ndenied admission shows that every other applicant with \nhis GPA and LSAT score was admitted, that might well \nsupport an inference of intentional discrimination.  \nMonahan therefore recognized that plaintiffs can \ndemonstrate intentional discrimination where the defend-\nant made a \u201cgross misjudgment,\u201d indicating that \u201cthe \nperson responsible actually did not base the decision on\u201d \nneutral, legitimate criteria.  687 F.2d at 1171 (citation \nomitted).  This Court has recognized the same principle in \nthe race-discrimination context:  Evidence that \u201cthe fac-\ntors usually considered important by the decisionmaker \n[would] strongly favor a decision contrary to the one \nreached\u201d \u201cmight afford evidence that improper purposes \n                                                 \n2 E.g., Penn Mut. Life Ins. Co. v. Mechs.\u2019 Sav. Bank & Tr. Co., 73 F. \n653, 654 (6th Cir. 1896) (Taft, J.) (describing \u201cbad faith\u201d as \u201can ordi-\nnary expression, the meaning of which is not doubtful,\u201d that means \n\u201cwith actual intent to mislead or deceive another\u201d); Overby v. Gordon, \n13 App. D.C. 392, 411 (D.C. Cir. 1898) (equating \u201c[b]ad faith\u201d with \n\u201cimproper purpose\u201d); Clark v. Nat\u2019l Linseed Oil Co., 105 F. 787, 790-\n91 (7th Cir. 1901) (same). \n \n\n19 \n \n \nare playing a role.\u201d  Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. \nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977).3    \nMonahan correctly drew on these longstanding con-\ncepts to describe Section 504\u2019s textual requirements.  To \ndemonstrate \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment,\u201d plaintiffs \nmust present \u201cfacts which would suggest the defendants \ndiscriminated.\u201d  Sellers ex rel. Sellers v. Sch. Bd. of City \nof Manassas, 141 F.3d 524, 529 (4th Cir. 1998).  Facts \ndemonstrating \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d are facts \nthat support \u201can inference of wrongful intent\u201d\u2014exactly \nwhat the statute requires.  See B.M., 732 F.3d at 888; see \nalso Pet.App.3a-4a.  The test simply restates the statute\u2019s \n\u201c[i]ntent [r]equirement.\u201d  See, e.g., M.Y. ex rel. J.Y. v. Spe-\ncial Sch. Dist. No. 1, 544 F.3d 885, 889 (8th Cir. 2008); \naccord Baker v. Bentonville Sch. Dist., 75 F.4th 810, 816 \n(8th Cir. 2023) (characterizing Monahan as a \u201cwrongful \nintent\u201d standard (citation omitted)). \n Federalism Principles Confirm Monahan \n1.  Section 504\u2019s status as Spending Clause legislation \nfurther confirms Monahan\u2019s interpretation of the text.  If \nCongress \u201cintends to impose a condition on the grant of \nfederal moneys, it must do so unambiguously.\u201d  \nPennhurst State Sch. & Hosp. v. Halderman, 451 U.S. 1, \n17 (1981).  That rule applies not just to damages liability, \nbut to the very \u201clegitimacy\u201d of any \u201ccondition on the grant \nof federal moneys.\u201d  Id.; contra U.S. Br. 18 n.2.  Clear no-\ntice is especially important here given that Section 504 \nviolations jeopardize all of a program\u2019s federal funds.  See \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a)-(b); 34 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 100.8, 104.61.   \n                                                 \n3 The brief in opposition (at 30) incorrectly suggests that \u201cgross mis-\njudgment\u201d might capture unintentional conduct.  Gross misjudgment \nis relevant only when it \u201cdemonstrate[s] that the defendant acted with \nwrongful intent.\u201d  See B.M. ex rel. Miller v. S. Callaway R-II Sch. \nDist., 732 F.3d 882, 887 (8th Cir. 2013).   \n\n20 \n \n \nAbsent clear statutory text, therefore, this Court \nshould not presume that Congress took the extraordinary \nstep of imposing liability on any federal-funding recipient \nwho acts in good faith yet fails to remedy unintentional \nbarriers to access.  On petitioner and the government\u2019s \ntelling, however, the federal government could sweep-\ningly withdraw all funding from any federally funded \nentity (like a university) for good-faith, nondiscriminatory \nfailures to accommodate (or here, a good-faith, uninten-\ntional IDEA violation).  See 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2); 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2000d-1.  That result would be startling, espe-\ncially when States that violate the IDEA risk only IDEA-\nspecific funding.  See 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1416(e)(2)-(3). \nMonahan\u2019s intent requirement avoids the notice \nproblem.  The Executive cannot bankrupt schools for \nmere mistakes.  And private parties cannot seek injunc-\ntive or damages relief based on good-faith disagreements.  \nOnly when the recipient intentionally discriminates \nagainst persons with disabilities will liability attach.  \nGiven that Section 504\u2019s text does not even mention rea-\nsonable accommodations, disparate impacts, or any other \ntheory of intent-free liability, any liability rule going be-\nyond \nMonahan\u2019s \nintent \nstandard \nraises \nserious \nconstitutional concerns.   \nAs for the ADA, it is unclear what constitutional au-\nthority Congress even has to force public schools to take \naffirmative actions, like hiring more teachers or extending \nthe school day.  The ADA is not Spending Clause legisla-\ntion.  Nor does the Commerce Clause give Congress the \nsweeping power to protect \u201cthe learning environment\u201d in \nour Nation\u2019s schools.  United States v. Lopez, 514 U.S. \n549, 564 (1995).  And Section 5 of the Fourteenth Amend-\nment \npermits \nonly \nlegislation \n\u201ccongruent \nand \nproportional to the targeted [Fourteenth Amendment] vi-\nolation.\u201d  Bd. of Trs. of Univ. of Ala. v. Garrett, 531 U.S. \n\n21 \n \n \n356, 374 (2001).  But the Equal Protection Clause does \n\u201cnot require[]\u201d the government to \u201cmake special accom-\nmodations for the disabled,\u201d id. at 367; it only prohibits \nconduct that lacks a rational basis, like decisions moti-\nvated by \u201ca bare \u2026 desire to harm.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. \nCleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 447 (1985) (citation \nomitted).  Monahan\u2019s interpretation avoids the problem, \nkeeping Title II\u2019s prohibition tightly linked to the Equal \nProtection Clause\u2019s intent standard.4  \n2.  Monahan\u2019s intent requirement also avoids major \nanticommandeering concerns.  The Constitution \u201chas \nnever been understood to confer upon Congress the abil-\nity to require the States to govern according to Congress\u2019 \ninstructions.\u201d  New York v. United States, 505 U.S. 144, \n162 (1992).  Title II\u2014which targets \u201cState [and] local gov-\nernment[s],\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(1)(A)\u2014therefore cannot \nbe read to \u201ccompel[]\u201d states to \u201cexpend \u2026 state funds\u201d to \naccommodate people with disabilities \u201cin accordance with \nfederal standards.\u201d  See Murphy v. NCAA, 584 U.S. 453, \n463, 476 (2018) (citation omitted).  Yet Title II offers none \nof the federal funding that Congress normally attaches to \naffirmative-accommodation mandates.  E.g., IDEA, 20 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1400 et seq.; Assistive Technology Act, 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3001 et seq.; Developmental Disabilities Assistance and \nBill of Rights Act, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15021 et seq.; AIDS Hous-\ning Opportunities Act, id. \u00a7 12901 et seq. \n                                                 \n4  In Tennessee v. Lane, this Court held that Title II was a valid exer-\ncise of Congress\u2019 Section 5 authority as applied to access to courts.  \n541 U.S. 509, 531 (2004).  The Court stated, however, that it was not \nconsidering \u201cTitle II\u2019s other applications.\u201d  Id. at 530-31, 532 n.20.  \nThe Court had previously held outside of the access-to-courts context \nthat extending Title I of the ADA beyond Cleburne\u2019s intentional-dis-\ncrimination core would \u201cfar exceed[]\u201d the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \nlimits.  Garrett, 531 U.S. at 372.   \n\n22 \n \n \nMonahan\u2019s intent requirement avoids this anticom-\nmandeering problem.  States and localities need only \nrefrain from basing their decisions on discriminatory rea-\nsons.  Monahan thus preserves Title II\u2019s role as a pure \nantidiscrimination measure that does not \u201cforc[e] the \nStates\u201d to expend their own funds or \u201cleave them with less \nmoney for other vital state programs.\u201d  See EEOC v. Wy-\noming, 460 U.S. 226, 237-40 (1983). \n3.  Additionally, Monahan respects \u201cStates\u2019 historical \nrole as the dominant authority responsible for providing \nservices to individuals with disabilities.\u201d  See Olmstead v. \nL.C. ex rel. Zimring, 527 U.S. 581, 625 (1999) (Thomas, J., \ndissenting).  \nCongress presumptively legislates with \u201cthe balance \nbetween federal and state power\u201d in mind.  U.S. Forest \nServ. v. Cowpasture River Pres. Ass\u2019n, 590 U.S. 604, 622 \n(2020).  Absent an intent requirement, States\u2019 uninten-\ntional violations of the IDEA, their good-faith choices to \ninvest in some assistive devices but not others, or their ex-\nercise of professional judgment to limit extra test-taking \ntime for students with learning disabilities would all be \nsubject to federal review and liability.  The same would be \ntrue for giving walkers instead of canes to prisoners with \ndisabilities or banning novel medical procedures.  This \nCourt should not lightly presume that Congress intended \nsuch \u201cfederal superintendence of \u2026 decisions tradition-\nally entrusted to state governance.\u201d  See Bowen v. Am. \nHosp. Ass\u2019n, 476 U.S. 610, 643 (1986) (plurality op.).   \nFederalism concerns are especially urgent in the \nschool context, where States \u201chistorically have been sov-\nereign.\u201d  Lopez, 514 U.S. at 564.  Schools make countless \nnondiscriminatory, safety-, academic-, and resource-\nbased decisions every day.  Inevitably, many of these \n\u201cneutral (and well-intentioned) policies disparately affect\u201d \nstudents with disabilities.  See Doe, 926 F.3d at 242.  Even \n\n23 \n \n \nwith notice, it is not always obvious what school policy or \naccommodation best serves students with disabilities \nwhile also fulfilling obligations to other students.     \nUnder Monahan\u2019s longstanding bad-faith standard, \ncourts do not second-guess \u201cthe application of expertise \nand the exercise of judgment by school authorities.\u201d  En-\ndrew F., 580 U.S. at 404.  Nor do schools with ballooning \nclass sizes and tight budgets need to \u201cshift scarce re-\nsources away from other\u201d students with critical needs \nbased on federal dictates.  See Bowen, 476 U.S. at 638 (plu-\nrality op.).  Instead, schools retain breathing room to \nmake good-faith judgment calls about how best to educate \nstudents without fearing liability should a court conclude \nthat \u201can incorrect evaluation has been made.\u201d  Monahan, \n687 F.2d at 1170.    \nUnder petitioner\u2019s view, however, Section 504 and Ti-\ntle II transform every unintentional IDEA violation into \na potential federal tort claim.  But Monahan rightly rec-\nognized that the statutory text cannot be read \u201cas \ncreating general tort liability for educational malprac-\ntice.\u201d  Id.  States have long rejected such a tort for \n\u201cfail[ure] to discover [a student\u2019s] disabilities\u201d or \u201cprovide \nan appropriate educational program once [the] disabilities \nare discovered.\u201d  D.S.W. v. Fairbanks N. Star Borough \nSch. Dist., 628 P.2d 554, 555 (Alaska 1981).  Such claims \ngenerate \u201cburdensome and expensive litigation\u201d and \u201cbla-\ntant[ly] interfere[] with the responsibility\u201d of \u201cschool \nadministrative agencies.\u201d  Id. at 555-56 (citations omit-\nted); see also Hunter v. Bd. of Educ. of Montgomery \nCnty., 439 A.2d 582, 583 (Md. 1982); Donohue v. Copiague \nUnion Free Sch. Dist., 391 N.E.2d 1352, 1354 (N.Y. 1979); \nPeter W. v. S.F. Unified Sch. Dist., 60 Cal. App. 3d 814, \n818 (1976).  Monahan correctly concluded that Section \n504 (and Title II) did not silently create a federal version \nof these disfavored state tort claims. \n\n24 \n \n \n \nPetitioner\u2019s Criticisms of Monahan Are Misguided \n1.  Petitioner (at 45) and the government (at 29) por-\ntray Monahan as a \u201cbespoke legal standard\u201d for \nschoolchildren with disabilities.  Such a standard, peti-\ntioner and the government say, violates the usual rule that \nstatutory provisions should carry a consistent meaning \nacross contexts.  Pet. Br. 25, 43-44; U.S. Br. 21-24. \nBut Monahan did not single out schoolchildren for \ndisfavored treatment.  Monahan recognizes that the \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard applies \u201cat least in \nthe context of education of handicapped children.\u201d  687 \nF.2d at 1171 (emphasis added).  There is nothing objec-\ntionable about a court limiting its decision to the fact \npattern at hand.  To be sure, the Eighth Circuit later in-\njected intent-free reasonable-accommodation claims \noutside the school context, based on this Court\u2019s dicta in \nChoate.  E.g., Stern v. Univ. of Osteopathic Med. & Health \nServs., 220 F.3d 906, 908 (8th Cir. 2000); see Pet.App.5a \nn.2.  But that subsequent dichotomy only calls into ques-\ntion the logic of these later cases.  It does not signal an \ninfirmity with Monahan\u2019s original interpretation. \nSimilarly, petitioner (at 12, 20, 22, 30-34, 43) and the \ngovernment (at 6-7, 10-12, 24, 28-32) invoke Section \n1415(l) of the IDEA, which mandates that \u201c[n]othing in \n[the IDEA] shall be construed to restrict or limit the \nrights, procedures, and remedies available under\u201d Section \n504 or Title II.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But Monahan\u2019s intent \nrequirement flows from Section 504 and Title II\u2019s text, \nand does not depend upon any reading of the IDEA.   \nPetitioner (at 11, 21, 31) and the government (at 31) \nseize on Monahan\u2019s statement that the court had a \u201cduty \nto harmonize the Rehabilitation Act and [the IDEA\u2019s pre-\ndecessor] to the fullest extent possible.\u201d  687 F.2d at 1171.  \n\n25 \n \n \nAccording to petitioner (at 31), that language demon-\nstrates that Monahan treated the IDEA\u2019s predecessor \n\u201cas an implicit constraint on Rehabilitation Act claims.\u201d  \nSimilarly, petitioner (at 45) accuses Monahan of \u201cin-\nvent[ing]\u201d its standard \u201con pure policy grounds.\u201d  \nBut as explained, Monahan\u2019s holding was based on \nSection 504\u2019s text, not the IDEA\u2019s predecessor statute.  \nSee Baker, 75 F.4th at 815 (\u201cJudge Richard Arnold [in \nMonahan] explained why the text of \u00a7 504 requires this \nlevel of proof\u201d (emphasis added)).  And in interpreting the \ntext, Monahan relied on Davis, a case that had nothing to \ndo with schoolchildren.  Monahan simply acknowledged \nthe limited \u201ccompetence of courts to make judgments in \ntechnical fields\u201d and observed that the bad-faith-or-gross-\nmisjudgment standard \u201caccomplishes th[e] result\u201d of har-\nmonizing the statutes.  687 F.2d at 1171 (emphasis added).  \nCourts can properly observe the salutary policy benefits \nof their textual analysis.  And there is nothing exceptional \nin Monahan\u2019s recognition that courts should hesitate to \ninject themselves into educational disputes.  This Court \ntoo cautions courts not to \u201csubstitute their own notions of \nsound educational policy for those of the school authori-\nties which they review.\u201d  See Endrew F., 580 U.S. at 404 \n(citation omitted).   \n2.  Petitioner (at 39) and the government (at 26-28) \nclaim that Monahan sets the bar too high.  But whether \nSection 504 and Title II are too demanding is a question \nfor Congress, not courts.  See Loper Bright Enters. v. Rai-\nmondo, 603 U.S. 369, 403-04 (2024).  In any event, \nMonahan\u2019s bad-faith standard is hardly insuperable.    \nMonahan does not require smoking-gun evidence of \ndiscriminatory intent.  A plaintiff may demonstrate im-\nproper purpose by presenting circumstantial evidence \nthat the school acted based on discriminatory reasons.  \nFor instance, the Eighth Circuit has held that, in \u201csome \n\n26 \n \n \ncircumstances, notice of a student\u2019s disability coupled \nwith delay in implementing accommodations can show \nbad faith or gross misjudgment,\u201d because undue delay can \nindicate \u201cwrongful intent.\u201d  B.M., 732 F.3d at 888; see also \nR.B. ex rel. L.B. v. Bd. of Educ. of City of N.Y., 99 F. Supp. \n2d 411, 419 (S.D.N.Y. 2000) (bad faith sufficiently alleged \nby delays in implementing IEP and remedial order).  A \nschool\u2019s failure to respond to the safety concerns of a stu-\ndent with a disability might also indicate \u201cdiscriminatory \nintent.\u201d  See M.P. ex rel. K. v. Indep. Sch. Dist. No. 271, \n326 F.3d 975, 982-83 (8th Cir. 2003).  And, of course, fa-\ncially discriminatory policies\u2014like counting only non-\nspecial-education classes toward graduation require-\nments\u2014can establish bad faith.  See Douglass v. District \nof Columbia, 605 F. Supp. 2d 156, 168 (D.D.C. 2009).   \nConversely, the bad-faith standard weeds out \u201cfruit-\nless \nchallenges \nto \nlegitimate, \nand \nutterly \nnondiscriminatory, distinctions.\u201d  See Doe, 926 F.3d at \n242.  Consider this case.  Both courts below held that the \nDistrict did not intentionally violate the IDEA.  \nPet.App.4a, 33a-34a.  Petitioner also has presented no ev-\nidence indicating that the District discriminated \u201cby \nreason of disability\u201d in making many accommodations for \nAva, but not her preferred ones or the ones the district \ncourt later determined the IDEA required.   \nAs the Eighth Circuit held, the District\u2019s responses to \nAva\u2019s requests\u2014which did not involve \u201cignor[ing] [her] \nneeds\u201d or any \u201cdelay [in] its efforts to address them\u201d\u2014\n\u201cdo not show wrongful intent.\u201d  Pet.App.4a.  Even now, \npetitioner (at 15-16) claims only that the District\u2019s \u201cpre-\nvailing and paramount consideration\u201d was \u201cto safeguard \nthe ordinary end-of-the-workday departure times for its \nfaculty and staff.\u201d  Good-faith disputes over how best to \nserve all children\u2019s needs should not support liability. \n\n27 \n \n \nII. Petitioner\u2019s Interpretation Is Incorrect \nPetitioner (at 30 n.7) asks this Court to reject an \n\u201casymmetric\u201d liability rule without deciding what the cor-\nrect rule should be.  But in the same breath, petitioner \nembraces an asymmetric scheme with an atextual no-in-\ntent standard for liability and injunctive relief and \nanother atextual \u201cdeliberate indifference\u201d standard for \ndamages.   \nThis Court should not erase the longstanding \u201cbad \nfaith or gross misjudgment\u201d standard that prevails in five \ncircuits governing twenty-two States, 46,000 public \nschools, and 22 million students and leave nothing in its \nplace.  This case squarely presents the question of what \nstandard applies.  And the courts-of-appeals cases are dis-\nuniform, textually unsupported, and reflect the chaos and \nintrusion on federalism that arise when courts make up \nliability rules. \n This Court Should Decide the Appropriate Standard \nIn asking this Court to grant review, petitioner con-\ncluded:  \u201cWhat standard should apply under the ADA \nand Rehabilitation Act is a pure question of law.  That \nquestion is cleanly presented and exceedingly important.  \nIt should be resolved in this case.\u201d  Pet. 33 (emphases \nadded); id. at 30 (\u201cThe Court should grant review to en-\nforce the plain meaning of the ADA and Rehabilitation \nAct.\u201d).  Respondents joined issue on that question in op-\nposing certiorari, challenging petitioner\u2019s \u201crule, under \nwhich plaintiffs could obtain injunctive relief (and poten-\ntially damages) without any showing of intentional \ndiscrimination.\u201d  See, e.g., BIO 28.   \nNow petitioner backtracks.  She (at 30 n.7) implores \nthe Court not to opine on any standards, leaving schools, \nteachers, and parents with no idea what the law requires \n\n28 \n \n \nand leaving the lower courts (including on remand here) \nto muddle through what standard governs.    \nBut petitioner\u2019s own question presented (at i) puts the \ncorrect standard squarely on the table.  Petitioner asked \nthis Court to decide whether Section 504 and Title II re-\nquire \u201cchildren with disabilities to satisfy a uniquely \nstringent \u2018bad faith or gross misjudgment standard.\u2019\u201d  To \nsay that courts should offer children with disabilities the \nsame standard as everyone else\u2014whatever that standard \nmay be\u2014is utterly non-responsive. \nThe government (at 31) calls any across-the-board de-\nfense of \u201cbad faith or gross misjudgment\u201d \u201cnot directly \nresponsive to the question presented\u201d because petitioner \ndescribed that standard as \u201cuniquely stringent.\u201d  But the \ngovernment (at I) puts no qualifiers in its question pre-\nsented, recognizing that this case is about whether the \nstatutes \u201crequire students with disabilities to prove that \ndefendants acted with \u2018bad faith or gross misjudgment.\u2019\u201d  \nAnd petitioner\u2019s adjectival description does not change \nthe scope of the case.  If petitioner had phrased the ques-\ntion presented as whether plaintiffs must meet the \n\u201cpatently erroneous bad-faith standard,\u201d this Court would \nnot be bound to decide only whether courts may impose \n\u201cpatently erroneous\u201d standards.  The crux of the question \npresented is still what the standard is, not whether a \n\u201cuniquely stringent\u201d standard is permissible.   \nThe decision below rests on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s hold-\ning that Ava failed to \u201cdemonstrate[] wrongful intent,\u201d as \ncircuit precedent required.  Pet.App.4a (citation omitted).  \nPetitioner does not challenge that holding.  The court\u2019s \nfootnoted summary of what rules might apply in other \ncontexts is dictum and thus \u201cbeside the point.\u201d  \nPet.App.5a n.2; see Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, 604 U.S. 22, 42 (2025).  Determining whether \nthat judgment should be affirmed requires determining \n\n29 \n \n \nwhether Monahan\u2019s longstanding intent requirement is \nin fact good law.5    \nRegardless, petitioner (at 10) is incorrect that the \ncourts of appeals \u201clargely agree\u201d on the standards for dis-\nability-discrimination claims outside the school context.  \nThe Sixth Circuit holds that Section 504 \u201cdoes not encom-\npass actions taken for nondiscriminatory reasons.\u201d  Doe, \n926 F.3d at 242.  And while petitioner (at 10 n.2) collects \ncases adopting a deliberate-indifference standard for \ndamages, the Fifth Circuit rejects that standard outright \nand correctly requires \u201cintentional discrimination.\u201d  \nDelano-Pyle v. Victoria County, 302 F.3d 567, 575 (5th \nCir. 2002); see also J.W. v. Paley, 81 F.4th 440, 449-50 (5th \nCir. 2023).  And the First Circuit has left \u201copen\u201d the ques-\ntion \u201cwhether a showing of deliberate indifference is \nenough.\u201d  Gray v. Cummings, 917 F.3d 1, 17 (1st Cir. \n2019).  Declining to resolve the standard here would \nsimply import that confusion and disagreement into the \nschool context.   \nAt minimum, this Court should resolve the appropri-\nate standard for damages under Section 504 and Title II.  \nCompensatory damages are the critical form of relief \navailable under these statutes but not the IDEA, see BIO \n22-26; supra p. 5, and disagreement over the correct \n                                                 \n5 The parties\u2019 live dispute over Monahan\u2019s bad-faith standard distin-\nguishes this case from Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, \nNo. 23-1039 (discussed at Pet. Br. 28), where the Sixth Circuit held \nthat majority-group Title VII plaintiffs must satisfy an additional \npleading requirement not applicable to minority-group plaintiffs.  87 \nF.4th 822, 825 (6th Cir. 2023).  There, respondent concedes that \u201cthe \nexact language\u201d of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s standard is wrong and instead \nurges the Court to \u201cconstrue that language\u201d to be \u201cconsistent\u201d with \nthe standard applied elsewhere.  Ames Oral Arg. Tr. 43.  But here, \nthe District argues that the Eighth Circuit correctly requires bad \nfaith and urges the Court to confirm that the same intent requirement \napplies to all Section 504 and Title II discrimination claims.   \n\n30 \n \n \nstandard for imposing damages is the crux of the circuit \nsplit, BIO 18-21.  Leaving the damages standard unre-\nsolved would thus be particularly chaos-inducing in the \nlower courts.  \n Deliberate Indifference Is Not the Appropriate Dam-\nages Standard  \nPetitioner accepts a bizarre two-track regime:  no in-\ntent required for injunctive relief; deliberate indifference \nfor damages.  While endorsing the first half of that \nscheme as \u201cclearly correct\u201d (at 30 n.7), petitioner conspic-\nuously declines to say whether, and if so why, her \ndamages claims should be treated differently from her re-\nquest for an injunction.  Petitioner\u2019s silence is telling.  It \nmakes no sense for courts to make up one rule for Section \n504 and Title II liability and injunctions, but use a differ-\nent rule for damages; the text requires that Title VI\u2019s \nintent standard apply across the board.  At bottom, peti-\ntioner and the government pay lip service to the text, but \nask this Court to greenlight an atextual, confusing, and \nasymmetric regime. \n1.  The lower courts adopting a heightened standard \nfor damages explain that, because Section 504 incorpo-\nrates \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and rights\u201d of Title VI, \n29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794a(a)(2), Title VI\u2019s remedial standards ap-\nply.  E.g., Eastman v. Va. Polytechnic Inst. & State Univ., \n939 F.2d 204, 206 (4th Cir. 1991); Bartlett v. N.Y. State Bd. \nof L. Exam\u2019rs, 156 F.3d 321, 331 (2d Cir. 1998).  Because \nTitle VI permits damages only in cases of intentional dis-\ncrimination, the same showing is required under Section \n504 and Title II.  E.g., Meagley v. City of Little Rock, 639 \nF.3d 384, 389 (8th Cir. 2011).   \nThat conclusion is undeniably correct, but it also \nmeans that intentional discrimination should be required \n\n31 \n \n \nfor any and all relief, including injunctions, not just dam-\nages.  Title VI is a \u201cban on intentional discrimination.\u201d  \nSandoval, 532 U.S. at 284.  If the incorporation of Title VI \nrequires intent for damages, it equally requires intent for \ninjunctive relief.  And if the incorporation of Title VI re-\nquires intent to obtain any relief, it should equally require \nintent to establish liability.   \nThe government (at 18 n.2) suggests that disparate \nremedial standards are appropriate because Section 504 \nis Spending Clause legislation and damages more \nsquarely implicate the \u201ccentral concern\u201d of imposing un-\nannounced \nmonetary \npenalties \non \nfederal-funding \nrecipients.  But injunctions can be just as unannounced \nand harsh and cost just as much, if not more.  Here, for \nexample, petitioner requests injunctive relief that she ar-\ngues the IDEA does not require.  Cert. Reply 9-10 & n.3.  \nThe government\u2019s further suggestion that covered enti-\nties give up millions in federal funding is perverse and \nraises serious constitutional concerns.  Supra pp. 19-21.   \nIn any event, the government\u2019s purported policy con-\ncerns cannot justify flouting the plain text of Section 504, \nincluding its wholesale incorporation of Title VI rights \nand remedies.  As petitioner (at 21-30, 35-37) and the gov-\nernment (at 21-24) repeatedly underscore, statutory text \nmust mean the same thing across contexts.  The same \nstatutory language (either \u201csolely by reason of \u2026 disabil-\nity\u201d or \u201c[t]he remedies, procedures, and rights set forth in \nTitle VI\u201d) cannot require \u201cno intent whatsoever\u201d for lia-\nbility and injunctive relief but require \u201cdeliberate \nindifference\u201d for damages.  Whatever intent rule applies \nunder Section 504 and Title II claims should apply to all \naspects of those claims equally. \n2.  Moreover, the courts of appeals have never justi-\nfied why, since Title VI is unquestionably the place to \nlook, deliberate indifference could be the appropriate \n\n32 \n \n \nstandard.  Again, Title VI unambiguously covers only in-\ntentional discrimination.  Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 280; see \nStudents for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President & Fel-\nlows of Harv. Coll., 600 U.S. 181, 288-90 (2023) (Gorsuch, \nJ., concurring).  This Court has never adopted a deliber-\nate-indifference standard under Title VI.  \nInstead, courts of appeals have incorporated the de-\nliberate-indifference standard from Title IX cases \ninvolving supervisory liability for sexual harassment that \nlong postdate Section 504 and Title II\u2019s enactment.  But \nthere, defendants were liable for someone else\u2019s inten-\ntional discrimination.  Gebser v. Lago Vista Indep. Sch. \nDist., 524 U.S. 274, 292 (1998); Davis ex rel. LaShonda D. \nv. Monroe Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 526 U.S. 629, 643-44 (1999).  \nNeither petitioner nor the government cites any case ap-\nplying deliberate indifference outside the supervisory-\nliability context.  The Justice Department\u2019s Title IX man-\nual says to generally follow Title VI precedents and \ndescribes deliberate-indifference as applying in sexual-\nharassment cases.  U.S. Dep\u2019t of Justice, Title IX Legal \nManual \n\u00a7\u00a7 I, \nIV.D.2 \n(updated \nJan. \n31, \n2025), \nhttps://www.justice.gov/crt/title-ix. \nWhen plaintiffs claim that a defendant itself directly \ndiscriminated, it makes little sense to ask whether the de-\nfendant was deliberately indifferent to its own \ndiscrimination.  Instead, the question in the mine-run Ti-\ntle IX case is whether the defendant engaged in \n\u201cintentional sex discrimination.\u201d  Jackson v. Birmingham \nBd. of Educ., 544 U.S. 167, 183 (2005).  Likewise, the ques-\ntion here is whether the District engaged in intentional \ndisability discrimination. \nThe government (at 15, 19) calls deliberate indiffer-\nence an \u201cexacting standard\u201d and a form of \u201cdiscriminatory \nintent\u201d (citation omitted).  Respondents agree that delib-\nerate indifference (if it applies) should be a demanding \n\n33 \n \n \ntest, and certainly welcome a holding that discriminatory \nintent is required.  But what the government (at 19-20) \napparently envisions is only knowledge liability.   \nAccording to the government (at 19), damages are \navailable if defendants had \u201c\u2018actual knowledge\u2019 of the sub-\nstantial likelihood of discrimination\u201d and \u201cfail[ed] to act \ndespite that knowledge\u201d (cleaned up).  Yet all sorts of non-\ndiscriminatory reasons might explain why defendants \nfailed to act.  A municipality might decline to pave a trail \nthrough a protected wetland to protect a fragile ecosys-\ntem, despite knowing that wheelchair users will be unable \nto access the trail.  A small town might be unable to afford \nan elevator for city hall\u2019s clocktower, despite knowing that \nmobility-impaired citizens will be unable go to the top.  Or \na public hospital might bar a blind visitor\u2019s service animal \nfrom a sterile ward, even if that means knowingly exclud-\ning the visitor.  Without Monahan\u2019s intent requirement, \npublic entities and federal-funding recipients would face \nthe very sweeping damages liability for good-faith deci-\nsions that the government purports to disclaim. \nThe government\u2019s embrace (at 19) of a \u201csubstantial \nlikelihood of discrimination\u201d standard is particularly trou-\nbling \nbecause \nthe \ngovernment \nnever \ndefines \n\u201csubstantial.\u201d  The government does not say whether \ndamages are available if a defendant concludes that an ac-\ncommodation would be unreasonable but its lawyers \nassess a 40% probability that a court might disagree.  Or \nperhaps the lawyers must assess litigation risks at 60% or \n80%.  Could petitioner argue here that the District was \ndeliberately indifferent if it believed in good faith that it \nwas complying with the IDEA but foresaw some uniden-\ntified risk that an ALJ might disagree? \n3.  The deliberate-indifference standard is meritless \nalso given Congress\u2019 remedial scheme in other ADA pro-\nvisions.  In Title I, which covers employers, Congress \n\n34 \n \n \nlimited damages to cases of \u201cintentional discrimination,\u201d \nas opposed to a \u201cpractice that is unlawful because of its \ndisparate impact.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1981a(a)(2).  That intent \nstandard is what the text says:  an intent standard.  We \nknow of no case applying a deliberate-indifference test.  \nSee Raytheon Co. v. Hernandez, 540 U.S. 44, 49 n.3 (2003) \n(observing that courts of appeals \u201cconsistently\u201d use the \nMcDonnell Douglas intent test under Title I).  And in Ti-\ntle III, which covers public accommodations, Congress \nforeclosed private damages suits altogether, whether the \ndefendant intentionally discriminated or not.  See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 12188.   \nYet under petitioner and the government\u2019s view, only \nfederal-funding recipients and public entities face dam-\nages liability with a showing of deliberate indifference, not \nintent.  In other words, public school districts like the Dis-\ntrict would face more liability under Title II of the ADA \nthan employers under Title I or private schools under Ti-\ntle III.  A private school could knowingly exclude a \nstudent with a disability from a field trip with no damages \nliability under Title III.  Yet a public school engaged in \nidentical conduct could face a damages claim under Title \nII.  That regime makes no sense from a textual and feder-\nalism perspective and disrespects Congress\u2019 carefully \ncalibrated policy choices in Titles I and III about when to \nimpose damages liability. \n \n\u201cNo Intent\u201d Is Not the Appropriate Liability Stand-\nard  \nAs for liability, petitioner (at 29, 30 n.7) and the gov-\nernment (at 13) embrace the view that no showing of \nintent is required.  The statutes\u2019 text, structure, and other \nprovisions definitively refute that reading.  As Judge Sut-\nton has explained, the text simply does not encompass \n\u201cactions taken for nondiscriminatory reasons.\u201d  Doe, 926 \nF.3d at 242.   \n\n35 \n \n \nText.  As Monahan recognized, Congress chose the \nphrase \u201cby reason of\u201d\u2014language that focuses on the rea-\nson for a decision.  \u201cReason\u201d means \u201c[t]he basis or motive \nfor an action, decision, or conviction.\u201d  American Heritage \nDictionary of the English Language 1086 (1969).  Liabil-\nity turns upon whether the protected characteristic (here, \ndisability) \u201cwas the \u2018reason\u2019 the [defendant] decided to \nact.\u201d  Gross v. FBL Fin. Servs., 557 U.S. 167, 176 (2009); \ncf. Jones v. Governor of Fla., 975 F.3d 1016, 1045 (11th \nCir. 2020) (en banc) (plurality op. of Pryor, C.J.) (\u201cby rea-\nson of\u201d in the Twenty-Fourth Amendment considers \u201cthe \nreason for the State\u2019s action\u201d). \nThe statutes\u2019 prohibition on \u201cdiscrimination\u201d rein-\nforces the focus on intent.  To \u201cdiscriminate\u201d means to \n\u201cact on the basis of prejudice\u201d or to \u201cmake a difference in \ntreatment or favor (of one as compared with others).\u201d  \nAmerican Heritage 376; Webster\u2019s New International \nDictionary of the English Language 745 (2d ed. 1951); see \nStudents for Fair Admissions, 600 U.S. at 288 (Gorsuch, \nJ., concurring).  Thus, in the context of Title IX\u2019s similarly \nphrased prohibition, \u201cthe normal definition of discrimina-\ntion is differential treatment.\u201d  Jackson, 544 U.S. at 174 \n(cleaned up).   \nPassive Voice.  Section 504 and Title II\u2019s passive \nvoice cannot overcome that focus on intent.  Title VI (on \nwhich Section 504 was based), Title IX, and the Age Dis-\ncrimination Act use materially identical passive-voice \nphrasing, yet those statutes indisputably require intent.  \nInfra p. 41.   \nThe government (at 13) cites an irrelevant criminal \ncase about passive voice, Dean v. United States, 556 U.S. \n568, 572 (2009).  Dean construed the phrase \u201cif the firearm \nis discharged\u201d not to require the defendant\u2019s intentional \nor knowing discharge of a firearm.  Id.  But that statute \nreferenced no mental state at all.  If the provision in Dean \n\n36 \n \n \nhad stated that \u201cif, by reason of malice, the firearm is dis-\ncharged,\u201d it would have been plain that the defendant \nmust discharge the firearm with malicious intent.     \nThis Court has already rejected the view that the de-\nfendant\u2019s intent is irrelevant under Section 504.  As \ndiscussed, Davis zeroes in on the defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose\u201d \nin refusing a requested accommodation.  Supra pp. 15-16.  \nAnd in Bowen, a plurality of this Court rejected a Section \n504 challenge to a hospital\u2019s denial of care to an infant with \na disability.  Bowen too focused on why the hospital denied \ncare.  The plurality explained that \u201cthe failure of [a] hos-\npital to \u2026 provide [a] treatment because of the \nunavailability of medical equipment or expertise would \nnot be \u2018on the basis of the handicap\u2019 but on the fact that \nthe hospital is incapable of providing the treatment.\u201d  476 \nU.S. at 630 n.15 (cleaned up).  \nThis Court has repeatedly looked at the defendant\u2019s \nintent in other statutes that similarly pair the passive \nvoice with motive-focused language and verbs like \u201cde-\nnied.\u201d  Take Wimberly v. Labor & Industrial Relations \nCommission, 479 U.S. 511 (1987), where this Court con-\nsidered a passive-voice bar on pregnancy discrimination.  \nThe statute there provided that \u201cno person shall be denied \ncompensation under such State law solely on the basis of \npregnancy or termination of pregnancy.\u201d  Id. at 514 (quot-\ning 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3304(a)(12)).  Despite the passive voice, the \nCourt explained that \u201c[t]he focus of th[e] language is on \nthe basis for the State\u2019s decision.\u201d  Id. at 516.  Thus, the \nprovision did not prohibit the State from applying a neu-\ntral rule that \u201cincidentally disqualifies pregnant \u2026 \nclaimants.\u201d  Id. at 517.  Indeed, Wimberly expressly anal-\nogized to Section 504, noting that the Rehabilitation Act \nsimply \u201cprohibit[s] disadvantageous treatment\u201d and does \n\n37 \n \n \nnot \u201cmandate \u2018affirmative efforts to overcome the disabil-\nities caused by handicaps.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 517-18 (quoting Davis, \n442 U.S. at 410).   \nSimilarly, in Husted v. A. Philip Randolph Institute, \nthis Court interpreted the Help America Vote Act\u2019s di-\nrective that no voting \u201cregistrant may be removed solely \nby reason of a failure to vote.\u201d  584 U.S. 756, 768 (2018) \n(quoting 52 U.S.C. \u00a7 21083(a)(4)(A)).  That text, the Court \nexplained, considered the \u201creason\u201d for which the State re-\nmoves a voter from the rolls.  Id.  Again, the statutory text \nfocused on the defendant\u2019s motive, notwithstanding the \npassive voice. \nMoreover, Section 504 and Title II define individuals \nwith a \u201cdisability\u201d to include people without a disability \nwho are \u201cregarded as having\u201d a disability.  See 29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 705(20)(B); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12102(1).  The only logical actor \nwho could \u201cregard[]\u201d someone as having a disability is the \nentity that allegedly discriminated.  The focus on the en-\ntity\u2019s perception thus confirms Congress\u2019 focus on the \nreason for the entity\u2019s decision, not simply the effect on \nthe plaintiff.   \nStatutory Structure.  Treating Section 504 and Title \nII as affirmatively requiring federal-funding recipients \nand public entities to make special accommodations and \navoid good-faith disparate impacts on the disabled also de-\nfies both statutes\u2019 larger scheme.   \nAs originally enacted, the Rehabilitation Act con-\ntained over 50 sections, which detailed numerous state-\nrun programs to help people with disabilities.  See Pub. L. \nNo. 93-112, 87 Stat. 355 (1973).  Title I of that Act supports \nemployment programs, Title II offers \u201cresearch and \ntraining\u201d projects, and Title III supports \u201cspecial pro-\njects\u201d to construct new facilities and implement new \nservices.  Section 504 appears at the very end and is titled \n\n38 \n \n \n\u201cNondiscrimination Under Federal Grants.\u201d  Yet on peti-\ntioner and the government\u2019s view, Section 504 apparently \nsubsumes the rest of the Rehabilitation Act, compelling \nStates to take all of the same affirmative actions detailed \nelsewhere in the statute to ensure equal access to pro-\ngramming.   \nCongress\u2019 intent not to create intent-free reasonable-\naccommodation claims is especially clear in Title II of the \nADA.  The ADA\u2019s two other main titles both do so ex-\npressly.  Titles I and III require employers and public \naccommodations to make affirmative accommodations.  \nSee 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12112(b)(5)(A) (\u201creasonable accommoda-\ntions\u201d); \nid. \n\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv) \n(\u201creasonable \nmodifications\u201d and \u201cfailure[s] to\u201d perform certain acts).  \nAnd Titles I and III create intent-free disparate-impact \nliability by expressly barring \u201cstandards, criteria, or \nmethods of administration \u2026 that have the effect of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of disability\u201d or \u201ctend to screen \nout \u2026 any class of individuals with disabilities.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 12112(b)(3)(A), (b)(6), 12182(b)(1)(D)(i), (b)(2)(A)(i) \n(emphases added).   \nTitles I and III, by their text, thus expressly reach \nreasonable-accommodation and disparate-impact claims \nwithout any required showing of intent, as courts widely \nrecognize.  E.g., Punt v. Kelly Servs., 862 F.3d 1040, 1048 \n(10th Cir. 2017) (Title I); Lentini v. Cal. Ctr. for the Arts, \nEscondido, 370 F.3d 837, 846-47 (9th Cir. 2004) (Title III).   \nYet in Section 504 and Title II, Congress conspicu-\nously omitted similar language.  Congress\u2019 use of \u201cclear \nand direct terms\u201d to impose those species of liability in \nother titles of the ADA itself strongly signals that Con-\ngress did not impose intent-free liability in Title II.  See \nUniv. of Tex. Sw. Med. Ctr. v. Nassar, 570 U.S. 338, 357 \n(2013); cf. Olmstead, 527 U.S. at 622 (Thomas, J., dissent-\ning).  That choice makes eminent sense given Title II\u2019s \n\n39 \n \n \nfocus on States and localities.  Congress appropriately af-\nforded States and localities greater solicitude than the \ncoffee shops, movie theaters, hot-dog stands, and employ-\ners covered by Titles I and III.     \nTitles I and III also illustrate the careful limitations \nthat Congress imposes when it does away with an intent \nrequirement.  Because accommodating disabilities inevi-\ntably carries costs, regulated parties have never been \nrequired to go beyond that which is \u201creasonable.\u201d  Title I \nrequires only \u201creasonable accommodations,\u201d provides ex-\namples of what is \u201creasonable,\u201d and specifies the \u201cfactors \nto be considered\u201d in \u201cdetermining whether an accommo-\ndation\u201d is not required because of \u201cundue hardship.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 12111(9)-(10), 12112(b)(5)(A).  Title III similarly \ndoes not require accommodations that would \u201cresult in an \nundue burden\u201d or \u201cfundamentally alter the nature\u201d of the \ngood or service offered, and only requires structural \nchanges if such changes are \u201creadily achievable.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 12182(b)(2)(A)(ii)-(iv).   \nYet Section 504 and Title II\u2014which never mention a \nreasonable-accommodation \nrequirement\u2014provide \nno \ncomparable guidance for federal-funding recipients and \npublic entities.  Here, petitioner presumably thinks it was \nreasonable for the District to provide at-home evening in-\nstruction.  But if a student were unable to start her school \nday until 8:30 p.m., would the school district need to hire \na night-shift teacher to provide overnight instruction?  \nSection 504 and Title II\u2019s text certainly do not say.6 \n                                                 \n6 While the Department of Justice\u2019s regulations define a \u201creasonable \naccommodation\u201d standard under Section 504 and Title II, e.g., 28 \nC.F.R. pt. 35, the government conspicuously avoids citing those reg-\nulations outside its statement of interest.  But see Pet. Br. 7 (relying \n \n\n40 \n \n \nUnsurprisingly, courts jettisoning an intent require-\nment have found themselves at sea when attempting to \ndefine what accommodations are required.  The Ninth \nCircuit defers to the plaintiff\u2019s proposed request.  See Du-\nvall v. County of Kitsap, 260 F.3d 1124, 1137 (9th Cir. \n2001).  The Third Circuit held a school liable even though \nthe school provided every accommodation the student re-\nquested, because the school failed to \u201cproactively\u201d spot \npotential affirmative measures.  Culley v. Cumberland \nValley Sch. Dist., 758 F. App\u2019x 301, 306 (3d Cir. \n2018).  And the Seventh Circuit requires judges to balance \n\u201csubjective\u201d and \u201cintangible values\u201d in determining what \nis \u201creasonable.\u201d  Wis. Cmty. Servs., Inc. v. City of Mil-\nwaukee, 465 F.3d 737, 752 (7th Cir. 2006) (en banc).  The \nFourth Circuit, by contrast, focuses on objective criteria \nand evaluates whether a requested accommodation was \n\u201creasonable on its face.\u201d  Richardson v. Clarke, 52 F.4th \n614, 619 (4th Cir. 2022).  Needless to say, none of these \nstandards appears in the statutory text. \nIndeed, it is far from clear why every IDEA violation \nwould not state a potential Section 504 and Title II claim \non petitioner and the government\u2019s view.  Plaintiffs would \npresumably argue that a free appropriate public educa-\ntion is a \u201cbenefit[]\u201d offered by school districts.  29 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 794(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12132.  And if all \u201cby reason of\u201d re-\nquires is proximate causation, U.S. Br. 13, then the denial \nof a free appropriate public education seemingly meets \nthe other side\u2019s test; the school\u2019s failure to comply with \nthe IDEA has caused the plaintiff to be \u201cdenied\u201d that \n\u201cbenefit.\u201d  29 U.S.C. \u00a7 794(a).  The IDEA does not \u201climit \nthe rights, procedures, and remedies available under\u201d the \nRehabilitation Act and the ADA.  20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(l).  But \n                                                 \non the regulations).  The government presumably makes that omis-\nsion because the regulations do not even purport to interpret the \nstatutory text.  See Loper Bright, 603 U.S. at 412-13. \n\n41 \n \n \nit defies credulity that Congress intended to transmute \nevery unintentional IDEA violation into a Section 504 and \nTitle II claim, with the threat of damages to boot.   \nOther Spending Clause Statutes.  Petitioner\u2019s in-\ntent-free regime is also implausible given that Section 504 \n\u201cwas patterned after Title VI.\u201d  Cmty. Television of S. \nCal. v. Gottfried, 459 U.S. 498, 509 (1983); see Doe, 926 \nF.3d at 242.  Much like Section 504 and Title II, Title VI \nprovides that no person shall \u201cbe excluded from participa-\ntion in, be denied the benefits of, or be subjected to \ndiscrimination\u201d \u201con the ground of\u201d a protected character-\nistic (there, race) in federally funded programs.  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2000d.  Title IX and the Age Discrimination Act bar \nidentical conduct \u201con the basis of\u201d sex and age.  20 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1681(a); 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 6102. \nThis Court has already held that Title VI, notwith-\nstanding its passive voice, reaches \u201conly instances of \nintentional discrimination.\u201d  Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 281 (ci-\ntation omitted).  Likewise, Title IX prohibits only \n\u201cintentional discrimination on the basis of sex.\u201d  Jackson, \n544 U.S. at 178; Sandoval, 532 U.S. at 282 & n.2.  And no \ncircuit since Sandoval has read the materially identical \nlanguage in the Age Discrimination Act to prohibit more \nthan intentional discrimination.  See, e.g., Kamps v. Bay-\nlor Univ., 592 F. App\u2019x 282, 285 (5th Cir. 2014); Doe, 926 \nF.3d at 240.  Treating disability discrimination as the one \nsetting where Congress jettisoned an intent require-\nment\u2014even though race and sex are constitutionally \nsuspect classes and the relevant text is materially identi-\ncal\u2014is nonsensical.  \nAbsurd Results.  The government\u2019s passive-voice ar-\ngument also proves far too much.  No one thinks that \nSection 504 and Title II require entities to make unrea-\nsonable accommodations.  Pet. Br. 7; U.S. Br. 20.  Yet on \n\n42 \n \n \nthe government\u2019s view, Section 504 and Title II are vio-\nlated whenever an individual with a disability suffers a \nstatutory \u201cadverse effect\u201d that \u201chas a sufficient causal link \nto[] that individual\u2019s disability.\u201d  U.S. Br. 13.   \nThat reading of the text imposes no reasonableness \nrequirement.  If a student\u2019s wheelchair breaks at home \nand she is unable to come to class, the school would appar-\nently be liable if it does not rush over a repairman before \nfirst bell.  The student otherwise will have suffered an \u201cad-\nverse effect\u201d (the inability to go to school) that was \nproximately caused by her disability.  And if the school \nknew about the broken wheelchair and failed to act expe-\nditiously, that inaction could apparently amount to \ndeliberate indifference and damages liability too.   \nPetitioner (at 7) attempts to jury-rig a reasonableness \nlimitation from other sources.  She says that courts have \n\u201cuniformly understood\u201d Section 504 to license reasonable-\naccommodation claims, citing this Court\u2019s decisions in \nChoate, Fry, and Davis.  But Choate \u201cassume[d] without \ndeciding\u201d that Section 504 reaches at least some uninten-\ntional acts.  469 U.S. at 299.7  And Fry merely observed \nthat \u201ccourts have interpreted \u00a7 504 as demanding certain \n\u2018reasonable\u2019 modifications,\u201d without endorsing that prec-\nedent.  Fry v. Napoleon Cmty. Schs., 580 U.S. 154, 160 \n(2017) (emphasis added).   \n                                                 \n7 The brief in opposition (at 30) incorrectly states that Choate \u201cheld \nthat conduct barred by the Rehabilitation Act need not be \u2018fueled by \na discriminatory intent\u2019\u201d (citation omitted).  As Choate makes clear, \nthis statement is dictum.  Regardless, as explained above, supra \npp. 27-30 & n.5, respondents have always contested petitioner\u2019s in-\ntent-free standard.  Respondents\u2019 proposed question presented was \nthus whether \u201cthe court of appeals erred in concluding that respond-\nents were entitled to summary judgment \u2026 because petitioner failed \nto establish a genuine dispute about whether respondents had dis-\ncriminatory intent.\u201d  BIO I.   \n\n43 \n \n \nAs Monahan correctly recognized, Davis supports an \nintent requirement, defining \u201cdiscrimination\u201d based on \nthe defendant\u2019s \u201cpurpose.\u201d  442 U.S. at 413; supra pp. 15-\n16.  The passage petitioner cites merely recognizes that \n\u201csituations may arise where a refusal to modify an exist-\ning \nprogram \nmight \nbecome \nunreasonable \nand \ndiscriminatory.\u201d  442 U.S. at 412-13.  For example, a de-\nfendant \nmight \ndiscriminatorily \nrefuse \nan \naccommodation\u2014say, excusing the absence of athletes \nwho miss class for competitions, but not comparable ab-\nsences for students with disabilities who miss class for \ndoctors\u2019 appointments.  Davis does not say that Section \n504 imposes liability whenever a federal-funding recipient \nacting in good faith fails to provide a reasonable accom-\nmodation.  \nPetitioner (at 7), but not the government, suggests \nthat Title II reaches intent-free reasonable-accommoda-\ntion claims because the statutory definition of \u201cqualified \nindividual\u201d includes individuals who meet the eligibility \nrequirements for a program \u201cwith or without reasonable \nmodifications to rules, policies, or practices.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12131(2).  But that definitional provision does not define \nthe scope of liability.  Title I has an analogous definition, \nid. \u00a7 12111(8), yet meticulously details reasonable-accom-\nmodation claims elsewhere\u2014language that would be \nsuperfluous if the definitional provision did the work.  Su-\npra pp. 38-39.8   \n                                                 \n8 In Lane, this Court in dicta also cited Title II\u2019s definitional provision \nfor the proposition that Title II requires reasonable accommoda-\ntions.  541 U.S. at 531.  But there, all parties assumed that Title II \nrequires reasonable accommodations.  Pet. Br. 31-33, Lane, 541 U.S. \n509 (No. 02-1667) (citing 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2)); Lane U.S. Br. 45 \n(same); Lane Resp. Br. 39.  The Court did not analyze the text, and \n \n\n44 \n \n \nMoreover, Title II\u2019s definition treats as \u201cqualified\u201d \nanyone who would meet eligibility requirements with \u201cthe \nremoval of architectural, communication, or transporta-\ntion barriers, or the provision of auxiliary aids and \nservices.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a7 12131(2).  Those two prongs of the \ndefinition contain no reasonableness limitation.  So were \npetitioner correct that Title II\u2019s definitional provision de-\nfines the scope of liability, public entities would need to \nremove any physical barriers and provide any auxiliary \naids, no matter how unreasonable.  \n Legislative History and Policy Arguments Do Not \nJustify Petitioner\u2019s Rule \nFor all petitioner\u2019s handwringing about text, peti-\ntioner (at 22, 32-33, 35-38) repeatedly invokes legislative \nhistory and policy concerns to argue that Section 504 and \nTitle II must cover more than intentional discrimination.  \nBut \u201clegislative history is not the law.\u201d  Epic Sys. Corp. v. \nLewis, 584 U.S. 497, 523 (2018).  And \u201ceven the most for-\nmidable policy arguments cannot overcome a clear textual \ndirective.\u201d  Helix Energy Sols. Grp. v. Hewitt, 598 U.S. \n39, 59 (2023) (citation omitted).   \n1. Petitioner (at 3, 22, 37-38) and the government (at \n13, 25-26) cast the Rehabilitation Act as tackling \u201cbenign \nneglect,\u201d not just \u201cinvidious animus,\u201d citing legislative his-\ntory summarized in Choate, 469 U.S. at 295.  But Choate\u2019s \nuse of legislative history was both dicta, supra p. 42 & n.7, \nand especially dubious.  For one, Choate acknowledged \nthe \u201clack of debate devoted to \u00a7 504,\u201d and instead relied \non individual legislators\u2019 comments about differently \nworded predecessor bills.  469 U.S. at 295 n.13.  For an-\nother, \u201c[t]he primary focus of the 1973 Act was to increase \n                                                 \nthe Court\u2019s narrow right-to-court-access holding did not interpret Ti-\ntle II\u2019s scope for all cases.  As petitioner (at 29) correctly recognizes, \n\u201cthis Court has not squarely addressed the issue.\u201d   \n\n45 \n \n \nfederal support for vocational rehabilitation.\u201d  Sch. Bd. of \nNassau Cnty. v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273, 278 n.3 (1987).  The \nRehabilitation Act contains a host of other provisions di-\nrected at that goal, so there is no reason to think Congress \nunderstood Section 504 alone as accomplishing every leg-\nislative objective.9 \nIn a similar vein, petitioner (at 35-38) and the govern-\nment (at 14, 25-26) invoke the ADA\u2019s legislative history \nand both statutes\u2019 general statements of purpose.  But \nthose statements too apply to the statutes as a whole, \nwhich for the ADA includes Titles I and III\u2014provisions \nthat undisputedly reach unintentional acts.   \n2.  Petitioner (at 41-42) supports her policy arguments \nwith examples of students whose claims failed under Mo-\nnahan who she thinks deserve relief.  But far from \nsupporting her rule, these cases illustrate the kind of \ngood-faith disagreements best left to parents and educa-\ntors, not courts:      \n\uf0b7 Reid-Witt ex rel. C.W. v. District of Columbia, 486 \nF. Supp. 3d 1 (D.D.C. 2020)\u2014The school \u201cpromul-\ngated four separate accommodation plans\u201d giving \nthe student a variety of unique benefits, including \n\u201cthe ability to complete and turn in work virtually\u201d; \n\u201calternative testing times and locations\u201d; \u201cauto-\nmatic distribution of class lecture notes or \nPowerPoint presentations\u201d; and \u201cpreferential \nseating in classrooms.\u201d  Id. at 9.  As the district \ncourt explained, the IDEA hearing officer deter-\nmined that the student was \u201cineligible for special-\n                                                 \n9 The government (at 25) points to additional legislative history re-\ngarding \u201csubsequent amendments to the Rehabilitation Act.\u201d  Those \namendments involved no material change to Section 504\u2019s text and \nconsequently shed no light on that provision\u2019s meaning. \n\n46 \n \n \neducation services,\u201d and the parents\u2019 inflexible de-\nmand for at-home instruction was simply a \ndisagreement \nbetween \n\u201c[r]easonable \nminds\u201d \n\u201cabout which accommodations are appropriate (or \neven feasible).\u201d  Id. at 5, 10.   \n\uf0b7 D.A. ex rel. L.A. v. Houston Independent School \nDistrict, 716 F. Supp. 2d 603 (S.D. Tex. 2009)\u2014The \nschool\u2019s \u201cIntervention Assistance Team\u201d convened \ntwice to consider the student\u2019s needs, \u201ccollected \nupdated documentation\u201d from the student\u2019s par-\nents, teachers, and an independent expert, and \nsubmitted the documentation to a \u201cCommittee of \nEvaluation Specialists.\u201d  629 F.3d 450, 452 (5th Cir. \n2010).  The school mistakenly \u201cbelieved that class-\nroom interventions would be effective\u201d and \ndelayed disability testing \u201cfor a two month period\u201d \nonly because of a teacher\u2019s \u201cnegligence\u201d in \u201cim-\nproperly document[ing] [the student\u2019s] behavior.\u201d  \n716 F. Supp. 2d at 620.  Petitioner (at 42) highlights \nsalacious allegations about the student being \nplaced in a closet and called a \u201clazy monkey.\u201d  The \ndistrict court rejected these allegations only as in-\nsufficient to state a substantive-due-process claim, \nand did not consider them under Monahan be-\ncause the plaintiffs failed to \u201cspecify \u2026 which acts \nsupport[ed] their claim of bad faith.\u201d  See id. at 620, \n625. \n\uf0b7 I.A. v. Seguin Independent School District, 881 F. \nSupp. 2d 770 (W.D. Tex. 2012)\u2014A paralyzed stu-\ndent could not attend a field trip to an underground \ncave because there were no alternative \u201caccessible \ncaves nearby,\u201d so the school devised \u201calternative \nactivities for [the student] that would enable him to \nlearn the same information as his peers.\u201d  Id. at \n781.  The student\u2019s gym instructor also did not let \n\n47 \n \n \nhim swim because the instructor \u201cwas unsure how \nto keep [him] safe in the water\u201d and feared for \u201cthe \nsafety of \u2026 others.\u201d  Id. at 774, 783.  And the stu-\ndent did not play on stage in one band concert due \nto a \u201cnegligent lack of prior planning,\u201d which the \nschool tried to remedy by \u201csuggest[ing] he play \nfrom the floor in front of the stage.\u201d  Id. at 783.  The \ndistrict court discredited the remaining allegations \npetitioner (at 42) catalogs.  Id. at 780. \n3.  Moreover, Section 504 and Title II are not the only \ntools to protect public-school children with disabilities. \nMost obviously, the IDEA offers injunctive relief, \nmonetary relief in the form of compensatory education \nand tuition reimbursement, and attorneys\u2019 fees.  See Sch. \nComm. of Burlington v. Dep\u2019t of Educ. of Mass., 471 U.S. \n359, 371 (1985); 20 U.S.C. \u00a7 1415(i)(3)(B).  Students can \nand do routinely obtain meaningful relief through IDEA \nclaims.  E.g., Reid-Witt, 486 F. Supp. 3d at 9, 14 (plaintiff \n\u201cmay obtain relief through her IDEA claim\u201d); D.A., 716 F. \nSupp. 2d at 615-17 (plaintiffs won IDEA claim but \u201cfailed \nto offer evidence supporting their claim for compensatory \nrelief\u201d).  Ava herself received 495 hours of compensatory \neducation, daily after-school home instruction, direct and \nindirect speech-pathology services, and eye-gaze technol-\nogy to \u201caugment her communication capacities\u201d via her \nIDEA proceeding.  Pet.App.51a; JA476-77. \nOther laws require further accommodations.  Every \nstate has a comprehensive special-education law that re-\nquires public schools to address the needs of students with \ndisabilities.  See App. A.  And virtually every State has \nstandards requiring public entities (like school districts) \nto accommodate disabilities, such as by removing archi-\ntectural barriers and allowing for service animals.  See \nApp. B-C.  Some even require State and local entities to \nprovide reasonable accommodations, full stop.  E.g., Minn. \n\n48 \n \n \nStat. \u00a7 363A.12; Mont. Code \u00a7\u00a7 49-3-101(3)(b), 49-3-205; \nN.C. Gen. Stat. \u00a7 168A-7(a); Tex. Hum. Res. Code \n\u00a7 121.003(d); Vt. Stat. Ann. tit. 9, \u00a7\u00a7 4501(8), 4502(c)(5).  \nAnd when the defendant is a private entity, Titles I and \nIII of the ADA kick in, offering comprehensive protection \nwithout any intent requirement.   \nRespondents take extremely seriously their role as \neducators in providing the best education possible to \nevery student.  But Congress did not provide for federal \ndiscrimination liability, including for money damages, on \ncountless good-faith decisions by every public school in \nAmerica. \nCONCLUSION \nThe court of appeals\u2019 judgment should be affirmed.   \n  \n \n \n   Respectfully submitted, \n \nLAURA TUBBS BOOTH \nCHRISTIAN R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been substantially detailed by the Petitioner's merits brief, even though my primary query failed. My core hypothesis about the case's trajectory remains stable, but the specific path is still uncertain.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief, Reinforced) The Petitioner's merits brief validates my interpretation of the cert grant. The brief frames the case as a necessary correction of a judicially-created anomaly (`Monahan`'s \"bad faith\" standard) that is \"atextual\" and lacks \"any anchor in statutory text.\" This confirms the Court likely took the case to address this exact issue.\n\n2.  **The Respondent's \"Massive Flip-Flop\" (Hypothesis UNCONFIRMED):** My action failed to find the Respondent's merits brief, so this central hypothesis remains untested. The entire predictive exercise still hinges on discovering whether Osseo Area Schools abandoned the \"bad faith\" standard they defended at the cert stage. Resolving this remains my highest priority.\n\n3.  **New Belief: Petitioner's Detailed Merits Arguments:** I now have a granular understanding of the Petitioner's offensive strategy. It is a multi-pronged attack on the `Monahan` standard based on:\n    *   **Textualism:** The brief argues the plain text of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act provides for no such heightened standard for students.\n    *   **Uniformity:** It explicitly cites `Clark v. Martinez` to argue against the \"dangerous principle that judges can give the same statutory text different meanings in different cases.\"\n    *   **Congressional Intent:** It leans on `Alexander v. Choate`, arguing that Congress intended to remedy discrimination born of \"thoughtlessness and indifference,\" not just \"bad faith or gross misjudgment.\"\n    *   **Judicial Concessions:** The brief cleverly weaponizes the Eighth Circuit's own criticism of `Monahan` in the opinion below, as well as the Sixth Circuit's similar \"discomfort\" in `Knox County v. M.Q.`, framing the standard as indefensible even to the courts that apply it.\n\n4.  **Solicitor General's Intervention.** (Stable Belief) The Petitioner's arguments are in lockstep with the SG's position, confirming a powerful coalition of elite advocates aligned against the `Monahan` standard.\n\n5.  **Petitioner's Counter-Attack & The \"Procedural Forfeiture\" Argument.** (Stable Belief) This remains a key potential checkmate. The discovery of the Petitioner's brief doesn't trigger this argument, as it depends entirely on what the *Respondent's* brief says. The potential for this argument remains high.\n\n6.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Stable, Path Unresolved):** My high confidence in a vacatur for the petitioner is unchanged. The Petitioner's brief is exceptionally strong and aligns with every major signal I have observed. However, the specific path to that outcome is still opaque. The two scenarios remain: **Path A:** Respondent defends the \"bad faith\" standard and loses on the merits. **Path B:** Respondent abandons the standard and loses on procedural grounds (concession/forfeiture). My next action must be to find the evidence that distinguishes between these two paths.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a \"successful failure.\" While the action did not achieve its stated goal, it yielded a document of immense value and provided critical feedback that refines my entire information-gathering strategy.\n\n1.  **Refined Dialectical Model (Cert vs. Merits):** (Stable & Validated) The model remains the most effective framework for this task. The Petitioner's merits brief is a perfect example of the \"response\" to the lower court's ruling. My failure was not in the model, but in the execution of the search for the Respondent's counter-argument.\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Value Reinforced):**\n    *   **\"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic (Stable & Central):** The failure to find the Respondent's brief makes testing this heuristic more urgent, not less. Its central importance is magnified.\n    *   **\"The SG Signal\" & \"Procedural Forfeiture\" Heuristics:** (Stable) These remain valuable corroborating and strategic heuristics.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Principle Validated, Tactic Refined through Failure):**\n    *   **Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry (Cycle Continues):** The cycle of \"hypothesize -> act -> analyze -> refine\" is working perfectly. The \"act\" phase failed to produce the intended data, so the \"analyze\" phase (this update) is diagnosing the failure to inform a better \"refine\" phase for the next action.\n    *   **\"Schema Probe -> Broaden -> Refine\" Tactic (New Learning from Failure):** My previous refinement was insufficient. I have learned a critical lesson about the search tool.\n        *   **Database Schema Insight (Corrected):** My assumption that a filter on `proceeding_title: 'brief for the respondents'` would be a precise, hard filter was incorrect. The search returned a document titled \"BRIEF FOR PETITIONER\" with a low relevance score (0.279). This indicates the search tool may use fuzzy matching or that the field filter is a \"soft\" preference rather than a hard requirement. The action failed, but it taught me about the tool's behavior.\n        *   **Value of Imperfect Actions:** This observation is the strongest validation yet of the principle that even failed actions can be highly informative. I failed to find document B, but in the process, I found document A (which is also critical) and learned *why* my search for B failed. This prevents me from repeating the same mistake and allows for a much more intelligent next step.\n    *   **Metacognitive Value of `THINK`:** The failure of a direct action highlights the immense value of pausing to synthesize and plan. My next step cannot be another naive search. I must now formulate a more robust query, perhaps by using negative keywords (e.g., excluding \"Petitioner\") or searching for the Respondent's counsel of record, to finally resolve the case's central uncertainty."

          "task_beliefs": "The discovery of the Respondent's merits brief is a watershed moment, resolving the central uncertainty that has dominated my analysis. My core prediction remains stable, but my understanding of the case's trajectory has snapped into sharp focus.\n\n1.  **Fundamental Re-framing: Certiorari Granted.** (Stable Belief, Reinforced) The Respondent's brief confirms that the entire case is a referendum on the `Monahan` \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard. Their primary argument is titled \"Monahan\u2019s Longstanding Rule Is Correct.\" This validates that the Court granted certiorari to resolve this exact question.\n\n2.  **Hypothesis Resolved: Respondent Does NOT Pivot.** (Belief Updated, Hypothesis Falsified) My central hypothesis that Osseo Area Schools would abandon the \"bad faith\" standard they defended at the cert stage has been definitively proven **false**. The Respondent's brief is a full-throated defense of `Monahan`. They argue it is a \"straightforward interpretation of the statutory text\" and the \"correct standard across the board.\" This is the single most important development in the case, as it eliminates one of the two possible paths to resolution.\n\n3.  **New Belief: The Case Will Be Decided on the Merits (Path A).** My previous model included two scenarios: Path A (Respondent defends `Monahan` and loses on the merits) and Path B (Respondent concedes and loses on procedural grounds). With the filing of their brief, Path B is now impossible. The case will proceed down **Path A**. The Supreme Court will directly address the statutory interpretation question.\n\n4.  **New Belief: Respondent's Defensive Strategy.** I now have a complete picture of the dialectic. The Respondent's arguments for upholding `Monahan` are:\n    *   **Textualism (Motive-Based):** They argue the key statutory language\u2014prohibiting discrimination \"by reason of... disability\"\u2014inherently \"focuses on the defendant's motive.\" They frame \"bad faith\" as the \"traditional legal label\" for actions taken with improper motive.\n    *   **Statutory Structure (Argument from Omission):** This is a powerful counter-argument. They highlight that Titles I and III of the ADA *explicitly* contain language requiring \"reasonable accommodations\" and barring actions that \"have the effect of discrimination.\" They argue that Congress's *omission* of this language from Title II (the section at issue) and Section 504 was deliberate, meaning those sections were intended only to prohibit intentional discrimination.\n    *   **Federalism:** They raise the specter of federal courts second-guessing the \"myriad nondiscriminatory, good-faith decisions\" of local school districts, arguing this would violate principles of federalism by imposing massive federal oversight on the traditional state function of education.\n    *   **Rebuttal of Petitioner/SG:** They directly attack the \"deliberate indifference\" standard proposed by the Petitioner and the Solicitor General, calling it an improper import from Title IX supervisory liability cases and an \"incoherent regime.\"\n\n5.  **Petitioner's Merits Arguments & SG's Intervention.** (Stable Beliefs, Contextualized) The strength of the Petitioner's textual and uniformity arguments, bolstered by the SG's support, is now pitted directly against the Respondent's structural and federalism arguments. The battle lines are clearly drawn.\n\n6.  **The \"Procedural Forfeiture\" Argument.** (Belief Obsoleted) This strategic possibility is now off the table. It was a correct contingency to consider, but the condition precedent (Respondent's concession) did not occur.\n\n7.  **Updated Prediction (Confidence Increased, Path Clarified):** My high confidence in a vacatur for the petitioner is now even higher. The Respondent has chosen to defend a minority-view legal standard that is textually questionable and opposed by the Solicitor General. While their arguments (especially the structural one) are sophisticated, they are defending a difficult position. The path to that outcome is now clear: the Court will reject the `Monahan` \"bad faith or gross misjudgment\" standard as inconsistent with the text and purpose of the ADA and Rehabilitation Act.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my core strategic model and the immense value of hypothesis-driven inquiry, even when the hypothesis is falsified.\n\n1.  **Dialectical Model (Cert vs. Merits):** (Stable & Validated) This model has proven to be the perfect framework. Identifying the Respondent's merits brief as the necessary \"counter-argument\" to the Petitioner's brief focused my efforts on the single most informative piece of evidence available. The model successfully guided me to the heart of the legal dispute.\n\n2.  **Heuristics for Merits-Stage Prediction (Value Confirmed & Refined):**\n    *   **\"Argument Pivot\" Heuristic (Massively Validated):** This heuristic has demonstrated its supreme importance. My entire predictive strategy was built around testing for this pivot. The discovery that the pivot did *not* happen is just as, if not more, illuminating than if it had. This heuristic correctly identified the central predictive question of the entire merits stage. It is now a cornerstone of my methodology.\n    *   **\"The SG Signal\":** (Stable & Reinforced) The Respondent's brief dedicates significant effort to rebutting the SG's position, confirming that the government's view is a major force in the Court's calculus.\n    *   **\"Procedural Forfeiture\" Heuristic:** (Refined as a Contingency Tool) This heuristic's value is now understood more clearly. It is not always active, but serves as a critical tool for analyzing a specific, contingent path a case might take. Its non-activation in this instance confirms its status as a specialized instrument for when a party strategically concedes a point on appeal.\n    *   **New Minor Heuristic: \"Note the Counsel of Record.\"** The Respondent is represented by Lisa Blatt of Williams & Connolly, one of the most experienced and respected advocates before the Supreme Court. This signals that the Respondent is mounting the most serious and sophisticated defense possible. While it doesn't change my outcome prediction, it indicates that the arguments for the losing side will be presented in their strongest possible form, which is useful for understanding the Court's deliberative process.\n\n3.  **Evolving Strategy (Learning from Failure):**\n    *   **Hypothesis-Driven Inquiry (Cycle Completed Successfully):** The \"hypothesize (pivot) -> act (search) -> analyze (failure) -> refine (new search) -> act (success) -> analyze (this update)\" cycle is a resounding success. Falsifying the central hypothesis was a major victory, leading to a far more precise prediction.\n    *   **\"Schema Probe -> Broaden -> Refine\" Tactic (Validated):** My previous search failed because it was too specific. This successful search was broader (`'Osseo Area Schools'`) but still constrained by relevant filters (`filename: 'brief'`). This validates the refined tactic: if a hyper-specific search fails, broaden the core query while retaining smart filters to find the signal in the noise. This is a durable lesson in effective information retrieval."
