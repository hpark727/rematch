    "facts_of_the_case": "Richards, an inmate at Michigan\u2019s Baraga Correctional Facility, sued Resident Unit Manager Thomas Perttu for sexual harassment and retaliation. Richards alleged that Perttu destroyed multiple grievances he attempted to file regarding Perttu's sexual abuse. Additionally, Richards claimed Perttu threatened to kill him if he continued trying to file grievances and wrongfully placed him in administrative segregation.\n\nAfter Perttu moved for summary judgment arguing the inmates failed to exhaust administrative remedies, and Richards cross-moved raising constitutional claims, the district court denied both motions due to factual disputes. A magistrate judge held an evidentiary hearing and recommended finding that Perttu proved the inmates failed to exhaust remedies. The district court adopted this recommendation and dismissed the case.\n\nRichards appealed, and after requesting supplemental briefing on whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury for exhaustion disputes intertwined with case merits, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit concluded that it does and reversed the judgment of the district court.",

The action's value lies in correctly identifying the core legal tension (PLRA vs. 7th Amendment) and the most critical initial document (the petition), which frames the problem and slightly reduces uncertainty about the task's structure.\n\nDesign EIG is slightly higher (0.2) because the thought process articulates a fundamental and generalizable strategy for SCOTUS prediction: start by analyzing the Petition for Certiorari. Formulating this explicit strategic hypothesis is a foundational step in learning about effective prediction methodologies (D).\n\nOverall, this is a low-cost, low-gain action that is necessary to structure the subsequent, higher-EIG information-gathering actions.",

The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is the single most information-dense document to resolve this uncertainty. It is explicitly designed to present the petitioner's core arguments and demonstrate a compelling reason (like a circuit split) for the Court to take the case. Acquiring it will dramatically reduce my uncertainty about the petitioner's legal strategy (\u03b8).\n\nFor the design (Design EIG: 0.8), this action serves as a direct and powerful test of my current design hypothesis: that starting with the cert petition is an optimal opening strategy. Successfully retrieving this document and confirming it contains the expected high-value information (arguments, precedents, circuit split) will provide strong evidence to solidify this heuristic as a core component of my general prediction methodology (D). The gain is high because it moves a hypothesis toward a validated strategic principle.\n\nThe Joint EIG is therefore very high, as this single action promises a massive reduction in uncertainty on both the specific task and my general strategic model.",

The design beliefs reveal a thoughtful meta-strategy centered on analyzing the cert petition as a high-value source, indicating a moderately sophisticated and adaptive approach to legal case analysis (0.65). Both belief sets are well integrated, with the design strategy directly supporting the task understanding, resulting in high coherence (0.85). The information density is substantial, providing specific legal concepts, procedural context, and strategic rationale, though not exhaustive or deeply granular, warranting a solid but not maximal score (0.7).

The opinion \nof the United States District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Michigan, App. 22a\u201328a, is not reported \nbut is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over Richards\u2019 \nclaims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court en-\ntered judgment for Perttu on March 22, 2022. Rich-\nards filed a timely notice of appeal by right on April \n11, 2022. The court of appeals had jurisdiction to re-\nview the district court\u2019s final judgment under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn Suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Sixth Circuit held that prisoners have a right \nto a jury trial on the question whether they have ex-\nhausted their administrative remedies under the Pris-\noner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) where disputed \nfacts regarding exhaustion are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits of their claim. This decision created \na firm split with the Seventh Circuit, which held that \ncourts, not juries, must determine whether a prisoner \nhas exhausted his or her administrative remedies, re-\ngardless of whether exhaustion is intertwined with \nthe merits of the case. \nThis split, when combined with the importance of \nthe issue, warrants this Court\u2019s review. The Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision conflicts with Congress\u2019s intent that the \nPLRA\u2019s robust exhaustion requirement limit the bur-\nden on federal courts by dismissing frivolous claims at \nthe earliest possible juncture. Indeed, requiring pris-\noners to properly exhaust all administrative remedies \nas a precondition to filing suit in federal court has dra-\nmatically reduced the burden on federal courts and \nprison officials.  \n\n3 \n \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision counteracts this \nstreamlined process by creating a right to a jury trial \nto determine whether prisoners have the right to \nbring their case to a jury. Ironically, under the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, the very method used by Congress \nin the PLRA to decrease the burden on federal courts \nand prison officials will end up increasing it by requir-\ning a jury trial to determine a threshold issue neces-\nsary for prisoners to present their case to a jury. To \nput this in perspective, over the past five years, Mich-\nigan alone has averaged 600 PLRA cases each year, \nall of which are filed in federal court. \nThis result not only contravenes the intent of Con-\ngress but also finds no support in the Seventh Amend-\nment. This Court has held that summary judgment \nand directed verdicts, both of which require a court to \ndetermine issues of fact, do not offend Seventh \nAmendment guarantees. Similarly, courts\u2014not ju-\nries\u2014determine subject-matter jurisdiction, personal \njurisdiction, abstention, and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over state-law claims, even where there are dis-\nputed issues of fact. Judges can similarly determine \nwhether a prisoner has exhausted his or her adminis-\ntrative remedies, regardless of whether exhaustion is \nintertwined with the merits of the case. The Court \nshould grant this petition to resolve the circuit split \nand to give full effect to Congress\u2019s purpose in enact-\ning the PLRA. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. District Court Proceedings and Bench \nTrial \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \nalleging that Thomas Perttu, a RUM for MDOC, sex-\nually harassed them and other prisoners, retaliated \nagainst them, and destroyed their property, in viola-\ntion of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments. \n(Compl., R. 1, Page ID # 1\u201351.) Perttu moved for sum-\nmary judgment, arguing that Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies \nbefore filing their complaint. (Mot. for Summ. J., \nR. 34, Page ID # 108\u2013110.) The district court denied \nPerttu\u2019s motion, finding a question of fact as to \nwhether the grievance process was available to Rich-\nards due to his allegation that Perttu interfered with \nhis grievance filings. App. 78a\u201383a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted a bench trial on the issue of exhaustion on No-\nvember 4, 2021. (Minutes, R. 156, Page ID # 748\u2013749.) \nEvaluating the testimony, evidence, and arguments \npresented, the magistrate judge recommended that \nthe district court conclude that Perttu carried his bur-\nden by establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \nany of their claims before filing suit.\u201d App. 64a, 76a. \nRichards alleged that Perttu had destroyed his and \nhis co-Plaintiffs\u2019 grievances or otherwise prevented \nthem from being processed, making the grievance pro-\ncess unavailable. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. Reviewing \nthe evidence, however, the magistrate judge recom-\nmended that the Court conclude that \u201cadministrative \nremedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and \nhis co-Plaintiffs. App. 68a. \n\n5 \n \nThe magistrate judge discussed how the circum-\nstances surrounding the alleged observations of \nPerttu destroying grievances undermined their own \ncredibility. App. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \n\u201cdemonstrate[d] that RUM Perttu could not, and in \nfact did not, intercept and destroy all grievances filed \nby Plaintiffs in the relevant time,\u201d in part because \n\u201cPerttu did not work seven days a week every week \nfrom June 2019 to March 2020.\u201d App. 73a. Moreover, \nthe evidence showed that Richards had access to the \ngrievance process because he had filed six grievances \nin the relevant period\u2014three of them specifically \ngrieving Perttu\u2014directly contradicting his claim that \nhis administrative remedies were effectively unavail-\nable. App. 73a\u201375a. \nBased on these findings, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Rich-\nards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their ad-\nministrative remedies for the claims against Perttu. \nApp. 76a. Richards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine ob-\njections, (Obj., R. 159, Page ID # 790\u2013814), which the \ndistrict court overruled, App. 22a\u201328a. The district \ncourt adopted the report and recommendation and en-\ntered judgment for Perttu. App. 22a\u201328a. Richards \nalone appealed the district court\u2019s ruling. (Notice, \nR. 172, Page ID # 878.) \nB. The Appeal to the Sixth Circuit  \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case. The Sixth Circuit began \nits analysis by discussing whether the exhaustion \n\n6 \n \nissue was intertwined with Richards\u2019 underlying re-\ntaliation claim, noting that Richards alleged that \nPerttu destroyed his grievances, preventing him from \nexhausting the grievance requirements. Richards\u2019 \ncomplaint, the Sixth Circuit said, \u201clays out several \nspecific instances when Perttu allegedly destroyed \ngrievances that Richards had intended to file.\u201d App. \n2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinterfered with Richards\u2019s \nspeech.\u201d App. 10a. Under these circumstances, the \nCourt concluded that \u201cthe factual disputes regarding \nexhaustion . . . are intertwined with the merits of \nRichards\u2019s retaliation claim.\u201d App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not apply to the present case be-\ncause the disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were \nnot \u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nfinding that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \u201cJu-\nries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control,\u201d \nthe Seventh Circuit stated. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \n\n7 \n \nNotably, in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 (9th \nCir. 2014) (en banc), the Ninth Circuit agreed with the \nreasoning of Pavey. App. 14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing and ultimately concluded that \u201cRichards \nwas stripped of his right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the \nultimate dispute\u201d because he was denied a jury trial \non the exhaustion issue. App. 15a\u201317a (internal cita-\ntion omitted). The Sixth Circuit also relied on Fire-\nman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Railway Express Agency, \nInc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. 1958), a case outside \nof the PLRA context. App. 17\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nthe Sixth Circuit held that where jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d). \nThe Sixth Circuit concluded that the district court \nerred by ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than \na jury trial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] \nthat a jury trial is appropriate in these circumstances \nonly if the district court finds that genuine disputes of \nmaterial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018deci-\nsive of the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784).  \n\n8 \n \nC. The PLRA Framework \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision did not discuss the \nframework of, or Congress\u2019s intent behind, the PLRA. \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits were \nfiled in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends in \nprisoner litigation, as the PLRA approaches 20, 28 \nCorrectional Law Reporter, Vol. 69, 71 (2017). Shortly \nafter that, filings exploded. Id. By the mid-1990s, cor-\nrectional systems and federal courts were overbur-\ndened by a mammoth caseload of prison litigation. In \n1995 alone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in fed-\neral court, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Id. Not \nsurprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems. In \nthis context, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201clargely in \nresponse to concerns about the heavy volume of frivo-\nlous prison litigation in the federal courts.\u201d Alexander \nv. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1326 n.11 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nA significant component of the PLRA was a ro-\nbust, mandatory exhaustion requirement. Previously, \n\u00a7 1997e contained a limited and largely discretionary \nexhaustion requirement. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 523\u201324 (2002). In enacting the PLRA in 1996, \nhowever, Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaustion pre-\nscription,\u201d requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Id. at 524. As this Court stated, \u201c[b]eyond \ndoubt, Congress enacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the \nquantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.\u201d \nId. at 524. To further this end, \u201cCongress afforded cor-\nrections officials time and opportunity to address com-\nplaints internally\u201d prior to prisoners seeking relief in \nfederal court. Id. at 525. Part of the rationale was \n\n9 \n \nthat, by giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. In addition, a prison\u2019s \n\u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivolous \nclaims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, \n737 (2001)). And the record created by prisons\u2019 inter-\nnal grievance processes would facilitate consideration \nof those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id.  \nLower courts have also recognized Congress\u2019s in-\ntent in enacting the PLRA. As courts have acknowl-\nedged, Congress passed the PLRA for three interre-\nlated purposes. First, Congress intended \u201cto return \ncontrol of the inmate grievance process to prison ad-\nministrators.\u201d Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 230 (3d \nCir. 2004). Second, the PLRA \u201cencourage[d] develop-\nment of an administrative record, and perhaps settle-\nments, within the inmate grievance process.\u201d Id. \nThird, Congress sought \u201cto reduce the burden on the \nfederal courts by erecting barriers to frivolous pris-\noner lawsuits.\u201d Id. Comporting with this analysis, the \nD.C. Circuit found that \u201cthe very purpose of the PLRA \nexhaustion requirement[ ] [is] relieving courts of the \nburden of lawsuits filed before prison officials have \nhad an opportunity to resolve prisoner grievances on \ntheir own.\u201d Jackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d \n262, 269 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA, prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \n\n10 \n \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in prisoner litiga-\ntion, as the PLRA approaches 20, at 71. Compared to \n1995, this represents a 34% decrease in the number of \nprisoner lawsuits and a 53% decline in the rate of law-\nsuits filed per 1,000 prisoners. The exhaustion re-\nquirement has been a critical component of the \nPLRA\u2019s success.  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis Court\u2019s review is warranted to resolve \na circuit split and give effect to Congress\u2019s \nintent in enacting the PLRA. \nIn the wake of the decision below, circuits are split \nregarding whether a prisoner has a right to a jury trial \nwhere the exhaustion requirement of the PLRA is in-\ntertwined with the merits of the case. The Seventh \nand Sixth Circuits are squarely in opposition on this \nimportant question. \nCongress enacted the PLRA to streamline pris-\noner lawsuits. But the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision under-\nmines this goal by holding, unnecessarily, that prison-\ners have the right to a jury trial to determine whether \nthey have the right to take their case to a jury. \n\n11 \n \nResolution by this Court is necessary to ensure the \nPLRA is faithfully followed. \nOf course, the Seventh Amendment will not yield \nto a statute. But it need not here, as the Constitution \ndoes not entitle a prisoner to a jury trial to determine \nwhether the prisoner has exhausted administrative \nremedies any more than a jury is necessary to deter-\nmine whether there is a genuine issue of fact for trial. \nThreshold issues such as exhaustion do not implicate \nthe Seventh Amendment.  \nA. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created a \ncircuit split that this Court must resolve. \nAlthough the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created a cir-\ncuit split on whether the Seventh Amendment re-\nquires a jury trial when exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of the case, there is no dispute that \nthe PLRA requires prisoners to exhaust their admin-\nistrative remedies as a prerequisite to filing suit in \nfederal court. Under the PLRA, \u201c[n]o action shall be \nbrought with respect to prison conditions under sec-\ntion [1983 of this title], or any other Federal law, by a \nprisoner . . . until such administrative remedies as are \navailable are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The \nexhaustion requirement is mandatory, Porter, 534 \nU.S. at 524, but not jurisdictional, Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006). The failure to exhaust is an \naffirmative defense that defendants have the burden \nto plead and prove. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 \n(2007).  \nPrisoners have contended that, because exhaus-\ntion constitutes a disputed issue of fact, whether a \nprisoner has exhausted his or her administrative \n\n12 \n \nremedies is an issue that should be decided by a jury. \nBut in various contexts giving rise to the question of \nwhether a jury should determine factual disputes re-\nlating to exhaustion, the circuits that have examined \nthe issue agree that \u201cjudges may resolve factual dis-\nputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 271 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Messa v. Goord, \n652 F.3d 305, 308\u201309 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam); Dil-\nlon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 272 (5th Cir. 2010); Lee, \n789 F.3d at 678; Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. \nRich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1373\u201374 (11th Cir. 2008); Wyatt \nv. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119\u201320 (9th Cir. 2003), \noverruled on other grounds by Albino, 747 F.3d at \n1166.  \nIn the more specific context of exhaustion inter-\ntwin\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The opinion \nof the United States District Court for the Western \nDistrict of Michigan, App. 22a\u201328a, is not reported \nbut is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over Richards\u2019 \nclaims under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. The district court en-\ntered judgment for Perttu on March 22, 2022. Rich-\nards filed a timely notice of appeal by right on April \n11, 2022. The court of appeals had jurisdiction to re-\nview the district court\u2019s final judgment under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn Suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \n \n \n\n2 \n \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act, 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe Sixth Circuit held that prisoners have a right \nto a jury trial on the question whether they have ex-\nhausted their administrative remedies under the Pris-\noner Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) where disputed \nfacts regarding exhaustion are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits of their claim. This decision created \na firm split with the Seventh Circuit, which held that \ncourts, not juries, must determine whether a prisoner \nhas exhausted his or her administrative remedies, re-\ngardless of whether exhaustion is intertwined with \nthe merits of the case. \nThis split, when combined with the importance of \nthe issue, warrants this Court\u2019s review. The Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision conflicts with Congress\u2019s intent that the \nPLRA\u2019s robust exhaustion requirement limit the bur-\nden on federal courts by dismissing frivolous claims at \nthe earliest possible juncture. Indeed, requiring pris-\noners to properly exhaust all administrative remedies \nas a precondition to filing suit in federal court has dra-\nmatically reduced the burden on federal courts and \nprison officials.  \n\n3 \n \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision counteracts this \nstreamlined process by creating a right to a jury trial \nto determine whether prisoners have the right to \nbring their case to a jury. Ironically, under the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s analysis, the very method used by Congress \nin the PLRA to decrease the burden on federal courts \nand prison officials will end up increasing it by requir-\ning a jury trial to determine a threshold issue neces-\nsary for prisoners to present their case to a jury. To \nput this in perspective, over the past five years, Mich-\nigan alone has averaged 600 PLRA cases each year, \nall of which are filed in federal court. \nThis result not only contravenes the intent of Con-\ngress but also finds no support in the Seventh Amend-\nment. This Court has held that summary judgment \nand directed verdicts, both of which require a court to \ndetermine issues of fact, do not offend Seventh \nAmendment guarantees. Similarly, courts\u2014not ju-\nries\u2014determine subject-matter jurisdiction, personal \njurisdiction, abstention, and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over state-law claims, even where there are dis-\nputed issues of fact. Judges can similarly determine \nwhether a prisoner has exhausted his or her adminis-\ntrative remedies, regardless of whether exhaustion is \nintertwined with the merits of the case. The Court \nshould grant this petition to resolve the circuit split \nand to give full effect to Congress\u2019s purpose in enact-\ning the PLRA. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. District Court Proceedings and Bench \nTrial \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983, \nalleging that Thomas Perttu, a RUM for MDOC, sex-\nually harassed them and other prisoners, retaliated \nagainst them, and destroyed their property, in viola-\ntion of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amendments. \n(Compl., R. 1, Page ID # 1\u201351.) Perttu moved for sum-\nmary judgment, arguing that Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs failed to exhaust administrative remedies \nbefore filing their complaint. (Mot. for Summ. J., \nR. 34, Page ID # 108\u2013110.) The district court denied \nPerttu\u2019s motion, finding a question of fact as to \nwhether the grievance process was available to Rich-\nards due to his allegation that Perttu interfered with \nhis grievance filings. App. 78a\u201383a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted a bench trial on the issue of exhaustion on No-\nvember 4, 2021. (Minutes, R. 156, Page ID # 748\u2013749.) \nEvaluating the testimony, evidence, and arguments \npresented, the magistrate judge recommended that \nthe district court conclude that Perttu carried his bur-\nden by establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \nany of their claims before filing suit.\u201d App. 64a, 76a. \nRichards alleged that Perttu had destroyed his and \nhis co-Plaintiffs\u2019 grievances or otherwise prevented \nthem from being processed, making the grievance pro-\ncess unavailable. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. Reviewing \nthe evidence, however, the magistrate judge recom-\nmended that the Court conclude that \u201cadministrative \nremedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and \nhis co-Plaintiffs. App. 68a. \n\n5 \n \nThe magistrate judge discussed how the circum-\nstances surrounding the alleged observations of \nPerttu destroying grievances undermined their own \ncredibility. App. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \n\u201cdemonstrate[d] that RUM Perttu could not, and in \nfact did not, intercept and destroy all grievances filed \nby Plaintiffs in the relevant time,\u201d in part because \n\u201cPerttu did not work seven days a week every week \nfrom June 2019 to March 2020.\u201d App. 73a. Moreover, \nthe evidence showed that Richards had access to the \ngrievance process because he had filed six grievances \nin the relevant period\u2014three of them specifically \ngrieving Perttu\u2014directly contradicting his claim that \nhis administrative remedies were effectively unavail-\nable. App. 73a\u201375a. \nBased on these findings, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Rich-\nards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust their ad-\nministrative remedies for the claims against Perttu. \nApp. 76a. Richards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine ob-\njections, (Obj., R. 159, Page ID # 790\u2013814), which the \ndistrict court overruled, App. 22a\u201328a. The district \ncourt adopted the report and recommendation and en-\ntered judgment for Perttu. App. 22a\u201328a. Richards \nalone appealed the district court\u2019s ruling. (Notice, \nR. 172, Page ID # 878.) \nB. The Appeal to the Sixth Circuit  \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case. The Sixth Circuit began \nits analysis by discussing whether the exhaustion \n\n6 \n \nissue was intertwined with Richards\u2019 underlying re-\ntaliation claim, noting that Richards alleged that \nPerttu destroyed his grievances, preventing him from \nexhausting the grievance requirements. Richards\u2019 \ncomplaint, the Sixth Circuit said, \u201clays out several \nspecific instances when Perttu allegedly destroyed \ngrievances that Richards had intended to file.\u201d App. \n2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinterfered with Richards\u2019s \nspeech.\u201d App. 10a. Under these circumstances, the \nCourt concluded that \u201cthe factual disputes regarding \nexhaustion . . . are intertwined with the merits of \nRichards\u2019s retaliation claim.\u201d App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not apply to the present case be-\ncause the disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were \nnot \u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nfinding that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \u201cJu-\nries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control,\u201d \nthe Seventh Circuit stated. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \n\n7 \n \nNotably, in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 (9th \nCir. 2014) (en banc), the Ninth Circuit agreed with the \nreasoning of Pavey. App. 14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing and ultimately concluded that \u201cRichards \nwas stripped of his right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the \nultimate dispute\u201d because he was denied a jury trial \non the exhaustion issue. App. 15a\u201317a (internal cita-\ntion omitted). The Sixth Circuit also relied on Fire-\nman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Railway Express Agency, \nInc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. 1958), a case outside \nof the PLRA context. App. 17\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nthe Sixth Circuit held that where jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d). \nThe Sixth Circuit concluded that the district court \nerred by ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than \na jury trial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] \nthat a jury trial is appropriate in these circumstances \nonly if the district court finds that genuine disputes of \nmaterial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018deci-\nsive of the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784).  \n\n8 \n \nC. The PLRA Framework \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision did not discuss the \nframework of, or Congress\u2019s intent behind, the PLRA. \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits were \nfiled in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends in \nprisoner litigation, as the PLRA approaches 20, 28 \nCorrectional Law Reporter, Vol. 69, 71 (2017). Shortly \nafter that, filings exploded. Id. By the mid-1990s, cor-\nrectional systems and federal courts were overbur-\ndened by a mammoth caseload of prison litigation. In \n1995 alone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in fed-\neral court, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Id. Not \nsurprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems. In \nthis context, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201clargely in \nresponse to concerns about the heavy volume of frivo-\nlous prison litigation in the federal courts.\u201d Alexander \nv. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1326 n.11 (11th Cir. 1998).  \nA significant component of the PLRA was a ro-\nbust, mandatory exhaustion requirement. Previously, \n\u00a7 1997e contained a limited and largely discretionary \nexhaustion requirement. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 523\u201324 (2002). In enacting the PLRA in 1996, \nhowever, Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaustion pre-\nscription,\u201d requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Id. at 524. As this Court stated, \u201c[b]eyond \ndoubt, Congress enacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the \nquantity and improve the quality of prisoner suits.\u201d \nId. at 524. To further this end, \u201cCongress afforded cor-\nrections officials time and opportunity to address com-\nplaints internally\u201d prior to prisoners seeking relief in \nfederal court. Id. at 525. Part of the rationale was \n\n9 \n \nthat, by giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. In addition, a prison\u2019s \n\u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivolous \nclaims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, \n737 (2001)). And the record created by prisons\u2019 inter-\nnal grievance processes would facilitate consideration \nof those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id.  \nLower courts have also recognized Congress\u2019s in-\ntent in enacting the PLRA. As courts have acknowl-\nedged, Congress passed the PLRA for three interre-\nlated purposes. First, Congress intended \u201cto return \ncontrol of the inmate grievance process to prison ad-\nministrators.\u201d Spruill v. Gillis, 372 F.3d 218, 230 (3d \nCir. 2004). Second, the PLRA \u201cencourage[d] develop-\nment of an administrative record, and perhaps settle-\nments, within the inmate grievance process.\u201d Id. \nThird, Congress sought \u201cto reduce the burden on the \nfederal courts by erecting barriers to frivolous pris-\noner lawsuits.\u201d Id. Comporting with this analysis, the \nD.C. Circuit found that \u201cthe very purpose of the PLRA \nexhaustion requirement[ ] [is] relieving courts of the \nburden of lawsuits filed before prison officials have \nhad an opportunity to resolve prisoner grievances on \ntheir own.\u201d Jackson v. District of Columbia, 254 F.3d \n262, 269 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA, prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \n\n10 \n \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in prisoner litiga-\ntion, as the PLRA approaches 20, at 71. Compared to \n1995, this represents a 34% decrease in the number of \nprisoner lawsuits and a 53% decline in the rate of law-\nsuits filed per 1,000 prisoners. The exhaustion re-\nquirement has been a critical component of the \nPLRA\u2019s success.  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nI. \nThis Court\u2019s review is warranted to resolve \na circuit split and give effect to Congress\u2019s \nintent in enacting the PLRA. \nIn the wake of the decision below, circuits are split \nregarding whether a prisoner has a right to a jury trial \nwhere the exhaustion requirement of the PLRA is in-\ntertwined with the merits of the case. The Seventh \nand Sixth Circuits are squarely in opposition on this \nimportant question. \nCongress enacted the PLRA to streamline pris-\noner lawsuits. But the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision under-\nmines this goal by holding, unnecessarily, that prison-\ners have the right to a jury trial to determine whether \nthey have the right to take their case to a jury. \n\n11 \n \nResolution by this Court is necessary to ensure the \nPLRA is faithfully followed. \nOf course, the Seventh Amendment will not yield \nto a statute. But it need not here, as the Constitution \ndoes not entitle a prisoner to a jury trial to determine \nwhether the prisoner has exhausted administrative \nremedies any more than a jury is necessary to deter-\nmine whether there is a genuine issue of fact for trial. \nThreshold issues such as exhaustion do not implicate \nthe Seventh Amendment.  \nA. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created a \ncircuit split that this Court must resolve. \nAlthough the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created a cir-\ncuit split on whether the Seventh Amendment re-\nquires a jury trial when exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of the case, there is no dispute that \nthe PLRA requires prisoners to exhaust their admin-\nistrative remedies as a prerequisite to filing suit in \nfederal court. Under the PLRA, \u201c[n]o action shall be \nbrought with respect to prison conditions under sec-\ntion [1983 of this title], or any other Federal law, by a \nprisoner . . . until such administrative remedies as are \navailable are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). The \nexhaustion requirement is mandatory, Porter, 534 \nU.S. at 524, but not jurisdictional, Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006). The failure to exhaust is an \naffirmative defense that defendants have the burden \nto plead and prove. Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199, 218 \n(2007).  \nPrisoners have contended that, because exhaus-\ntion constitutes a disputed issue of fact, whether a \nprisoner has exhausted his or her administrative \n\n12 \n \nremedies is an issue that should be decided by a jury. \nBut in various contexts giving rise to the question of \nwhether a jury should determine factual disputes re-\nlating to exhaustion, the circuits that have examined \nthe issue agree that \u201cjudges may resolve factual dis-\nputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 271 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Messa v. Goord, \n652 F.3d 305, 308\u201309 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam); Dil-\nlon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 272 (5th Cir. 2010); Lee, \n789 F.3d at 678; Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. \nRich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1373\u201374 (11th Cir. 2008); Wyatt \nv. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119\u201320 (9th Cir. 2003), \noverruled on other grounds by Albino, 747 F.3d at \n1166.  \nIn the more specific context of exhaustion inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, prior to the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s decision in the present case, the circuits that \nconsidered the issue were in agreement: prisoners had \nno right to a jury trial to determine whether they had \nexhausted their administrative remedies, even where \nexhaustion was intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (Seventh Circuit); see also \nAlbino, 747 F.3d at 1171\u201372 (Ninth Circuit). The \nSixth Circuit acknowledged that its decision created a \ncircuit split. App. 15a\u201316a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at \n742 & Albino, 747 F.3d at 1171\u201372). \nIn Pavey, the plaintiff filed suit claiming that a \ncorrectional officer had used excessive force against \nhim, breaking his arm. 544 F.3d at 740. When the de-\nfendants moved to dismiss based on the plaintiff\u2019s fail-\nure to exhaust his administrative remedies, he coun-\ntered that, due to his broken arm, he was unable to \n\n13 \n \ncomplete a grievance. Id. Thus, like Richards, the ex-\nhaustion inquiry was intertwined with the merits of \nthe case. And, also like Richards, the plaintiff con-\ntended that he had the right to a jury trial on the ex-\nhaustion issue. Pavey v. Conley, No. 3:03-CV-662 RM, \n2006 WL 3392946, at *1 (N.D. Ind. Nov. 21, 2006), \namended, No. 303-CV-662 RM, 2006 WL 3715019 \n(N.D. Ind. Dec. 14, 2006), and rev\u2019d, 544 F.3d 739 (7th \nCir. 2008), as amended on denial of reh\u2019g and reh\u2019g en \nbanc (Sept. 12, 2008).  \nThe Seventh Circuit began its analysis by noting \nthat \u201cnot every factual issue that arises in the course \nof a litigation is triable by a jury as a matter of right.\u201d \n544 F.3d at 741. Subject-matter jurisdiction, personal \njurisdiction, abstention, and supplemental jurisdic-\ntion over state-law claims are all decided by courts, \nnot juries, \u201ceven if there are contestable factual ques-\ntions bearing on the decision.\u201d Id. From this, the Sev-\nenth Circuit gleaned the principle that \u201cjuries do not \ndecide what forum a dispute is to be resolved in\u201d be-\ncause \u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traf-\nfic control.\u201d Id. In most cases, \u201cthe only consequence \nof a failure to exhaust\u201d is that a prisoner must with-\ndraw his or her case and refile once the grievance pro-\ncess has been completed. Id.  \nThat the merits of the case are intertwined with \nthe exhaustion issue makes no difference to whether \na court or a jury should determine whether a prisoner \nexhausted administrative remedies. First, \u201cany find-\ning that the judge makes, relating to exhaustion, that \nmight affect the merits may be reexamined by the jury \nif\u2014and only after\u2014the prisoner overcomes the ex-\nhaustion defense and the case proceeds to the merits.\u201d \n\n14 \n \nId. at 742. Second, \u201c[t]he alternative of trying the mer-\nits before exhaustion . . . is unsatisfactory in the pre-\nsent setting because it would thwart Congress\u2019s effort \nto bar trials of prisoner cases in which the prisoner \nhas failed to exhaust his administrative remedies.\u201d Id. \nAnd the Seventh Circuit cautioned that having a jury \ndetermine exhaustion may lead to the \u201cjury . . . de-\ncid[ing] the merits of a case that should never have \ngotten to the merits stage because the judge should \nhave found that the prisoner had failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Id.  \nSeveral years later, in Albino, the Ninth Circuit \nendorsed the result and reasoning of Pavey, noting \nthat, to the extent summary judgment is not appropri-\nate, \u201cthe district judge may decide disputed questions \nof fact in a preliminary proceeding.\u201d Albino, 747 F.3d \nat 1168. The Ninth Circuit concluded, as did the Sev-\nenth Circuit, that \u201cexhaustion is analogous to subject-\nmatter jurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, venue, and \nabstention,\u201d which are all decided at the outset of liti-\ngation. Id. at 1170. Like those issues, exhaustion \nshould be decided prior to reaching the merits of a \nprisoner\u2019s claims. Id. Factual questions should be de-\ncided by the court, not a jury, including in those in-\nstances where exhaustion is intertwined with the \nmerits of the claim. Id. at 1170\u201371. \nB. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision weakens the \nPLRA by undermining the exhaustion \nrequirement. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding ignores the carefully \ncrafted framework of the PLRA and its stringent ex-\nhaustion requirement. This Court has held that \n\n15 \n \nexhaustion requires proper exhaustion, which means \nthat the prisoner must fully complete the prison griev-\nance process. Ngo, 548 U.S. at 93\u201394. \u201c[P]roper ex-\nhaustion of administrative remedies . . . means using \nall steps that the agency holds out, and doing so \nproperly (so that the agency addresses the issues on \nthe merits).\u201d Id. at 90 (quotation omitted). Exhaustion \nof administrative remedies is a prerequisite to filing a \nprisoner lawsuit challenging prison conditions. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a); Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. As such, \nexhaustion is a threshold issue that must be deter-\nmined before a court can review the merits of a plain-\ntiff\u2019s claims or the other defenses raised by a defend-\nant. \nCongress enacted the PLRA \u201cto reduce the quan-\ntity and improve the quality of prisoner suits; to this \npurpose, Congress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally be-\nfore allowing the initiation of a federal case.\u201d Porter, \n534 U.S. at 516\u201317. The exhaustion requirement con-\nstitutes a critical component of those goals, requiring \nprisoners to exhaust their administrative remedies as \na prerequisite to bring a lawsuit under \u00a7 1997e(a). \nNgo, 548 U.S. at 85; Porter, 534 U.S. at 524\u201325. That \nis, prisoners do not have the right to bring their case \nbefore a jury unless and until they have exhausted all \navailable administrative remedies. Ngo, 548 U.S. at \n85; Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. \nRequiring proper exhaustion serves Congress\u2019s \ngoals in enacting the PLRA. It gives prisoners an ef-\nfective incentive to make full use of the prison griev-\nance process and accordingly provides prisons with a \nfair opportunity to correct their own errors. Ngo, 548 \n\n16 \n \nU.S. at 94. This is important in relation to prison sys-\ntems because it is \u201cdifficult to imagine an activity in \nwhich a State has a stronger interest, or one that is \nmore intricately bound up with state laws, regula-\ntions, and procedures, than the administration of its \nprisons.\u201d Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 491\u201392 \n(1973). It makes sense, therefore, why Congress re-\nquired prisoners to properly exhaust their administra-\ntive remedies before filing suit by filing a grievance \nthat complies with the prison\u2019s grievance system re-\ngarding the allegations made in the complaint. The \nSixth Circuit\u2019s decision, however, upends this practi-\ncal wisdom by granting prisoners the right to a jury \ntrial to determine the threshold question of whether \nthey have the right to bring their case before a jury.  \nThe decision below not only thwarts congressional \nintent but also misconstrues the Seventh Amend-\nment, effectively neutering the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion re-\nquirement. As a practical matter, for entitlement to a \njury trial in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners need only al-\nlege that prison officials prevented them from filing \ngrievances. Regardless of how implausible or even \noutlandish the allegations\u2014as here, where the bench \ntrial established that Richards\u2019 allegations are both \nimplausible and outlandish, App. 68a\u201376a\u2014prisoners \ncan all but guarantee that their case will go to a jury \nwhere exhaustion is an issue. \nThe result will be entirely predictable: prison offi-\ncials and federal courts will again be inundated with \nmeritless lawsuits that they must allow to go to a jury. \nThis approach will erase nearly 30 years of progress \nin reducing frivolous lawsuits.  \n\n17 \n \nTo put this in perspective, in 1995, before the pas-\nsage of the PLRA with its exacting exhaustion re-\nquirement, there were 24.6 lawsuits per 1,000 prison-\ners. At that time there were about 1.6 million prison-\ners in the United States, including state, local, and \nfederal prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in prisoner liti-\ngation, as the PLRA approaches 20, at 71. As of 2021, \nthere were approximately 1.9 million prisoners1 and \n24,372 prisoner lawsuits.2 At the 1995 rate of 24.6 \nlawsuits per 1,000 prisoners, this would result in \n46,740 prisoner lawsuits\u2014nearly doubling the num-\nber of prisoner lawsuits filed in federal courts.  \nThe PLRA was enacted to avoid such a result, and \nhaving judges determine whether administrative \nremedies have been exhausted comports with the in-\ntent of Congress. A critical component is the exhaus-\ntion requirement, which Congress enacted to prevent \npremature lawsuits from going to trial at all. Jones, \n549 U.S. at 202 (\u201cAmong other reforms, the PLRA \nmandates early judicial screening of prisoner com-\nplaints and requires prisoners to exhaust prison griev-\nance procedures before filing suit.\u201d). Accordingly, un-\nder the PLRA, exhaustion is a \u201cthreshold issue[ ] of \njudicial administration that \u2018courts must address to \ndetermine whether litigation is being conducted in the \nright forum at the right time.\u2019 \u201d Lee, 789 F.3d at 678 \n(quoting Dillon, 596 F.3d at 272). Threshold issues, \n \n1 See Wendy Sawyer and Peter Wagner, Mass Incarceration: The \nWhole Pie 2024, Prison Policy Initiative (March 14, 2024), \nhttps://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2024.html.  \n2 See Data Update, Incarceration and the Law, https://incarcer-\nationlaw.com/resources/data-update/ (last visited June 12, 2024). \n\n18 \n \ncontrary to the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision, do not require \na jury. \nC. The Sixth Circuit misconstrued the \nSeventh Amendment. \nHaving judges determine the exhaustion issue \nalso comports with the Seventh Amendment, which \ndoes not require a threshold issue to be decided by a \njury. As this Court held in Parklane Hosiery Co. v. \nShore, 439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979), \u201c[t]he Seventh \nAmendment has never been interpreted in the rigid \nmanner advocated by the petitioners,\u201d because \u201cmany \nprocedural devices developed since 1791 that have di-\nminished the civil jury\u2019s historic domain have been \nfound not to be inconsistent with the Seventh Amend-\nment.\u201d Such \u201cprocedural devices\u201d are broad and var-\nied, including directed verdicts, retrials on the issue \nof damages, and summary judgment. Id. (citing Gal-\nloway v. United States, 319 U.S. 372, 388\u201393 (1943) \n(holding that granting a directed verdict does not vio-\nlate the Seventh Amendment); Gasoline Prods. Co. v. \nChamplin Refin. Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1931) \n(holding that a retrial on the issue of damages only \ndoes not violate the Seventh Amendment); & Fidelity \n& Deposit Co. of Md. v. United States, 187 U.S. 315, \n319\u201321 (1902) (holding that granting summary judg-\nment does not violate the Seventh Amendment)). \nOther questions require courts to decide disputed \nissues of fact without sending the issue to a jury. For \ninstance, sometimes-fact-intensive questions of sub-\nject-matter and personal jurisdiction are resolved by \ncourts, not juries. E.g. McNutt v. Gen. Motors Ac-\nceptance Corp. of Ind., 298 U.S. 178, 188\u201390 (1936) \n\n19 \n \n(holding that subject-matter jurisdiction should be de-\ncided by the court); Dillon, 596 F.3d at 271 (holding \nthat personal jurisdiction should be decided by the \ncourt). Similarly, whether a court has supplemental \njurisdiction over a state-law claim is decided by a \ncourt rather than a jury. See Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe same is true for abstention and venue. See Am-\nbrosia Coal & Constr. Co. v. Pages Morales, 368 F.3d \n1320, 1330\u201332 (11th Cir. 2004) (holding that absten-\ntion is a threshold issue to be decided by the trial \njudge); Small, 728 F.3d at 269\u201370 (holding that ex-\nhaustion, like venue, is a threshold issue to be decided \nby the court rather than the jury). See also Lee, 789 \nF.3d at 678 (\u201c[J]udges may resolve disputed facts in \ndeciding threshold issues of judicial administration \nsuch as subject-matter jurisdiction, personal jurisdic-\ntion, venue, and abstention in favor of another court \nor agency.\u201d).  \nThe collective lesson of these cases is that thresh-\nold issues, which determine whether a case should get \nto a jury, are procedural matters that do not require a \njury. And exhaustion is exactly that\u2014a threshold is-\nsue to determine whether a prisoner has met a proce-\ndural requirement to take his or her case to a jury. \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to heed the parallels between \nthese kinds of procedural determinations and the \nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. Indeed, the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s only attempt to distinguish those circum-\nstances was to say that \u201cnone permit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \na jury.\u201d App. 17a. \n\n20 \n \nThe Sixth Circuit also failed to give deference to \nCongress\u2019s intent behind the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion re-\nquirement. In discussing the pre-PLRA version of \n\u00a7 1997e, this Court noted that \u201ceven in this field of ju-\ndicial discretion, appropriate deference to Congress\u2019 \npower to prescribe the basic procedural scheme under \nwhich a claim may be heard in a federal court requires \nfashioning of exhaustion principles in a manner con-\nsistent with congressional intent and any applicable \nstatutory scheme.\u201d McCarthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. \n140, 144 (1992), superseded by the PLRA, Booth, 532 \nU.S. at 739\u201341, 737.  \nMoreover, instead of discussing the text, history, \nand purpose of the Seventh Amendment, the Sixth \nCircuit relied heavily on its decision in Fireman\u2019s \nFund, 253 F.2d at 780. But that case did not hold that \na jury is required to determine the merits of an issue.  \nIn Fireman\u2019s Fund, the defendant contended that \nthe amount in question did not meet the jurisdictional \nrequirements of the district court. Id. at 782. The dis-\ntrict court agreed and dismissed the case. Id. The \nSixth Circuit reversed, ruling that the amount in \nquestion went to the merits of the case. Id. at 784. In \nsuch circumstances, the court said, \u201cthe case should \nbe heard and determined on its merits through regu-\nlar trial procedure.\u201d Id. Otherwise, \u201cthe merits of a \ncontroversy could be summarily decided, partly on af-\nfidavits without the right of cross-examination.\u201d Id.  \nThere are several problems with reliance on Fire-\nman\u2019s Fund. For one, the case did not discuss or rely \non the Seventh Amendment. For another, it did not \ndiscuss the prospect of a bench trial that included \u201cthe \nright of cross-examination\u201d and the other incidents of \n\n21 \n \ntrial, including the right to present and examine wit-\nnesses, the opportunity to present evidence, applica-\ntion of the Federal Rules of Evidence, and the availa-\nbility of opening and closing statements. A bench trial \nincludes all of these elements, and it is undisputed \nthat the district court provided Richards all of the in-\ncidents of a typical trial, other than a jury. Accord-\ningly, the concerns articulated in Fireman\u2019s Fund \nsimply do not apply.  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should grant this pe-\ntition. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Perttu v. Richards* has been substantially deepened and specified. I have moved from a general awareness of the legal conflict to a detailed grasp of the petitioner's legal strategy and the specific precedents involved.\n\nMy foundational belief remains that the core legal question is whether the Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial applies to factual disputes over PLRA exhaustion when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the claim. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari has provided a wealth of specific information, allowing me to build upon this foundation:\n\n1.  **Parties and Counsel:** The petitioner, Thomas Perttu, is represented by the Michigan Solicitor General. This signifies that the State of Michigan is formally backing this appeal, lending it institutional weight. The respondent, Kyle Brandon Richards, is represented by the University of Virginia Appellate Litigation Clinic.\n2.  **Petitioner's Core Arguments:** I now understand the petitioner's three-pronged argument for why the Supreme Court should grant certiorari and ultimately reverse the Sixth Circuit:\n    *   **Creation of a Circuit Split:** The petitioner argues the Sixth Circuit's decision creates a direct conflict with the Seventh Circuit's ruling in *Pavey v. Conley* (544 F.3d 739), which held that judges, not juries, decide PLRA exhaustion issues, even if intertwined with the merits. The petition memorably quotes *Pavey*: \"Juries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\" It also notes that the Ninth Circuit (in *Albino v. Baca*) and several other circuits (2nd, 3rd, 5th, 11th) have adopted similar judge-led approaches to resolving exhaustion disputes.\n    *   **Violation of Congressional Intent:** The petitioner contends that the Sixth Circuit's ruling undermines the central purpose of the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA). The PLRA was enacted to *reduce* the burden of prisoner litigation on federal courts by requiring administrative exhaustion as a filter. Forcing a jury trial on the threshold question of exhaustion ironically *increases* the judicial burden, directly contravening Congress's intent. The petition highlights the practical stakes by noting Michigan alone averages 600 PLRA cases annually.\n    *   **Misconstruction of the Seventh Amendment:** The petitioner argues that the Seventh Amendment is not implicated by this threshold procedural question. The argument analogizes the exhaustion determination to other gateway issues that judges routinely decide, such as summary judgment and jurisdictional challenges, which can also involve factual disputes but do not require a jury.\n3.  **Key Factual Details:** The petition adds critical context from the lower court proceedings. A magistrate judge, after a bench trial, found that the administrative grievance process *was* available to Richards. This finding was based on evidence showing Richards had successfully filed six other grievances during the relevant period, including three against Perttu himself, which directly contradicts his claim that Perttu made the process unavailable by destroying his filings. This factual detail weakens the respondent's underlying claim and may make the Court more sympathetic to the petitioner's argument.\n\nBased on this new information, my belief has shifted from uncertainty to a strong inclination that the Supreme Court will reverse the Sixth Circuit. The existence of a clean circuit split on an important and recurring issue of federal law, combined with strong arguments based on statutory purpose and constitutional interpretation, makes this case a prime candidate for review and reversal.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of effective strategies for this task has been significantly validated and refined.\n\nMy initial heuristic\u2014that locating and analyzing the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is a highly effective opening strategy\u2014is now a strongly held belief. This observation confirmed that the cert petition is a primary source of immense value, serving as a roadmap to the entire legal conflict. It efficiently provided the precise legal question, the petitioner's core arguments, the key precedents, and, most importantly, the existence and nature of the circuit split.\n\nThis experience allows me to add several new layers to my design methodology:\n\n1.  **Strategic Deconstruction of Legal Arguments:** I have learned to recognize a powerful and common pattern in Supreme Court advocacy. The petitioner's argument is structured around three pillars: (1) **The Circuit Split:** The procedural hook to get the Court's attention. (2) **The Statutory Purpose:** The argument that the lower court's decision frustrates the will of Congress. (3) **The Constitutional Interpretation:** The argument that the Constitution does not compel the lower court's outcome. I now believe that looking for this \"Split, Statute, Constitution\" framework is an effective heuristic for analyzing petitions and predicting which arguments will be most salient to the Court.\n2.  **Prioritizing Information within a Source:** While the entire cert petition is useful, the \"Reasons for Granting the Petition\" section is the most information-dense part for understanding the core legal battle. In future analyses of similar documents, I will prioritize this section to most efficiently reduce my uncertainty.\n3.  **Sequential Information Gathering:** The success of this action informs the next logical step. Having fully digested the petitioner's arguments, the most valuable piece of missing information is the respondent's counter-narrative. Therefore, a new strategic principle is: after analyzing the Petition for Certiorari, the next action should be to locate and analyze the \"Brief in Opposition.\" This sequential approach (Petition -> Opposition) creates a dialectic that will build a comprehensive view of the legal landscape before the Court."

Whether the respondent's arguments are strong (decreasing my confidence in reversal) or weak (cementing it), the information gain will be maximal. Concurrently, this action serves as a crucial test of my newly refined design principle: the 'Petition -> Opposition' sequential analysis strategy. The informativeness of the resulting document will either strongly validate this dialectical approach as a core, efficient methodology or force a significant revision, thus providing substantial information about optimal design.

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal landscape in *Perttu v. Richards* remains stable in its core components, as this observation was an internal reasoning step rather than the introduction of new external evidence. However, this step has allowed me to precisely define the boundaries of my current knowledge and the specific nature of my uncertainty.\n\nMy foundational knowledge, derived from the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, is unchanged:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue is whether the Seventh Amendment mandates a jury trial for factual disputes concerning a prisoner's exhaustion of administrative remedies under the PLRA, particularly when those facts overlap with the merits of the underlying claim.\n2.  **Parties and Stakes:** The petitioner, a Michigan prison official, is backed by the state's Solicitor General, indicating significant institutional interest. The respondent is represented by a university appellate clinic. The case has broad implications for the administration of the ~600 PLRA cases filed annually in Michigan alone.\n3.  **Petitioner's Strong Position:** The petitioner has presented a compelling three-part argument for reversal based on:\n    *   **A clear Circuit Split:** The Sixth Circuit's ruling directly contradicts the Seventh Circuit's precedent in *Pavey v. Conley* (\"Juries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control\"), a position adopted by the Second, Third, Fifth, Ninth, and Eleventh circuits.\n    *   **Violation of Statutory Intent:** Forcing jury trials on the threshold issue of exhaustion would increase, not decrease, the burden of prisoner litigation, directly opposing the PLRA's purpose.\n    *   **Constitutional Interpretation:** The Seventh Amendment does not apply to such gateway procedural determinations, which are analogous to other judge-decided issues like jurisdiction.\n4.  **Damaging Factual Finding:** A magistrate judge previously found that the respondent, Richards, had successfully filed other grievances against the petitioner, undermining his claim that the grievance process was unavailable to him.\n\nThe new observation sharpens my understanding by moving from a general sense of one-sidedness to a specific \"known unknown.\" My primary uncertainty is now explicitly focused on the respondent's counter-arguments. The most valuable information to acquire next would be answers to the following questions:\n*   How does the respondent attempt to distinguish the Sixth Circuit's ruling from the contrary precedent in *Pavey* and other circuits? Do they argue the split is not as clean as the petitioner claims?\n*   How does the respondent argue that requiring a jury trial for exhaustion is compatible with, or even necessary for, the PLRA's statutory scheme?\n*   What is the respondent's affirmative argument for why the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial for suits at common law *must* apply to these intertwined factual disputes?\n\nMy prediction remains a strong inclination that the Supreme Court will reverse the Sixth Circuit, but my confidence is tempered by the explicit acknowledgment that I have not yet seen the other side of the argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation strongly validates and refines my meta-level strategies for analyzing Supreme Court cases. My belief system for effective design has evolved from initial heuristics to a more structured, testable methodology.\n\nMy core design principles, built from prior observations, are reinforced:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** The belief that the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is the single most valuable document for initial case analysis is solidified. It provides the legal question, arguments, and key context.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** This heuristic for deconstructing legal arguments remains a powerful tool for understanding what is salient to the Court.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** The \"Reasons for Granting the Petition\" section is confirmed as the highest-yield area for efficient analysis.\n\nThis observation adds two crucial layers to my design methodology:\n4.  **Validating the Sequential Strategy:** My previous hypothesis\u2014that after analyzing the Petition, the next logical step is to analyze the \"Brief in Opposition\"\u2014is now being actively implemented. The internal reasoning step confirms that this sequential approach (Petition -> Opposition) is the most direct path to resolving my primary uncertainty. This elevates the strategy from a good idea to a core operational principle, reflecting the dialectical nature of legal advocacy.\n5.  **The Value of Metacognitive Checkpoints:** The \"THINK\" action itself demonstrates a new, valuable heuristic. Periodically pausing the information-gathering process to perform an internal \"state of the world\" assessment is highly effective. This metacognitive step allows the agent to:\n    *   Synthesize and consolidate existing knowledge (\u03b8).\n    *   Explicitly identify the most significant remaining uncertainties.\n    *   Strategically plan the next action to target those specific uncertainties, ensuring that each step is maximally informative.\n    *   This confirms that an efficient design is not just about finding the right sources, but about the *rhythm* of observation and reflection."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Perttu v. Richards* has evolved dramatically. The previous observation defined my primary uncertainty\u2014the nature of the respondent's counter-arguments. This observation, the Brief in Opposition, has directly resolved that uncertainty, revealing a powerful and well-reasoned defense that significantly alters my prediction of the case's outcome. My belief state is no longer one-sided; it now encompasses the central constitutional clash at the heart of the case.\n\nMy foundational knowledge from the Petition for Certiorari remains, but it is now contextualized by the respondent's direct rebuttal:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The question remains undisputed, but the respondent has successfully reframed it from a procedural/statutory issue into a fundamental Seventh Amendment conflict.\n2.  **Circuit Split:** The respondent *concedes* the existence of the split with the Seventh Circuit's *Pavey* decision and the Ninth Circuit's endorsement in *Albino*. However, they characterize it as a \"shallow split\" and argue the Sixth Circuit is \"clearly correct,\" suggesting other circuits will eventually adopt their position, making Supreme Court intervention premature. This concession, while framed to argue against granting the writ, paradoxically strengthens the case for the Court to hear it and resolve the acknowledged disagreement.\n3.  **Respondent's Counter-Arguments:** I now have the respondent's arguments, which are formidable and directly counter the petitioner's three-part case:\n    *   **Constitutional Supremacy:** The respondent's primary argument is that this is a core Seventh Amendment case. They argue that \u00a7 1983 claims are suits at common law requiring a jury. They make a powerful analogy, citing *Smithers v. Smith*, that even jurisdictional facts (like amount-in-controversy) must be decided by a jury if they are intertwined with the merits of the case. They argue a fortiori that if a *jurisdictional* issue gets this protection, a mere *affirmative defense* like exhaustion certainly must.\n    *   **Historical Analysis:** The respondent grounds their constitutional claim in a historical analysis of common-law pleading, arguing that a factual challenge to the plaintiff's declaration (like the one here) would have been treated as a \"plea in traverse,\" which would have triggered a trial by jury, not a decision by a judge. This directly addresses the Supreme Court's historical test for the scope of the Seventh Amendment.\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation:** The respondent systematically dismantles the petitioner's PLRA-based argument. They cite key Supreme Court precedents like *Jones v. Bock* and *Woodford v. Ngo* to establish that the Court has already rejected the idea that PLRA exhaustion is a special \"jurisdictional\" requirement; it is simply an affirmative defense. They argue that the petitioner's concerns about judicial efficiency cannot override a direct constitutional command like the Seventh Amendment.\n\nMy prediction has shifted significantly. I previously had a strong inclination toward reversal based on the clean circuit split and the petitioner's strong statutory purpose argument. Now, my confidence in reversal is much lower. The case is a genuine, high-level legal contest: the petitioner's argument from inter-circuit uniformity and statutory efficiency versus the respondent's powerful, historically-grounded constitutional argument. My uncertainty has evolved from *what the respondent will argue* to *how the Justices will weigh a deep circuit split against a compelling Seventh Amendment claim*. The outcome is now much closer to a toss-up.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful confirmation and refinement of my meta-level strategies for legal analysis. My methodology is becoming more robust and predictive.\n\nMy core design principles have been tested and strengthened:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** This remains the best starting point for any case analysis.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** This heuristic continues to be an effective way to structure legal arguments. This observation added a crucial layer of sophistication: the framework is not flat, but hierarchical. A strong constitutional argument can effectively trump a statutory purpose argument, as demonstrated by the respondent's strategy.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** The \"Reasons for Granting/Denying the Writ\" sections are confirmed as the most information-rich parts of the initial briefs.\n4.  **Validation of the Sequential Strategy:** My hypothesis that the Brief in Opposition is the logical next step after the Petition for Certiorari has been proven correct in the most emphatic way. This observation directly answered the specific \"known unknowns\" I had identified. The dialectical approach (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply) is now a core, battle-tested operational principle for efficient analysis.\n5.  **The Power of Metacognitive Checkpoints:** The value of pausing to synthesize knowledge and explicitly define uncertainty is now undeniable. My previous \"THINK\" step allowed me to formulate precise questions that this observation answered, proving that a rhythm of observation and reflection is more efficient than continuous, undirected information gathering.\n6.  **New Heuristic: Primary Source Nuance:** This observation highlights that a summary would have been insufficient. The specific citation to *Smithers v. Smith*, the details of the common-law pleading analysis, and the rhetorical force of phrases like \"strap the Seventh Amendment to the roof\" are all critical data points for assessing argument strength that can only be found in the primary source document. This reinforces a belief in prioritizing deep dives into original texts."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Perttu v. Richards* is now highly structured, centered on a direct and fundamental legal conflict. My knowledge has progressed from an initial one-sided view to a nuanced appreciation of a high-stakes constitutional battle.\n\nMy cumulative knowledge, built upon the Petition for Certiorari and the Brief in Opposition, is as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue is whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for factual disputes over a prisoner's exhaustion of administrative remedies when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the underlying claim. This question remains the stable core of the case.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** The petitioner's case, drawn from the cert petition, rests on two pillars:\n    *   **Circuit Split:** A clear and acknowledged split exists between the Sixth Circuit (which found a jury right) and the Seventh and Ninth Circuits (which did not).\n    *   **Statutory Purpose:** The Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) was designed to efficiently filter out frivolous prisoner lawsuits, and allowing jury trials for the affirmative defense of exhaustion would undermine this core purpose, creating \"mini-trials\" that the statute was meant to avoid.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** The respondent's Brief in Opposition fundamentally reframed the debate, shifting it from a procedural/statutory issue to a constitutional one. Their arguments are:\n    *   **Constitutional Supremacy:** The Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial for suits at common law is the supreme law. They argue that if even jurisdictional facts intertwined with the merits require a jury (*Smithers v. Smith*), then a mere affirmative defense like exhaustion must also receive that protection.\n    *   **Historical Test:** The respondent's argument is grounded in the Supreme Court's historical test for the Seventh Amendment, contending that a factual challenge like this would have been a \"plea in traverse\" at common law, which was resolved by a jury.\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation:** Citing *Jones v. Bock* and *Woodford v. Ngo*, the respondent argues the Supreme Court has already established that PLRA exhaustion is an affirmative defense, not a special jurisdictional prerequisite that could bypass the Seventh Amendment.\n4.  **Current Predictive State:** My prediction has evolved from strongly favoring the petitioner (and reversal) to viewing the case as a genuine toss-up. The conflict is now clear: the petitioner's argument for statutory efficiency and inter-circuit uniformity versus the respondent's powerful, historically-grounded Seventh Amendment claim. This internal synthesis has crystallized my primary uncertainty. It is no longer \"what will the respondent argue?\" but has been refined to a much more specific question: **How will the petitioner's Reply Brief attempt to dismantle the respondent's formidable constitutional and historical arguments?** The outcome of the case now seems to hinge on whether the petitioner can find a convincing way to argue that the PLRA's procedural goals can or should operate as an exception to the Seventh Amendment's command.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of how to effectively analyze Supreme Court cases has been significantly refined and validated. The current strategy is proving highly efficient.\n\nMy core design principles have been tested and strengthened through a successful cycle of observation and synthesis:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Remains the optimal starting point for establishing the legal question, the parties' initial positions, and the existence of a circuit split.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** This heuristic is not just a checklist but a hierarchical model. The Brief in Opposition demonstrated that a strong constitutional argument can subordinate or even neutralize a compelling statutory purpose argument. The hierarchy appears to be Constitution > Statute > Circuit Split (as a reason to grant cert).\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** The \"Reasons for Granting/Denying the Writ\" sections are confirmed as the highest-yield targets for initial analysis.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** The strategy of analyzing briefs in their logical sequence (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply) is now a core, battle-tested principle. It correctly predicted that the Brief in Opposition would directly address the \"known unknowns\" from the initial petition.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** The value of analyzing original texts is reinforced. Nuances like the *Smithers v. Smith* analogy and the \"plea in traverse\" historical argument are critical data points for assessing argument strength and would be lost in a summary.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** This observation, being an internal `THINK` step, provides powerful evidence for a new principle. Pausing the information-gathering process to explicitly synthesize knowledge and define remaining uncertainty is a crucial, value-adding action. These reflective checkpoints are not passive summaries; they are an active part of the design that:\n    *   **Crystallizes knowledge** from a list of facts into a structured model of the core conflict.\n    *   **Sharpens uncertainty**, transforming a broad question into a precise, falsifiable hypothesis that can be targeted by the next action.\n    *   **Maximizes efficiency** by ensuring the next information-gathering step (in this case, seeking the Reply Brief) is the most direct path to resolving the most critical remaining uncertainty. This validates an `Observe -> Synthesize -> Observe` loop as a superior methodology."

It formalizes the need for more precise search queries, the value of using metadata to track procedural posture, and the importance of distinguishing between documents at different stages of litigation. These are highly generalizable principles that will improve the efficiency and accuracy of all future analyses. This is a textbook example of the agent learning *how* to learn more effectively.\n\nJoint EIG (1.5): The action is highly valuable because the design-level learning (how to construct a better search) is the direct enabler for solving the immediate task-level problem (finding the most critical document).

My knowledge has now progressed to include the procedural posture of the case before the Supreme Court.\n\nMy cumulative knowledge is as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue remains whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for factual disputes over a prisoner's exhaustion of administrative remedies under the PLRA when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** The petitioner's argument, established in the cert petition, is based on the need to resolve a circuit split (Sixth vs. Seventh/Ninth Circuits) and to uphold the PLRA's statutory purpose of efficiently filtering prisoner lawsuits without resource-intensive \"mini-trials\" on the affirmative defense of exhaustion.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** The respondent's argument, from the Brief in Opposition, powerfully reframes the issue as one of constitutional rights. It posits that the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial is supreme, applies to affirmative defenses with disputed facts (*Jones v. Bock*), and is supported by the historical test for what constitutes a suit at common law (a \"plea in traverse\").\n4.  **Updated Procedural Status & Predictive State:** The latest observation, while not providing the substantive arguments of the reply brief, has revealed a critical piece of information: **the Supreme Court has granted certiorari.** This confirms the national importance of the legal question and the significance of the circuit split. The case has now advanced from the certiorari stage to the merits stage. The existence of a merits-stage Reply Brief (filed Feb. 13, 2025, and containing 5,998 words) and a cert-stage Reply Brief (filed Aug. 30, 2024) is now confirmed. My prediction remains that the case is a toss-up, but the nature of my uncertainty has evolved. The question is no longer *if* the Court will weigh in, but *how*. The grant of cert slightly increases the probability of reversal, as the Court is acting on the petitioner's request to resolve a split. However, the strength of the respondent's constitutional argument remains a formidable obstacle. My primary uncertainty is now even more sharply focused: **What are the petitioner's refined arguments on the merits, and how do they attempt to create an exception to or distinguish the Seventh Amendment's historical test in the specific context of the PLRA?** The content of the merits briefs, particularly the Petitioner's Reply Brief, is now the most critical piece of evidence needed to make a final prediction.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level framework for analysis has been tested and significantly enhanced. The latest observation, while failing to retrieve the target content, provided immense strategic value, leading to important refinements in my methodology.\n\nMy core design principles have evolved and now include:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Remains the best starting point for understanding the core question and initial arguments.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** This hierarchical heuristic (Constitution > Statute > Circuit Split) remains a powerful tool for weighing the strength of competing arguments.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** The \"Reasons for Granting/Denying the Writ\" sections are confirmed as the highest-yield sections for initial analysis.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** The strategy of analyzing briefs in their logical sequence (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply) is strongly validated. The discovery of two separate reply briefs (one for cert, one for merits) reinforces that the legal conversation evolves in distinct stages, each requiring analysis.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** The value of analyzing original texts remains paramount.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** The `Observe -> Synthesize -> Observe` loop is a core, validated principle. Pausing to synthesize knowledge crystallizes the core conflict and sharpens the focus of the next information-gathering action, maximizing efficiency.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata (New Principle):** This observation provides powerful evidence that even when a search fails to return the primary target document, the resulting metadata can be critically important. Proofs of service and certificates of compliance, while not containing legal arguments, confirmed the existence of the reply brief and, crucially, revealed the case's progression to the merits stage. This single piece of metadata reframed the entire task. Ancillary documents should not be dismissed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture (New Principle):** I must actively track the procedural lifecycle of a case. My analysis must adapt as a case moves from the cert stage to the merits stage, as the relevant documents and the focus of the arguments will change.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement (Refined Principle):** Simple search queries can be ambiguous and return related but non-substantive documents. Future searches should be more precise. Information gleaned from metadata (e.g., the 5,998-word count from the Certificate of Compliance) can be used to construct more targeted queries to isolate the desired substantive document."

This is not accurate, and his concerns are \nunfounded. When prisoners fail to exhaust their ad-\nministrative remedies, those cases are dismissed \nwithout prejudice so the prisoner can have the oppor-\ntunity to use the grievance process. Moreover, the lim-\nitations period tolls while prisoners work their way \nthrough the grievance process.  \nRichards reveals his true aim, however, by argu-\ning that prisoners have the right to a jury trial to de-\ncide all issues of fact surrounding exhaustion under \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), regardless \nof whether disputed facts regarding exhaustion are in-\ntertwined with the underlying merits of their claim. \nBr. in Opp. 13\u201317. This proposition has no support in \nthe case law and, along with his misunderstanding of \nthe PLRA, casts a shadow over his entire argument. \nWhat is more, Richards concedes a circuit split but \nasks this Court to ignore a fundamental rift in the in-\nterpretation of both the Seventh Amendment and the \nwill of Congress as plainly stated in the PLRA. Br. in \nOpp. 2, 13. After all, if \u201c[t]he Sixth Circuit is clearly \nright\u2014and the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly \nwrong,\u201d Br. in Opp. 2, on an issue of constitutional in-\nterpretation affecting all the prisoner litigation in \nthose circuits, where millions of people live, then this \nCourt should grant this Petition to resolve the split.  \n\n2 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nRichards misconstrues the PLRA and its \njurisprudence. \nRichards shows an elementary misunderstanding \nof the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion jurisprudence when he \nclaims that \u201ca finding of non-exhaustion in the PLRA \ncontext will almost always bar the claim forever.\u201d Br. \nin Opp. 14. When cases, like his own, are dismissed, it \ndoes not prevent a prisoner from seeking relief. Ra-\nther, the PLRA merely requires that the prisoner com-\nplete the prison\u2019s grievance process. This approach \ncomports with one of the central purposes of exhaus-\ntion: the creation of \u201can administrative record that \nclarifies the contours of the controversy.\u201d Porter v. \nNussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524\u201325 (2002). \nRichards\u2019 argument has two key flaws. First, dis-\nmissals of prisoner cases under the PLRA for failure \nto exhaust are without prejudice to allow the prisoner \nto pursue the grievance process and then permit \u201cthe \nlitigant to refile if he exhausts or is otherwise no \nlonger barred by the PLRA requirements.\u201d Bargher v. \nWhite, 928 F.3d 439, 447 (5th Cir. 2019) (citing Booth \nv. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 735 (2001)). See also Boyd \nv. Corr. Corp. of Am., 380 F.3d 989, 994 (6th Cir. 2004) \n(holding that a dismissal for failure to exhaust under \nthe PLRA \u201cshould be without prejudice\u201d); Gallagher v. \nShelton, 587 F.3d 1063, 1068 (10th Cir. 2009) (Under \nthe PLRA, \u201ca dismissal based on a failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies should be without preju-\ndice.\u201d). \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSecond, and equally important, when a prisoner\u2019s \ncase is dismissed for failure to exhaust, the limitations \nperiod is tolled while the prisoner exhausts his admin-\nistrative remedies. Gonzalez v. Hasty, 651 F.3d 318, \n323\u201334 (2d Cir. 2011) (holding that \u201cequitable tolling \nis applicable to the time period during which a pris-\noner-plaintiff is exhausting his administrative reme-\ndies pursuant to the PLRA.\u201d); Brown v. Morgan, 209 \nF.3d 595, 596 (6th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[T]he statute of limita-\ntions which applied to Brown\u2019s civil rights action was \ntolled for the period during which his available state \nremedies were being exhausted.\u201d).  \nRichards compounds his misunderstanding of the \nSeventh Amendment and the PLRA by arguing that \nprisoners have the right to a jury trial to decide all \nissues of fact surrounding exhaustion under the \nPLRA, regardless of whether disputed facts regarding \nexhaustion are intertwined with the underlying mer-\nits of their claim. Br. in Opp. 13\u201317. He cites no rele-\nvant authority for this novel proposition, instead rely-\ning on ancient tomes that discuss antiquated common-\nlaw pleading forms. \nNot only have those dusty pleading rules been \nsupplanted\u2014since 1938\u2014by the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, but more recent case law strongly \ncuts against Richards\u2019 argument. Every circuit to ex-\namine the issue has held that \u201cjudges may resolve fac-\ntual disputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without \nthe participation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., \n728 F.3d 265, 271 (3d Cir. 2013). See also Lee v. Willey, \n789 F.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015); Messa v. Goord, 652 \nF.3d 305, 308\u201309 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam); Dillon v. \nRogers, 596 F.3d 260, 272 (5th Cir. 2010); Pavey v. \n\n4 \n \nConley, 544 F.3d 739, 742 (7th Cir. 2008); Bryant v. \nRich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008); Wyatt \nv. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119\u201320 (9th Cir. 2003), \noverruled on other grounds by Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d \n1162, 1166 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc). Richards\u2019 specu-\nlative argument has no basis in law. \nII. This Court should resolve the concrete \ncircuit split that implicates both the Seventh \nAmendment and the PLRA. \nIn analyzing the Seventh Amendment and the \nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement, the Seventh Circuit \ncorrectly held that the two provisions do not conflict. \nIndeed, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision squares the text \nof the Seventh Amendment, which does not require a \njury trial to determine all factual issues, with Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose in enacting the PLRA\u2014to decrease \nthe burden on district courts by weeding out nonviable \nclaims. Under a proper reading of the two provisions, \njudges may decide exhaustion issues without a jury.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held otherwise and, in doing so, \nrelied on inapposite precedent. This Court should re-\nsolve the circuit split created by the Sixth Circuit\u2019s er-\nroneous decision. \nA. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Pavey \nfollows the Seventh Amendment while \nalso respecting the congressional intent \nbehind the PLRA. \nContrary to Richards\u2019 assertions, Br. in Opp. 10\u2013\n12, Judge Posner\u2019s well-reasoned opinion in Pavey v. \nConley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. 2008), makes perfect \n\n5 \n \nsense because it recognizes both that the Seventh \nAmendment does not require a jury to determine all \nfactual issues and that Congress enacted the PLRA to \nrelieve the burden on lower courts by filtering out non-\nviable claims. \nThe Seventh Circuit carefully analyzed the Sev-\nenth Amendment and the PLRA, concluding that the \nexhaustion requirement did not conflict with the Sev-\nenth Amendment. Deciding the threshold issue of ex-\nhaustion is no different than deciding subject-matter \njurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, supplemental juris-\ndiction, or abstention, all of which require judges to \ndecide issues of fact without a jury. Id. at 741. The \nCourt also recognized that \u201cthe only consequence of a \nfailure to exhaust is that the prisoner must go back\u201d \nand exhaust the grievance process. Id. Pavey also \nnoted that, should a jury be necessary to decide ex-\nhaustion, the result would be the absurdity of \u201ca series \nof jury trials before there was a trial on the merits: a \njury trial to decide exhaustion, a verdict finding that \nthe prisoner had failed to exhaust, an administrative \nproceeding, the resumption of the litigation, and an-\nother jury trial on failure to exhaust.\u201d Id. It is difficult \nto square this labyrinthian result with either the Sev-\nenth Amendment or the PLRA, and for all his criti-\ncism of Pavey, Richards makes no attempt to do so. \nThe Ninth Circuit adopted Pavey, noting that \ncourts have \u201cexercised substantial discretion in fash-\nioning exhaustion rules, though \u2018appropriate defer-\nence to Congress\u2019s power to prescribe the basic proce-\ndural scheme . . . requires fashioning of exhaustion \nprinciples in a manner consistent with congressional \nintent.\u2019 \u201d Albino, 747 F.3d at 1171 (quoting Booth, 532 \n\n6 \n \nU.S. at 735). One of the key principles for exhaustion \nis that it \u201cshould be decided as early as feasible.\u201d Al-\nbino, 747 F.3d at 1170 (citing Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 202 (2007) (\u201cAmong other reforms, the PLRA \nmandates early judicial screening of prisoner com-\nplaints and requires prisoners to exhaust prison griev-\nance procedures before filing suit.\u201d). Thus, just as \njudges decide disputed issues of fact in a motion for \nsummary judgment, or issues of jurisdiction and ab-\nstention, they likewise should decide whether a pris-\noner has exhausted administrative remedies\u2014includ-\ning when the issue is intertwined with the underlying \nmerits of the claim. Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371. \nPavey and Albino, which implement the clear will of \nCongress while acknowledging that the Seventh \nAmendment does not apply to threshold issues, make \nmore sense than the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision.  \nB. The Sixth Circuit decision is clearly \nincorrect \nand \nrelied \non \nits \nown \ninapposite intra-circuit precedent. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision not only creates a \nsplit with the Seventh Circuit, but it is also wrong. \nRichards acknowledges that the Sixth Circuit relied \non in-circuit precedent, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. \nv. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 \n(6th Cir. 1958), rather than a robust discussion of the \nPLRA. Br. in Opp. 6\u20137. And although he grudgingly \nadmits that Fireman\u2019s Fund did not discuss the Sev-\nenth Amendment at all, he refers to this as \u201conly su-\nperficially true\u201d because the case relied on Smithers v. \nSmith, 204 U.S. 632 (1907) and Land v. Dollar, 330 \nU.S. 731 (1947). Br. in Opp. 6\u20137. But Smithers and \nLand fail to make Fireman\u2019s Fund applicable and \n\n7 \n \ninstead underscore that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is \nbased on a porous foundation. \nAt issue in Smithers was the title to 1,280 acres of \nland. 204 U.S. at 633. The defendant argued not only \nthat the amount in controversy failed to meet the nec-\nessary jurisdictional requirement of $2,000, but also \nthat the plaintiff\u2019s allegations to the contrary were \nfraudulent. Id. at 641. As in Fireman\u2019s Fund, the dis-\ntrict court agreed with the defendant and dismissed \nthe case. Id. at 642. \nThis Court reversed, in part because the plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations of the amount in controversy typically con-\ntrolled, rendering it unnecessary for a judge to rule on \nthis issue. Id. Moreover, after examining the evidence, \nit concluded that the value of the land in question was \n\u201cmuch in excess of the jurisdictional amount.\u201d Id. at \n643\u201344. And the district court appeared not to have \nconsidered the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. Id. In addition, \nthis Court found no precedent supporting the district \ncourt\u2019s determination, particularly where the proce-\ndure that was used omitted \u201cthe ordinary incidents of \ntrial.\u201d Id. at 644\u201345. Although \u201cthe right to a jury\u201d con-\nstituted an ordinary incident of trial, the primary ba-\nsis for reversal was the evidence itself. Smithers \nsimply does not speak to the Seventh Amendment\u2019s \napplicability to exhaustion determinations.  \nLand is similarly inapposite. There, the plaintiff \ncontended that several federal officials had refused to \nreturn stock pledged in exchange for a governmental \nloan. 330 U.S. at 733. The district court held a hearing \non the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, \nafter which it sua sponte dismissed the case because \nthe suit was against the United States and thus \n\n8 \n \nbarred by immunity. Id. at 734\u201335. But the decision \nwas based in part on affidavits and \u201chad not been sub-\nmitted for decision on the merits,\u201d and \u201cthe question \nof jurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \nId. at 735. This Court did not discuss either the Sev-\nenth Amendment or whether a jury was necessary to \ndetermine the merits. \nSo, while it is true that the line from Smithers and \nLand to Fireman\u2019s Fund is clear and straight, that \nline is not based on Seventh Amendment principles. \nAs such, these cases serve to highlight the flawed ba-\nsis of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reasoning below. \nThe applicable principle that does emerge from \nthese cases is that courts have the discretion to deter-\nmine threshold issues without a jury. So long as the \ncourt provides the parties the incidents of trial, a jury \nis not necessary. Instead of following this line of rea-\nsoning, however, the Sixth Circuit mechanically ap-\nplied the Seventh Amendment\u2019s jury requirement \nwithout regard to the other incidents of trial. The \ncourt was heedless of the precedent allowing courts to \nmake findings of fact on threshold issues, and it coun-\ntermanded Congress\u2019s intent in the PLRA. Thus, not \nonly did the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision create a circuit \nsplit on this issue, it was also wrong on the merits. \nAnd on the underlying exhaustion question, the \nmagistrate who heard the testimony and scrutinized \nthe evidence found Richards\u2019 proofs lacking. Richards \ncharacterizes his claims as \u201c \u2018serious and detailed al-\nlegations [that] cannot reasonably be considered friv-\nolous.\u2019 \u201d Br. in Opp. 3 (quoting App. 8a). But this Court \n\n9 \n \nis not bound by the Sixth Circuit\u2019s finding here.1 In-\ndeed, the magistrate judge found that Richards and \nhis witnesses lacked \u201cpersonal knowledge of the inci-\ndents\u201d at issue and, for that matter, lacked any sem-\nblance of credibility. App. 69a\u201376a. Richards chal-\nlenges none of these findings, showing that his re-\nquest for a jury is the type of \u201csportive filing[ ]\u201d that \nthe PLRA was designed to end. Skinner v. Switzer, \n562 U.S. 521, 535 (2011).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should grant this  \nPetition.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

At the same time, it comports with \nthe PLRA\u2019s strict, mandatory exhaustion regime. \nRichards posits a bright-line rule that he says \nwould resolve this case\u2014that \u201cpredominantly factual \nissues relevant to liability in actions for money dam-\nages are for the jury.\u201d Br. 13. But that rule has no ap-\nplication here, where it is dependent on two incorrect \nsuppositions. The first is that no prisoner will ever be \nable to return to federal court, making a dismissal \nwithout prejudice a label without substance. That is \nsimply not true for many prisoners. Numerous prison \ngrievance systems across the country afford prisoners \nan opportunity to return to court after a dismissal \nwithout prejudice. The second is that a judge\u2019s deter-\nmination of intertwined facts concerning exhaustion \nwill be binding on a jury that might later hear the \nmerits, thus effectively deciding the merits where the \nprisoner has a right to a jury trial. But it would not be \nbinding. Richards\u2019 proffered rule might be applicable \nin other contexts, but it is not so here\u2014and it is wholly \ncontrary to the goals of the PLRA.  \nSupport for Richards\u2019 rule further unravels when \nhe makes comparisons to defenses such as jurisdic-\ntion, venue, and statute of limitations, which are not \nappropriate comparators, and seeks support in the \nBeacon Theatres line of cases. The former tend to be \n\n2 \n \ndependent on the degree of intertwinement and rest \non the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion. The latter \nwere driven by concerns about collateral estoppel, \nwhich, again, are not present in this context. \nOne comes away from Richards\u2019 merits brief with \nthe idea that judges never decide intertwined facts. \nBut they do. Class certification prerequisites and \nheightened pleading requirements are two such exam-\nples. And as Markman demonstrates, judicial fact-\nfinding on legal issues\u2014even where not, strictly \nspeaking, intertwined with the merits\u2014can greatly \nimpact a jury\u2019s determination, yet do not infringe on \nthe Seventh Amendment. \nNo one disputes that prisoners have a right to a \njury trial on their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims once they \nmeet the PLRA\u2019s threshold exhaustion requirement \nand otherwise state a viable claim for relief. And those \nprisoners, like Richards, who can go back and exhaust \nhave the opportunity for a jury to decide the merits of \ntheir legal claims. This comports with the goals of the \nPLRA while preserving the right to a jury trial under \nthe Seventh Amendment.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nJudges \ncan \ndecide \nintertwined \nfacts \nregarding \nPLRA \nexhaustion \nwithout \nimpinging on the Seventh Amendment.  \nRichards\u2019 arguments appear to rule out allocation \nto a judge any time there are intertwined facts in an \naction at law for money damages. The Seventh \nAmendment does not mandate that broad rule, and \n\n3 \n \nthis Court has never adopted it. To the contrary, this \nCourt has recognized circumstances where a judge \nmay, in making a preliminary determination, decide \nfacts that are intertwined with the merits. And the \ncircumstances where intertwined facts counsel send-\ning factfinding to a jury are distinguishable, being ca-\npable of resolution only by proceeding to the merits. \nDismissal for failure to exhaust, by contrast, will not \ndetermine the ultimate merits question. Nor does the \nBeacon Theatres line of cases help Richards, as it is \ndriven by concerns about collateral estoppel, which \nare not present in the PLRA exhaustion context. For \nthese reasons, judges may engage in factfinding to re-\nsolve whether a prisoner has exhausted prison griev-\nance procedures even where that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. \nA. PLRA exhaustion is an affirmative \ndefense, but affirmative defenses can be \nthreshold \nissues \nthat \nare \nproperly \ndecided by judges not juries. \n\u201cThe Seventh Amendment does not confer the \nright to a trial, but only the right to have a jury hear \nthe case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u201d Caley v. Gulfstream \nAerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(emphasis omitted) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. \nCo. v. Orr, 294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)). Exhaus-\ntion is one of those threshold issues that determine \nwhether the litigation should proceed before a court. \nAnd in intertwined cases, \u201c[t]he alternative of trying \nthe merits before exhaustion . . . is unsatisfactory . . . \nbecause it would thwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials \nof prisoner cases in which the prisoner has failed to \n\n4 \n \nexhaust his administrative remedies. A jury might de-\ncide the merits of a case that should never have gotten \nto the merits stage because the judge should have \nfound that the prisoner had failed to exhaust his ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739, \n742 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nRichards pushes back against Perttu\u2019s characteri-\nzation of PLRA exhaustion as a threshold issue. But \nas a matter of logic, exhaustion is just that. It is clear \nfrom the PLRA\u2019s language that Congress intended it \nto be preliminary to the case proceeding, for the ex-\nhaustion provision reads: \u201cNo action shall be brought \n. . . until such administrative remedies as are availa-\nble are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (emphasis \nadded).1 This makes sense, as it allows claims to be \nresolved \u201cmore quickly and economically\u201d within the \nprison system, settles some claims at the administra-\ntive level, and may \u201cconvince the losing party not to \npursue the matter in federal court.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 89 (2006) (citations omitted).  \nRichards argues that because PLRA exhaustion is \nan affirmative defense and Congress decided not to in-\nclude exhaustion in the \u00a7 1997e(c) prescreening provi-\nsion, exhaustion is an \u201cordinary affirmative defense\u201d \nrather than a threshold issue. Br. at 15\u201317. But \n \n1 This deliberate, mandatory timing component is a stark depar-\nture from the previous exhaustion provision under the Civil \nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Pub. L. No. 96-247, 94 \nSt. 349, which provided that \u201c[i]n any action brought . . . the court \nshall, if the court believes that such a requirement would be ap-\npropriate and in the interests of justice, continue such case for a \nperiod of not to exceed 180 days in order to require exhaustion of \nsuch plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies as are \navailable.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nneither prevents exhaustion from being considered as \na preliminary matter, consistent with the language of \n\u00a7 1997e(a).  \nOn the first point, Richards overreads Woodford \nand Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199 (2007). Neither case \nsuggests that exhaustion is not a threshold issue. \nWoodford explains that exhaustion is not jurisdic-\ntional, 548 U.S. at 101, and Jones holds that PLRA \nexhaustion is an affirmative defense, 549 U.S. at 212\u2013\n13, meaning that prisoners need not raise exhaustion \nin their pleadings. As to the \u201cusual practice,\u201d id. at \n212, the Federal Rules provide only that affirmative \ndefenses must be raised in a defendant\u2019s responsive \npleading, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), without otherwise \nmandating the timing or manner of their resolution.  \nThe PLRA, however, does address the timing of \nexhaustion\u2014by indicating that no prisoner action \nmay be brought \u201cuntil\u201d available administrative rem-\nedies are exhausted. See \u00a7 1997e(a). The text of the \nPLRA is clear, and this Court\u2019s precedent is consistent \nwith its language. See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, \n524 (2002) (explaining that \u201cexhaustion is a prerequi-\nsite to suit\u201d) (citing Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, \n741 (2001)); Woodford, 548 U.S. at 100 (\u201c[S]aying that \na party may not sue in federal court until the party \nfirst pursues all available avenues of administrative \nreview necessarily means that, if the party never pur-\nsues all available avenues of administrative review, \nthe person will never be able to sue in federal court.\u201d).  \n\n6 \n \nB. Judges sometimes decide intertwined \nfacts regarding threshold issues, even in \ncases where there is a right to a jury trial \non the merits. \nConsistent with this Court\u2019s reminder that \u201cthe \nSeventh Amendment was never intended to establish \nthe jury as the exclusive mechanism for factfinding in \ncivil cases,\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety \n& Health Rev. Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, 460 (1977), \njudges do decide intertwined facts on threshold issues. \nTake the class-action context. Intertwinement \narose in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, \n342 (2011), a proposed class action alleging that the \ndiscretion exercised by supervisors as to pay and pro-\nmotion matters violated Title VII by discriminating \nagainst women. The commonality prerequisite \u201cover-\nlap[ped] with the respondents\u2019 merits contention that \nWal\u2013Mart engage[d] in a pattern or practice of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d Id. at 352. This Court explained that \n\u201c[f]requently [Rule 23(a)\u2019s] \u2018rigorous analysis\u2019 will en-\ntail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s un-\nderlying claim.\u201d Id. at 351. \u201cThat,\u201d the Court said, \n\u201ccannot be helped,\u201d because \u201cthe class determination \ngenerally involves considerations that are enmeshed \nin the factual and legal issues comprising the plain-\ntiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). But the \nCourt explained that there was not \u201canything unusual \nabout that consequence,\u201d as \u201c[t]he necessity of touch-\ning aspects of the merits in order to resolve prelimi-\nnary matters, e.g., jurisdiction and venue, is a familiar \nfeature of litigation.\u201d Id. at 351\u201352 (emphasis added) \n(citation omitted).  \n\n7 \n \nWal-Mart is instructive because Rule 23 does not \nset forth a mere pleading standard, but rather re-\nquires a party seeking class certification to \u201caffirma-\ntively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule\u2014\nthat is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in \nfact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions \nof law or fact, etc.\u201d Id. at 350. And that can require a \njudge to \u201cprobe behind the pleadings before coming to \nrest on the certification question.\u201d Id. (quoting Gen. \nTel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982)). \nSee also Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, \n568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013) (noting that \u201c[m]erits ques-\ntions may be considered to the extent\u2026they are rele-\nvant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequi-\nsites for class certification are satisfied\u201d) (citation \nomitted); In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig., 471 \nF.3d 24, 41 (2d Cir. 2006) (cautioning that a judge\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to make . . . [Rule 23] determinations is not \nlessened by overlap between a Rule 23 requirement \nand a merits issue, even a merits issue that is identical \nwith a Rule 23 requirement\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nCases involving heightened pleading require-\nments are also instructive. At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, \na judge can require a comparative weighing of factual \nassertions and prevent submission of claims to a jury \nwithout violating the Seventh Amendment. This can \nbe seen in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \n551 U.S. 308, 313 (2007), an action under the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), \nwhich sets forth \u201c[e]xacting\u201d pleading requirements \nfor both the facts constituting the alleged violation \nand the facts evidencing scienter. This Court allowed \nthe judge to determine whether a reasonable person \nwould deem the inference of scienter to be at least as \n\n8 \n \nstrong as the opposing inference. Id. at 322\u201324. In do-\ning so, the judge had to \u201cengage in a comparative eval-\nuation,\u201d \u201cconsider[ing] not only inferences urged by \nthe plaintiff . . . but also competing inferences ration-\nally drawn from the facts alleged,\u201d id. at 314, in order \nto determine whether \u201ca reasonable person would \ndeem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as \ncompelling as any opposing inference one could draw \nfrom the facts alleged,\u201d id. at 324. This Court de-\nscribed the heightened pleading rule as a congression-\nally \u201cprescribe[d] means of making an issue,\u201d id. at \n311 (cleaned up), and it noted that only when \u201c[t]he \nissue [has been] made as prescribed,\u201d id. at 328, does \nthe jury then have the authority to \u201cassess the credi-\nbility of witnesses, resolve genuine issues of fact, and \nmake the ultimate determination\u201d as to scienter, id. \nat 311 (cleaned up)\u2014much like PLRA exhaustion.  \nAlthough the Seventh Circuit in Tellabs was con-\ncerned that this screening violated the Seventh \nAmendment, this Court said the concern was undue, \nthat a comparative assessment of plausible infer-\nences\u2014while constantly assuming the plaintiff\u2019s alle-\ngations to be true\u2014\u201cdoes not impinge upon the Sev-\nenth Amendment right to jury trial.\u201d Id. at 326\u201327. \nThe goals of the PSLRA\u2019s pleading requirements are \nalso much like the statutory requirements of the \nPLRA\u2014to screen out frivolous suits, while allowing \nmeritorious actions to move forward. Id. at 328. \nThere are situations, too, where, although a \njudge\u2019s factfinding on a legal issue does not involve \nspecific facts that are intertwined with the merits, it \naffects the merits and can end up being dispositive of \nthe underlying merits question. Yet the jury has not \n\n9 \n \nhad to \u201cshoulder\u201d that factfinding responsibility \u201cas \nnecessary to preserve the substance of the common-law \nright of trial by jury.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 377 (1996) (cleaned up). \nMarkman provides a vivid example. There, this Court \nsaid that the \u201cmongrel practice\u201d of deciding disputed \nclaim terms over which testimony is offered fell to the \njudge and not the jury, id. at 378, even though doing \nso involved reviewing extrinsic evidence and making \ncredibility determinations, and even though the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s determination on the legal issue led to \njudgment as a matter of law for the alleged infringer, \ncontrary to the jury\u2019s findings, id. at 375. See also \nTeva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, \n333 (2015) (explaining that while \u201c[i]n some instances, \na factual finding will play only a small role in a judge\u2019s \nultimate legal conclusion about the meaning of the pa-\ntent term,\u201d in others \u201ca factual finding may be close to \ndispositive of the ultimate legal question of the proper \nmeaning of the term in the context of the patent\u201d).  \nC. The contexts in which judges might send \na threshold issue to the jury due to \nintertwined facts are distinguishable. \nJudges do sometimes send intertwined facts to the \njury, but the cases and contexts in which they tend to \ndo so are distinguishable from PLRA exhaustion.  \nTake jurisdictional issues. They are generally de-\ncided by a judge, and that makes sense because \n\u201c[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all \nin any cause.\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, \n523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998) (cleaned up). But there are \ncases in which the question of jurisdiction can be \n\n10 \n \nresolved only by proceeding to a decision on the mer-\nits\u2014in other words, where jurisdiction is \u201cdependent \non [a] decision on the merits.\u201d Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. \n731, 735 (1947). That was the circumstance in Fire-\nman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Railway Express Agency, \nInc., the decision on which the court below relied in \nruling that intertwined exhaustion facts require a \njury trial. 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. 1958) (amount \nin controversy could not be decided without that juris-\ndictional ruling \u201cconstituting at the same time a rul-\ning on the merits of the case\u201d). In that situation, a dis-\ntrict court holds jurisdiction to resolve both. Land, 330 \nU.S. at 739.  \nThose jurisdictional issues do not govern how \ncourts should handle PLRA exhaustion for several \nreasons. First, a district judge has discretion in deter-\nmining the mode of deciding jurisdiction in inter-\ntwined cases. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., \n419 U.S. 186, 203 n.19 (1974) (noting that jurisdic-\ntional decisions may be deferred until a hearing on the \nmerits); Wetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 121 (1898) \n(same); 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1350 (4th ed. 2024) \n(\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until evidence is \nsubmitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case.\u201d) (emphasis \nadded). That defeats Richards\u2019 insistence that the \nSeventh Amendment mandates that intertwined \nthreshold issues go to the jury. Second, dismissal for \nwant of jurisdiction often closes the courthouse door \nforever, while dismissal for failure to exhaust under \n\n11 \n \nthe PLRA typically leaves the prisoner free to there-\nafter exhaust and seek an adjudication on the merits.2  \nStatute of limitations is another example of an af-\nfirmative defense that differs from PLRA exhaustion. \nIn contrast to the discretion a judge might employ in \nequitably tolling the statute of limitations, the PLRA\u2019s \nexhaustion requirement is mandatory, see Booth, 532 \nU.S. at 739, and cannot be excused by a court, Ross v. \nBlake, 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016).  \nFor these reasons, how courts treat jurisdictional \nissues and statutes of limitations do not dictate how \njudges should handle PLRA exhaustion when the rel-\nevant facts are intertwined with the merits. As ex-\nplained below, allocation of intertwined PLRA ex-\nhaustion facts to a judge does not impinge on the Sev-\nenth Amendment right to a jury trial.  \n \n2 Most circuits to have addressed the issue have held that a dis-\nmissal for failure to exhaust under the PLRA should be without \nprejudice. See Savage v. United States Dep\u2019t of Just., 91 F.4th \n480, 484 (D.C. Cir. 2024); Moss v. Harwood, 19 F.4th 614, 623 n.3 \n(4th Cir. 2021); Bargher v. White, 928 F.3d 439, 447 (5th Cir. \n2019); Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 81 n.16 (3d Cir. \n2019); Porter v. Sturm, 781 F.3d 448, 452 (8th Cir. 2015) (cita-\ntions omitted); Gallagher v.

This is not accurate, and his concerns are \nunfounded. When prisoners fail to exhaust their ad-\nministrative remedies, those cases are dismissed \nwithout prejudice so the prisoner can have the oppor-\ntunity to use the grievance process. Moreover, the lim-\nitations period tolls while prisoners work their way \nthrough the grievance process.  \nRichards reveals his true aim, however, by argu-\ning that prisoners have the right to a jury trial to de-\ncide all issues of fact surrounding exhaustion under \nthe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), regardless \nof whether disputed facts regarding exhaustion are in-\ntertwined with the underlying merits of their claim. \nBr. in Opp. 13\u201317. This proposition has no support in \nthe case law and, along with his misunderstanding of \nthe PLRA, casts a shadow over his entire argument. \nWhat is more, Richards concedes a circuit split but \nasks this Court to ignore a fundamental rift in the in-\nterpretation of both the Seventh Amendment and the \nwill of Congress as plainly stated in the PLRA. Br. in \nOpp. 2, 13. After all, if \u201c[t]he Sixth Circuit is clearly \nright\u2014and the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly \nwrong,\u201d Br. in Opp. 2, on an issue of constitutional in-\nterpretation affecting all the prisoner litigation in \nthose circuits, where millions of people live, then this \nCourt should grant this Petition to resolve the split.  \n\n2 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nRichards misconstrues the PLRA and its \njurisprudence. \nRichards shows an elementary misunderstanding \nof the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion jurisprudence when he \nclaims that \u201ca finding of non-exhaustion in the PLRA \ncontext will almost always bar the claim forever.\u201d Br. \nin Opp. 14. When cases, like his own, are dismissed, it \ndoes not prevent a prisoner from seeking relief. Ra-\nther, the PLRA merely requires that the prisoner com-\nplete the prison\u2019s grievance process. This approach \ncomports with one of the central purposes of exhaus-\ntion: the creation of \u201can administrative record that \nclarifies the contours of the controversy.\u201d Porter v. \nNussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524\u201325 (2002). \nRichards\u2019 argument has two key flaws. First, dis-\nmissals of prisoner cases under the PLRA for failure \nto exhaust are without prejudice to allow the prisoner \nto pursue the grievance process and then permit \u201cthe \nlitigant to refile if he exhausts or is otherwise no \nlonger barred by the PLRA requirements.\u201d Bargher v. \nWhite, 928 F.3d 439, 447 (5th Cir. 2019) (citing Booth \nv. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, 735 (2001)). See also Boyd \nv. Corr. Corp. of Am., 380 F.3d 989, 994 (6th Cir. 2004) \n(holding that a dismissal for failure to exhaust under \nthe PLRA \u201cshould be without prejudice\u201d); Gallagher v. \nShelton, 587 F.3d 1063, 1068 (10th Cir. 2009) (Under \nthe PLRA, \u201ca dismissal based on a failure to exhaust \nadministrative remedies should be without preju-\ndice.\u201d). \n \n \n\n3 \n \nSecond, and equally important, when a prisoner\u2019s \ncase is dismissed for failure to exhaust, the limitations \nperiod is tolled while the prisoner exhausts his admin-\nistrative remedies. Gonzalez v. Hasty, 651 F.3d 318, \n323\u201334 (2d Cir. 2011) (holding that \u201cequitable tolling \nis applicable to the time period during which a pris-\noner-plaintiff is exhausting his administrative reme-\ndies pursuant to the PLRA.\u201d); Brown v. Morgan, 209 \nF.3d 595, 596 (6th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[T]he statute of limita-\ntions which applied to Brown\u2019s civil rights action was \ntolled for the period during which his available state \nremedies were being exhausted.\u201d).  \nRichards compounds his misunderstanding of the \nSeventh Amendment and the PLRA by arguing that \nprisoners have the right to a jury trial to decide all \nissues of fact surrounding exhaustion under the \nPLRA, regardless of whether disputed facts regarding \nexhaustion are intertwined with the underlying mer-\nits of their claim. Br. in Opp. 13\u201317. He cites no rele-\nvant authority for this novel proposition, instead rely-\ning on ancient tomes that discuss antiquated common-\nlaw pleading forms. \nNot only have those dusty pleading rules been \nsupplanted\u2014since 1938\u2014by the Federal Rules of \nCivil Procedure, but more recent case law strongly \ncuts against Richards\u2019 argument. Every circuit to ex-\namine the issue has held that \u201cjudges may resolve fac-\ntual disputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without \nthe participation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., \n728 F.3d 265, 271 (3d Cir. 2013). See also Lee v. Willey, \n789 F.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015); Messa v. Goord, 652 \nF.3d 305, 308\u201309 (2d Cir. 2011) (per curiam); Dillon v. \nRogers, 596 F.3d 260, 272 (5th Cir. 2010); Pavey v. \n\n4 \n \nConley, 544 F.3d 739, 742 (7th Cir. 2008); Bryant v. \nRich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008); Wyatt \nv. Terhune, 315 F.3d 1108, 1119\u201320 (9th Cir. 2003), \noverruled on other grounds by Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d \n1162, 1166 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc). Richards\u2019 specu-\nlative argument has no basis in law. \nII. This Court should resolve the concrete \ncircuit split that implicates both the Seventh \nAmendment and the PLRA. \nIn analyzing the Seventh Amendment and the \nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement, the Seventh Circuit \ncorrectly held that the two provisions do not conflict. \nIndeed, the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision squares the text \nof the Seventh Amendment, which does not require a \njury trial to determine all factual issues, with Con-\ngress\u2019s purpose in enacting the PLRA\u2014to decrease \nthe burden on district courts by weeding out nonviable \nclaims. Under a proper reading of the two provisions, \njudges may decide exhaustion issues without a jury.  \nThe Sixth Circuit held otherwise and, in doing so, \nrelied on inapposite precedent. This Court should re-\nsolve the circuit split created by the Sixth Circuit\u2019s er-\nroneous decision. \nA. The Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Pavey \nfollows the Seventh Amendment while \nalso respecting the congressional intent \nbehind the PLRA. \nContrary to Richards\u2019 assertions, Br. in Opp. 10\u2013\n12, Judge Posner\u2019s well-reasoned opinion in Pavey v. \nConley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. 2008), makes perfect \n\n5 \n \nsense because it recognizes both that the Seventh \nAmendment does not require a jury to determine all \nfactual issues and that Congress enacted the PLRA to \nrelieve the burden on lower courts by filtering out non-\nviable claims. \nThe Seventh Circuit carefully analyzed the Sev-\nenth Amendment and the PLRA, concluding that the \nexhaustion requirement did not conflict with the Sev-\nenth Amendment. Deciding the threshold issue of ex-\nhaustion is no different than deciding subject-matter \njurisdiction, personal jurisdiction, supplemental juris-\ndiction, or abstention, all of which require judges to \ndecide issues of fact without a jury. Id. at 741. The \nCourt also recognized that \u201cthe only consequence of a \nfailure to exhaust is that the prisoner must go back\u201d \nand exhaust the grievance process. Id. Pavey also \nnoted that, should a jury be necessary to decide ex-\nhaustion, the result would be the absurdity of \u201ca series \nof jury trials before there was a trial on the merits: a \njury trial to decide exhaustion, a verdict finding that \nthe prisoner had failed to exhaust, an administrative \nproceeding, the resumption of the litigation, and an-\nother jury trial on failure to exhaust.\u201d Id. It is difficult \nto square this labyrinthian result with either the Sev-\nenth Amendment or the PLRA, and for all his criti-\ncism of Pavey, Richards makes no attempt to do so. \nThe Ninth Circuit adopted Pavey, noting that \ncourts have \u201cexercised substantial discretion in fash-\nioning exhaustion rules, though \u2018appropriate defer-\nence to Congress\u2019s power to prescribe the basic proce-\ndural scheme . . . requires fashioning of exhaustion \nprinciples in a manner consistent with congressional \nintent.\u2019 \u201d Albino, 747 F.3d at 1171 (quoting Booth, 532 \n\n6 \n \nU.S. at 735). One of the key principles for exhaustion \nis that it \u201cshould be decided as early as feasible.\u201d Al-\nbino, 747 F.3d at 1170 (citing Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 202 (2007) (\u201cAmong other reforms, the PLRA \nmandates early judicial screening of prisoner com-\nplaints and requires prisoners to exhaust prison griev-\nance procedures before filing suit.\u201d). Thus, just as \njudges decide disputed issues of fact in a motion for \nsummary judgment, or issues of jurisdiction and ab-\nstention, they likewise should decide whether a pris-\noner has exhausted administrative remedies\u2014includ-\ning when the issue is intertwined with the underlying \nmerits of the claim. Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371. \nPavey and Albino, which implement the clear will of \nCongress while acknowledging that the Seventh \nAmendment does not apply to threshold issues, make \nmore sense than the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision.  \nB. The Sixth Circuit decision is clearly \nincorrect \nand \nrelied \non \nits \nown \ninapposite intra-circuit precedent. \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision not only creates a \nsplit with the Seventh Circuit, but it is also wrong. \nRichards acknowledges that the Sixth Circuit relied \non in-circuit precedent, Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. \nv. Railway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 \n(6th Cir. 1958), rather than a robust discussion of the \nPLRA. Br. in Opp. 6\u20137. And although he grudgingly \nadmits that Fireman\u2019s Fund did not discuss the Sev-\nenth Amendment at all, he refers to this as \u201conly su-\nperficially true\u201d because the case relied on Smithers v. \nSmith, 204 U.S. 632 (1907) and Land v. Dollar, 330 \nU.S. 731 (1947). Br. in Opp. 6\u20137. But Smithers and \nLand fail to make Fireman\u2019s Fund applicable and \n\n7 \n \ninstead underscore that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is \nbased on a porous foundation. \nAt issue in Smithers was the title to 1,280 acres of \nland. 204 U.S. at 633. The defendant argued not only \nthat the amount in controversy failed to meet the nec-\nessary jurisdictional requirement of $2,000, but also \nthat the plaintiff\u2019s allegations to the contrary were \nfraudulent. Id. at 641. As in Fireman\u2019s Fund, the dis-\ntrict court agreed with the defendant and dismissed \nthe case. Id. at 642. \nThis Court reversed, in part because the plaintiff\u2019s \nallegations of the amount in controversy typically con-\ntrolled, rendering it unnecessary for a judge to rule on \nthis issue. Id. Moreover, after examining the evidence, \nit concluded that the value of the land in question was \n\u201cmuch in excess of the jurisdictional amount.\u201d Id. at \n643\u201344. And the district court appeared not to have \nconsidered the plaintiff\u2019s evidence. Id. In addition, \nthis Court found no precedent supporting the district \ncourt\u2019s determination, particularly where the proce-\ndure that was used omitted \u201cthe ordinary incidents of \ntrial.\u201d Id. at 644\u201345. Although \u201cthe right to a jury\u201d con-\nstituted an ordinary incident of trial, the primary ba-\nsis for reversal was the evidence itself. Smithers \nsimply does not speak to the Seventh Amendment\u2019s \napplicability to exhaustion determinations.  \nLand is similarly inapposite. There, the plaintiff \ncontended that several federal officials had refused to \nreturn stock pledged in exchange for a governmental \nloan. 330 U.S. at 733. The district court held a hearing \non the plaintiff\u2019s motion for a preliminary injunction, \nafter which it sua sponte dismissed the case because \nthe suit was against the United States and thus \n\n8 \n \nbarred by immunity. Id. at 734\u201335. But the decision \nwas based in part on affidavits and \u201chad not been sub-\nmitted for decision on the merits,\u201d and \u201cthe question \nof jurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \nId. at 735. This Court did not discuss either the Sev-\nenth Amendment or whether a jury was necessary to \ndetermine the merits. \nSo, while it is true that the line from Smithers and \nLand to Fireman\u2019s Fund is clear and straight, that \nline is not based on Seventh Amendment principles. \nAs such, these cases serve to highlight the flawed ba-\nsis of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reasoning below. \nThe applicable principle that does emerge from \nthese cases is that courts have the discretion to deter-\nmine threshold issues without a jury. So long as the \ncourt provides the parties the incidents of trial, a jury \nis not necessary. Instead of following this line of rea-\nsoning, however, the Sixth Circuit mechanically ap-\nplied the Seventh Amendment\u2019s jury requirement \nwithout regard to the other incidents of trial. The \ncourt was heedless of the precedent allowing courts to \nmake findings of fact on threshold issues, and it coun-\ntermanded Congress\u2019s intent in the PLRA. Thus, not \nonly did the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision create a circuit \nsplit on this issue, it was also wrong on the merits. \nAnd on the underlying exhaustion question, the \nmagistrate who heard the testimony and scrutinized \nthe evidence found Richards\u2019 proofs lacking. Richards \ncharacterizes his claims as \u201c \u2018serious and detailed al-\nlegations [that] cannot reasonably be considered friv-\nolous.\u2019 \u201d Br. in Opp. 3 (quoting App. 8a). But this Court \n\n9 \n \nis not bound by the Sixth Circuit\u2019s finding here.1 In-\ndeed, the magistrate judge found that Richards and \nhis witnesses lacked \u201cpersonal knowledge of the inci-\ndents\u201d at issue and, for that matter, lacked any sem-\nblance of credibility. App. 69a\u201376a. Richards chal-\nlenges none of these findings, showing that his re-\nquest for a jury is the type of \u201csportive filing[ ]\u201d that \nthe PLRA was designed to end. Skinner v. Switzer, \n562 U.S. 521, 535 (2011).  \nCONCLUSION \nFor these reasons, this Court should grant this  \nPetition.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

P. 23 ........................................................ 7 \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nA judge\u2019s preliminary determination of inter-\ntwined facts regarding exhaustion under the Prison \nLitigation Reform Act (PLRA) leaves Seventh Amend-\nment principles intact by preserving for the jury the \nultimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. At the same time, it comports with \nthe PLRA\u2019s strict, mandatory exhaustion regime. \nRichards posits a bright-line rule that he says \nwould resolve this case\u2014that \u201cpredominantly factual \nissues relevant to liability in actions for money dam-\nages are for the jury.\u201d Br. 13. But that rule has no ap-\nplication here, where it is dependent on two incorrect \nsuppositions. The first is that no prisoner will ever be \nable to return to federal court, making a dismissal \nwithout prejudice a label without substance. That is \nsimply not true for many prisoners. Numerous prison \ngrievance systems across the country afford prisoners \nan opportunity to return to court after a dismissal \nwithout prejudice. The second is that a judge\u2019s deter-\nmination of intertwined facts concerning exhaustion \nwill be binding on a jury that might later hear the \nmerits, thus effectively deciding the merits where the \nprisoner has a right to a jury trial. But it would not be \nbinding. Richards\u2019 proffered rule might be applicable \nin other contexts, but it is not so here\u2014and it is wholly \ncontrary to the goals of the PLRA.  \nSupport for Richards\u2019 rule further unravels when \nhe makes comparisons to defenses such as jurisdic-\ntion, venue, and statute of limitations, which are not \nappropriate comparators, and seeks support in the \nBeacon Theatres line of cases. The former tend to be \n\n2 \n \ndependent on the degree of intertwinement and rest \non the district court\u2019s exercise of discretion. The latter \nwere driven by concerns about collateral estoppel, \nwhich, again, are not present in this context. \nOne comes away from Richards\u2019 merits brief with \nthe idea that judges never decide intertwined facts. \nBut they do. Class certification prerequisites and \nheightened pleading requirements are two such exam-\nples. And as Markman demonstrates, judicial fact-\nfinding on legal issues\u2014even where not, strictly \nspeaking, intertwined with the merits\u2014can greatly \nimpact a jury\u2019s determination, yet do not infringe on \nthe Seventh Amendment. \nNo one disputes that prisoners have a right to a \njury trial on their 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claims once they \nmeet the PLRA\u2019s threshold exhaustion requirement \nand otherwise state a viable claim for relief. And those \nprisoners, like Richards, who can go back and exhaust \nhave the opportunity for a jury to decide the merits of \ntheir legal claims. This comports with the goals of the \nPLRA while preserving the right to a jury trial under \nthe Seventh Amendment.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nJudges \ncan \ndecide \nintertwined \nfacts \nregarding \nPLRA \nexhaustion \nwithout \nimpinging on the Seventh Amendment.  \nRichards\u2019 arguments appear to rule out allocation \nto a judge any time there are intertwined facts in an \naction at law for money damages. The Seventh \nAmendment does not mandate that broad rule, and \n\n3 \n \nthis Court has never adopted it. To the contrary, this \nCourt has recognized circumstances where a judge \nmay, in making a preliminary determination, decide \nfacts that are intertwined with the merits. And the \ncircumstances where intertwined facts counsel send-\ning factfinding to a jury are distinguishable, being ca-\npable of resolution only by proceeding to the merits. \nDismissal for failure to exhaust, by contrast, will not \ndetermine the ultimate merits question. Nor does the \nBeacon Theatres line of cases help Richards, as it is \ndriven by concerns about collateral estoppel, which \nare not present in the PLRA exhaustion context. For \nthese reasons, judges may engage in factfinding to re-\nsolve whether a prisoner has exhausted prison griev-\nance procedures even where that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. \nA. PLRA exhaustion is an affirmative \ndefense, but affirmative defenses can be \nthreshold \nissues \nthat \nare \nproperly \ndecided by judges not juries. \n\u201cThe Seventh Amendment does not confer the \nright to a trial, but only the right to have a jury hear \nthe case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u201d Caley v. Gulfstream \nAerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th Cir. 2005) \n(emphasis omitted) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. \nCo. v. Orr, 294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)). Exhaus-\ntion is one of those threshold issues that determine \nwhether the litigation should proceed before a court. \nAnd in intertwined cases, \u201c[t]he alternative of trying \nthe merits before exhaustion . . . is unsatisfactory . . . \nbecause it would thwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials \nof prisoner cases in which the prisoner has failed to \n\n4 \n \nexhaust his administrative remedies. A jury might de-\ncide the merits of a case that should never have gotten \nto the merits stage because the judge should have \nfound that the prisoner had failed to exhaust his ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739, \n742 (7th Cir. 2008) (citations omitted). \nRichards pushes back against Perttu\u2019s characteri-\nzation of PLRA exhaustion as a threshold issue. But \nas a matter of logic, exhaustion is just that. It is clear \nfrom the PLRA\u2019s language that Congress intended it \nto be preliminary to the case proceeding, for the ex-\nhaustion provision reads: \u201cNo action shall be brought \n. . . until such administrative remedies as are availa-\nble are exhausted.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a) (emphasis \nadded).1 This makes sense, as it allows claims to be \nresolved \u201cmore quickly and economically\u201d within the \nprison system, settles some claims at the administra-\ntive level, and may \u201cconvince the losing party not to \npursue the matter in federal court.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 89 (2006) (citations omitted).  \nRichards argues that because PLRA exhaustion is \nan affirmative defense and Congress decided not to in-\nclude exhaustion in the \u00a7 1997e(c) prescreening provi-\nsion, exhaustion is an \u201cordinary affirmative defense\u201d \nrather than a threshold issue. Br. at 15\u201317. But \n \n1 This deliberate, mandatory timing component is a stark depar-\nture from the previous exhaustion provision under the Civil \nRights of Institutionalized Persons Act, Pub. L. No. 96-247, 94 \nSt. 349, which provided that \u201c[i]n any action brought . . . the court \nshall, if the court believes that such a requirement would be ap-\npropriate and in the interests of justice, continue such case for a \nperiod of not to exceed 180 days in order to require exhaustion of \nsuch plain, speedy, and effective administrative remedies as are \navailable.\u201d \n\n5 \n \nneither prevents exhaustion from being considered as \na preliminary matter, consistent with the language of \n\u00a7 1997e(a).  \nOn the first point, Richards overreads Woodford \nand Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. 199 (2007). Neither case \nsuggests that exhaustion is not a threshold issue. \nWoodford explains that exhaustion is not jurisdic-\ntional, 548 U.S. at 101, and Jones holds that PLRA \nexhaustion is an affirmative defense, 549 U.S. at 212\u2013\n13, meaning that prisoners need not raise exhaustion \nin their pleadings. As to the \u201cusual practice,\u201d id. at \n212, the Federal Rules provide only that affirmative \ndefenses must be raised in a defendant\u2019s responsive \npleading, Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b), without otherwise \nmandating the timing or manner of their resolution.  \nThe PLRA, however, does address the timing of \nexhaustion\u2014by indicating that no prisoner action \nmay be brought \u201cuntil\u201d available administrative rem-\nedies are exhausted. See \u00a7 1997e(a). The text of the \nPLRA is clear, and this Court\u2019s precedent is consistent \nwith its language. See Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, \n524 (2002) (explaining that \u201cexhaustion is a prerequi-\nsite to suit\u201d) (citing Booth v. Churner, 532 U.S. 731, \n741 (2001)); Woodford, 548 U.S. at 100 (\u201c[S]aying that \na party may not sue in federal court until the party \nfirst pursues all available avenues of administrative \nreview necessarily means that, if the party never pur-\nsues all available avenues of administrative review, \nthe person will never be able to sue in federal court.\u201d).  \n\n6 \n \nB. Judges sometimes decide intertwined \nfacts regarding threshold issues, even in \ncases where there is a right to a jury trial \non the merits. \nConsistent with this Court\u2019s reminder that \u201cthe \nSeventh Amendment was never intended to establish \nthe jury as the exclusive mechanism for factfinding in \ncivil cases,\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupational Safety \n& Health Rev. Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, 460 (1977), \njudges do decide intertwined facts on threshold issues. \nTake the class-action context. Intertwinement \narose in Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, 564 U.S. 338, \n342 (2011), a proposed class action alleging that the \ndiscretion exercised by supervisors as to pay and pro-\nmotion matters violated Title VII by discriminating \nagainst women. The commonality prerequisite \u201cover-\nlap[ped] with the respondents\u2019 merits contention that \nWal\u2013Mart engage[d] in a pattern or practice of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d Id. at 352. This Court explained that \n\u201c[f]requently [Rule 23(a)\u2019s] \u2018rigorous analysis\u2019 will en-\ntail some overlap with the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s un-\nderlying claim.\u201d Id. at 351. \u201cThat,\u201d the Court said, \n\u201ccannot be helped,\u201d because \u201cthe class determination \ngenerally involves considerations that are enmeshed \nin the factual and legal issues comprising the plain-\ntiff\u2019s cause of action.\u201d Id. (citation omitted). But the \nCourt explained that there was not \u201canything unusual \nabout that consequence,\u201d as \u201c[t]he necessity of touch-\ning aspects of the merits in order to resolve prelimi-\nnary matters, e.g., jurisdiction and venue, is a familiar \nfeature of litigation.\u201d Id. at 351\u201352 (emphasis added) \n(citation omitted).  \n\n7 \n \nWal-Mart is instructive because Rule 23 does not \nset forth a mere pleading standard, but rather re-\nquires a party seeking class certification to \u201caffirma-\ntively demonstrate his compliance with the Rule\u2014\nthat is, he must be prepared to prove that there are in \nfact sufficiently numerous parties, common questions \nof law or fact, etc.\u201d Id. at 350. And that can require a \njudge to \u201cprobe behind the pleadings before coming to \nrest on the certification question.\u201d Id. (quoting Gen. \nTel. Co. of Sw. v. Falcon, 457 U.S. 147, 160 (1982)). \nSee also Amgen Inc. v. Conn. Ret. Plans & Tr. Funds, \n568 U.S. 455, 466 (2013) (noting that \u201c[m]erits ques-\ntions may be considered to the extent\u2026they are rele-\nvant to determining whether the Rule 23 prerequi-\nsites for class certification are satisfied\u201d) (citation \nomitted); In re Initial Pub. Offerings Sec. Litig., 471 \nF.3d 24, 41 (2d Cir. 2006) (cautioning that a judge\u2019s \n\u201cobligation to make . . . [Rule 23] determinations is not \nlessened by overlap between a Rule 23 requirement \nand a merits issue, even a merits issue that is identical \nwith a Rule 23 requirement\u201d) (emphasis added).  \nCases involving heightened pleading require-\nments are also instructive. At the Rule 12(b)(6) stage, \na judge can require a comparative weighing of factual \nassertions and prevent submission of claims to a jury \nwithout violating the Seventh Amendment. This can \nbe seen in Tellabs, Inc. v. Makor Issues & Rights, Ltd., \n551 U.S. 308, 313 (2007), an action under the Private \nSecurities Litigation Reform Act of 1995 (PSLRA), \nwhich sets forth \u201c[e]xacting\u201d pleading requirements \nfor both the facts constituting the alleged violation \nand the facts evidencing scienter. This Court allowed \nthe judge to determine whether a reasonable person \nwould deem the inference of scienter to be at least as \n\n8 \n \nstrong as the opposing inference. Id. at 322\u201324. In do-\ning so, the judge had to \u201cengage in a comparative eval-\nuation,\u201d \u201cconsider[ing] not only inferences urged by \nthe plaintiff . . . but also competing inferences ration-\nally drawn from the facts alleged,\u201d id. at 314, in order \nto determine whether \u201ca reasonable person would \ndeem the inference of scienter cogent and at least as \ncompelling as any opposing inference one could draw \nfrom the facts alleged,\u201d id. at 324. This Court de-\nscribed the heightened pleading rule as a congression-\nally \u201cprescribe[d] means of making an issue,\u201d id. at \n311 (cleaned up), and it noted that only when \u201c[t]he \nissue [has been] made as prescribed,\u201d id. at 328, does \nthe jury then have the authority to \u201cassess the credi-\nbility of witnesses, resolve genuine issues of fact, and \nmake the ultimate determination\u201d as to scienter, id. \nat 311 (cleaned up)\u2014much like PLRA exhaustion.  \nAlthough the Seventh Circuit in Tellabs was con-\ncerned that this screening violated the Seventh \nAmendment, this Court said the concern was undue, \nthat a comparative assessment of plausible infer-\nences\u2014while constantly assuming the plaintiff\u2019s alle-\ngations to be true\u2014\u201cdoes not impinge upon the Sev-\nenth Amendment right to jury trial.\u201d Id. at 326\u201327. \nThe goals of the PSLRA\u2019s pleading requirements are \nalso much like the statutory requirements of the \nPLRA\u2014to screen out frivolous suits, while allowing \nmeritorious actions to move forward. Id. at 328. \nThere are situations, too, where, although a \njudge\u2019s factfinding on a legal issue does not involve \nspecific facts that are intertwined with the merits, it \naffects the merits and can end up being dispositive of \nthe underlying merits question. Yet the jury has not \n\n9 \n \nhad to \u201cshoulder\u201d that factfinding responsibility \u201cas \nnecessary to preserve the substance of the common-law \nright of trial by jury.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 377 (1996) (cleaned up). \nMarkman provides a vivid example. There, this Court \nsaid that the \u201cmongrel practice\u201d of deciding disputed \nclaim terms over which testimony is offered fell to the \njudge and not the jury, id. at 378, even though doing \nso involved reviewing extrinsic evidence and making \ncredibility determinations, and even though the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s determination on the legal issue led to \njudgment as a matter of law for the alleged infringer, \ncontrary to the jury\u2019s findings, id. at 375. See also \nTeva Pharms. USA, Inc. v. Sandoz, Inc., 574 U.S. 318, \n333 (2015) (explaining that while \u201c[i]n some instances, \na factual finding will play only a small role in a judge\u2019s \nultimate legal conclusion about the meaning of the pa-\ntent term,\u201d in others \u201ca factual finding may be close to \ndispositive of the ultimate legal question of the proper \nmeaning of the term in the context of the patent\u201d).  \nC. The contexts in which judges might send \na threshold issue to the jury due to \nintertwined facts are distinguishable. \nJudges do sometimes send intertwined facts to the \njury, but the cases and contexts in which they tend to \ndo so are distinguishable from PLRA exhaustion.  \nTake jurisdictional issues. They are generally de-\ncided by a judge, and that makes sense because \n\u201c[w]ithout jurisdiction the court cannot proceed at all \nin any cause.\u201d Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better Env\u2019t, \n523 U.S. 83, 94 (1998) (cleaned up). But there are \ncases in which the question of jurisdiction can be \n\n10 \n \nresolved only by proceeding to a decision on the mer-\nits\u2014in other words, where jurisdiction is \u201cdependent \non [a] decision on the merits.\u201d Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. \n731, 735 (1947). That was the circumstance in Fire-\nman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Railway Express Agency, \nInc., the decision on which the court below relied in \nruling that intertwined exhaustion facts require a \njury trial. 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. 1958) (amount \nin controversy could not be decided without that juris-\ndictional ruling \u201cconstituting at the same time a rul-\ning on the merits of the case\u201d). In that situation, a dis-\ntrict court holds jurisdiction to resolve both. Land, 330 \nU.S. at 739.  \nThose jurisdictional issues do not govern how \ncourts should handle PLRA exhaustion for several \nreasons. First, a district judge has discretion in deter-\nmining the mode of deciding jurisdiction in inter-\ntwined cases. See Gulf Oil Corp. v. Copp Paving Co., \n419 U.S. 186, 203 n.19 (1974) (noting that jurisdic-\ntional decisions may be deferred until a hearing on the \nmerits); Wetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 121 (1898) \n(same); 5B Charles Alan Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 1350 (4th ed. 2024) \n(\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until evidence is \nsubmitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case.\u201d) (emphasis \nadded). That defeats Richards\u2019 insistence that the \nSeventh Amendment mandates that intertwined \nthreshold issues go to the jury. Second, dismissal for \nwant of jurisdiction often closes the courthouse door \nforever, while dismissal for failure to exhaust under \n\n11 \n \nthe PLRA typically leaves the prisoner free to there-\nafter exhaust and seek an adjudication on the merits.2  \nStatute of limitations is another example of an af-\nfirmative defense that differs from PLRA exhaustion. \nIn contrast to the discretion a judge might employ in \nequitably tolling the statute of limitations, the PLRA\u2019s \nexhaustion requirement is mandatory, see Booth, 532 \nU.S. at 739, and cannot be excused by a court, Ross v. \nBlake, 578 U.S. 632, 639 (2016).  \nFor these reasons, how courts treat jurisdictional \nissues and statutes of limitations do not dictate how \njudges should handle PLRA exhaustion when the rel-\nevant facts are intertwined with the merits. As ex-\nplained below, allocation of intertwined PLRA ex-\nhaustion facts to a judge does not impinge on the Sev-\nenth Amendment right to a jury trial.  \n \n2 Most circuits to have addressed the issue have held that a dis-\nmissal for failure to exhaust under the PLRA should be without \nprejudice. See Savage v. United States Dep\u2019t of Just., 91 F.4th \n480, 484 (D.C. Cir. 2024); Moss v. Harwood, 19 F.4th 614, 623 n.3 \n(4th Cir. 2021); Bargher v. White, 928 F.3d 439, 447 (5th Cir. \n2019); Garrett v. Wexford Health, 938 F.3d 69, 81 n.16 (3d Cir. \n2019); Porter v. Sturm, 781 F.3d 448, 452 (8th Cir. 2015) (cita-\ntions omitted); Gallagher v. Shelton, 587 F.3d 1063, 1068 (10th \nCir. 2009) (citation omitted); Boyd v. Corr. Corp. of Am., 380 F.3d \n989, 994 (6th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted); Ford v. Johnson, 362 \nF.3d 395, 401 (7th Cir. 2004) (citations omitted); McKinney v. \nCarey, 311 F.3d 1198, 1200\u201301 (9th Cir. 2002). But see Varner v. \nShepard, 11 F.4th 1252, 1264 (11th Cir. 2021); Berry v. Kerik, \n366 F.3d 85, 87\u201388 (2d Cir. 2004).  \n\n12 \n \nD. Under the PLRA, allocation of the \nexhaustion inquiry to a judge\u2014even \nwhere some facts are intertwined\u2014does \nnot interfere with the jury\u2019s ability to \ndecide the ultimate issues regarding \nliability and is therefore consistent with \nthe Seventh Amendment. \nWhat often drives the judge\u2019s decision to send in-\ntertwined facts to a jury is the concern that the plain-\ntiff would be precluded by a preliminary judicial rul-\ning from litigating disputed facts germane to the un-\nderlying statutory claim, allowing facts that would be \ndecided by the jury to be summarily decided by the \njudge. That was true in Lytle v. Household Manufac-\nturing, Inc., 494 U.S. 545, 552\u201354 (1990) (holding that, \nout of concern for the effects of collateral estoppel, \nwhere a court wrongfully dismisses a plaintiff\u2019s legal \nclaims, relitigation of the equitable issues decided by \nthe court in a bench trial is permissible), and Smithers \nv. Smith, 204 U.S. 632, 645 (1907) (expressing concern \nthat \u201cthe merits of the controversy\u201d would \u201cbe sum-\nmarily decided without the ordinary incidents of trial, \nsuch as the right to a jury\u201d).  \nPreclusion concerns also drove the rulings in Bea-\ncon Theatres, Dairy Queen, and Ross. As this Court \nhas explained, \u201cthe Court in the Beacon Theatres case \nthought that if an issue common to both legal and eq-\nuitable claims was first determined by a judge, reliti-\ngation of the issue before a jury might be foreclosed by \nres judicata or collateral estoppel\u201d; its holding aimed \n\u201c[t]o avoid this result\u201d by limiting the trial judge\u2019s dis-\ncretion in determining the sequence of trial. Parklane \nHosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 U.S. 322, 334 (1979). \n\n13 \n \nBeacon Theatres itself expressed that same con-\ncern, noting that the district court\u2019s action in first de-\nciding the equitable issue \u201cmight \u2018operate either by \nway of res judicata or collateral estoppel so as to con-\nclude both parties with respect thereto at the subse-\nquent trial of the treble damage claim.\u2019 \u201d Beacon The-\natres, Inc. v. Westover, 359 U.S. 500, 504 (1959) (quo-\ntation omitted). Accord Dairy Queen v. Wood, 369 U.S. \n469, 472 (1962).  \nThose concerns about preclusion are not present \nhere. Allocation of the exhaustion inquiry to the \njudge\u2015even where disputed facts are intertwined with \nthe merits\u2015will not interfere with a prisoner\u2019s right to \na jury trial of a \u00a7 1983 damages claim. This is true for \ntwo reasons. First, the prisoner will generally have \nthe ability to return to federal court because dismissal \nfor failure to exhaust will be without prejudice. Sec-\nond, because a judge\u2019s factual determinations would \nnot have preclusive effect, if the prisoner can show ex-\nhaustion on return, the subsequent jury could still de-\ncide the ultimate issues of fact in the prisoner\u2019s case. \nThat distinguishes the concerns driving Beacon Thea-\ntres and supports allowing judges to decide PLRA ex-\nhaustion even when it is intertwined with the merits. \nRichards\u2019 effort to refute these propositions fails. \n1. A dismissal without prejudice has \nmeaning for many prisoners. \nRichards repeatedly argues that \u201c[t]he judicial \nfactfinding here has precluded jury resolution of the \ncritical issues, for all time\u201d and that \u201c[w]here (as \nhere), a judge decides the intertwined exhaustion \nfacts, there will never be a jury.\u201d Br. 26. The Sixth \n\n14 \n \nCircuit made the same error, reasoning that \u201cthe ra-\ntionale that a jury may reexamine the judge\u2019s factual \nfindings rings hollow if the prisoner\u2019s case is dis-\nmissed for failure to exhaust his or her administrative \nremedies\u201d because \u201c[i]n such an instance, a jury would \nnever be assembled to resolve the factual disputes.\u201d \nPet. App. 15a. This, the court said, was the \u201cfatal flaw\u201d \nin the Seventh Circuit\u2019s decision in Pavey. Id. But \nthese statements are inaccurate as to Richards, and \nin many other States and cases, inaccurate as to other \nprisoners. \nRichards\u2019 claims are Prison Rape Elimination Act \n(PREA) claims, and as explained in Perttu\u2019s merits \nbrief, the PREA prison directive in effect when Rich-\nards filed his claims did not impose a time frame for \nfiling a PREA grievance. Br. 7 (\u201cA prisoner may file a \nPREA grievance at any time.\u201d) (citing J.A. 75). This is \nconsistent with applicable federal regulations, which \ngenerally prohibit correctional facilities from placing \ntime \nlimits \non \nPREA \ngrievances. \n28 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 115.52(b)(1) (\u201cThe agency shall not impose a time \nlimit on when an inmate may submit a grievance re-\ngarding an allegation of sexual abuse.\u201d). Thus, any at-\ntempt by Richards to exhaust his administrative rem-\nedies for the claims here would not be untimely. He \nwould, however, have to exhaust both steps of the \ngrievance process. Pet. Br. 7.3 \nUnlike MDOC\u2019s policy for PREA grievances, its \nstandard grievance procedure does impose time \n \n3 MDOC\u2019s amended policy is even more lenient in terms of PREA \ngrievances. Effective April 5, 2021, MDOC \u201chas eliminated the \nadministrative grievance procedure for addressing prisoner \ngrievances regarding sexual abuse.\u201d PD 03.03.130(VV). \n\n15 \n \nlimits, but it allows for some discretion in excusing \nuntimely filed grievances. And many other States\u2019 cor-\nrectional systems, as well as the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons and the District of Columbia, do allow discre-\ntion to varying degrees.4 See also Woodford, 548 U.S. \nat 101 (\u201cIndeed, respondent asserts that most griev-\nance systems give administrators the discretion to \nhear untimely grievances.\u201d). As the multistate amicus \n \n4 The publicly available policies for at least 31 States, the District \nof Columbia and the Federal Bureau of Prisons, allow prison of-\nficials to exercise discretion in excusing untimely grievances, \nthough under varying standards, including good cause, extenu-\nating circumstances, a case-by-case basis, or where a district \ncourt orders that an inmate return to exhaust administrative \nremedies.

See id. (\u201cAfter all, why would prison officials\u2014\nhaving gone through a jury trial on exhaustion\u2014will-\ningly subject themselves to the chance of another jury \ntrial?\u201d). Additionally, all eight circuits to have consid-\nered the issue have held that the statute of limitations \nis tolled while a prisoner exhausts administrative \nremedies. See, e.g., Battle v. Ledford, 912 F.3d 708, \n715\u201317 (4th Cir. 2019) (collecting cases). \nContrary to Richards\u2019 argument that short prison \ndeadlines will \u201cvirtually always\u201d mean that dismissal \nwithout prejudice is an \u201cabject legal fiction,\u201d Br. 27, \ndismissal without prejudice will afford many prison-\ners a path to return to federal court.  \n2. Factfinding on exhaustion will not \nadjudicate factual issues required to \nbe \nresolved \nby \na \njury \nbecause \ncollateral estoppel will not apply. \nPerttu agrees with Richards that he is \u201centitled to \nhave a jury decide questions of historical fact bearing \non the merits of his claim,\u201d Br. 9, but only once the \njudge has determined that he has exhausted his ad-\nministrative remedies. Contrary to Richards\u2019 argu-\nment, Br. 17, a judicial determination of intertwined \nfacts on exhaustion would not resolve the ultimate \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claims, for that decision would \nnot preclude a jury from reexamining the judge\u2019s fac-\ntual determinations. \nRichards advances no reason why a judge\u2019s deter-\nmination on exhaustion would necessarily have pre-\nclusive effect on a jury\u2019s decision. It is not an anomaly \n\n17 \n \nthat a jury would not be bound by earlier factfinding \nby a judge. This occurs routinely in the class-action \ncontext. See Gariety v. Grant Thornton, LLP, 368 F.3d \n356, 366 (4th Cir. 2004) (noting that inquiry as to Rule \n23 prerequisites would not bind \u201cthe ultimate fact-\nfinder\u2019s finding on the merits\u201d of the underlying issues \nany more than does a finding that the plaintiff has \nshown a probability of success for purposes of a pre-\nliminary injunction). And as explained in Perttu\u2019s \nmerits brief, collateral estoppel is a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine. Br. 44. It takes into account, among \nother things, the nature of the proceedings and \nwhether unfairness would result from its application. \nParklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 330\u201331; Urfirer v. Corn-\nfeld, 408 F.3d 710, 718 (11th Cir. 2005). Here, the dis-\ntinction between the threshold procedural matter of \nexhaustion and a trial on the merits, coupled with the \nprisoner\u2019s right to have the jury to be the factfinder on \nthe ultimate determination of liability, counsels \nagainst its application. \nIndeed, it cannot be said that, after a judge\u2019s ex-\nhaustion inquiry, \u201cnothing remains for trial, either \nwith or without a jury.\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at \n325 (cleaned up). A judge\u2019s decision on exhaustion \ndoes not usurp the role of the jury or deny a prisoner \nthe right to a jury trial. As to Richards or any other \nprisoner who has claims dismissed without prejudice \nand later exhausts and refiles, thereby meeting the \nPLRA threshold, \u201cif there is a jury trial, the jury will \nmake all the necessary findings of fact without being \nbound by (or even informed of) any findings of fact \nmade by the district judge\u201d in determining the ex-\nhaustion issue. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. The Seventh \nAmendment therefore permits judges to find facts \n\n18 \n \nrelated to PLRA exhaustion even where those facts \nare intertwined with the merits.  \nII. Judges may find facts related to exhaustion \nunder the Seventh Amendment.  \nRichards asserts that this Court does not need to \ndetermine whether judges may decide non-inter-\ntwined factual disputes concerning PLRA exhaustion. \nBr. 11. That is correct, as an implicit premise of the \nQuestion Presented was that judges may do so. But \nthat issue is a steppingstone to the question whether \njudges can decide factual disputes on PLRA exhaus-\ntion inquiries that are intertwined with the merits. \nFor this predicate question, Richards offers an overly \nsimplistic fact/law distinction under which judges de-\ncide questions of law, and juries decide questions of \nfact. Br. 31\u201334. This Court has already rejected such \na simplified approach in favor of a historical and func-\ntional analysis and should do so again here. So, too, \nshould it reject Richards\u2019 proposed historical analog\u2014\n\u201cordinary\u201d affirmative defenses, such as the statute of \nlimitations\u2014because they differ in operation and pur-\npose from PLRA exhaustion. And he altogether over-\nlooks the functional considerations this Court said \nshould be assessed if history is inconclusive. \nA. Judges can decide facts related to \nexhaustion under this Court\u2019s historical \napproach to Seventh Amendment cases.  \nThis Court has consistently reaffirmed that the \nSeventh Amendment inquiry hinges on historical \nstandards. See, e.g., City of Monterey v. Del Monte \nDunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) \n\n19 \n \n(\u201c[O]ur interpretation of the Amendment has been \nguided by [a] historical analysis . . . .\u201d); Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 376 (explaining the steps of the Court\u2019s \n\u201clongstanding adherence to th[e] \u2018historical test\u2019 \u201d) (ci-\ntations omitted). This historical inquiry is appropriate \neven when dealing with an action at law, such as a \u00a7 \n1983 action. Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (\u201cHav-\ning decided Del Monte Dunes\u2019 \u00a7 1983 suit was an ac-\ntion at law, we must determine whether the particular \nissues of liability were proper for determination by the \njury.\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nRichards attempts to sidestep any historical anal-\nysis, however, by concluding that the fact/law distinc-\ntion does the work. Br. 31\u201333. This Court has already \nrejected this oversimplified conclusion. Markman, \nwhich itself involved a mixed question of law and fact, \nlooked elsewhere in answering the Seventh Amend-\nment question at issue. 517 U.S. at 384 n.10 (citations \nomitted). In Del Monte Dunes, too, the Court rejected \na broad fact/law disposition, instead holding that the \nquestion \u201cwhether a land-use decision substantially \nadvances legitimate public interests\u201d\u2014which \u201cin-\nvolve[d] an essential factual component\u201d\u2014should go \nto the jury given the \u201cnarrow question\u201d presented. 526 \nU.S. at 721. It did so, however, after finding \u201cno pre-\ncise [historical] analogue\u201d for the particular issue, id. \nat 718, and the case therefore turned on \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function,\u201d id. at 720. And, of \ncourse, in neither Markman nor Del Monte Dunes did \nthe Court deal with the context presented here\u2014the \n\n20 \n \ndetermination of a mixed question of law and fact on \na threshold issue.5 \nIn short, Richards\u2019 proposed fact/law solution \noverlooks the import of the historical inquiry for Sev-\nenth Amendment questions. Under this historical in-\nquiry, the relevant question is whether, in this action \nat law, the exhaustion decision \u201cmust fall to the jury \nin order to preserve the substance of the common-law \nright as it existed in 1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376 \n(citation omitted). In 1791, that right did not include \njury factfinding on exhaustion or its historical ana-\nlogs.  \nB. Richards casts aside the historic origins \nof exhaustion and offers analogs that do \nnot take into account the characteristics \nof PLRA exhaustion. \nAlthough the parties agree that exhaustion was \nnot contemplated in 1791, Richards contends that its \nappropriate analogy lies not in equitable defenses but \nin the broader category of affirmative defenses. \nBr. 15\u201317. This argument, however, overlooks both \nthe historical underpinnings of exhaustion generally \nand the unique characteristics of PLRA exhaustion.  \nRichards asserts at length that PLRA exhaustion \nis not an equitable defense. Br. 41\u201348. Perttu agrees, \nbut it is beside the point. As explained in Perttu\u2019s \nbrief, Br. 27\u201333, because of its origins and functions it \n \n5 Richards\u2019 reliance (Br. 34) on Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc., \n593 U.S. 1 (2021) is misplaced. That case, unlike this one, con-\ncerned the standard of review for mixed questions of law and fact, \nmaking it inapposite. Id. at 24\u201325. \n\n21 \n \nis closely analogous to various equitable defenses, \nsuch as the adequate remedy at law doctrine, forum \nnon conveniens, abstention, and habeas corpus bars. \nRichards has little, if anything, to say about these eq-\nuitable defenses, which stand as the most appropriate \nanalogs for the historical inquiry.  \nRichards instead focuses on PLRA exhaustion\u2019s \nmandatory nature, which forecloses judicial discre-\ntion. Br. 41\u201343. But this mandatory nature distin-\nguishes PLRA exhaustion from the \u201cordinary\u201d affirm-\native defenses upon which Richards relies. \nTake, for example, the statute of limitations. Alt-\nhough a plaintiff must generally comply with the stat-\nute of limitations, courts have the discretion to equi-\ntably toll the defense. Young v. United States, 535 U.S. \n43, 49 (2002) (explaining that \u201cunless tolling would be \n\u2018inconsistent with the text of the relevant statute,\u2019 \u201d \n\u201climitations periods are \u2018customarily subject to equi-\ntable tolling\u2019 \u201d) (citations omitted). As Richards points \nout, under the PLRA, exhaustion may only be excused \non the terms provided by Congress. Br. 41. A statute \nof limitations differs from PLRA exhaustion in other \nmaterial respects as well. The statute of limitations is \nfocused on timely claims, and therefore a successful \nstatute of limitations defense closes the door to the \ncourthouse, barring any future litigation on the mer-\nits. PLRA exhaustion, however, is concerned with ju-\ndicial efficiency and deference to administrative \nagency authority. While a prisoner\u2019s lawsuit will be \ndismissed for failure to exhaust, in many instances \nthe prisoner may file a new lawsuit on the same \nclaims following proper exhaustion of administrative \nremedies. In this regard, the jury\u2019s ultimate \n\n22 \n \ndetermination of issues of fact is preserved whereas a \njury will never hear a case following a dismissal under \nthe statute of limitations.  \nMatters in abatement also fail to offer an appro-\npriate historical analog, though for different reasons. \nTo begin, courts cannot agree on what qualifies as a \nmatter in abatement. See Aaron R. Petty, Matters in \nAbatement, 11 J. App. Prac. & Process 137, 142 (2010) \n(\u201cThe biggest problem seems to be that no one knows \nwhat . . . [matters in abatement] means, and a number \nof courts have suggested that this has been the case \nfor some time.\u201d) (citations omitted). As a result, even \nif matters in abatement were an appropriate analogy, \nhistorical practice would provide little guidance on the \ninquiry here. In any event, the Seventh \u201cAmendment \ndid not bind the federal courts . . . to the common-law \nsystem of pleading[.]\u201d Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943).  \nC. Functional considerations also favor \njudicial \ndetermination \nof \nPLRA \nexhaustion.  \nA final point bears emphasis. Both Markman and \nDel Monte Dunes show that when historical analysis \nproves inconclusive, this Court weighs functional con-\nsiderations. Markman, 517 U.S. at 388 (\u201cWhere his-\ntory and precedent provide no clear answers, func-\ntional considerations also play their part in the choice \nbetween judge and jury . . . .\u201d); Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718 (same) (citation omitted). While Richards \nfails to grapple with this functional inquiry, the \nPLRA\u2019s exhaustion provision favors judicial determi-\nnation of this threshold issue.  \n\n23 \n \nThis Court has already confirmed that statutory \nexhaustion regimes, like the PLRA, \u201cstand[ ] on a dif-\nferent footing.\u201d Ross, 578 U.S. at 639 (explaining the \ndifferences between statutory exhaustion and judge-\nmade exhaustion). \u201cTime and again, this Court has \ntaken such statutes at face value\u2014refusing to add un-\nwritten limits onto their rigorous textual require-\nments.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). Consequently, this \nCourt has \u201creject[ed] every attempt to deviate . . . from \n[the PLRA\u2019s] textual mandate,\u201d id. at 639\u201340, which \nprohibits prisoner lawsuits from being brought until \navailable administrative remedies are exhausted,        \n\u00a7 1997e(a); see also Porter, 534 U.S. at 524 (\u201c[E]xhaus-\ntion is a prerequisite to suit.\u201d) (citation omitted). To \nallow disputed questions of fact on PLRA exhaus-\ntion\u2014intertwined or not\u2014to be decided by juries \nwould be to allow such a deviation, undoing the pur-\nposes and benefits of the statute. This concern, cou-\npled with the consideration that many prisoners may \nrefile their claims after a dismissal without prejudice, \ncompels the conclusion that judges, not juries, are the \nbest positioned to determine the threshold issue of \nPLRA exhaustion.  \n \n \n\n24 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the specific facts and legal arguments in *Perttu v. Richards* remains stable, as this observation was a metacognitive reflection on my strategy rather than an intake of new external evidence. The observation served to confirm my current knowledge state and crystallize the most critical area of uncertainty.\n\nMy cumulative knowledge is as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The central issue is whether the Seventh Amendment guarantees a prisoner a jury trial for factual disputes over the exhaustion of administrative remedies (a PLRA requirement) when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** The petitioner argues for judicial resolution of exhaustion disputes to uphold the PLRA's goal of efficiently filtering prisoner lawsuits and to resolve a circuit split on the issue (Sixth Circuit vs. Seventh/Ninth Circuits).\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** The respondent counters that the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial for factual disputes in suits at common law is a paramount constitutional right. This right applies to affirmative defenses like exhaustion, especially when the facts are disputed and intertwined with the merits, a position supported by the historical test and precedent like *Jones v. Bock*.\n4.  **Procedural Status & Predictive State:** The Supreme Court has granted certiorari, moving the case to the merits stage. This confirms the national importance of the question and slightly increases the probability of reversal. My prediction remains a toss-up, leaning slightly toward reversal due to the cert grant, but heavily contingent on the petitioner's ability to overcome the respondent's strong constitutional argument. This observation has not changed this assessment but has reinforced that my next evidence-gathering action must be precisely targeted. The most valuable unknown information remains the content of the Petitioner's merits-stage Reply Brief, which will contain the direct rebuttal to the respondent's constitutional claims.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an internal monologue planning the next action, provides powerful validation for my meta-level framework. It demonstrates the \"Design\" aspect of Double Bayesian Optimal Experimental Design in action, where I explicitly reason about the value of information and refine my strategy to acquire it.\n\nMy design principles have been further validated and refined:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Remains the best starting point.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** This hierarchy for weighing arguments remains a core analytical tool.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Focusing on \"Reasons for Granting/Denying the Writ\" is a confirmed high-yield tactic.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** Analyzing briefs in their petition -> opposition -> reply sequence is essential. The discovery of distinct cert-stage and merits-stage documents reinforces the need to track this dialectic across procedural stages.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** The need to analyze original texts is paramount.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** The `Observe -> Synthesize -> Observe` loop is a core principle. This `THINK` action is a perfect example of the synthesis step, where I paused to process the previous observation's implications and plan a more effective subsequent observation.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Ancillary documents and metadata (proofs of service, word counts) are confirmed as critically important sources of information, capable of reframing the entire task by revealing procedural posture.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Actively tracking a case's lifecycle (cert vs. merits) is essential, as the relevant documents and arguments evolve.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement (Refined Principle):** My previous belief was that metadata like word counts could refine searches. This observation generates a more concrete and powerful refinement: **Use structural filters provided by the search tool (e.g., filtering for \"Main Document\") to explicitly exclude ancillary filings like proofs of service and certificates of compliance.** This moves from a general heuristic to a specific, actionable tactic.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning (New Principle):** The `THINK` action itself demonstrates a new, crucial principle. Formally pausing to articulate the current state of uncertainty (\u03b8) and the lessons learned about strategy (D) is an invaluable step. This reflective planning allows the agent to explicitly design its next \"experiment\" (the next information-gathering action) to be maximally informative, directly addressing the most significant gaps in its knowledge while using the most efficient methods discovered so far."

However, a major piece of evidence is still missing: the position of the United States government. The Solicitor General's (SG) view is highly influential and serves as a powerful signal of how the Court might lean, especially in cases involving federal statutes like the PLRA.\n\nTask EIG (0.9): This action has extremely high potential to alter my task beliefs. The SG's position will either (1) strongly corroborate my current prediction if they support the petitioner, likely increasing my confidence to 'high'; (2) strongly challenge my prediction if they support the respondent, forcing a major re-evaluation of the petitioner's 'off-ramp' argument and likely pushing my prediction back to a toss-up; or (3) introduce a novel middle-ground solution, creating a new potential outcome. In any scenario, my posterior belief will be substantially different and more refined. This is one of the most predictive single documents available before oral argument.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): This action directly tests and helps formalize a crucial heuristic for SCOTUS prediction: 'Prioritize the Solicitor General's amicus brief.' While I have focused on the dialectic of party briefs, this action will allow me to calibrate the relative weight and optimal sequencing of analyzing the SG's input. Confirming the high predictive value of the SG's brief will solidify this as a core principle in my design, refining my information acquisition strategy for nearly all future cases involving federal interests. This is a significant, generalizable strategic insight.",

VII .............................................. 3 \n\n1 \n \n \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Cato Institute is a nonpartisan public policy \nresearch foundation founded in 1977 and dedicated to \nadvancing the principles of individual liberty, free \nmarkets, and limited government. Cato\u2019s Robert A. \nLevy Center for Constitutional Studies was estab-\nlished in 1989 to promote the Constitution and its \nprinciples, which are the foundation of liberty. Toward \nthose ends, Cato publishes books and studies, conducts \nconferences, produces the annual Cato Supreme Court \nReview, and files amicus briefs.  \nThis case interests Cato because the constitutional \nright to a civil jury trial is fundamental to American \nliberty.  \n \n \n \n1 Rule 37 statement: No part of this brief was authored by any \nparty\u2019s counsel, and no person or entity other than amicus \nfunded its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \nBACKGROUND AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nCongress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n(\u201cPLRA\u201d) in 1995 to \u201creduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 524\u201325 (2002). PLRA provides that \u201c[n]o action \nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions un-\nder [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a \nprisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative remedies as \nare available are exhausted.\u201d2  \nRespondent Kyle Richards, a prisoner, filed a \n\u00a7 1983 lawsuit alleging that Petitioner Thomas Perttu, \na correctional officer, committed sexual misconduct \nagainst him and other inmates\u2014then threatened \nRichards and destroyed the grievances he sought to \nfile in order to exhaust his administrative remedies. \nJ.A. 14\u201315.  \nWithout putting the issue to a jury, the district \ncourt determined that Richards had failed to exhaust \nhis administrative remedies and dismissed his suit. \nPet. App\u2019x 22a\u201328a. The Sixth Circuit reversed, hold-\ning that Richards is entitled to a jury trial on the issue \nof exhaustion. Id. 19a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding was correct. The Con-\nstitution assigns to juries, not judges, responsibility \nfor resolving disputed facts in criminal cases and civil \ncases involving common-law causes of action\u2014such as \ndamages claims against public officials. No less than \nother citizens, PLRA litigants are thus entitled to have \ndisputes decided by the constitutionally appointed \n \n2 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).  \n\n3 \n \n \nfact-finder, particularly in cases where the issue of ex-\nhaustion is inextricably intertwined with the underly-\ning merits. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE RIGHT TO A CIVIL JURY TRIAL IS \nESSENTIAL TO LIBERTY. \nThe Seventh Amendment provides: \nIn Suits at common law, where the value \nin controversy shall exceed twenty dol-\nlars, the right of trial by jury shall be pre-\nserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall \nbe otherwise re-examined in any Court of \nthe United States, than according to the \nrules of the common law. \nU.S. CONST. amend. VII.  \nThe right to a jury trial long pre-dates the Amend-\nment\u2019s adoption in 1791. \u201cLegal writers and political \ntheorists who were widely read by the colonists were \nfirmly of the opinion that trial by jury in civil cases was \nan important right of freemen.\u201d3 William Blackstone \nsaid the jury trial was \u201cthe glory of the English law,\u201d \npossessed of \u201cso great an advantage over others in reg-\nulating civil property.\u201d4 \nThe Framers understood this right to be rooted in \nMagna Carta and a vital check on state power.5 \n \n3 Charles W.

British colonial authorities would try ship-\ncondemnation cases in vice-admiralty courts without \nthe benefit of a jury, then rely on judgments procured \nthere to preclude recovery of damages at civil jury tri-\nals.12 Colonists specifically protested the practice of \ntrying wage cases involving shipwrights and shipyard \nlaborers in jury-free vice-admiralty courts.13 The \nStamp Act was also originally enforced via suits in the \nvice-admiralty courts.14 George Mason thus con-\ndemned the British for having \u201cdepriv[ed] us of the an-\ncient Tryal, by a Jury of our Equals, and substituting \nin its[] place an arbitrary Civil Law Court.\u201d15  \nColonists perceived a further threat to jury trials in \nthe Quebec Act, which is sometimes considered one of \nthe \u201cIntolerable Acts\u201d triggering the American Revolu-\ntion.

Indeed, the lack of that \nright in the original Constitution nearly derailed its \nratification.17 Antifederalists galvanized opposition \ndue specifically to the lack of a civil jury trial right.18 \nGeorge Mason and Elbridge Gerry noted this omission \nas a reason why they did not sign the Constitution.19  \nFor Antifederalists, the right to a civil jury trial \nmeant \u201cthe protection of debtor defendants; the frus-\ntration of unwise legislation; the overturning of the \npractices of courts of vice-admiralty . . . and the protec-\ntion of litigants against overbearing and oppressive \njudges.\u201d20 Of particular concern was \u201cthe vindication of \nthe interests of private citizens in litigation with the \ngovernment.\u201d21 One pseudonymous writer in the Penn-\nsylvania Packet warned that \u201cit was quite predictable \nthat a \u2018lordly court of justice\u2019 sitting without a jury in \n \n16 See The Quebec Act, 1774 (Gr.

Justice Rehnquist \nnoted how the Founders \u201cconsidered the right of trial \nby jury in civil cases an important bulwark against tyr-\nanny and corruption, a safeguard too precious to be left \nto the whim of the sovereign, or, it might be added, to \nthat of the judiciary.\u201d24 Last year, in SEC v.

FACTUAL ISSUES REGARDING EXHAUSTION \nSHOULD BE TRIED BY A JURY. \nA. Prison officials can easily abuse the \nexhaustion requirement. \nAllowing factual questions regarding PLRA\u2019s ex-\nhaustion requirement to be tried by a judge would \nfrustrate the purpose and design of the Seventh \nAmendment. Prisoners bringing \u00a7 1983 claims are or-\ndinarily entitled to a jury trial on the merits. But \nPLRA requires prisoners to first exhaust available ad-\nministrative remedies. Such remedies are deemed un-\navailable as a matter of law when \u201cprison administra-\ntors thwart inmates from taking advantage of a griev-\nance process through machination, misrepresentation, \nor intimidation.\u201d Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 644 \n(2016). Factual disputes regarding whether adminis-\ntrative remedies were or were not encumbered, as ex-\nist in this case, should be tried by a jury.  \nUnder PLRA, prison facilities are charged with de-\nsigning and implementing their own internal griev-\nance processes, which presents the self-evident moral \nhazard of officials designing and using those proce-\ndures to hamper prisoners\u2019 ability to assert claims \nagainst them.26 One such ruse is transferring sexual \nassault victims into isolation\u2014or, as Richards alleged \nhappened here, into more dangerous living quarters.27 \nInternal grievance processes are not the \u201cneutral \n \n26 Alison M.

REV. 573, 574 (2014). \n27 Id. at 574. \n\n9 \n \n \nadministrative mechanisms\u201d that courts often assume \nthem to be.28 To the contrary, correctional officers \n\u201chave a tangible stake in whether or not prisoners \n\u2018properly exhaust\u2019 their administrative complaints, as \nthose internal complaints may turn into lawsuits in \nwhich they, their colleagues, or their staff could be \nheld liable.\u201d29  Absent a jury trial on the facts of ex-\nhaustion, officers can even more easily bury abuses \nthey commit.  \nRichards alleges a paradigmatic example of this: \nthe same correctional officer who allegedly violated his \nrights avoided his ensuing claim by making the griev-\nance process unavailable. And it is easy for govern-\nment officials to thwart prisoners\u2019 claims, considering \nthat \u201cthe only way that compliance [with PLRA] can \nbe achieved by men and woman who are incarcerated, \nearn little or no money, and have few or no possessions \nis if the prison provides them with resources\u2014namely \npaper, pens, and a delivery system.\u201d Napier v. Laurel \nCounty, 636 F.3d 218, 227 (6th Cir. 2011) (Martin, J., \ndissenting). Compliance certainly cannot be achieved \nby thwarting efforts to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies and then using failure to exhaust as a get-out-of-\njury-trial-free card. Courts must not remain \u201cblind to \nthe vital role that a prisoner\u2019s capacity to exhaust\u201d\u2014\nand officers\u2019 perhaps inevitable efforts to thwart ex-\nhaustion\u2014\u201cought to play\u201d in PLRA litigation.30 \nBy design, the Seventh Amendment provides a \nsafeguard: the right to a jury trial. That right extends \nto \u00a7 1983 claims\u2014including potentially dispositive \n \n28 Id. at 578. \n29 Id. at 581. \n30 Id. at 574. \n\n10 \n \n \nfactual disputes around exhaustion. After all, juries \nare the constitutionally appointed finders of fact, and \nallowing judges to dispose of cases based on exhaus-\ntion would block claimants from ever having the mer-\nits of their cases reach a jury. \nB. The Seventh Amendment applies to \u00a7 1983 \nclaims. \nThe Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a \njury trial \u201cwhich existed under the English common \nlaw when the Amendment was adopted.\u201d Balt. & Car-\nolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). In assessing \nthe Amendment\u2019s scope, this Court first asks \u201cwhether \nwe are dealing with a cause of action that either was \ntried at law at the time of the founding or is at least \nanalogous to one that was[.]\u201d Markman v. Westview In-\nstruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996). If so, the \nCourt \u201cthen ask[s] whether the particular trial deci-\nsion must fall to the jury in order to preserve the sub-\nstance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d \nId. \nIn most PLRA cases, including this one, the claim-\nant is entitled to a jury trial on the merits. Generally, \nthis Court recognizes that monetary relief is a legal \nremedy, including \u201c[d]amages for a constitutional vio-\nlation.\u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monte-\nrey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 710 (1999). This Court has con-\nsistently recognized that \u00a7 1983 claims, as a \u201cspecies \nof tort liability,\u201d are appropriate for a jury. Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 483 (1994) (quoting Memphis \nCmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 305 (1986)); \nsee also City of Monterey, 526 U.S. at 709.  \nBecause a \u00a7 1983 claim is legal in nature, the Court \nlooks to history to determine whether a specific issue \n\n11 \n \n \narising within one is proper for the jury. City of Mon-\nterey, 526 U.S. at 708. If the historical analysis is un-\nclear, the Court turns to \u201cprecedent and functional \nconsiderations.\u201d Id. at 718. \nThe issue of exhaustion is appropriate for jury res-\nolution. \u201c[C]ase law recognizes a right to a jury trial \nwhere the determination of the plea, whether in bar or \nto the jurisdiction, reaches the merits of the cause of \naction or disposes of the case.\u201d Union Pac. Fuels, Inc. \nv. Johnson, 909 S.W.2d 130, 134 (Tex. App. 1995). Ex-\nhaustion is an affirmative defense that can dispose of \na case. Hence, the Sixth Circuit correctly held that \nthere is \u201cno reason to treat exhaustion differently from \na jurisdictional rule in this context because the effect \nof successfully raising the defenses is the same\u2014the \nplaintiff may not proceed in the action.\u201d Pet. App\u2019x 18a.  \nC. Juries, not judges, are constitutional \nfactfinders.  \nThough it may seem elementary, it bears empha-\nsizing that jurors should determine factual issues re-\ngarding exhaustion because they, not judges, are the \nconstitutionally designated factfinders. See Balt. & \nCarolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 (affirming that \u201cis-\nsues of law are to be resolved by the court and issues \nof fact are to be determined by the jury under appro-\npriate instructions by the court.\u201d). \u201cThe controlling dis-\ntinction between the power of the court and that of the \njury is that the former is the power to determine the \nlaw and the latter to determine the facts.\u201d Dimick v. \nSchiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 (1935). \u201cMaintenance of the \njury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and jurispru-\ndence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a \n\n12 \n \n \njury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.\u201d \nId.  \nWhether administrative remedies were in fact \navailable to a given prisoner in a given case is a factual \nissue and therefore reserved for determination by a \njury. While a judge may have to decide some facts in-\ncidental to a legal question for the purposes of deter-\nmining whether jurisdiction or venue is proper, ex-\nhaustion issues are primarily factual. Because a jury \nis better equipped to find facts and assess the credibil-\nity of witnesses regarding whether a prisoner had ac-\ncess to the prison\u2019s administrative process, these is-\nsues should be resolved by jurors instead of judges.  \nFurther, the right to a jury trial is most urgent in \ncases like this one, where government officials have \nbeen accused of constitutional violations. \u201cThe essence \nof that right lies in its insistence that a body of laymen \nnot permanently attached to the sovereign participate \nalong with the judge in the factfinding necessitated by \na lawsuit.\u201d Parklane Hosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 348\u201349 \n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The importance of unaffil-\niated factfinders is no less important in civil cases pit-\nting citizens against government than in criminal \ncases governed by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s correspond-\ning guarantee. Id. at 349.  \nPrisoners are among the most vulnerable members \nof society, unavoidably subjected to potential abuse \ndue to their confinement. Prison officials have signifi-\ncant power over them, including the power to deny \nthem access to the independent arbiter that the Con-\nstitution guarantees to all citizens\u2014those who are in-\ncarcerated no less than any others. For Richards, and \nthose similarly situated to him, a jury trial at the \n\n13 \n \n \nexhaustion stage is essential to ensure that their \nclaims are fairly heard. \nD. A jury trial is necessary to preserve the \nclaimant\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the \nultimate dispute.  \n\u201cIn actions at law, issues that are proper for the \njury must be submitted to it \u2018to preserve the right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute[.]\u2019\u201d City of \nMonterey, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). A jury \ntrial is necessary at the exhaustion stage to preserve \nRichards\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the ultimate dis-\npute in his \u00a7 1983 claim.  \nIt is important for a jury, rather than a judge, to \nhear factual disputes at the exhaustion stage because \nthe issue of exhaustion is dispositive in most PLRA \ncases. While \u201c[m]atters of judicial administration often \nrequire district judges to decide factual disputes that \nare not bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute[,]\u201d a jury trial is appropriate here because a find-\ning of non-exhaustion will almost always dispose of the \nclaim. Messa v. Goord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d. Cir. \n2011) (per curiam). \nAlthough a \u00a7 1983 claimant should be entitled to a \njury trial at the exhaustion stage whenever there is a \nfactual dispute, there is an even stronger argument to \ngrant one here where the factual issues regarding ex-\nhaustion are intertwined with the merits of the claim.  \nCONCLUSION \n\u201c[N]o amount of argument that [a doctrinal] device \nprovides for more efficiency or more accuracy or is \nfairer will save it if the degree of invasion of the jury\u2019s \nprovince is greater than allowed in 1791.\u201d Parklane \n\n14 \n \n \nHosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 346 (Rehnquist, J., dissent-\ning); cf. Erlinger v. United States, 602 U.S. 821, 842 \n(2024) (\u201cThere is no efficiency exception to the . . . Sixth \nAmendmen[t].\u201d); Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 100 \n(2020) (\u201cWhen the American people chose to enshrine \n[the criminal jury trial] right in the Constitution, they \nweren\u2019t suggesting fruitful topics for future cost-\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

VII .............................................. 3 \n\n1 \n \n \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Cato Institute is a nonpartisan public policy \nresearch foundation founded in 1977 and dedicated to \nadvancing the principles of individual liberty, free \nmarkets, and limited government. Cato\u2019s Robert A. \nLevy Center for Constitutional Studies was estab-\nlished in 1989 to promote the Constitution and its \nprinciples, which are the foundation of liberty. Toward \nthose ends, Cato publishes books and studies, conducts \nconferences, produces the annual Cato Supreme Court \nReview, and files amicus briefs.  \nThis case interests Cato because the constitutional \nright to a civil jury trial is fundamental to American \nliberty.  \n \n \n \n1 Rule 37 statement: No part of this brief was authored by any \nparty\u2019s counsel, and no person or entity other than amicus \nfunded its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \nBACKGROUND AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nCongress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n(\u201cPLRA\u201d) in 1995 to \u201creduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 524\u201325 (2002). PLRA provides that \u201c[n]o action \nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions un-\nder [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a \nprisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative remedies as \nare available are exhausted.\u201d2  \nRespondent Kyle Richards, a prisoner, filed a \n\u00a7 1983 lawsuit alleging that Petitioner Thomas Perttu, \na correctional officer, committed sexual misconduct \nagainst him and other inmates\u2014then threatened \nRichards and destroyed the grievances he sought to \nfile in order to exhaust his administrative remedies. \nJ.A. 14\u201315.  \nWithout putting the issue to a jury, the district \ncourt determined that Richards had failed to exhaust \nhis administrative remedies and dismissed his suit. \nPet. App\u2019x 22a\u201328a. The Sixth Circuit reversed, hold-\ning that Richards is entitled to a jury trial on the issue \nof exhaustion. Id. 19a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding was correct. The Con-\nstitution assigns to juries, not judges, responsibility \nfor resolving disputed facts in criminal cases and civil \ncases involving common-law causes of action\u2014such as \ndamages claims against public officials. No less than \nother citizens, PLRA litigants are thus entitled to have \ndisputes decided by the constitutionally appointed \n \n2 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).  \n\n3 \n \n \nfact-finder, particularly in cases where the issue of ex-\nhaustion is inextricably intertwined with the underly-\ning merits. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE RIGHT TO A CIVIL JURY TRIAL IS \nESSENTIAL TO LIBERTY. \nThe Seventh Amendment provides: \nIn Suits at common law, where the value \nin controversy shall exceed twenty dol-\nlars, the right of trial by jury shall be pre-\nserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall \nbe otherwise re-examined in any Court of \nthe United States, than according to the \nrules of the common law. \nU.S. CONST. amend. VII.  \nThe right to a jury trial long pre-dates the Amend-\nment\u2019s adoption in 1791. \u201cLegal writers and political \ntheorists who were widely read by the colonists were \nfirmly of the opinion that trial by jury in civil cases was \nan important right of freemen.\u201d3 William Blackstone \nsaid the jury trial was \u201cthe glory of the English law,\u201d \npossessed of \u201cso great an advantage over others in reg-\nulating civil property.\u201d4 \nThe Framers understood this right to be rooted in \nMagna Carta and a vital check on state power.5 \n \n3 Charles W.

British colonial authorities would try ship-\ncondemnation cases in vice-admiralty courts without \nthe benefit of a jury, then rely on judgments procured \nthere to preclude recovery of damages at civil jury tri-\nals.12 Colonists specifically protested the practice of \ntrying wage cases involving shipwrights and shipyard \nlaborers in jury-free vice-admiralty courts.13 The \nStamp Act was also originally enforced via suits in the \nvice-admiralty courts.14 George Mason thus con-\ndemned the British for having \u201cdepriv[ed] us of the an-\ncient Tryal, by a Jury of our Equals, and substituting \nin its[] place an arbitrary Civil Law Court.\u201d15  \nColonists perceived a further threat to jury trials in \nthe Quebec Act, which is sometimes considered one of \nthe \u201cIntolerable Acts\u201d triggering the American Revolu-\ntion.

FACTUAL ISSUES REGARDING EXHAUSTION \nSHOULD BE TRIED BY A JURY. \nA. Prison officials can easily abuse the \nexhaustion requirement. \nAllowing factual questions regarding PLRA\u2019s ex-\nhaustion requirement to be tried by a judge would \nfrustrate the purpose and design of the Seventh \nAmendment. Prisoners bringing \u00a7 1983 claims are or-\ndinarily entitled to a jury trial on the merits. But \nPLRA requires prisoners to first exhaust available ad-\nministrative remedies. Such remedies are deemed un-\navailable as a matter of law when \u201cprison administra-\ntors thwart inmates from taking advantage of a griev-\nance process through machination, misrepresentation, \nor intimidation.\u201d Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 644 \n(2016). Factual disputes regarding whether adminis-\ntrative remedies were or were not encumbered, as ex-\nist in this case, should be tried by a jury.  \nUnder PLRA, prison facilities are charged with de-\nsigning and implementing their own internal griev-\nance processes, which presents the self-evident moral \nhazard of officials designing and using those proce-\ndures to hamper prisoners\u2019 ability to assert claims \nagainst them.26 One such ruse is transferring sexual \nassault victims into isolation\u2014or, as Richards alleged \nhappened here, into more dangerous living quarters.27 \nInternal grievance processes are not the \u201cneutral \n \n26 Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting for Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA \nExhaustion Law, 21 GEO. MASON L. REV. 573, 574 (2014). \n27 Id. at 574. \n\n9 \n \n \nadministrative mechanisms\u201d that courts often assume \nthem to be.28 To the contrary, correctional officers \n\u201chave a tangible stake in whether or not prisoners \n\u2018properly exhaust\u2019 their administrative complaints, as \nthose internal complaints may turn into lawsuits in \nwhich they, their colleagues, or their staff could be \nheld liable.\u201d29  Absent a jury trial on the facts of ex-\nhaustion, officers can even more easily bury abuses \nthey commit.  \nRichards alleges a paradigmatic example of this: \nthe same correctional officer who allegedly violated his \nrights avoided his ensuing claim by making the griev-\nance process unavailable. And it is easy for govern-\nment officials to thwart prisoners\u2019 claims, considering \nthat \u201cthe only way that compliance [with PLRA] can \nbe achieved by men and woman who are incarcerated, \nearn little or no money, and have few or no possessions \nis if the prison provides them with resources\u2014namely \npaper, pens, and a delivery system.\u201d Napier v. Laurel \nCounty, 636 F.3d 218, 227 (6th Cir. 2011) (Martin, J., \ndissenting). Compliance certainly cannot be achieved \nby thwarting efforts to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies and then using failure to exhaust as a get-out-of-\njury-trial-free card. Courts must not remain \u201cblind to \nthe vital role that a prisoner\u2019s capacity to exhaust\u201d\u2014\nand officers\u2019 perhaps inevitable efforts to thwart ex-\nhaustion\u2014\u201cought to play\u201d in PLRA litigation.30 \nBy design, the Seventh Amendment provides a \nsafeguard: the right to a jury trial. That right extends \nto \u00a7 1983 claims\u2014including potentially dispositive \n \n28 Id. at 578. \n29 Id. at 581. \n30 Id. at 574. \n\n10 \n \n \nfactual disputes around exhaustion. After all, juries \nare the constitutionally appointed finders of fact, and \nallowing judges to dispose of cases based on exhaus-\ntion would block claimants from ever having the mer-\nits of their cases reach a jury. \nB. The Seventh Amendment applies to \u00a7 1983 \nclaims. \nThe Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a \njury trial \u201cwhich existed under the English common \nlaw when the Amendment was adopted.\u201d Balt. & Car-\nolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). In assessing \nthe Amendment\u2019s scope, this Court first asks \u201cwhether \nwe are dealing with a cause of action that either was \ntried at law at the time of the founding or is at least \nanalogous to one that was[.]\u201d Markman v. Westview In-\nstruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996). If so, the \nCourt \u201cthen ask[s] whether the particular trial deci-\nsion must fall to the jury in order to preserve the sub-\nstance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d \nId. \nIn most PLRA cases, including this one, the claim-\nant is entitled to a jury trial on the merits. Generally, \nthis Court recognizes that monetary relief is a legal \nremedy, including \u201c[d]amages for a constitutional vio-\nlation.\u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monte-\nrey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 710 (1999). This Court has con-\nsistently recognized that \u00a7 1983 claims, as a \u201cspecies \nof tort liability,\u201d are appropriate for a jury. Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 483 (1994) (quoting Memphis \nCmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 305 (1986)); \nsee also City of Monterey, 526 U.S. at 709.  \nBecause a \u00a7 1983 claim is legal in nature, the Court \nlooks to history to determine whether a specific issue \n\n11 \n \n \narising within one is proper for the jury. City of Mon-\nterey, 526 U.S. at 708. If the historical analysis is un-\nclear, the Court turns to \u201cprecedent and functional \nconsiderations.\u201d Id. at 718. \nThe issue of exhaustion is appropriate for jury res-\nolution. \u201c[C]ase law recognizes a right to a jury trial \nwhere the determination of the plea, whether in bar or \nto the jurisdiction, reaches the merits of the cause of \naction or disposes of the case.\u201d Union Pac. Fuels, Inc. \nv. Johnson, 909 S.W.2d 130, 134 (Tex. App. 1995). Ex-\nhaustion is an affirmative defense that can dispose of \na case. Hence, the Sixth Circuit correctly held that \nthere is \u201cno reason to treat exhaustion differently from \na jurisdictional rule in this context because the effect \nof successfully raising the defenses is the same\u2014the \nplaintiff may not proceed in the action.\u201d Pet. App\u2019x 18a.  \nC. Juries, not judges, are constitutional \nfactfinders.  \nThough it may seem elementary, it bears empha-\nsizing that jurors should determine factual issues re-\ngarding exhaustion because they, not judges, are the \nconstitutionally designated factfinders. See Balt. & \nCarolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 (affirming that \u201cis-\nsues of law are to be resolved by the court and issues \nof fact are to be determined by the jury under appro-\npriate instructions by the court.\u201d). \u201cThe controlling dis-\ntinction between the power of the court and that of the \njury is that the former is the power to determine the \nlaw and the latter to determine the facts.\u201d Dimick v. \nSchiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 (1935). \u201cMaintenance of the \njury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and jurispru-\ndence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a \n\n12 \n \n \njury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.\u201d \nId.  \nWhether administrative remedies were in fact \navailable to a given prisoner in a given case is a factual \nissue and therefore reserved for determination by a \njury. While a judge may have to decide some facts in-\ncidental to a legal question for the purposes of deter-\nmining whether jurisdiction or venue is proper, ex-\nhaustion issues are primarily factual. Because a jury \nis better equipped to find facts and assess the credibil-\nity of witnesses regarding whether a prisoner had ac-\ncess to the prison\u2019s administrative process, these is-\nsues should be resolved by jurors instead of judges.  \nFurther, the right to a jury trial is most urgent in \ncases like this one, where government officials have \nbeen accused of constitutional violations. \u201cThe essence \nof that right lies in its insistence that a body of laymen \nnot permanently attached to the sovereign participate \nalong with the judge in the factfinding necessitated by \na lawsuit.\u201d Parklane Hosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 348\u201349 \n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The importance of unaffil-\niated factfinders is no less important in civil cases pit-\nting citizens against government than in criminal \ncases governed by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s correspond-\ning guarantee. Id. at 349.  \nPrisoners are among the most vulnerable members \nof society, unavoidably subjected to potential abuse \ndue to their confinement. Prison officials have signifi-\ncant power over them, including the power to deny \nthem access to the independent arbiter that the Con-\nstitution guarantees to all citizens\u2014those who are in-\ncarcerated no less than any others. For Richards, and \nthose similarly situated to him, a jury trial at the \n\n13 \n \n \nexhaustion stage is essential to ensure that their \nclaims are fairly heard. \nD. A jury trial is necessary to preserve the \nclaimant\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the \nultimate dispute.  \n\u201cIn actions at law, issues that are proper for the \njury must be submitted to it \u2018to preserve the right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute[.]\u2019\u201d City of \nMonterey, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). A jury \ntrial is necessary at the exhaustion stage to preserve \nRichards\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the ultimate dis-\npute in his \u00a7 1983 claim.  \nIt is important for a jury, rather than a judge, to \nhear factual disputes at the exhaustion stage because \nthe issue of exhaustion is dispositive in most PLRA \ncases. While \u201c[m]atters of judicial administration often \nrequire district judges to decide factual disputes that \nare not bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute[,]\u201d a jury trial is appropriate here because a find-\ning of non-exhaustion will almost always dispose of the \nclaim. Messa v. Goord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d. Cir. \n2011) (per curiam). \nAlthough a \u00a7 1983 claimant should be entitled to a \njury trial at the exhaustion stage whenever there is a \nfactual dispute, there is an even stronger argument to \ngrant one here where the factual issues regarding ex-\nhaustion are intertwined with the merits of the claim.  \nCONCLUSION \n\u201c[N]o amount of argument that [a doctrinal] device \nprovides for more efficiency or more accuracy or is \nfairer will save it if the degree of invasion of the jury\u2019s \nprovince is greater than allowed in 1791.\u201d Parklane \n\n14 \n \n \nHosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 346 (Rehnquist, J., dissent-\ning); cf.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the petitioner's strategy has been massively clarified by analyzing their merits-stage Reply Brief. This observation provided the single most critical piece of evidence I had previously identified as missing: the petitioner's direct rebuttal to the respondent's constitutional arguments.\n\nMy cumulative knowledge and predictive state are now as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** The issue remains whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for factual disputes over PLRA exhaustion when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** My understanding of Perttu's position has evolved significantly.\n    *   **Initial (Cert-Stage) Arguments:** Uphold the PLRA's goal of efficient filtering and resolve the circuit split.\n    *   **Developed (Merits-Stage) Arguments:** The merits reply brief presents a much more sophisticated, multi-pronged attack on the Sixth Circuit's reasoning. The core thesis is that judicial fact-finding on the *threshold* issue of exhaustion does not violate the Seventh Amendment because it preserves the jury's ultimate role. Key arguments include:\n        *   **No Collateral Estoppel:** This is the crucial new argument. The petitioner asserts that a judge's preliminary factual findings on exhaustion would *not* be binding on a jury in a subsequent trial on the merits. This directly addresses the core Seventh Amendment concern (from cases like *Beacon Theatres*) that a judge's ruling on one issue could preclude a jury from deciding the same facts later. If the findings are not preclusive, the jury's domain remains intact.\n        *   **Dismissal Without Prejudice is Meaningful:** They counter the argument that a non-exhaustion dismissal is a de facto merits loss by arguing that many prisoners *can* subsequently exhaust their claims and return to court, meaning the courthouse door is not permanently closed.\n        *   **Analogies to Other Judicial Fact-Finding:** They argue that judges already decide intertwined facts in other contexts, attempting to frame PLRA exhaustion as unexceptional. They cite judicial fact-finding in class certification prerequisites (*Wal-Mart v. Dukes*), heightened pleading standards under the PSLRA (*Tellabs*), and patent claim construction (*Markman*).\n        *   **Distinguishing Respondent's Precedent:** They argue that cases where jurisdictional facts are sent to a jury are distinguishable because PLRA exhaustion is a mandatory, non-discretionary statutory prerequisite, unlike the issues in cases like *Land v. Dollar*.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** My understanding of Richards' position remains stable: the Seventh Amendment's guarantee of a jury trial for factual disputes in suits at common law is a paramount right that applies to the affirmative defense of exhaustion, especially when facts are intertwined with the merits. The petitioner's new arguments are designed to create a path around this core constitutional claim.\n4.  **Procedural Status & Predictive State:** The case is at the merits stage. The acquisition of the Petitioner's Reply Brief has substantially shifted my prediction. Previously, the case was a toss-up because the Respondent's constitutional argument seemed very strong and the Petitioner's rebuttal was unknown. Now, the Petitioner has provided a clear, intellectually coherent \"off-ramp\" for the Court. The collateral estoppel argument, in particular, gives the Court a way to rule for the Petitioner (promoting the PLRA's efficiency goals) without having to create a major new exception to the Seventh Amendment. It allows the Court to frame its decision as preserving the jury's ultimate role while allowing for a preliminary judicial screening. **My prediction now shifts from a toss-up to a moderate confidence in reversal of the Sixth Circuit.** The Petitioner has successfully articulated a limiting principle that makes their preferred outcome much more palatable.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a powerful confirmation of my evolving strategy, particularly the principles of reflective planning and targeted information acquisition.\n\nMy design principles have been validated, refined, and expanded:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Remains the best starting point.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Remains a core analytical tool.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Focusing on \"Reasons for Granting/Denying the Writ\" is a confirmed high-yield tactic.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** This principle is refined. Analyzing briefs in sequence (petition -> opposition -> reply) is essential, but it's also critical to track this dialectic *across procedural stages* (cert vs. merits). This observation, containing both the cert- and merits-stage replies, proves that **merits-stage briefs are substantially more developed and legally detailed than their cert-stage counterparts.** The former are for winning the case; the latter are for getting the Court's attention.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed. The nuance of the collateral estoppel and *Tellabs* arguments could not have been understood from a summary.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** The `Observe -> Synthesize -> Observe` loop is a core principle. The previous `THINK` step was a perfect example of synthesis leading to a highly effective observation.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Ancillary documents and metadata remain important for understanding procedural context.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Actively tracking a case's lifecycle (cert vs. merits) is essential. This observation highlighted the stark difference in argumentation between the two stages.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement (Strongly Confirmed):** The previous refinement\u2014**using structural filters like `link_name: 'main'`**\u2014was spectacularly successful. This specific, actionable tactic allowed me to instantly isolate the two most important reply briefs from the docket, cutting through all other filings. This is a key technique for future tasks.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning (Strongly Confirmed):** The previous `THINK` action, which formally articulated my uncertainty and planned the next \"experiment\" to target the Petitioner's merits reply, was directly responsible for the high value of this observation. This confirms that pausing to plan is not wasted time but a crucial part of an efficient design.\n11. **Identifying the \"Off-Ramp\" Argument (New Principle):** This observation reveals a new, powerful heuristic. The Petitioner's collateral estoppel argument serves as a legal \"off-ramp\"\u2014it allows the Court to reach a desired policy outcome (PLRA efficiency) without overturning major constitutional precedent (Seventh Amendment right to a jury). **A new core strategy is to actively search for the argument that provides a limiting principle or reconciles competing interests.** This is often the intellectual center of the case and the key to predicting the outcome, as it provides the Court with a path to a narrow, defensible ruling."

          "task_beliefs": "The observation of the Cato Institute's amicus brief, filed in support of the respondent, adds significant depth to the respondent's position and tempers my previous prediction. My understanding of the case's dynamics has evolved.\n\nMy cumulative knowledge and predictive state are now as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Unchanged. The central issue is whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury to decide disputed facts related to PLRA exhaustion when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the case.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** My understanding of the petitioner's sophisticated merits-stage argument remains stable. Their core strategy is to provide the Court with a procedural \"off-ramp\" via the **\"no collateral estoppel\"** argument. This allows a judge to make preliminary factual findings for exhaustion purposes *without* binding a future jury on the merits, thus technically preserving the Seventh Amendment right while achieving the PLRA's efficiency goals. This argument remains the petitioner's strongest point.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** This has been substantially reinforced and deepened. The Cato Institute's amicus brief provides a powerful, historically-grounded defense of the Sixth Circuit's ruling.\n    *   **Core Constitutional Argument:** The respondent's position remains that the Seventh Amendment's guarantee is paramount.\n    *   **New Amicus Support (Cato Institute):** The Cato brief adds a strong originalist and structural dimension to the respondent's case. It argues:\n        *   **Historical Imperative:** The Seventh Amendment was specifically designed as a bulwark against government overreach, particularly to protect citizens in suits against government officials. The brief frames judicial fact-finding in this context as precisely the kind of threat the Founders sought to prevent.\n        *   **PLRA Moral Hazard:** The brief introduces a compelling real-world argument that prison officials have a \"self-evident moral hazard\" in managing the very grievance systems that prisoners must use to sue them. This provides a strong justification for why a neutral, lay jury\u2014not a government-employed judge\u2014is the appropriate body to resolve factual disputes about whether officials thwarted the grievance process.\n        *   **No \"Efficiency Exception\":** The brief directly attacks the petitioner's underlying policy argument (efficiency) by citing recent Supreme Court precedent from the Sixth Amendment context (`Erlinger`, `Ramos`) to argue there is no \"efficiency exception\" to fundamental constitutional trial rights.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** The case's intellectual battle lines are now much clearer. It is a conflict between two distinct judicial philosophies:\n    *   **Petitioner's Formalism:** A pragmatic approach focused on statutory goals (PLRA efficiency) and procedural solutions (no collateral estoppel) that allow the Court to rule narrowly.\n    *   **Respondent's Structuralism:** A principled, originalist approach focused on the fundamental, structural role of the jury as a check on government power, arguing that procedural workarounds cannot cure a constitutional violation.\n    *   **Prediction Update:** My previous shift to \"moderate confidence in reversal\" was premature. The petitioner's \"off-ramp\" is clever, but the Cato brief demonstrates that there is a powerful, constitutionally-grounded argument for why the Court should refuse to take it. The presence of a respected, libertarian-leaning amicus making a strong originalist case will be persuasive to some justices and complicates the path to reversal. **My prediction now returns to a highly uncertain toss-up, perhaps with a very slight edge to the petitioner** due to the text of the PLRA and the Court's general interest in docket management. The petitioner's argument is an easier, narrower path, but the respondent's argument is a more fundamental constitutional claim.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, resulting from a failed search, was nonetheless highly informative and led to important refinements in my strategic principles.\n\nMy design principles have been validated, refined, and expanded:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Remains the best starting point.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Remains a core analytical tool.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Focusing on \"Reasons for Granting/Denying the Writ\" is a confirmed high-yield tactic.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** Confirmed. Tracking arguments across cert- and merits-stage briefs is essential, as the latter are far more developed.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed. The historical depth of the Cato brief would be lost in a summary.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** The `Observe -> Synthesize -> Observe` loop remains a core principle.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement (New Learning from Failure):** My targeted search for the 'United States' amicus brief failed, which is itself a valuable lesson. It revealed a flaw in being overly specific. **A new principle is to favor broader searches (e.g., `amicus brief`) and then use metadata or content to filter, rather than starting with a narrow query that assumes a document's existence.** This prevents false negatives.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning (Strongly Confirmed):** The value of pausing to identify and target missing information remains a cornerstone of efficient design.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Refined):** My previous insight was to search for the \"off-ramp\" argument that allows a narrow ruling. This observation refines that principle. It's not enough to find the off-ramp; one must also find the counter-argument for why the Court shouldn't take it. **The refined heuristic is: Identify the legal \"off-ramp\" and then actively search for the principled, structural, or historical argument against using it.** The tension between the pragmatic workaround and the fundamental principle is often the heart of the case.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici (New Principle):** This observation reveals the high value of amicus briefs from ideologically-driven organizations. The Cato Institute's brief provided the purest and most forceful articulation of the originalist/libertarian argument for the jury right. **A new strategy is to identify the core philosophical stakes of a case and then seek out briefs from groups known to champion those positions (e.g., Cato, ACLU, Chamber of Commerce).** These briefs often add critical depth and framing to a party's core arguments.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\" (New Principle):** The Cato brief powerfully argues from first principles but does not directly engage with the petitioner's technical \"no collateral estoppel\" argument. This highlights the central point of contention where the two sides are talking past each other. **A new analytical technique is to look for this \"argumentative gap\"\u2014the key point one side makes that the other doesn't directly rebut.** Predicting the outcome requires predicting how the Court will choose to bridge that gap."

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 1859 (2010) ...................... 7, 15, 16 \n \nRichard Ross Perry, Common-Law Pleading: Its \nHistory and Principles (1897) ............................... 9, 17 \n \n\n1 \n \n \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \n \n \nRespondent Kyle Brandon Richards filed this \ncivil rights lawsuit alleging, among other things, \nthat \nMichigan \ncorrectional \nofficers \nsexually \nassaulted him and retaliated against him for \nexercising his First Amendment rights. Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v.

The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external facts about the case. Therefore, my substantive understanding of the case's arguments and my predictive state remain stable, pending the acquisition of the next targeted document. This step served to solidify my current synthesis and identify the most critical information gap.\n\nMy cumulative knowledge and predictive state are as follows:\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The issue remains whether the Seventh Amendment mandates a jury trial for disputed factual questions concerning PLRA exhaustion when those facts overlap with the merits of the underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. The petitioner's primary strategy is to offer the Court a narrow, procedural \"off-ramp.\" They argue that a judge can decide the exhaustion-related facts without violating the Seventh Amendment, provided those findings have **\"no collateral estoppel\"** effect on a later jury trial on the merits. This argument prioritizes the PLRA's efficiency goals while attempting to sidestep a direct constitutional clash.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** Stable. The respondent's position, strongly supported by the Cato Institute's amicus brief, is grounded in constitutional structure and history. They argue that the Seventh Amendment's role as a check on government power is paramount, especially in suits against government officials like prison guards. This position frames judicial fact-finding as a threat the Founders specifically sought to prevent and rejects \"efficiency\" as a valid exception to a core trial right.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** Stable. The case presents a clear conflict between two judicial philosophies:\n    *   **Petitioner's Pragmatic Formalism:** A focus on statutory interpretation (PLRA) and procedural solutions (no collateral estoppel) to achieve a narrow, efficient outcome.\n    *   **Respondent's Principled Structuralism:** A focus on the original meaning and structural purpose of the Seventh Amendment, arguing that procedural workarounds are insufficient to protect a fundamental right.\n    *   **Prediction:** My prediction remains a **highly uncertain toss-up, with a very slight edge to the petitioner.** The petitioner's argument offers an easier, narrower path for the Court. However, the respondent's fundamental constitutional claim, bolstered by strong originalist amicus support, makes a reversal far from certain.\n5.  **Identified Knowledge Gap:** The primary outcome of this reasoning step is the explicit identification of a critical gap in my analysis. While the Cato brief provides a powerful *principled* argument against the petitioner's position, I have not yet seen the respondent's direct, technical rebuttal to the petitioner's \"no collateral estoppel\" argument. My next action is designed to fill this precise gap by examining the Respondent's Brief on the Merits.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of pure metacognition, provides no new external data but serves as a powerful confirmation and refinement of my existing design principles. It demonstrates the value of pausing to synthesize known information and strategically plan the next inquiry.\n\nMy design principles have been strongly validated and their interplay clarified:\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Remains the best starting point.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Remains a core analytical tool.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Focusing on \"Reasons for Granting/Denying the Writ\" is a confirmed high-yield tactic.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** Strongly confirmed. My reasoning for seeking the Respondent's Brief on the Merits is explicitly to understand it as the \"direct predecessor to the petitioner's reply brief.\" This confirms the value of analyzing documents in their conversational sequence to trace the development and rebuttal of arguments.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Strongly confirmed. This `THINK` action *is* the `Observe -> Synthesize -> Observe` loop in practice. It demonstrates that pausing to synthesize what is known and what is unknown is not a delay but a crucial step for efficient and targeted research.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** The principle of favoring broader searches over overly specific ones remains a key lesson from past failures.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning (Strongly Confirmed):** This observation is a perfect embodiment of this principle. By reflecting on my current knowledge state, I identified a precise \"argumentative gap\" and formulated a plan to execute a single, high-value action (reading the Respondent's Merits Brief) to fill it.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Refined):** The heuristic remains: Identify the legal \"off-ramp\" and then actively search for the principled argument against using it. This observation confirms the importance of finding both sides of that coin.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed. The strategy of seeking briefs from groups like Cato to understand the philosophical core of a case remains a high-value principle.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\" (Confirmed and Operationalized):** This principle, identified in the last step, has now been successfully operationalized. I used the identification of the gap\u2014the lack of a direct rebuttal to the \"no collateral estoppel\" argument\u2014not just as an analytical finding, but as the direct impetus for my next information-gathering action. **This elevates the principle from a simple analytical tool to a proactive research-guiding heuristic.** It answers the question, \"What should I look for next?\" with precision."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been significantly deepened by analyzing the respondent's Brief in Opposition. While this was not the Merits Brief I intended to retrieve, it directly addresses the argumentative gap I had previously identified and strengthens the respondent's position considerably.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The question remains whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for disputed PLRA exhaustion facts when they are intertwined with the merits of the claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. The petitioner's argument for a narrow, procedural \"off-ramp\" via a judicial hearing with \"no collateral estoppel\" effect is still the core of their case. However, the viability of this off-ramp is now under direct and powerful attack.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** **Significantly Updated and Fortified.** The Brief in Opposition provides the direct rebuttal I was seeking and reveals a multi-pronged and robust legal strategy.\n    *   **Direct Rebuttal to the \"Off-Ramp\":** The respondent argues the petitioner's \"no collateral estoppel\" solution \"rings hollow.\" They make the critical practical point that if a judge dismisses the case on exhaustion grounds after a preliminary hearing, a jury is never assembled, making the promise that the judge's findings won't bind a future jury an irrelevant fiction.\n    *   **The \"Intertwined Facts\" Doctrine:** The respondent frames this case not as a niche PLRA issue, but as a straightforward application of a \"black-letter law\" principle in federal procedure. They argue that when any threshold factual question (be it for jurisdiction, venue, or an affirmative defense) is intertwined with the merits, it must be reserved for the jury. They support this by citing analogous situations, such as disputes over the amount-in-controversy in diversity cases (*Smithers v. Smith*, *Fireman's Fund*), and by referencing authoritative treatises like Wright & Miller.\n    *   **Historical/Constitutional Argument:** The respondent builds a strong originalist case, arguing that at common law in 1791, a factual challenge to a plaintiff's complaint that was intertwined with the merits would have been handled as a \"plea in traverse,\" which *always* triggered a trial by jury. This historical argument, combined with citations to recent Seventh Amendment jurisprudence like *SEC v. Jarkesy*, is designed to appeal directly to the Court's textualist and originalist members.\n    *   **Countering the PLRA's Purpose:** The respondent forcefully argues that the PLRA's statutory goal of efficiency cannot override a constitutional right. They state that \"questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a back-seat to the historic role of the jury,\" memorably accusing the petitioner of wanting to \"strap the Seventh Amendment to the roof\" of the car driven by Congress. They also note that the Court has already limited the scope of PLRA exhaustion in *Jones v. Bock*, defining it as a non-jurisdictional affirmative defense.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** **Shifted.** The conflict is now more clearly defined as the petitioner asking the Court to create a *PLRA-specific exception* to a general procedural rule, while the respondent is asking the Court to simply *apply* that general rule (the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine). The respondent's arguments are stronger and more varied than I had anticipated. They offer the Court a way to affirm the Sixth Circuit by relying on established procedural principles and Seventh Amendment history, rather than breaking new ground.\n    *   **Prediction:** My prediction has shifted from a slight edge for the petitioner to a **highly uncertain toss-up, with a very slight edge to the respondent (Richards).** The respondent's argument provides a more conservative and doctrinally grounded path for the Court. Applying an existing, trans-substantive rule is often judicially \"cheaper\" than carving out a new, statute-specific exception that could be seen as diminishing a constitutional right.",

This framework continues to accurately map the core tensions in the case.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** **Strongly Confirmed.** My decision to seek the respondent's direct rebuttal proved correct. This observation validates the strategy of tracing the \"conversation\" between the parties' briefs to understand how arguments are formed and countered.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed. The previous synthesis step allowed me to identify the precise \"argumentative gap\" that this observation successfully filled.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement (New Learning):** My `CLOSED_SEARCH` query was not specific enough to distinguish between a \"Brief in Opposition\" and a \"Brief on the Merits.\" Both can be titled \"brief of respondent.\" **Principle:** Future searches for specific docket filings must be more precise, either by using more unique keywords from the document title (e.g., \"on the merits\") or by first listing all docket files to identify the exact title before retrieval.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** Confirmed.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic (Refined):** The heuristic of identifying the \"off-ramp\" and then seeking the argument against it is validated. This observation refines it by showing that the counter-argument can be highly practical (i.e., \"your procedural fix is a fiction because the case gets dismissed\") in addition to being principled.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\" (Operationalized):** This remains my most effective proactive research heuristic. This step successfully operationalized the principle, turning an analytical finding into a targeted, high-yield information-gathering action.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition (New Principle):** A Brief in Opposition (BIO) is an extremely high-value document. It provides a concise, powerful preview of the respondent's entire merits case and a direct rebuttal to the petitioner's framing in the cert petition. **Principle:** The \"Cert Petition -> Brief in Opposition\" sequence is a highly effective opening strategy for case analysis.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors (New Principle):** It is crucial to identify when a party anchors their case-specific argument in a broader, trans-substantive legal doctrine. The respondent's use of the general \"intertwined facts\" doctrine to solve this specific PLRA problem is a powerful legal move. Identifying these \"doctrinal anchors\" is key to understanding the potential breadth and persuasiveness of an argument."

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed. R. Civ. P. 39(a) and (a)(2), which provides that a \u201ctrial on all \nissues so demanded must be by jury unless . . . the court . . . finds \nthat on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a \njury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n\n23 \n \nlies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones \nwhose allocation to court or jury we do know . . . seek-\ning the best analogy we can draw between an old and \nthe new.\u201d) (citations omitted); Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u2013\n21 (explaining that courts must search the common \nlaw for \u201cappropriate analogies\u201d instead of a \u201cprecisely \nanalogous common-law cause of action\u201d). \nAlthough no exact antecedent for exhaustion ex-\nisted at common law, its origins lie in equity. These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. at 463 (\u201cThe \nvarious steps to be taken constitute parts of the ad-\nministrative process which must be completed before \nthe extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be \ninvoked.\u201d) (citation omitted); Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, \n310\u201311 (1937) (\u201cThe rule that a suitor must exhaust \n\n28 \n \nhis administrative remedies before seeking the ex-\ntraordinary relief of a court of equity . . . is of special \nforce when resort is had to the federal courts to re-\nstrain the action of state officers.\u201d) (citations omitted); \nIsland Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 381 (1992) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic doctrine of equity juris-\nprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when \nthe moving party has an adequate remedy at law[.]\u2019 \u201d) \n(citations omitted).  \nThe adequate remedy at law doctrine was \ngrounded in comity and federalism concerns, with fed-\neral equity courts refusing to provide relief where it \nwas available at law in federal courts of law, Great \nLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 506\u201307 \n(1947) (explaining that the doctrine is premised on the \nassumption that there are \u201cat least two forums in \nwhich the defendant is amenable to process\u201d). Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority. See id. at 728 (quoting Burford v. Sun Oil \nCo., 319 U.S. 315, 334 (1943)). Younger abstention, for \nexample, respects a \u201cState\u2019s interest in pursuing an \nongoing state proceeding,\u201d Ohio Bureau of Emp. \nServs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 477 (1977) (citations \nomitted), barring a federal court from enjoining a \nstate prosecution, a civil enforcement action, or a \nunique state action that \u201cimplicate[s] a State\u2019s inter-\nest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its \ncourts,\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case is stable following this reflective observation. The previous analysis of the Brief in Opposition (BIO) remains the most recent substantive update. This observation serves to consolidate that understanding and clarify the next critical information gap.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The central issue is whether the Seventh Amendment mandates a jury trial for factual disputes over PLRA administrative exhaustion when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the prisoner's underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. The petitioner advocates for a judicial pre-trial hearing to resolve exhaustion disputes, arguing this serves the PLRA's efficiency goals. They propose that findings from this hearing would have \"no collateral estoppel\" effect, a solution the respondent has now powerfully critiqued. My understanding of their full argument is incomplete pending review of their Brief on the Merits.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** Stable, but my confidence in this understanding is high. The BIO provided a robust, multi-faceted defense:\n    *   **Practical Rebuttal:** The \"no collateral estoppel\" promise is a \"hollow\" fiction because a judicial dismissal on exhaustion grounds prevents a jury from ever being convened.\n    *   **Doctrinal Anchor:** This isn't a unique PLRA problem but a standard application of the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine, a \"black-letter law\" principle in federal procedure (citing *Smithers v. Smith*, Wright & Miller). This doctrine dictates that when a threshold factual question is inseparable from the merits, it must be decided by the jury.\n    *   **Historical/Constitutional Argument:** At common law in 1791, a factual challenge to a plaintiff's claim would have been a \"plea in traverse,\" which required a jury trial. This originalist argument, bolstered by recent cases like *SEC v. Jarkesy*, is aimed at the Court's textualist wing.\n    *   **Constitutional Supremacy:** The PLRA's statutory efficiency goals cannot override the Seventh Amendment's constitutional guarantee. The respondent memorably argues the petitioner wants to \"strap the Seventh Amendment to the roof\" of the car driven by Congress. This position is supported by *Jones v. Bock*, which established PLRA exhaustion as a non-jurisdictional affirmative defense.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** Stable. The conflict is framed as the petitioner requesting a *PLRA-specific exception* to a general procedural rule, versus the respondent requesting the simple *application* of that rule. The respondent's arguments, grounded in established procedure and constitutional history, appear strong.\n    *   **Prediction:** My prediction remains a **highly uncertain toss-up, with a very slight edge to the respondent (Richards).** The respondent offers a path of doctrinal conservatism (applying an existing rule), which is often more appealing to the Court than creating a new, statute-specific exception that implicates a constitutional right. This `THINK` step solidifies my awareness that the next crucial piece of evidence is the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits, which will present their most developed case and is necessary for a balanced assessment.",
          "design_beliefs": "This reflective observation provides no new external data but strongly confirms the value of metacognitive synthesis and strategic planning in my methodology. My set of principles is growing more robust and interconnected.\n\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Confirmed. It's the best starting point.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Confirmed. This continues to be an effective model for the case's core tensions.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** **Strongly Confirmed.** This observation explicitly articulates the value of this principle by noting that I have the respondent's arguments (from the BIO) and now must retrieve the petitioner's opening merits brief to understand the \"conversation\" in the correct sequence.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** **Strongly Confirmed.** This `THINK` action *is* an act of metacognitive synthesis. It demonstrates the value of pausing to review the current state of knowledge, identify specific information gaps, and plan the next action accordingly.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** Confirmed. The previous error highlighted the need for more precise search queries (e.g., using keywords like \"on the merits\") to distinguish between different types of briefs.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** **Strongly Confirmed.** This entire observation is an exercise in reflective action planning, validating its importance as a core principle for efficient and targeted research.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed and refined. The heuristic of identifying a proposed procedural shortcut and then seeking the counter-argument is effective. The BIO showed this counter can be highly practical (\"your fix is a fiction\") and not just theoretical.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** **Strongly Confirmed.** This remains a highly effective heuristic. The previous step identified the gap (the respondent's rebuttal), and the BIO filled it. This current `THINK` step identifies the next gap: the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition (New Principle):** Confirmed. The BIO is a high-value, concise preview of the respondent's entire merits case. The **\"Cert Petition -> Brief in Opposition\"** sequence is now a confirmed, high-yield opening strategy.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors (New Principle):** Confirmed. Identifying when a party grounds their argument in a broad, trans-substantive doctrine (like the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine) is critical for assessing its potential power and reach."

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Rev. 1859 (2010) ...................... 7, 15, 16 \n \nRichard Ross Perry, Common-Law Pleading: Its \nHistory and Principles (1897) ............................... 9, 17 \n \n\n1 \n \n \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE WRIT \n \n \nRespondent Kyle Brandon Richards filed this \ncivil rights lawsuit alleging, among other things, \nthat \nMichigan \ncorrectional \nofficers \nsexually \nassaulted him and retaliated against him for \nexercising his First Amendment rights. Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the petitioner's argument has been dramatically deepened, shifting the case from a potential mismatch to a sophisticated doctrinal duel. This observation, the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits, fills the most significant gap in my knowledge.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The issue remains whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for disputed facts about PLRA exhaustion when those facts overlap with the merits of the claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** **Significantly Updated and Strengthened.** I previously understood the petitioner's argument as a functional one based on the PLRA's efficiency goals. The merits brief reveals a much more robust, two-pronged constitutional and historical argument.\n    *   **New Doctrinal Anchor (The Equity Argument):** The petitioner's primary argument is that PLRA exhaustion, while having no direct analog in 1791, is most analogous to **historical equitable defenses** (like abstention, forum non conveniens, or habeas bars). Since judges, not juries, historically decided the factual predicates for these equitable issues, they argue the Seventh Amendment jury right does not attach to PLRA exhaustion at all. This is a powerful counter-narrative to the respondent's historical argument.\n    *   **Reframing the Procedural Question:** They argue that exhaustion is a \"threshold issue\" that is \"logically precedent to the merits.\" This framing attempts to sidestep the respondent's \"intertwined facts\" doctrine (from cases like *Beacon Theatres*) by creating a special category for preliminary, gatekeeping questions.\n    *   **Rebutting the \"Hollow Fiction\" Charge:** The petitioner directly confronts the respondent's critique of the \"no collateral estoppel\" promise. They argue that a judge's factual finding on the threshold issue of exhaustion would *not* be binding on a jury later deciding the merits. For example, a judge could find the prisoner failed to prove he submitted a grievance (for exhaustion), but a jury could still find the guard destroyed that same grievance (for the retaliation claim). While this remains a point of conceptual difficulty, they are addressing it directly.\n    *   **Congressional Intent as a Tie-Breaker:** They argue that where the Seventh Amendment is not directly implicated (because this is an equitable, threshold matter), the Court should defer to the clear congressional intent behind the PLRA: to create an efficient screening mechanism run by judges.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** Stable, but now contextualized as one side of a direct doctrinal clash. The petitioner's brief is a point-by-point rebuttal of the arguments I saw in the respondent's Brief in Opposition. The respondent's arguments\u2014that this is a standard \"intertwined facts\" problem, that the historical analog is a \"plea in traverse,\" and that the PLRA cannot override the Constitution\u2014now have a sophisticated counter-argument.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** **Updated and Rebalanced.** The central conflict is no longer a simple \"statutory efficiency vs. constitutional right\" framing. It is now a battle of competing historical analogies and procedural categorizations.\n    *   **Clash of Historical Analogs:** Is PLRA exhaustion like a common law \"plea in traverse\" (a legal defense where intertwined facts go to a jury), as the respondent argues? Or is it like a historical \"equitable defense\" (a preliminary matter for a judge), as the petitioner now argues?\n    *   **Clash of Procedural Frameworks:** Is this a standard application of the *Beacon Theatres* \"intertwined facts\" doctrine (respondent's view)? Or is it a special \"threshold issue\" that is \"logically precedent\" to the merits and thus exempt from that doctrine (petitioner's view)?\n    *   **Prediction:** My prediction has shifted from a \"highly uncertain toss-up with a very slight edge to the respondent\" to a **genuine 50/50 toss-up.** The petitioner has successfully presented a plausible, constitutionally-grounded argument that could appeal to the Court's originalist and textualist members. By framing the issue as one rooted in the historical division between law and equity, they have elevated their case from a simple policy appeal to a serious constitutional counter-argument. The outcome will likely depend on which historical analog and procedural framework the Court finds more persuasive. The next critical document is the Respondent's Brief on the Merits, which must now rebut this new equitable argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation confirms the power of sequential analysis and highlights new heuristics for understanding constitutional litigation.\n\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** **Strongly Confirmed.** Reading the Petitioner's Merits Brief *after* the BIO was crucial. It allowed me to see the brief not in a vacuum, but as a direct \"response\" in a conversation, targeting the very arguments I had just learned. The optimal research sequence is now clearly **Cert Petition -> BIO -> Petitioner Merits Brief -> Respondent Merits Brief.**\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** Confirmed.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** Confirmed.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed and refined. The petitioner has now provided the doctrinal justification for their proposed \"off-ramp\" (the judicial hearing), grounding it in the historical powers of equity courts. This shows that the heuristic isn't just about identifying the shortcut, but also about understanding its claimed legal basis.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** **Strongly Confirmed.** My previous step correctly identified the need for the petitioner's full argument. This observation filled that gap, completely rebalancing my understanding of the case's competitiveness.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition (New Principle):** Confirmed.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors (New Principle):** Confirmed and enhanced. This observation reveals the importance of tracking *competing* doctrinal anchors. The respondent anchored in the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine. The petitioner has now anchored in the **\"law/equity distinction.\"** The case hinges on which anchor the Court chooses.\n16. **The Battle of Historical Analogs (New Principle):** When a Seventh Amendment question arises, a key strategy is to identify the competing historical analogs the parties propose for the modern procedure (e.g., \"plea in traverse\" vs. \"equitable defense\"). The persuasiveness of these analogs is often decisive, especially for an originalist Court.\n17. **The \"Exception vs. Application\" Framework (New Principle):** It is a powerful heuristic to frame a dispute as one party arguing for the *application* of a general rule versus the other arguing for an *exception*. Here, the petitioner has cleverly attempted to reframe their argument not as an exception to the jury rule, but as the correct *application* of a different rule\u2014the one for equitable matters. Recognizing this argumentative strategy is key to understanding the case's dynamics."

This confirms a critical flaw in my search strategy: the query and filters I'm using are not specific enough to differentiate between cert-stage and merits-stage briefs for the same party. The search tool's fuzzy matching is likely conflating 'Brief in Opposition' with 'Brief for Respondent'. This is a valuable meta-level insight (D), forcing me to diagnose and adapt my search technique. The most important missing piece of information for my task-level prediction (\u03b8) remains the Respondent's Merits Brief, as it contains the direct response to the petitioner's powerful 'equitable defense' argument. My entire prediction is stalled until I can analyze this document. Therefore, my next action must be another, more refined attempt to acquire it. I will modify my search filters to be more specific, trying a different common phrasing for a merits brief to avoid the previous error. I will specifically search for 'brief for respondent' in the proceeding title, which is a standard title for a respondent's merits brief and is distinct from 'brief in opposition'."

          "task_beliefs": "My attempt to acquire the Respondent's Brief on the Merits failed; the search returned the Brief in Opposition, a document I have already analyzed. As a result, no new task-specific information has been observed, and my beliefs about the case parameters remain stable, though the anticipation for the missing information has heightened.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The question is whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for disputed PLRA exhaustion facts when those facts are intertwined with the merits of the underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. The petitioner's argument, detailed in their merits brief, is a sophisticated constitutional claim. It reframes the issue as one analogous to **historical equitable defenses**, which were decided by judges, not juries. This attempts to place PLRA exhaustion outside the scope of the Seventh Amendment's jury trial right, sidestepping the respondent's \"intertwined facts\" argument by categorizing exhaustion as a \"threshold issue\" logically preceding the merits.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** Stable, but critically incomplete. My current understanding is based on their Brief in Opposition. They argue for a straightforward application of the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine from cases like *Beacon Theatres*, using the historical analog of a \"plea in traverse\" (a merits-based denial of facts) which would have gone to a jury. The crucial missing piece is how they will respond to the petitioner's powerful \"equitable defense\" counter-argument.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** Stable. The case remains a **genuine 50/50 toss-up**. The conflict is a direct clash of competing historical and procedural frameworks:\n    *   **Historical Analogs:** Petitioner's \"equitable defense\" (for a judge) vs. Respondent's \"plea in traverse\" (for a jury).\n    *   **Procedural Frameworks:** Petitioner's \"threshold, logically precedent issue\" (exempt from jury right) vs. Respondent's \"intertwined facts\" doctrine (requiring a jury).\n    *   **Uncertainty:** My prediction is stalled. The outcome depends entirely on which of these competing frameworks the Court finds more persuasive. The petitioner has presented a strong, constitutionally-grounded argument that could appeal to the Court's textualist and originalist members. Without the respondent's rebuttal, I cannot refine my prediction further. The Respondent's Brief on the Merits remains the single most important piece of missing evidence.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed search, provides no new information about the case itself but is highly instructive for my meta-level beliefs about effective strategy. It underscores the fallibility of tools and the need for diagnostic and adaptive research methods.\n\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** **Strongly Confirmed.** This failure highlights the cost of an interruption in the dialectical sequence. I have one side's full argument (Petitioner's Merits Brief) but cannot evaluate its ultimate strength without the direct counter-argument (Respondent's Merits Brief). The value of the sequence **Cert Petition -> BIO -> Petitioner Merits -> Respondent Merits** is reinforced by its absence.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** **Updated and Refined.** My previous belief in refining search was too simplistic. This observation shows that targeted searches can fail. My query for \"Respondent's brief on the merits\" returned the BIO, likely due to keyword overlap. This indicates that search tools can be imprecise and that I must account for potential failures.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** **Updated.** My plan to get the next brief was correct, but the execution failed. Future action planning must include contingencies for information-gathering failures. If a direct query fails, the next plan should involve alternative methods (e.g., broader searches, different keywords, browsing the docket chronologically).\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** **Strongly Confirmed.** This failure proves the value of this heuristic. I correctly identified the most critical gap in my knowledge, and my inability to fill it has brought my predictive analysis to a halt, demonstrating its central importance.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition:** Confirmed.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors:** Confirmed. The case remains a battle between the petitioner's \"law/equity distinction\" anchor and the respondent's \"intertwined facts\" anchor.\n16. **The Battle of Historical Analogs:** Confirmed.\n17. **The \"Exception vs. Application\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n18. **Diagnosing Search Failures (New Principle):** A failed information-gathering action is not a null result; it is a valuable signal about the research process itself. When a search fails, I must perform a diagnostic check:\n    *   **Query Analysis:** Was the query too specific, too broad, or ambiguous?\n    *   **Tool Limitations:** Is the search tool matching keywords in a naive way? Are the filters being misapplied?\n    *   **Data Availability:** Is it possible the document is not yet available or indexed in the database?\n    *   This diagnostic step is crucial for designing a more effective follow-up action and avoiding repeated failures. This is a critical evolution from simply \"refining search\" to actively debugging the research process."

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Because he \nalleges that their retaliation included destroying his \nprison grievances and preventing him from utilizing \nthe grievance process, the question of whether he \nfailed to exhaust available administrative remedies \nis inextricably intertwined with the core merits of \nhis claim. This is a 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 claim for money \ndamages, so the Seventh Amendment clearly gives \nMr. Richards a right to jury trial on the merits of his \nclaims.  Nonetheless, the magistrate judge conducted \na bench trial, heard evidence from both sides, found \nas a fact that the testimony of Respondent and his \nco-plaintiffs was not credible, and recommended \ndismissal on the ground that they failed to exhaust \navailable \nprison \nremedies. \nThe \ndistrict \ncourt \naccepted that recommendation. \n \nThe Sixth Circuit correctly held that this process \nviolated \nthe \nSeventh \nAmendment, \ngiven \nthe \nsubstantial overlap between the factual disputes \nrelated to exhaustion and the actual merits of \nRichards\u2019 claims. In so doing, and as the petition \nexplains, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision created an \nacknowledged circuit split with the Seventh Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 (7th Cir. \n2008). The en banc Ninth Circuit has also endorsed \nthe relevant holding of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 \nF.3d 1162, 1171 (9th Cir. 2014) (en banc), though the \nSixth Circuit characterized the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nlanguage as dicta. Pet. App. 14a. On the other side of \n\n2 \n \n \nthe equation, several district courts in the Second \nCircuit have like, the Sixth Circuit, disagreed with \nPavey.  \n \nNonetheless, review of this shallow split would \nbe premature. The Sixth Circuit is clearly right\u2014\nand the Seventh and Ninth Circuits clearly wrong\u2014\non the Seventh Amendment question. Indeed, there \nare strong arguments that the Seventh Amendment \ndoes not permit judicial resolution of facts related to \nexhaustion \neven \nwhen \nthose \nfacts \nare \nnot \nintertwined with the merits. When the facts are \nintertwined, it is black-letter law that judges should \ndefer to juries even as to facts (like amount-in-\ncontroversy) that also bear on subject matter \njurisdiction. Several circuits that generally permit \njudge resolution of exhaustion questions have \nreserved decision on whether a different rule might \nbe necessary when those facts are intertwined with \nthe merits. There is every reason to expect that \nthose circuits will ultimately side with the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s cogent analysis in this case and reject the \nSeventh Circuit\u2019s puzzling and illogical Pavey \ndecision. Indeed the Seventh and Ninth Circuits may \nwell reconsider the question en banc without this \nCourt\u2019s intervention. \n \nThe petition argues at length that convening a \njury to decide factual disputes bearing on exhaustion \nof remedies would defeat Congress\u2019s intent to \nstreamline \nprisoner \nlitigation \nin \nthe \nPrison \nLitigation Reform Act (\u201cPLRA\u201d). It says time and \nagain that early bench trial resolution of exhaustion \nquestions is necessary to bar \u201cfrivolous claims at the \nearliest possible juncture.\u201d  Pet. at 2; see also id. at 9, \n16. But the PLRA\u2019s actual pre-screening provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A, notably does not provide for such \n\n3 \n \n \na procedure. The Sixth Circuit here also ruled that \nRichards\u2019 \u201cserious and detailed allegations cannot \nreasonably be considered frivolous,\u201d Pet. App. 8a, \nand observed that the defendant did \u201cnot directly \ncontest whether his alleged actions were motivated \nby Richards\u2019s protected conduct.\u201d  96 F.4th at 918\u2013\n19.  The petition challenges neither ruling.   \n \nThis Court has repeatedly rejected arguments \nlike these suggesting that the PLRA sets up \nexhaustion as some kind of special and jurisdictional \nprecondition to suit. See, e.g., Jones v. Bock, 549 U.S. \n199, 216 (2007) (\u201cfailure to exhaust is an affirmative \ndefense under the PLRA\u201d); see also Woodford v. Ngo, \n548 U.S. 81, 101 (2006) (concluding that \u201cthe PLRA \nexhaustion requirement is not jurisdictional\u201d). The \nproblem of intertwined exhaustion and merits \nfactual disputes also is presented only in a subset of \nPLRA cases.  And in any event the question is not \nwhether jury resolution of disputed facts can be \nsquared with a statute\u2019s purpose, but rather whether \nthat statute\u2019s application can be squared with the \nConstitution. As this Court has repeatedly made \nclear, questions about Congress\u2019s intent must take a \nback-seat to the historic role of the jury at common \nlaw. Yet Michigan would hand Congress the keys to \nthe car and strap the Seventh Amendment to the \nroof. This Court should decline that invitation. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n4 \n \n \nI. THE \nSIXTH \nCIRCUIT\u2019S \nDECISION \nIS \n \nCLEARLY CORRECT \n \nA. \nThe \nSixth \nCircuit \nCorrectly \nRecognized That Facts Intertwined \nWith The Merits Should Always Be \nDecided By Juries  \n \nThe petition argues that a factual dispute about \nexhaustion is just a \u201cthreshold issue to determine \nwhether \na \nprisoner \nhas \nmet \na \nprocedural \nrequirement to take his or her case to a jury,\u201d and \nthat therefore the Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated by analogy to other threshold issues like \nabstention and venue. Pet. 19. These arguments \nmirror Judge Posner\u2019s \u201cgeneralization\u201d in Pavey that \n\u201c[j]uries decide cases, not issues of judicial traffic \ncontrol.\u201d 544 F.3d at 741. But they bear little \nresemblance to an actual Seventh Amendment \nanalysis. \n \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedents, \u00a7 1983\u2014the \nfoundation of Richards\u2019s action\u2014is clearly analogous \nto causes of action that were \u201ctried at law at the time \nof the founding.\u201d Markman v. Westview Instruments, \nInc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996); City of Monterey v. Del \nMonte Dunes at Monterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 718 \n(1999). So the precise Seventh Amendment question \nis \u201cwhether the particular trial decision,\u201d a factual \ndispute about exhaustion that overlaps with the \nmerits, \u201cmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the \nsubstance of the common-law right as it existed in \n1791.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at 376. To figure that out, \n\u201cwe look to history to determine whether the \nparticular issues, or analogous ones, were decided by \njudge or by jury in suits at common law at the time \n\n5 \n \n \nthe Seventh Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte \nDunes, 526 U.S. at 718. And \u201cwhere history does not \nprovide a clear answer, we look to precedent and \nfunctional considerations.\u201d Id. \nThe Sixth Circuit rightly acknowledged that \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents \u201c\u2018many procedural \ndevices developed since 1791 that have diminished the \ncivil jury\u2019s historic domain,\u2019\u201d such as directed verdicts \nand summary judgment, \u201c\u2018have been found not to be \ninconsistent with the Seventh Amendment.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. \n16a-17a (quoting Parklane Hosiery Co., Inc. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 336 (1979)). But it then recognized the \nkey distinction between those devices and what \nhappened here: none of them \u201cpermit a judge to decide \ngenuine disputes of material fact at a preliminary \nstage of the case that would normally be reserved for \nthe jury.\u201d Pet. App. 17a. The magistrate judge\u2019s \nfactfinding in this case\u2014including explicit credibility \ndeterminations\u2014directly invaded the merits and \n\u201cstripped [Richards] of his \u2018right to a jury\u2019s resolution \nof the ultimate dispute.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 17a (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 377).  \nTo buttress the point, the Sixth Circuit cited its \nlongstanding holding that factual disputes about the \namount in controversy should be deferred to the jury \non the merits in diversity cases, even though that \nissue also has implications for subject matter \njurisdiction. See Pet. App. 17a-18a; Fireman\u2019s Fund \nInsurance Co v. Railway Express Agency, 253 F.2d \n780 (6th Cir. 1958). Because \u201cFireman\u2019s Fund \nrequires that certain cases be heard and determined \non the merits even when constitutionally implicated \njurisdictional disputes might procedurally terminate \nthe proceedings,\u201d the court explained, \u201cwe are all the \nmore convinced that the result should be the same \n\n6 \n \n \nwhen the lesser concern of an affirmative defense, \nsuch as the PLRA\u2019s requirement to exhaust \nadministrative remedies, implicates the merits of a \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. After all, \u201c[u]nlike exhaustion, \nan absence of subject-matter jurisdiction implicates \na federal court\u2019s ability to even hear the case.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a. Fireman\u2019s Fund also explains why its \nholding is not inconsistent with the general rule that \njudges ordinarily are allowed to hear evidence and to \ndetermine facts necessary to the court\u2019s jurisdiction: \n\u201csuch hearings usually involve factual issues \npertaining only to the question of jurisdiction, not \nincluding factual issues which would be decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784. \nThe petition criticizes the Sixth Circuit\u2019s reliance \non Fireman\u2019s Fund on the ground that \u201cthe case did \nnot discuss or rely on the Seventh Amendment.\u201d Pet. \n20. That is only superficially true. Fireman\u2019s Fund \nrelied on this Court\u2019s decision in Smithers v. Smith, \n204 U.S. 632 (1907), which similarly held that a \ndispute about amount in controversy should be \ndeferred to a jury trial when that issue is intertwined \nwith the merits. And Smithers clearly does rely on \nSeventh Amendment principles, at least in part. This \nCourt explained that judicial discretion to find \njurisdictional facts \u201cobviously is not unlimited, . . . lest \nunder the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits \nof the controversy between the parties be summarily \ndecided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, \nincluding the right to a jury.\u201d 204 U.S. at 645 \n(emphasis added). \u201cFor it must not be forgotten,\u201d this \nCourt wrote, \u201cthat where, in good faith, one has \nbrought into court a cause of action which, as stated \nby him, is clearly within its jurisdiction, he has the \nright to try its merits in the manner provided by the \n\n7 \n \n \nConstitution and law, and cannot be compelled to \nsubmit to a trial of another kind.\u201d Id. \nFireman\u2019s Fund also relied on this Court\u2019s \nopinion in Land v. Dollar, 330 U.S. 731 (1947), \nwhich considered a suit by a steamship company\u2019s \nstockholders against the U.S. Maritime Commission \nto recover stock previously given to the Commission. \nThis Court held that the district court erred in \ndeciding a jurisdictional sovereign immunity question, \nbecause \u201cthis is the type of case where the question of \njurisdiction is dependent on decision of the merits.\u201d \n330 U.S. at 735. \u201c[I]f the allegations of the petition \n[were] true, the shares of stock never were property of \nthe United States,\u201d so the district court had \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine its jurisdiction\u201d and should \ninstead have \u201cproceed[ed] to a decision on the merits.\u201d \nId. at 738\u201339. Land v. Dollar does not explicitly \ninvoke the right to jury trial, but the principles it \nrelied on are plainly intended to protect that right. \nIt is longstanding black letter law that \u201c[i]n a case \nin which there is a right to jury trial, a dismissal for \nlack of jurisdiction that improperly summarily decides \nthe substantive issues also violates the parties\u2019 \nSeventh Amendment rights.\u201d 8 Moore\u2019s Federal \nPractice \u00a7 38.34[1][c][i] (3d ed. 2009) (\u201cTrial on Merits \nRequired \nWhen \nJurisdictional \nDetermination \nDepends on Determination of Merits.\u201d).1 Factual \n                                                 \n1 See also 5C Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedure \n\u00a7 1350 (3d ed. 2004) (\u201cThe court may postpone a decision until \nevidence is submitted at trial if the jurisdictional issue is \nintertwined with the merits of the case.\u201d); Joshua S. Moskovitz, \nNote, The Usual Practice: Raising and Deciding Failure to \nExhaust Administrative Remedies as an Affirmative Defense \nunder the Prison Litigation Reform Act, 31 Cardozo L. Rev. 1859, \n1899 n.248 (2010) (Moskovitz) (collecting sources).  \n\n8 \n \n \nquestions bearing on both personal jurisdiction and \nvenue are also reserved for trial and submitted to the \njury when they are intertwined with the core merits of \nthe case.2 And in the related context of civil actions \npresenting both legal and equitable claims, this Court \nhas consistently held that the jury trial right cannot \n\u201cbe impaired by any blending with a claim, properly \ncognizable at law, of a demand for equitable relief in \naid of the legal action, or during its pendency.\u201d Scott v. \nNeely, 140 U.S. 106, 109\u201310 (1891); see also Ross v. \nBernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 537\u201338, 538 n.10 (1970) \n(\u201c[W]here equitable and legal claims are joined in the \nsame action, [the] right to jury trial on the legal \nclaims . . . must not be infringed.\u201d). \nThe rule that factual issues bearing on the merits \nmust always be decided by a jury has very deep roots. \nAt common law, defendants could dispute a plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration (i.e., complaint) by either demurrer or \nplea. John Jay McKelvey, Principles of Common-Law \nPleading \u00a7 93, at 68\u201369 (1894) (McKelvey). A \ndemurrer, like a modern-day 12(b)(6) or purely legal \n12(b)(1) motion, accepted the facts as alleged and \n\u201craise[d] a question of law for the determination of the \ncourt\u201d about the declaration\u2019s sufficiency. Benjamin J. \n                                                 \n2 See, e.g., Brown v. Slenker, 220 F.3d 411, 419 (5th Cir. 2000) \n(\u201c[Personal j]urisdiction remains intertwined with the merits, and \non remand both must be decided at a new trial, based on valid \njury findings.\u201d); Kierulff Assocs. v. Luria Bros. & Co., 240 F. Supp. \n640, 642 (S.D.N.Y. 1965) (\u201cWhere venue and the merits of an \naction are intertwined, it is often better to wait until trial where a \nfull presentation of the issue can be made, rather than rule \npreliminarily on a motion.\u201d); Fastener Corp. v. Spotnails, Inc., 291 \nF. Supp. 974, 976 (N.D. Ill. 1968) (\u201c[T]he venue question merge[d] \nwith the issue of infringement on the merits . . . .\u201d).  \n\n9 \n \n \nShipman, Handbook of Common-Law Pleading \u00a7\u00a7 8\u20139, \nat 28 (3d ed. 1923) (Shipman).  \nAs an alternative to the demurrer, there were \nvarious types of pleas. The plea in traverse denied the \ndeclaration\u2019s factual allegations and triggered a jury \ntrial. \u201cWhere an allegation is traversed, or denied, it is \nevident that a question is at once raised between the \nparties; and it is a question of fact . . . .\u201d Shipman \n\u00a7 167, at 302; see also Richard Ross Perry, Common-\nLaw Pleading: Its History and Principles 179\u201380 \n(1897) (Perry). \u201c[T]he tender and acceptance of an \nissue of fact close[d] all pleading in the action, as there \n[was] then nothing left but a trial, which [disposed] of \nthe action on its merits.\u201d Shipman \u00a7 15, at 32\u201333.  \nThe common law permitted various other types of \npleas\u2014such as a plea in abatement or plea in bar\u2014\nthat might raise legal or factual issues collateral to \nthe merits. But critically, if any such plea actually \ncontradicted the factual allegations of the plaintiff\u2019s \ndeclaration, the common law would have regarded it \nas a traverse and proceeded immediately to a trial by \njury. \u201cThe word traverse . . . is synonymous with the \nword denial. Where the defendant intends to rely for \nhis defense upon the fact that the allegations \ncontained in the declaration as to the subject matter of \nthe action are untrue, he must put in the plea known \nas a traverse.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 185, at 118; see also Perry, \nat 275. Therefore in a case (like this one) where the \nfacts relevant to a threshold defect were intertwined \nwith the merits, it would not even have been possible \nto frame the issue for a purely judicial decision at \ncommon law. \nThe petition argues that a bench trial before a \nmagistrate judge gave Mr. Richards many of the other \nimportant protections of a trial, such as a right to \n\n10 \n \n \npresent \nevidence \nand \ncross \nexamine \nopposing \nwitnesses. Pet. 20-21. No doubt those rights are \nimportant. But the right to trial by jury in civil cases \nis separately and specially protected by the Seventh \nAmendment. This Court recently recognized that \n\u201cthe right to trial by jury is \u2018of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and \njurisprudence that any seeming curtailment of the \nright has always been and \u2018should be scrutinized \nwith the utmost case.\u2019\u201d SEC v. Jarkesy, Slip Op. at 7 \n(2024) (quoting Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 \n(1935)). And that is by no means a newfound \nsentiment: Justice Story once explained that the civil \njury trial right is \u201cjustly dear to the American \npeople. It has always been an object of deep interest \nand solicitude, and every encroachment upon it has \nbeen watched with great jealousy.\u201d Parsons v. \nBedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 U.S. 433, 466 \n(1830). The Sixth Circuit\u2019s decision is entirely \nconsistent with that tradition. \n \n \nB. \nThe Seventh Circuit\u2019s Decision In \n \nPavey Makes No Sense  \nThe Seventh and Ninth Circuit decisions, by \ncontrast, do not genuinely grapple with the Seventh \nAmendment problem and clearly get the answer \nwrong.  \nJudge Posner\u2019s opinion in Pavey takes for \ngranted that questions of subject matter jurisdiction \n\u201coften . . . turn[] on factual issues that may be \ngenuinely debatable, but even if so the issues are \nresolved by the judge,\u201d without recognizing that an \nopposite rule applies when jurisdictional facts are \nintertwined with the merits. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nThe Pavey opinion then leaps from the observation \n\n11 \n \n \nthat judges sometimes are permitted to decide \nquestions of fact relevant to preliminary threshold \nissues to an entirely unwarranted \u201cgeneralization\u201d \nthat juries do not decide any questions that can be \ncharacterized as matters of \u201cjudicial traffic control.\u201d \nId.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, Pavey wrongly \ncharacterizes exhaustion as just an issue of \u201cjudicial \ntraffic control\u201d on the naked assertion that \u201cin many \ncases\u201d exhaustion is simply a question of the choice \nof forum because \u201cthe only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder.\u201d Id. \u201cThat \ndistinguishes the issue of exhaustion from deadline \nissues that juries decide,\u201d the Seventh Circuit \nreasoned, because \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense \nif successfully interposed ends the litigation rather \nthan shunting it to another forum.\u201d The Seventh \nCircuit acknowledged, however, that in that actual \ncase the defendant \u201cwould no longer have any \nadministrative remedies\u201d if the exhaustion issue was \nresolved against him, so the issue was entirely \ndispositive of the merits. Id. Surely this Court \nunderstands that that will almost always be true in \nPLRA cases. Prisons have grievance and appeal \nprocesses with extremely tight filing windows\u2014\nmeasured in days. By the time an exhaustion issue \nis raised in federal court, those deadlines will \ngenerally be years in the past and will make it \nimpossible for the plaintiff to go back and seek \nfurther exhaustion. See Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting \nfor Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA Exhaustion Law, \n21 George Mason L. Rev. 573, 584 (2014) (\u201cIn the \nlast few years, many corrections departments have \nalso reduced the amount of time within which a \n\n12 \n \n \nprisoner must file her initial grievance and any \nsubsequent appeals.  In the light of the deference \nshown to [these internal] rules in the PLRA \nexhaustion analysis, this reduction means that for \nprisoners in some systems there is effectively only a \ntwo- or three-day statute of limitations on their \nconstitutional claims.\u201d) (footnotes omitted).   \nFinally, the Seventh Circuit reasoned that, \u201c[b]y \nanalogy to the cases that require that claims at law \nbe decided before equitable claims when both types \nof claim are presented,\u201d a jury later hearing the case \non the merits would not be bound by any exhaustion \nfindings the judge made. Id. at 742. But as the Sixth \nCircuit correctly explained, that line of reasoning \n\u201crings hollow\u201d because \u201cif the prisoner\u2019s case is \ndismissed for failure to exhaust his or her \nadministrative remedies\u201d then \u201ca jury would never \nbe assembled to resolve the factual disputes\u201d on the \nmerits. Pet. App. 15a. \nIn Albino v. Baca, the en banc Ninth Circuit \nappeared to embrace Pavey, with the court noting \nthat \u201c[w]e agree with the Seventh Circuit that, if a \nfactual finding on a disputed question is relevant \nboth to exhaustion and to the merits, a judge\u2019s \nfinding made in the course of deciding exhaustion is \nnot binding on a jury deciding the merits of the suit.\u201d \n747 F.3d at 1171. But the claims at issue in Albino \ndid not actually implicate the underlying merits, and \nelsewhere in its opinion the Ninth Circuit used less \ndefinitive language:  \u201cExhaustion should be decided, \nif feasible, before reaching the merits of a prisoner's \nclaim.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added); see also id. (\u201cWe \nreiterate that, if feasible, disputed factual questions \nrelevant to exhaustion should be decided at the very \nbeginning of the litigation.\u201d). Now that the Sixth \n\n13 \n \n \nCircuit has explained the flaws in the Seventh \nCircuit\u2019s reasoning it seems unlikely that other \ncircuits will follow along. Indeed, there is reason to \nhope that the Seventh and Ninth Circuits will \nreconsider their position en banc without a need for \nthis Court\u2019s intervention.  \nThis \nCourt \nalso \nmay \nbenefit \nfrom \nmore \npercolation. Among the courts of appeals, only the \nSixth and Seventh Circuits have addressed the issue \npresented head-on. Several district courts in the \nSecond Circuit have parted ways with Pavey. Other \ncircuits have identified the problem as well and will \nalmost certainly in due course wrestle with it more \nfully. See Small v. Camden County, 728 F.3d 265, \n270 (3d Cir. 2013) (\u201c[T]he Seventh Amendment is not \nimplicated as long as the facts are not bound up with \nthe merits of the underlying dispute.\u201d); Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d Cir. 2011) (\u201c[T]he \nfactual disputes relating to exhaustion are not \nintertwined with the merits . . . .\u201d); Dillon v. Rogers, \n596 F.3d 260, 272 n.2 (5th Cir. 2010) (\u201cWe do not \ndetermine today who should serve as factfinder \nwhen facts concerning exhaustion also go to the \nmerits of a prisoner\u2019s claim.\u201d). And, given the \nfavorable decision in the Sixth Circuit, prisoners will \nbe more likely to raise the issue going forward. \n \nC. \nExhaustion \nFacts \nShould \nBe \nDecided By Juries Even When They \nAre Not Intertwined With The \nMerits \n \nThe Sixth Circuit decided this case against the \nbackdrop of its own precedent holding that facts \nrelated to exhaustion can be resolved by judges when \n\n14 \n \n \nthey are not intertwined with the merits. That \nassumption is widely shared by the lower courts. \nAlthough it is not necessary to reach the issue in this \ncase, the Court should understand that that \nassumption is probably wrong. The reason goes back \nto the issue the Seventh Circuit failed to wrestle \nwith in Pavey: that a finding of non-exhaustion in \nthe PLRA context will almost always bar the claim \nforever. \nRecall that at common law a defendant who \ncould not or chose not to demur could either file a \ntraverse or a plea. There were a variety of pleas, but \nthe most common were \u201cpleas in abatement\u201d and \n\u201cpleas in bar.\u201d The plea in abatement was one of the \n\u201cdilatory pleas,\u201d which raised a class of common law \ndefenses that merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d \nGeorge L. Clark, Common Law Pleading \u00a7 59, at 131 \n(1931) (Clark); McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93 (\u201cJudgment \nupon the dilatory plea was not final, . . . it did not \ndetermine the case upon the merits.\u201d).3 A plea in \nabatement, if successful, \u201cdispose[d] of the particular \nsuit\u201d but allowed the plaintiff to \u201ccommence anew \nupon the same cause of action in the same court\u201d so \nlong as the plaintiff avoided the mistake that caused \nthe original abating. McKelvey \u00a7 131, at 92. Typically, \na plea in abatement related to the parties\u2019 identities, a \nmisnomer in the declaration of facts, or a defect in the \n                                                 \n3 The other dilatory pleas were pleas to the jurisdiction and pleas \nin suspension of the action. Clark \u00a7 59, at 132. Pleas to the \njurisdiction attacked a court\u2019s subject matter or personal \njurisdiction, disposing of the case entirely before that court if \nsuccessful. McKelvey \u00a7\u00a7 131, 134, at 92, 95. Pleas in suspension of \nthe action sought to identify the plaintiff\u2019s temporary incapacity \nto bring suit. Id. \u00a7 131, at 92; Clark \u00a7 60, at 134; Shipman \u00a7 230, \nat 400. \n\n15 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s writ. Id. \u00a7\u00a7 134\u2013135, at 95; Moskovitz, at \n1885. Defects in the plaintiff\u2019s writ included \u201cwrong \nvenue,\u201d that the \u201caction was brought prematurely,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe same claim was pending in another court,\u201d \nthat \u201cthe parties were misnamed,\u201d or that \u201ca \nnecessary party was not joined or . . . was misjoined.\u201d \nMoskovitz, at 1885.  \nMany lower courts have broadly analogized \nexhaustion of administrative remedies to the old \nplea in abatement, and held that there is no Seventh \nAmendment right to jury factfinding because \nsupposedly factual disputes relevant to a plea in \nabatement were resolved by judges. See, e.g., Bryant \nv. Rich, 530 F.3d 1368, 1374 (11th Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cExhaustion of administrative remedies is a matter \nin abatement, and ordinarily does not deal with the \nmerits.\u201d (cleaned up) (quoting 5C Wright & Miller \n\u00a7 1360, at 78 n.15)); Albino, 747 F.3d at 1168. That \nassumption is actually disputed by scholars.4 \nRegardless, the analogy is wrong. The dilatory pleas \n(including abatement) \u201cdid not determine the case \nupon the merits.\u201d McKelvey \u00a7 132, at 93. A plea in \nabatement merely \u201cdelay[ed] the plaintiff\u2019s action \ninstead of dealing with the merits of his claim.\u201d Clark \n\u00a7 59, at 131. By definition, therefore, a plea in \nabatement could not present an argument that the \n                                                 \n4 Pleas in abatement typically tendered an issue of law properly \n\u201celiminated on demurrer\u201d by the judge. A.C. Umbreit, Outline \nof the Law of Common Law Pleading, 4 Marq. L. Rev. 130, 133 \n(1920). But if the plaintiff did not demur, \u201c[t]here is extensive \nhistorical support that a factual dispute on a matter in \nabatement \n[could \nalso \nbe] \ndecided \nby \nthe \njury . . . as \ndocumented in civil cases, in criminal cases, and in numerous \ntreatises.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1896 & nn.234\u201336 (collecting sources \nsupporting jury resolution of fact disputes posed by various \ndilatory pleas). \n\n16 \n \n \nplaintiff\u2019s claim was permanently barred. Matters in \nabatement \u201ccould only go so far as to defeat the \npresent action, and not to demonstrate that the \nplaintiff was permanently disabled from bringing the \nclaim.\u201d Moskovitz, at 1886. Any plea in abatement \nbased on a prematurity defect necessarily alleged that \nthe action was curably premature. See, e.g., Shipman \n\u00a7 225, at 390 n.18 (citing Grand Lodge Bhd. of R.R. \nTrainmen v. Randolph, 57 N.E. 882 (1900), as an \nexample of a plea in abatement alleging \u201cfailure to \nexhaust remedies provided in [a] contract\u201d). Again, \nhowever, in most PLRA cases the very short prison \ngrievance timelines will have expired long before suit \nso a finding of non-exhaustion will permanently bar \nthe claim. \nIn common law terms, an affirmative defense that \nwould permanently end the litigation would have been \nraised by a \u201cplea in bar,\u201d and specifically a variant \ncalled a plea \u201cin discharge.\u201d Pleas in bar could be pled \nnegatively, as a traverse denying the factual \nallegations, or affirmatively, as a confession and \navoidance admitting the facts but denying their legal \neffect by alleging new facts. Shipman \u00a7 197\u2013199, at \n348. Pleas in confession and avoidance were divided \ninto two categories: pleas in justification or excuse and \npleas in discharge. Id. Pleas in discharge included \nbankruptcy, release, payment, and the statute of \nlimitations\u2014all of which alleged that the plaintiff\u2019s \ncause of action had \u201cbeen discharged by some matter \nsubsequent, either of fact or of law.\u201d Id \u00a7 198(b), at \n348; id. \u00a7 199, at 350; cf. Fed. R. Civ. P. 8(c)(1). \nLike a statute of limitations issue, an exhaustion \ndefect arises after a \u00a7 1983 claim accrues and \ntherefore is more analogous to a matter in discharge \nthan in abatement. And a judge would never have \n\n17 \n \n \ndecided disputed facts posed by a plea in discharge. If \nthe plea contained a traverse disputing the plaintiff\u2019s \nfacts, the issue was joined and a jury trial was \ntriggered. If the plea was instead framed as a \nconfession and avoidance, then the ball was in the \nplaintiff\u2019s court. See Perry, at 179\u201380, 272\u201373. The \nplaintiff could respond with his own demurrer, \naccepting the new facts alleged in avoidance but \ndenying their legal effect, which would frame up an \nissue of law for the judge. Id. Or the plaintiff could \nrespond with a traverse to the plea, joining issue on \nthe merits and triggering a trial. See id. There were \nsome other ways to procure judicial decision of a true \nquestion of law, such as the arcane concept of \u201cexpress \ncolor\u201d in trespass actions.5 As far as counsel can \ndetermine, however, a defendant could never procure \njudicial resolution of disputed facts relevant to a \ndispositive affirmative defense like exhaustion. \n \nII.  \nTHE \nPETITION \nOVERSTATES \nTHE \nSUPPOSED \nCONFLICT \nWITH \nTHE \nPLRA\u2019S PURPOSES, WHICH DO NOT \nTRUMP THE SEVENTH AMENDMENT \nIN ANY EVENT \n \nThe Seventh Circuit justified its distortion of \ntraditional jury trial principles because it thought \n\u201c[t]he alternative . . . is unsatisfactory\u201d and \u201cwould \nthwart Congress\u2019s effort to bar trials of prisoner \n                                                 \n5 See Shipman \u00a7\u00a7 200\u2013202, at 350\u201355; Perry, at 274\u201376. Even \nthen, if the issue of law was not \u201cwholly foreign to the merits of \nthe cause,\u201d Shipman \u00a7 202, at 354\u201355, and could not be \n\u201csegregate[d] . . . from the remaining matters of fact,\u201d Perry, at \n275, then the defendant could not withdraw the matter from the \njury.  \n\n18 \n \n \ncases in which the prisoner has failed to exhaust his \nadministrative remedies.\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742. \nThe petition doubles down on that position, devoting \nbarrels of ink to arguing that Congress intended to \nmake exhaustion a \u201cthreshold issue[] of judicial \nadministration,\u201d Pet. 17 (quoting Lee v. Willey, 789 \nF.3d 673, 678 (6th Cir. 2015)), to weed out frivolous \nclaims. The petition notably ignores the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s conclusion that Richards\u2019s allegations were \n\u201cserious and detailed\u201d and could not \u201creasonably be \nconsidered frivolous.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Instead, the \npetition elects to criticizes the Sixth Circuit for \n\u201cfail[ing] \nto \ngive \ndeference\u201d \nin \nits \nSeventh \nAmendment \nanalysis \nto \nCongress\u2019s \nsupposed \nobjectives, Pet. 20. \nAll of this is both irrelevant and overstated. It is \nirrelevant because Congress\u2019s desire to reduce the \nworkload of the federal courts does not give it a free \npass to violate the Bill of Rights. If the Seventh \nAmendment protects a right to jury resolution of all \nfacts intertwined with the merits of a legal claim \n(and it does) then the Seventh Amendment controls. \nCongress has ample tools to address this perceived \nproblem without violating the jury trial right, and it \nhas used them\u2014aggressively.  \nThese concerns are overstated for a couple of \nreasons. First, in Woodford and Jones this Court has \nalready rejected the once-pervasive arguments and \nholdings that PLRA exhaustion is a jurisdictional or \nquasi-jurisdictional right not to face litigation at all, \nwhich necessarily must be resolved before anything \nelse happens in a case. Prior to Woodford and Jones, \nthe lower courts invented procedural vehicles found \nnowhere \nin \nthe \nFederal \nRules, \nsuch \nas \nthe \n\u201cunenumerated 12(b) motion,\u201d Wyatt v. Terhune, 315 \n\n19 \n \n \nF.3d 1108 (9th Cir. 2003); requiring prisoner plaintiffs \nto plead exhaustion with specificity up front; or \ndismissing entire complaints if any claim was not \nexhausted. See Jones, 549 U.S. at 203 (holding that \nthese innovations \u201cexceed[ed] the proper limits on the \njudicial role\u201d). But this Court held that exhaustion is \nan ordinary affirmative defense. See id. at 212-214. \nAffirmative defenses (all of them) must be raised by \nanswer under Rule 8(c), which places the burden of \nproof on the defendant and leaves the question to be \nresolved in the ordinary course through summary \njudgment or trial. No doubt the lower courts find those \nholdings inconvenient (or \u201cunsatisfactory,\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 742), but they represent this Court\u2019s \nconclusion that in fact Congress did not intend to \nmake exhaustion of administrative remedies some \nkind of threshold super-requirement. When it wants \nto, Congress knows how to write jurisdictional \nstatutes, or immunity statutes like the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act, which create a vehicle for \nthreshold resolution of some important issue before \nanything else happens. It did not take that course in \nthe PLRA, and this Court has already said so. See id. \nat 216 (noting the conspicuous \u201cfailure of Congress to \ninclude exhaustion in terms among the enumerated \ngrounds justifying dismissal upon early screening\u201d). \nSecond, the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding is narrow and \nthere is no reason to think it will have a dramatic \nimpact on prisoner litigation. The Sixth Circuit \n\u201cemphasize[d] that a jury trial is appropriate in \nthese circumstances only if the district court finds \nthat genuine disputes of material fact concerning \nPLRA exhaustion are decisive of the merits of the \nplaintiff\u2019s claim.\u201d Pet. App. 19a. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). The petition argues that every \n\n20 \n \n \nprisoner suit will somehow allege exhaustion facts \nintertwined with the merits, but the ordinary rules \nof civil procedure are up to that challenge\u2014and if \nnot this Court has, \u201c[i]n a series of recent cases, . . . \nexplained that courts should generally not depart \nfrom the usual practice under the Federal Rules on \nthe basis of perceived policy concerns.\u201d See id. at \n212. The Sixth Circuit\u2019s rule has already been \napplied in district courts throughout the Second \nCircuit for more than a decade without issue. See \nPet. App. 15a-16a.  \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nThe petition should be denied.  \n \n \n \n \n \nJ.

The reflection, however, sharpens my understanding of my own uncertainty and confirms the critical nature of the missing information.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The case asks whether the Seventh Amendment's right to a jury trial applies to disputes over the exhaustion of administrative remedies under the Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA) when the factual dispute about exhaustion is intertwined with the merits of the prisoner's underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. Perttu's merits brief presents a formidable argument that PLRA exhaustion is a \"threshold\" issue analogous to a **historical equitable defense**. This framing is designed to place the issue within the purview of a judge, thereby circumventing the Seventh Amendment's jury trial right, which historically applied to actions at law, not equity. This is a sophisticated originalist/textualist argument that directly targets the core of the respondent's likely position.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** Stable, but critically incomplete and my desire for the missing information is heightened. Based on the Brief in Opposition, Richards will argue for a direct application of the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine, which holds that when legal and equitable claims share a common factual issue, the jury right for the legal claim must be preserved. The historical analog for this is a \"plea in traverse,\" a factual denial that would have been decided by a jury. The central, unanswered question is how Richards will counter Perttu's powerful \"equitable defense\" framing from the merits brief.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** Stable. The case remains a **genuine 50/50 toss-up**, a direct confrontation between two competing legal frameworks. My predictive model is stalled pending the acquisition of the Respondent's Brief on the Merits. This document is the single most important variable needed to update my belief state.\n    *   **Historical Analogs:** Petitioner's \"equitable defense\" (judge) vs. Respondent's \"plea in traverse\" (jury).\n    *   **Procedural Frameworks:** Petitioner's \"threshold, logically precedent issue\" (no jury right) vs. Respondent's \"intertwined facts\" doctrine (jury right applies).\n    *   **Source of Uncertainty:** This internal reflection confirms that my inability to resolve the tension between these frameworks is due entirely to the missing dialectical counter-argument. Without the Respondent's Merits Brief, I cannot assess the resilience of the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine against the petitioner's specific constitutional attack.",

This reinforces that the value of each brief is magnified when it can be read in response to the preceding one.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** Confirmed.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** **Updated and Evolved.** This principle has evolved from a general heuristic to a specific, diagnostic process.\n    *   *Previous State:* Acknowledged that targeted searches can fail and require refinement.\n    *   *Current State:* I have now diagnosed a specific failure mode: keyword ambiguity between cert-stage (\"Brief in Opposition\") and merits-stage (\"Brief for Respondent\") documents due to fuzzy matching by the search tool. The refinement is now a concrete tactic: search for the precise, standard title of the desired document (e.g., \"brief for respondent\") to eliminate this ambiguity.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** **Updated.** My planning now incorporates the output of the diagnostic process. The next action is not just \"try again\" but a targeted attempt designed to fix the specific, identified flaw in the previous attempt.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** **Strongly Confirmed.** This reflection is a case study in the importance of this heuristic. The entire thought process revolves around the \"argumentative gap\" (the missing brief) and how the inability to fill it has halted all analytical progress.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition:** Confirmed.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors:** Confirmed.\n16. **The Battle of Historical Analogs:** Confirmed.\n17. **The \"Exception vs. Application\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n18. **Diagnosing Search Failures:** **Confirmed and Applied.** This observation is a practical application of this principle. The internal monologue is a perfect example of performing the diagnostic check:\n    *   **Query Analysis:** The thought identifies that the query was not specific enough.\n    *   **Tool Limitations:** The thought hypothesizes that \"fuzzy matching\" is the likely culprit.\n    *   This successful self-correction validates the principle's utility and embeds it as a core component of my information-gathering loop, especially following a failed action."

The case remains centered on whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for PLRA exhaustion disputes when the facts of exhaustion are intertwined with the merits of the underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. Perttu's argument, detailed in his merits brief, hinges on framing PLRA exhaustion as a modern analog to a **historical equitable defense**. This is a sophisticated textualist/originalist move designed to place the question before a judge, thereby sidestepping the Seventh Amendment's application to suits at law.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** My understanding here is both deepened and frustrated. I still lack the crucial Merits Brief. However, the re-surfacing of the Brief in Opposition (BIO) in my search provides a high-fidelity look at the bedrock of Richards's case, which I can now detail more thoroughly.\n    *   **Foundational Argument (from BIO):** The core argument is that when a procedural/jurisdictional fact-finding (like exhaustion) is \"inextricably intertwined\" with the merits of a claim at law (like a \u00a7 1983 suit), the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial for the merits claim must be preserved.\n    *   **Doctrinal Anchors (from BIO):** The argument is anchored in precedent like *Smithers v. Smith* and *Land v. Dollar*, which held that a court cannot \"under the guise of determining jurisdiction, the merits of the controversy between the parties be summarily decided without the ordinary incidents of a trial, including the right to a jury.\" This principle is extended from jurisdictional questions to the affirmative defense of exhaustion.\n    *   **Historical Analog (from BIO):** The BIO confirms that the direct counter-argument to Perttu's \"equitable defense\" is the **\"plea in traverse.\"** At common law, a factual denial of the plaintiff's complaint was a traverse, which automatically triggered a jury trial. The BIO argues that because Richards's claim (that Perttu prevented him from exhausting remedies) is a factual denial of Perttu's defense (that Richards failed to exhaust), it is analogous to a traverse and must be decided by a jury. The BIO cites numerous common-law pleading treatises (McKelvey, Shipman, Perry) to support this.\n    *   **Pragmatic/Policy Argument (from BIO):** Richards forcefully rejects the *Pavey* court's \"judicial traffic control\" analogy, arguing that for most prisoners with short administrative deadlines, a dismissal for failure to exhaust is a final, dispositive end to their case, not a mere \"shunting\" to another forum.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** Stable, but the tension is now palpable. The predictive state remains a **genuine 50/50 toss-up**, but my understanding of the contours of that conflict is sharper. The battle is clearly defined:\n    *   **Historical Analogs:** Petitioner's \"equitable defense\" (judge) vs. Respondent's \"plea in traverse\" (jury).\n    *   **Procedural Frameworks:** Petitioner's \"threshold, logically precedent issue\" (judge) vs. Respondent's \"intertwined facts doctrine\" (jury).\n    *   **Constitutional Interpretation:** Petitioner's focus on the PLRA's statutory efficiency goals vs. Respondent's argument that the Seventh Amendment's protections cannot be subordinated to a statute's purpose.\n    *   **Source of Uncertainty:** The continued absence of the Respondent's Merits Brief is the sole factor preventing an updated prediction. I have a robust model of the Respondent's foundational arguments but no information on how they have been adapted or strengthened to counter the specific \"equitable defense\" argument from Perttu's Merits Brief.

It forces a critical re-evaluation of my tools and tactics.\n\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** **Strongly Confirmed.** This repeated failure underscores the principle's importance. My analysis is paralyzed precisely because I cannot complete the dialectical sequence (Petition -> Opposition -> Petitioner Merits -> Respondent Merits).\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** **Updated/Evolved.** The principle remains valid, but this failure introduces a crucial corollary: When the most valuable primary source is inaccessible after repeated, targeted attempts, the strategy must pivot to the next-best sources. This could include other primary sources that analyze the missing document (e.g., Amicus Briefs) rather than continuing a futile direct search.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed. The low search score (0.519) and the filename (\"...Brief20in20Opp.json\") were immediate signals that the search tool had returned an incorrect result, allowing for a rapid diagnosis of the action's failure.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** **Updated and Evolved.** This principle has undergone a significant evolution through failure.\n    *   *State 1:* Acknowledged that searches can fail.\n    *   *State 2:* Diagnosed a specific failure mode (keyword ambiguity) and formulated a specific solution (using precise field filters).\n    *   *Current State:* The specific solution has now failed, proving the initial diagnosis was incomplete. The problem is not just the query but a fundamental limitation or bias in the search tool itself, which seems to prioritize returning a poor match over returning no match. The strategy must now evolve beyond query refinement to include tool-switching or target-switching.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** **Updated.** My planning must now account for tool unreliability.\n    *   *Previous Plan:* Fix the query to get the target document.\n    *   *Current Plan:* The current search tool/method is unreliable for this target. The next action must be a strategic pivot: either search for the document using a different method or search for a different *type* of document (like Amicus briefs) that will provide information about the target document.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed. This now becomes a more prominent, actionable principle as a potential next step.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** **Strongly Confirmed.** The frustration and analytical paralysis caused by this gap confirms that identifying and filling it is the highest-priority meta-strategy.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition:** Confirmed. Even when returned in error, the BIO provided a valuable, high-resolution reinforcement of the respondent's core legal theory.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors:** Confirmed.\n16. **The Battle of Historical Analogs:** Confirmed. The BIO's detailed discussion of common-law pleading solidifies this as the intellectual core of the case.\n17. **The \"Exception vs. Application\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n18. **Diagnosing Search Failures:** Confirmed and Applied. This principle worked perfectly, allowing me to immediately recognize the search had failed by comparing the result (BIO) to the query's intent (Merits Brief). This leads to the creation of a new, related principle.\n19. **NEW - Tool Skepticism and Verification:** I must treat my information-gathering tools as fallible. A \"successful\" action (one that returns a result) is not necessarily a *correct* one. I must always verify that the returned artifact matches the intent of the query.\n20. **NEW - Information Scent and Pivoting:** When multiple, increasingly refined attempts to find a specific piece of information fail, the \"information scent\" has gone cold. This is a strong signal to stop that line of inquiry and pivot the entire strategy\u2014for example, from seeking Document X to seeking documents *about* Document X."

VII .............................................. 3 \n\n1 \n \n \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Cato Institute is a nonpartisan public policy \nresearch foundation founded in 1977 and dedicated to \nadvancing the principles of individual liberty, free \nmarkets, and limited government. Cato\u2019s Robert A. \nLevy Center for Constitutional Studies was estab-\nlished in 1989 to promote the Constitution and its \nprinciples, which are the foundation of liberty. Toward \nthose ends, Cato publishes books and studies, conducts \nconferences, produces the annual Cato Supreme Court \nReview, and files amicus briefs.  \nThis case interests Cato because the constitutional \nright to a civil jury trial is fundamental to American \nliberty.  \n \n \n \n1 Rule 37 statement: No part of this brief was authored by any \nparty\u2019s counsel, and no person or entity other than amicus \nfunded its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \nBACKGROUND AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nCongress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n(\u201cPLRA\u201d) in 1995 to \u201creduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 524\u201325 (2002). PLRA provides that \u201c[n]o action \nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions un-\nder [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a \nprisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative remedies as \nare available are exhausted.\u201d2  \nRespondent Kyle Richards, a prisoner, filed a \n\u00a7 1983 lawsuit alleging that Petitioner Thomas Perttu, \na correctional officer, committed sexual misconduct \nagainst him and other inmates\u2014then threatened \nRichards and destroyed the grievances he sought to \nfile in order to exhaust his administrative remedies. \nJ.A. 14\u201315.  \nWithout putting the issue to a jury, the district \ncourt determined that Richards had failed to exhaust \nhis administrative remedies and dismissed his suit. \nPet. App\u2019x 22a\u201328a. The Sixth Circuit reversed, hold-\ning that Richards is entitled to a jury trial on the issue \nof exhaustion. Id. 19a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding was correct. The Con-\nstitution assigns to juries, not judges, responsibility \nfor resolving disputed facts in criminal cases and civil \ncases involving common-law causes of action\u2014such as \ndamages claims against public officials. No less than \nother citizens, PLRA litigants are thus entitled to have \ndisputes decided by the constitutionally appointed \n \n2 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).  \n\n3 \n \n \nfact-finder, particularly in cases where the issue of ex-\nhaustion is inextricably intertwined with the underly-\ning merits. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE RIGHT TO A CIVIL JURY TRIAL IS \nESSENTIAL TO LIBERTY. \nThe Seventh Amendment provides: \nIn Suits at common law, where the value \nin controversy shall exceed twenty dol-\nlars, the right of trial by jury shall be pre-\nserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall \nbe otherwise re-examined in any Court of \nthe United States, than according to the \nrules of the common law. \nU.S. CONST. amend. VII.  \nThe right to a jury trial long pre-dates the Amend-\nment\u2019s adoption in 1791. \u201cLegal writers and political \ntheorists who were widely read by the colonists were \nfirmly of the opinion that trial by jury in civil cases was \nan important right of freemen.\u201d3 William Blackstone \nsaid the jury trial was \u201cthe glory of the English law,\u201d \npossessed of \u201cso great an advantage over others in reg-\nulating civil property.\u201d4 \nThe Framers understood this right to be rooted in \nMagna Carta and a vital check on state power.5 \n \n3 Charles W.

British colonial authorities would try ship-\ncondemnation cases in vice-admiralty courts without \nthe benefit of a jury, then rely on judgments procured \nthere to preclude recovery of damages at civil jury tri-\nals.12 Colonists specifically protested the practice of \ntrying wage cases involving shipwrights and shipyard \nlaborers in jury-free vice-admiralty courts.13 The \nStamp Act was also originally enforced via suits in the \nvice-admiralty courts.14 George Mason thus con-\ndemned the British for having \u201cdepriv[ed] us of the an-\ncient Tryal, by a Jury of our Equals, and substituting \nin its[] place an arbitrary Civil Law Court.\u201d15  \nColonists perceived a further threat to jury trials in \nthe Quebec Act, which is sometimes considered one of \nthe \u201cIntolerable Acts\u201d triggering the American Revolu-\ntion.

Bed-\nford, 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 433, 446 (1830) (\u201cOne of the strongest objec-\ntions originally taken against the Constitution of the United \nStates, was the want of an express provision securing the right of \ntrial by jury in civil cases.\u201d).  \n19 Wolfram, supra, at 660 n.59, 667.  \n20 Id. at 670\u201371. \n21 Id. at 671; see also id. at 708 (\u201cAnother important function of \nthe civil jury . . . was to provide the common citizen with a sym-\npathetic forum in suits against the government.\u201d). \n\n7 \n \n \nthe federal courts would likely be \u2018ready to protect the \nofficers of government against the weak and helpless \ncitizens[.]\u2019\u201d22 \nAntifederalist concern became so intense that Alex-\nander Hamilton dedicated the Federalist No. 83 to as-\nsuring readers that \u201c[t]he friends and adversaries of \nthe plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing \nelse, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial \nby jury.\u201d23 Of course, the Constitution\u2019s Framers re-\nsponded with crucial reassurance of their own\u2014the \nSeventh Amendment. \nThis Court\u2019s precedents have continued to recog-\nnize civil jury trials\u2019 importance. Justice Rehnquist \nnoted how the Founders \u201cconsidered the right of trial \nby jury in civil cases an important bulwark against tyr-\nanny and corruption, a safeguard too precious to be left \nto the whim of the sovereign, or, it might be added, to \nthat of the judiciary.\u201d24 Last year, in SEC v. Jarkesy, \nJustice Gorsuch emphasized that despite \u201cits weak-\nnesses and the potential for misuse, we continue to in-\nsist that [the jury trial] be jealously preserved.\u201d25 \nThe Seventh Amendment was adopted both to ex-\npose official government actions to the scrutiny of or-\ndinary citizens and to ensure that they, not \n \n22 Id.

FACTUAL ISSUES REGARDING EXHAUSTION \nSHOULD BE TRIED BY A JURY. \nA. Prison officials can easily abuse the \nexhaustion requirement. \nAllowing factual questions regarding PLRA\u2019s ex-\nhaustion requirement to be tried by a judge would \nfrustrate the purpose and design of the Seventh \nAmendment. Prisoners bringing \u00a7 1983 claims are or-\ndinarily entitled to a jury trial on the merits. But \nPLRA requires prisoners to first exhaust available ad-\nministrative remedies. Such remedies are deemed un-\navailable as a matter of law when \u201cprison administra-\ntors thwart inmates from taking advantage of a griev-\nance process through machination, misrepresentation, \nor intimidation.\u201d Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 644 \n(2016). Factual disputes regarding whether adminis-\ntrative remedies were or were not encumbered, as ex-\nist in this case, should be tried by a jury.  \nUnder PLRA, prison facilities are charged with de-\nsigning and implementing their own internal griev-\nance processes, which presents the self-evident moral \nhazard of officials designing and using those proce-\ndures to hamper prisoners\u2019 ability to assert claims \nagainst them.26 One such ruse is transferring sexual \nassault victims into isolation\u2014or, as Richards alleged \nhappened here, into more dangerous living quarters.27 \nInternal grievance processes are not the \u201cneutral \n \n26 Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting for Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA \nExhaustion Law, 21 GEO. MASON L. REV. 573, 574 (2014). \n27 Id. at 574. \n\n9 \n \n \nadministrative mechanisms\u201d that courts often assume \nthem to be.28 To the contrary, correctional officers \n\u201chave a tangible stake in whether or not prisoners \n\u2018properly exhaust\u2019 their administrative complaints, as \nthose internal complaints may turn into lawsuits in \nwhich they, their colleagues, or their staff could be \nheld liable.\u201d29  Absent a jury trial on the facts of ex-\nhaustion, officers can even more easily bury abuses \nthey commit.  \nRichards alleges a paradigmatic example of this: \nthe same correctional officer who allegedly violated his \nrights avoided his ensuing claim by making the griev-\nance process unavailable. And it is easy for govern-\nment officials to thwart prisoners\u2019 claims, considering \nthat \u201cthe only way that compliance [with PLRA] can \nbe achieved by men and woman who are incarcerated, \nearn little or no money, and have few or no possessions \nis if the prison provides them with resources\u2014namely \npaper, pens, and a delivery system.\u201d Napier v. Laurel \nCounty, 636 F.3d 218, 227 (6th Cir. 2011) (Martin, J., \ndissenting). Compliance certainly cannot be achieved \nby thwarting efforts to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies and then using failure to exhaust as a get-out-of-\njury-trial-free card. Courts must not remain \u201cblind to \nthe vital role that a prisoner\u2019s capacity to exhaust\u201d\u2014\nand officers\u2019 perhaps inevitable efforts to thwart ex-\nhaustion\u2014\u201cought to play\u201d in PLRA litigation.30 \nBy design, the Seventh Amendment provides a \nsafeguard: the right to a jury trial. That right extends \nto \u00a7 1983 claims\u2014including potentially dispositive \n \n28 Id. at 578. \n29 Id. at 581. \n30 Id. at 574. \n\n10 \n \n \nfactual disputes around exhaustion. After all, juries \nare the constitutionally appointed finders of fact, and \nallowing judges to dispose of cases based on exhaus-\ntion would block claimants from ever having the mer-\nits of their cases reach a jury. \nB. The Seventh Amendment applies to \u00a7 1983 \nclaims. \nThe Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a \njury trial \u201cwhich existed under the English common \nlaw when the Amendment was adopted.\u201d Balt. & Car-\nolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). In assessing \nthe Amendment\u2019s scope, this Court first asks \u201cwhether \nwe are dealing with a cause of action that either was \ntried at law at the time of the founding or is at least \nanalogous to one that was[.]\u201d Markman v. Westview In-\nstruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996). If so, the \nCourt \u201cthen ask[s] whether the particular trial deci-\nsion must fall to the jury in order to preserve the sub-\nstance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d \nId. \nIn most PLRA cases, including this one, the claim-\nant is entitled to a jury trial on the merits. Generally, \nthis Court recognizes that monetary relief is a legal \nremedy, including \u201c[d]amages for a constitutional vio-\nlation.\u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monte-\nrey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 710 (1999). This Court has con-\nsistently recognized that \u00a7 1983 claims, as a \u201cspecies \nof tort liability,\u201d are appropriate for a jury. Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 483 (1994) (quoting Memphis \nCmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 305 (1986)); \nsee also City of Monterey, 526 U.S. at 709.  \nBecause a \u00a7 1983 claim is legal in nature, the Court \nlooks to history to determine whether a specific issue \n\n11 \n \n \narising within one is proper for the jury. City of Mon-\nterey, 526 U.S. at 708. If the historical analysis is un-\nclear, the Court turns to \u201cprecedent and functional \nconsiderations.\u201d Id. at 718. \nThe issue of exhaustion is appropriate for jury res-\nolution. \u201c[C]ase law recognizes a right to a jury trial \nwhere the determination of the plea, whether in bar or \nto the jurisdiction, reaches the merits of the cause of \naction or disposes of the case.\u201d Union Pac. Fuels, Inc. \nv. Johnson, 909 S.W.2d 130, 134 (Tex. App. 1995). Ex-\nhaustion is an affirmative defense that can dispose of \na case. Hence, the Sixth Circuit correctly held that \nthere is \u201cno reason to treat exhaustion differently from \na jurisdictional rule in this context because the effect \nof successfully raising the defenses is the same\u2014the \nplaintiff may not proceed in the action.\u201d Pet. App\u2019x 18a.  \nC. Juries, not judges, are constitutional \nfactfinders.  \nThough it may seem elementary, it bears empha-\nsizing that jurors should determine factual issues re-\ngarding exhaustion because they, not judges, are the \nconstitutionally designated factfinders. See Balt. & \nCarolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 (affirming that \u201cis-\nsues of law are to be resolved by the court and issues \nof fact are to be determined by the jury under appro-\npriate instructions by the court.\u201d). \u201cThe controlling dis-\ntinction between the power of the court and that of the \njury is that the former is the power to determine the \nlaw and the latter to determine the facts.\u201d Dimick v. \nSchiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 (1935). \u201cMaintenance of the \njury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and jurispru-\ndence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a \n\n12 \n \n \njury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.\u201d \nId.  \nWhether administrative remedies were in fact \navailable to a given prisoner in a given case is a factual \nissue and therefore reserved for determination by a \njury. While a judge may have to decide some facts in-\ncidental to a legal question for the purposes of deter-\nmining whether jurisdiction or venue is proper, ex-\nhaustion issues are primarily factual. Because a jury \nis better equipped to find facts and assess the credibil-\nity of witnesses regarding whether a prisoner had ac-\ncess to the prison\u2019s administrative process, these is-\nsues should be resolved by jurors instead of judges.  \nFurther, the right to a jury trial is most urgent in \ncases like this one, where government officials have \nbeen accused of constitutional violations. \u201cThe essence \nof that right lies in its insistence that a body of laymen \nnot permanently attached to the sovereign participate \nalong with the judge in the factfinding necessitated by \na lawsuit.\u201d Parklane Hosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 348\u201349 \n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The importance of unaffil-\niated factfinders is no less important in civil cases pit-\nting citizens against government than in criminal \ncases governed by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s correspond-\ning guarantee. Id. at 349.  \nPrisoners are among the most vulnerable members \nof society, unavoidably subjected to potential abuse \ndue to their confinement. Prison officials have signifi-\ncant power over them, including the power to deny \nthem access to the independent arbiter that the Con-\nstitution guarantees to all citizens\u2014those who are in-\ncarcerated no less than any others. For Richards, and \nthose similarly situated to him, a jury trial at the \n\n13 \n \n \nexhaustion stage is essential to ensure that their \nclaims are fairly heard. \nD. A jury trial is necessary to preserve the \nclaimant\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the \nultimate dispute.  \n\u201cIn actions at law, issues that are proper for the \njury must be submitted to it \u2018to preserve the right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute[.]\u2019\u201d City of \nMonterey, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). A jury \ntrial is necessary at the exhaustion stage to preserve \nRichards\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the ultimate dis-\npute in his \u00a7 1983 claim.  \nIt is important for a jury, rather than a judge, to \nhear factual disputes at the exhaustion stage because \nthe issue of exhaustion is dispositive in most PLRA \ncases. While \u201c[m]atters of judicial administration often \nrequire district judges to decide factual disputes that \nare not bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute[,]\u201d a jury trial is appropriate here because a find-\ning of non-exhaustion will almost always dispose of the \nclaim. Messa v. Goord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d. Cir. \n2011) (per curiam). \nAlthough a \u00a7 1983 claimant should be entitled to a \njury trial at the exhaustion stage whenever there is a \nfactual dispute, there is an even stronger argument to \ngrant one here where the factual issues regarding ex-\nhaustion are intertwined with the merits of the claim.  \nCONCLUSION \n\u201c[N]o amount of argument that [a doctrinal] device \nprovides for more efficiency or more accuracy or is \nfairer will save it if the degree of invasion of the jury\u2019s \nprovince is greater than allowed in 1791.\u201d Parklane \n\n14 \n \n \nHosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 346 (Rehnquist, J., dissent-\ning); cf. Erlinger v. United States, 602 U.S. 821, 842 \n(2024) (\u201cThere is no efficiency exception to the . . . Sixth \nAmendmen[t].\u201d); Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 100 \n(2020) (\u201cWhen the American people chose to enshrine \n[the criminal jury trial] right in the Constitution, they \nweren\u2019t suggesting fruitful topics for future cost-\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

VII .............................................. 3 \n\n1 \n \n \nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \nThe Cato Institute is a nonpartisan public policy \nresearch foundation founded in 1977 and dedicated to \nadvancing the principles of individual liberty, free \nmarkets, and limited government. Cato\u2019s Robert A. \nLevy Center for Constitutional Studies was estab-\nlished in 1989 to promote the Constitution and its \nprinciples, which are the foundation of liberty. Toward \nthose ends, Cato publishes books and studies, conducts \nconferences, produces the annual Cato Supreme Court \nReview, and files amicus briefs.  \nThis case interests Cato because the constitutional \nright to a civil jury trial is fundamental to American \nliberty.  \n \n \n \n1 Rule 37 statement: No part of this brief was authored by any \nparty\u2019s counsel, and no person or entity other than amicus \nfunded its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \nBACKGROUND AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nCongress enacted the Prison Litigation Reform Act \n(\u201cPLRA\u201d) in 1995 to \u201creduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. \n516, 524\u201325 (2002). PLRA provides that \u201c[n]o action \nshall be brought with respect to prison conditions un-\nder [42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983], or any other Federal law, by a \nprisoner confined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative remedies as \nare available are exhausted.\u201d2  \nRespondent Kyle Richards, a prisoner, filed a \n\u00a7 1983 lawsuit alleging that Petitioner Thomas Perttu, \na correctional officer, committed sexual misconduct \nagainst him and other inmates\u2014then threatened \nRichards and destroyed the grievances he sought to \nfile in order to exhaust his administrative remedies. \nJ.A. 14\u201315.  \nWithout putting the issue to a jury, the district \ncourt determined that Richards had failed to exhaust \nhis administrative remedies and dismissed his suit. \nPet. App\u2019x 22a\u201328a. The Sixth Circuit reversed, hold-\ning that Richards is entitled to a jury trial on the issue \nof exhaustion. Id. 19a.  \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding was correct. The Con-\nstitution assigns to juries, not judges, responsibility \nfor resolving disputed facts in criminal cases and civil \ncases involving common-law causes of action\u2014such as \ndamages claims against public officials. No less than \nother citizens, PLRA litigants are thus entitled to have \ndisputes decided by the constitutionally appointed \n \n2 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a).  \n\n3 \n \n \nfact-finder, particularly in cases where the issue of ex-\nhaustion is inextricably intertwined with the underly-\ning merits. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE RIGHT TO A CIVIL JURY TRIAL IS \nESSENTIAL TO LIBERTY. \nThe Seventh Amendment provides: \nIn Suits at common law, where the value \nin controversy shall exceed twenty dol-\nlars, the right of trial by jury shall be pre-\nserved, and no fact tried by a jury, shall \nbe otherwise re-examined in any Court of \nthe United States, than according to the \nrules of the common law. \nU.S. CONST. amend. VII.  \nThe right to a jury trial long pre-dates the Amend-\nment\u2019s adoption in 1791. \u201cLegal writers and political \ntheorists who were widely read by the colonists were \nfirmly of the opinion that trial by jury in civil cases was \nan important right of freemen.\u201d3 William Blackstone \nsaid the jury trial was \u201cthe glory of the English law,\u201d \npossessed of \u201cso great an advantage over others in reg-\nulating civil property.\u201d4 \nThe Framers understood this right to be rooted in \nMagna Carta and a vital check on state power.5 \n \n3 Charles W.

British colonial authorities would try ship-\ncondemnation cases in vice-admiralty courts without \nthe benefit of a jury, then rely on judgments procured \nthere to preclude recovery of damages at civil jury tri-\nals.12 Colonists specifically protested the practice of \ntrying wage cases involving shipwrights and shipyard \nlaborers in jury-free vice-admiralty courts.13 The \nStamp Act was also originally enforced via suits in the \nvice-admiralty courts.14 George Mason thus con-\ndemned the British for having \u201cdepriv[ed] us of the an-\ncient Tryal, by a Jury of our Equals, and substituting \nin its[] place an arbitrary Civil Law Court.\u201d15  \nColonists perceived a further threat to jury trials in \nthe Quebec Act, which is sometimes considered one of \nthe \u201cIntolerable Acts\u201d triggering the American Revolu-\ntion.

Indeed, the lack of that \nright in the original Constitution nearly derailed its \nratification.17 Antifederalists galvanized opposition \ndue specifically to the lack of a civil jury trial right.18 \nGeorge Mason and Elbridge Gerry noted this omission \nas a reason why they did not sign the Constitution.19  \nFor Antifederalists, the right to a civil jury trial \nmeant \u201cthe protection of debtor defendants; the frus-\ntration of unwise legislation; the overturning of the \npractices of courts of vice-admiralty . . . and the protec-\ntion of litigants against overbearing and oppressive \njudges.\u201d20 Of particular concern was \u201cthe vindication of \nthe interests of private citizens in litigation with the \ngovernment.\u201d21 One pseudonymous writer in the Penn-\nsylvania Packet warned that \u201cit was quite predictable \nthat a \u2018lordly court of justice\u2019 sitting without a jury in \n \n16 See The Quebec Act, 1774 (Gr.

Bed-\nford, 26 U.S. (1 Pet.) 433, 446 (1830) (\u201cOne of the strongest objec-\ntions originally taken against the Constitution of the United \nStates, was the want of an express provision securing the right of \ntrial by jury in civil cases.\u201d).  \n19 Wolfram, supra, at 660 n.59, 667.  \n20 Id. at 670\u201371. \n21 Id. at 671; see also id. at 708 (\u201cAnother important function of \nthe civil jury . . . was to provide the common citizen with a sym-\npathetic forum in suits against the government.\u201d). \n\n7 \n \n \nthe federal courts would likely be \u2018ready to protect the \nofficers of government against the weak and helpless \ncitizens[.]\u2019\u201d22 \nAntifederalist concern became so intense that Alex-\nander Hamilton dedicated the Federalist No. 83 to as-\nsuring readers that \u201c[t]he friends and adversaries of \nthe plan of the convention, if they agree in nothing \nelse, concur at least in the value they set upon the trial \nby jury.\u201d23 Of course, the Constitution\u2019s Framers re-\nsponded with crucial reassurance of their own\u2014the \nSeventh Amendment. \nThis Court\u2019s precedents have continued to recog-\nnize civil jury trials\u2019 importance. Justice Rehnquist \nnoted how the Founders \u201cconsidered the right of trial \nby jury in civil cases an important bulwark against tyr-\nanny and corruption, a safeguard too precious to be left \nto the whim of the sovereign, or, it might be added, to \nthat of the judiciary.\u201d24 Last year, in SEC v.

FACTUAL ISSUES REGARDING EXHAUSTION \nSHOULD BE TRIED BY A JURY. \nA. Prison officials can easily abuse the \nexhaustion requirement. \nAllowing factual questions regarding PLRA\u2019s ex-\nhaustion requirement to be tried by a judge would \nfrustrate the purpose and design of the Seventh \nAmendment. Prisoners bringing \u00a7 1983 claims are or-\ndinarily entitled to a jury trial on the merits. But \nPLRA requires prisoners to first exhaust available ad-\nministrative remedies. Such remedies are deemed un-\navailable as a matter of law when \u201cprison administra-\ntors thwart inmates from taking advantage of a griev-\nance process through machination, misrepresentation, \nor intimidation.\u201d Ross v. Blake, 578 U.S. 632, 644 \n(2016). Factual disputes regarding whether adminis-\ntrative remedies were or were not encumbered, as ex-\nist in this case, should be tried by a jury.  \nUnder PLRA, prison facilities are charged with de-\nsigning and implementing their own internal griev-\nance processes, which presents the self-evident moral \nhazard of officials designing and using those proce-\ndures to hamper prisoners\u2019 ability to assert claims \nagainst them.26 One such ruse is transferring sexual \nassault victims into isolation\u2014or, as Richards alleged \nhappened here, into more dangerous living quarters.27 \nInternal grievance processes are not the \u201cneutral \n \n26 Alison M. Mikkor, Correcting for Bias and Blind Spots in PLRA \nExhaustion Law, 21 GEO. MASON L. REV. 573, 574 (2014). \n27 Id. at 574. \n\n9 \n \n \nadministrative mechanisms\u201d that courts often assume \nthem to be.28 To the contrary, correctional officers \n\u201chave a tangible stake in whether or not prisoners \n\u2018properly exhaust\u2019 their administrative complaints, as \nthose internal complaints may turn into lawsuits in \nwhich they, their colleagues, or their staff could be \nheld liable.\u201d29  Absent a jury trial on the facts of ex-\nhaustion, officers can even more easily bury abuses \nthey commit.  \nRichards alleges a paradigmatic example of this: \nthe same correctional officer who allegedly violated his \nrights avoided his ensuing claim by making the griev-\nance process unavailable. And it is easy for govern-\nment officials to thwart prisoners\u2019 claims, considering \nthat \u201cthe only way that compliance [with PLRA] can \nbe achieved by men and woman who are incarcerated, \nearn little or no money, and have few or no possessions \nis if the prison provides them with resources\u2014namely \npaper, pens, and a delivery system.\u201d Napier v. Laurel \nCounty, 636 F.3d 218, 227 (6th Cir. 2011) (Martin, J., \ndissenting). Compliance certainly cannot be achieved \nby thwarting efforts to exhaust administrative reme-\ndies and then using failure to exhaust as a get-out-of-\njury-trial-free card. Courts must not remain \u201cblind to \nthe vital role that a prisoner\u2019s capacity to exhaust\u201d\u2014\nand officers\u2019 perhaps inevitable efforts to thwart ex-\nhaustion\u2014\u201cought to play\u201d in PLRA litigation.30 \nBy design, the Seventh Amendment provides a \nsafeguard: the right to a jury trial. That right extends \nto \u00a7 1983 claims\u2014including potentially dispositive \n \n28 Id. at 578. \n29 Id. at 581. \n30 Id. at 574. \n\n10 \n \n \nfactual disputes around exhaustion. After all, juries \nare the constitutionally appointed finders of fact, and \nallowing judges to dispose of cases based on exhaus-\ntion would block claimants from ever having the mer-\nits of their cases reach a jury. \nB. The Seventh Amendment applies to \u00a7 1983 \nclaims. \nThe Seventh Amendment preserves the right to a \njury trial \u201cwhich existed under the English common \nlaw when the Amendment was adopted.\u201d Balt. & Car-\nolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). In assessing \nthe Amendment\u2019s scope, this Court first asks \u201cwhether \nwe are dealing with a cause of action that either was \ntried at law at the time of the founding or is at least \nanalogous to one that was[.]\u201d Markman v. Westview In-\nstruments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996). If so, the \nCourt \u201cthen ask[s] whether the particular trial deci-\nsion must fall to the jury in order to preserve the sub-\nstance of the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d \nId. \nIn most PLRA cases, including this one, the claim-\nant is entitled to a jury trial on the merits. Generally, \nthis Court recognizes that monetary relief is a legal \nremedy, including \u201c[d]amages for a constitutional vio-\nlation.\u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at Monte-\nrey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 710 (1999). This Court has con-\nsistently recognized that \u00a7 1983 claims, as a \u201cspecies \nof tort liability,\u201d are appropriate for a jury. Heck v. \nHumphrey, 512 U.S. 477, 483 (1994) (quoting Memphis \nCmty. Sch. Dist. v. Stachura, 477 U.S. 299, 305 (1986)); \nsee also City of Monterey, 526 U.S. at 709.  \nBecause a \u00a7 1983 claim is legal in nature, the Court \nlooks to history to determine whether a specific issue \n\n11 \n \n \narising within one is proper for the jury. City of Mon-\nterey, 526 U.S. at 708. If the historical analysis is un-\nclear, the Court turns to \u201cprecedent and functional \nconsiderations.\u201d Id. at 718. \nThe issue of exhaustion is appropriate for jury res-\nolution. \u201c[C]ase law recognizes a right to a jury trial \nwhere the determination of the plea, whether in bar or \nto the jurisdiction, reaches the merits of the cause of \naction or disposes of the case.\u201d Union Pac. Fuels, Inc. \nv. Johnson, 909 S.W.2d 130, 134 (Tex. App. 1995). Ex-\nhaustion is an affirmative defense that can dispose of \na case. Hence, the Sixth Circuit correctly held that \nthere is \u201cno reason to treat exhaustion differently from \na jurisdictional rule in this context because the effect \nof successfully raising the defenses is the same\u2014the \nplaintiff may not proceed in the action.\u201d Pet. App\u2019x 18a.  \nC. Juries, not judges, are constitutional \nfactfinders.  \nThough it may seem elementary, it bears empha-\nsizing that jurors should determine factual issues re-\ngarding exhaustion because they, not judges, are the \nconstitutionally designated factfinders. See Balt. & \nCarolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 (affirming that \u201cis-\nsues of law are to be resolved by the court and issues \nof fact are to be determined by the jury under appro-\npriate instructions by the court.\u201d). \u201cThe controlling dis-\ntinction between the power of the court and that of the \njury is that the former is the power to determine the \nlaw and the latter to determine the facts.\u201d Dimick v. \nSchiedt, 293 U.S. 474, 486 (1935). \u201cMaintenance of the \njury as a fact-finding body is of such importance and \noccupies so firm a place in our history and jurispru-\ndence that any seeming curtailment of the right to a \n\n12 \n \n \njury trial should be scrutinized with the utmost care.\u201d \nId.  \nWhether administrative remedies were in fact \navailable to a given prisoner in a given case is a factual \nissue and therefore reserved for determination by a \njury. While a judge may have to decide some facts in-\ncidental to a legal question for the purposes of deter-\nmining whether jurisdiction or venue is proper, ex-\nhaustion issues are primarily factual. Because a jury \nis better equipped to find facts and assess the credibil-\nity of witnesses regarding whether a prisoner had ac-\ncess to the prison\u2019s administrative process, these is-\nsues should be resolved by jurors instead of judges.  \nFurther, the right to a jury trial is most urgent in \ncases like this one, where government officials have \nbeen accused of constitutional violations. \u201cThe essence \nof that right lies in its insistence that a body of laymen \nnot permanently attached to the sovereign participate \nalong with the judge in the factfinding necessitated by \na lawsuit.\u201d Parklane Hosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 348\u201349 \n(Rehnquist, J., dissenting). The importance of unaffil-\niated factfinders is no less important in civil cases pit-\nting citizens against government than in criminal \ncases governed by the Sixth Amendment\u2019s correspond-\ning guarantee. Id. at 349.  \nPrisoners are among the most vulnerable members \nof society, unavoidably subjected to potential abuse \ndue to their confinement. Prison officials have signifi-\ncant power over them, including the power to deny \nthem access to the independent arbiter that the Con-\nstitution guarantees to all citizens\u2014those who are in-\ncarcerated no less than any others. For Richards, and \nthose similarly situated to him, a jury trial at the \n\n13 \n \n \nexhaustion stage is essential to ensure that their \nclaims are fairly heard. \nD. A jury trial is necessary to preserve the \nclaimant\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the \nultimate dispute.  \n\u201cIn actions at law, issues that are proper for the \njury must be submitted to it \u2018to preserve the right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute[.]\u2019\u201d City of \nMonterey, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). A jury \ntrial is necessary at the exhaustion stage to preserve \nRichards\u2019s right to have a jury resolve the ultimate dis-\npute in his \u00a7 1983 claim.  \nIt is important for a jury, rather than a judge, to \nhear factual disputes at the exhaustion stage because \nthe issue of exhaustion is dispositive in most PLRA \ncases. While \u201c[m]atters of judicial administration often \nrequire district judges to decide factual disputes that \nare not bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute[,]\u201d a jury trial is appropriate here because a find-\ning of non-exhaustion will almost always dispose of the \nclaim. Messa v. Goord, 652 F.3d 305, 309 (2d. Cir. \n2011) (per curiam). \nAlthough a \u00a7 1983 claimant should be entitled to a \njury trial at the exhaustion stage whenever there is a \nfactual dispute, there is an even stronger argument to \ngrant one here where the factual issues regarding ex-\nhaustion are intertwined with the merits of the claim.  \nCONCLUSION \n\u201c[N]o amount of argument that [a doctrinal] device \nprovides for more efficiency or more accuracy or is \nfairer will save it if the degree of invasion of the jury\u2019s \nprovince is greater than allowed in 1791.\u201d Parklane \n\n14 \n \n \nHosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 346 (Rehnquist, J., dissent-\ning); cf. Erlinger v. United States, 602 U.S. 821, 842 \n(2024) (\u201cThere is no efficiency exception to the . . . Sixth \nAmendmen[t].\u201d); Ramos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 100 \n(2020) (\u201cWhen the American people chose to enshrine \n[the criminal jury trial] right in the Constitution, they \nweren\u2019t suggesting fruitful topics for future cost-bene-\nfit analyses. They were seeking to ensure that their \nchildren\u2019s children would enjoy the same hard-won lib-\nerty they enjoyed.\u201d). \u201cTo rule otherwise would effec-\ntively permit judicial repeal of the Seventh Amend-\nment because nearly any change in the province of the \njury, no matter how drastic the diminution of its func-\ntions, can always be denominated \u2018procedural reform.\u2019\u201d \nParklane Hosiery Co., 439 U.S. at 346 (Rehnquist, J., \ndissenting). Indeed, \u201cthe Seventh Amendment will \nprove burdensome in some instances,\u201d but \u201cthe oner-\nous nature of the protection is no license for contract-\ning the rights secured by [it].\u201d Id. at 346.  \nThis Court should affirm the decision below, hold-\ning that Richards and other claimants subject to PLRA \nare entitled to a jury trial when there is a factual dis-\npute regarding exhaustion. \n                                           Respectfully submitted, \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nDated: January 21, 2025 \nClark M.

          "task_beliefs": "My beliefs about the case's parameters are stable, as this observation was an internal strategic reflection rather than new external evidence. However, this reflection sharpens my focus on the precise nature of my uncertainty and what information is required to resolve it.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The case remains centered on whether the Seventh Amendment requires a jury trial for PLRA exhaustion disputes when the facts of exhaustion are intertwined with the merits of the underlying claim.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. Perttu's argument is that PLRA exhaustion is a modern analog to a **historical equitable defense**, an issue for a judge, thus avoiding the Seventh Amendment's jury requirement for suits at law.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** Stable. My understanding is still based on the Brief in Opposition (BIO). The core argument is that the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine from cases like *Smithers v. Smith* prevents a judge from summarily deciding facts that go to the merits. The historical counter-argument is that Richards's factual dispute over exhaustion is analogous to a common-law **\"plea in traverse,\"** which required a jury.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** Stable. The prediction remains a **50/50 toss-up**. The conflict is clearly defined as \"equitable defense\" (judge) vs. \"plea in traverse\" (jury). This observation reinforces that my primary uncertainty is the \"argumentative gap\": I still do not know how the Respondent's Merits Brief specifically counters the Petitioner's \"equitable defense\" argument. The internal monologue confirms that resolving this specific gap is the highest priority task-level goal, as it is the only path to updating my predictive model. My current state is one of acknowledged paralysis pending new information.",

It demonstrates the D-beliefs being put into practice to guide action.\n\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** **Strongly Confirmed.** The agent's explicit reasoning shows that the entire strategic pivot is a direct response to a breakdown in this dialectical sequence (inability to access Respondent's Merits Brief after Petitioner's).\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** **Evolved and Applied.** The corollary developed in the previous step\u2014that when a primary source is inaccessible, one must pivot to the next-best sources\u2014is now being actively implemented. The agent is moving from the primary target (Respondent's brief) to secondary-but-still-primary sources (Amicus briefs) that analyze it.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed. The `THINK` action is a pure act of metacognitive synthesis, evaluating past actions and planning future ones.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** **Evolved.** The strategy has now fully matured from \"refine the query\" to \"change the target document type.\" The agent has concluded that the tool itself is the obstacle for this specific target, necessitating a broader strategic shift.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** **Confirmed and Demonstrated.** The entire observation *is* an act of reflective action planning. It explicitly diagnoses a problem (\"I have now failed twice\"), invokes a design principle (\"'Information Scent and Pivoting' demand a change\"), and formulates a new plan (\"my next action will be to pivot my search... to amicus briefs\").\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** **Upgraded and Operationalized.** This principle has been promoted from a background heuristic to the central pillar of the immediate action plan. It is now the chosen method for circumventing the primary information-gathering failure.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** **Strongly Confirmed.** The agent's reasoning explicitly identifies the \"argumentative gap\" (the Respondent's counter to the equitable defense theory) as the primary source of uncertainty and the sole motivation for the strategic pivot.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition:** Confirmed.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors:** Confirmed.\n16. **The Battle of Historical Analogs:** Confirmed.\n17. **The \"Exception vs. Application\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n18. **Diagnosing Search Failures:** Confirmed.\n19. **Tool Skepticism and Verification:** **Confirmed and Applied.** The agent's reasoning is founded on skepticism of its tool's ability to retrieve the desired document, demonstrating this principle in action.\n20. **Information Scent and Pivoting:** **Strongly Confirmed and Operationalized.** This is the core principle guiding the observed `THINK` action. The agent explicitly states the \"information scent is cold\" and that this necessitates a strategic pivot, moving this principle from a theoretical concept to a practical, action-guiding rule."

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Sixth Circuit Proceedings ............................ 11 \nSummary of Argument ............................................. 13 \nArgument .................................................................. 16 \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. ....................................... 16 \nA. This Court has held that judges can \ndecide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment. .................................. 16 \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on any \nfactual questions concerning exhaustion \nbecause exhaustion derives from equity. .... 19 \n\niii \n \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common \nlaw at the time the Seventh \nAmendment was adopted. ..................... 20 \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the \ncommon law, but closely analogous \nequitable issues were not decided by \njuries in 1791. ........................................ 22 \na. No historical antecedent to \nexhaustion existed at common \nlaw, but its origins are equitable \nin nature. ......................................... 23 \nb. Traditional equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, \nforum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus \nbars are an appropriate common-\nlaw analog for exhaustion. .............. 27 \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion. ........ 33 \n4. Functional considerations \ndemonstrate that judges, not juries, \nshould determine exhaustion \nquestions. ............................................... 35 \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those \nfactual questions are intertwined with the \nunderlying merits. .............................................. 37 \n\niv \n \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined \nlegal and equitable issues, but that \npresumption does not apply here. ............... 38 \n1. The presumption does not apply \nbecause exhaustion is a threshold \nissue that is logically precedent to the \nmerits. .................................................... 41 \n2. The presumption does not apply \nbecause a judge\u2019s factual findings \nregarding exhaustion would not \npreclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim. ....................... 43 \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial \ndetermination of exhaustion would \nimplement congressional intent. ................. 46 \nConclusion ................................................................. 48 \n \n\nv \n \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nPage \nCases \nAlbino v.

The \nopinion of the United States District Court for the \nWestern District of Michigan (Pet. App. 22a\u201328a) is \nnot reported but is available at 2022 WL 842654. \nJURISDICTION \nThe district court had jurisdiction over claims \nbrought by Respondent Kyle Brandon Richards under \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1331. The district \ncourt entered judgment for Petitioner Thomas Perttu \non March 22, 2022. Richards filed a timely notice of \nappeal by right on April 11, 2022. The court of appeals \nhad jurisdiction to review the district court\u2019s final \njudgment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1291. This Court has ju-\nrisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n \n \n\n2 \n \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe Seventh Amendment to the United States \nConstitution, U.S. Const. amend. VII, provides: \nIn suits at common law, where the value in \ncontroversy shall exceed twenty dollars, the \nright of trial by jury shall be preserved, and no \nfact tried by a jury, shall be otherwise re-ex-\namined in any Court of the United States, \nthan according to the rules of the common law. \nThe Prison Litigation Reform Act (PLRA), 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a), states in applicable part: \n(a) No action shall be brought with respect to \nprison conditions under section 1983 of this ti-\ntle, or any other Federal law, by a prisoner \nconfined in any jail, prison, or other correc-\ntional facility until such administrative reme-\ndies as are available are exhausted. \nINTRODUCTION \nThe importance of the Seventh Amendment right \nto a trial by jury is well recognized. Less clear, but \nequally important, is the central principle that under-\ngirds the right: preservation of the right to a jury\u2019s ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact where a case \nproceeds to trial. Embedded in that principle is a tacit \nlimitation\u2014the Seventh Amendment does not guar-\nantee the right to a jury trial on every fact question \nwithin a jury-triable case. Rather, the right is impli-\ncated only when a particular issue or trial decision \nmust fall to the jury to maintain the substance of the \n\n3 \n \ncommon-law right as it existed in 1791. This limita-\ntion is consistent with this Court\u2019s jurisprudence\u2014\nboth its historical view of the Seventh Amendment \nand its treatment of cases involving an overlap of legal \nand equitable issues that implicate collateral estoppel \nconcerns as opposed to cases where those concerns are \nnot present.  \nThe issue of exhaustion under the PLRA is not one \nfor a jury. Exhaustion has no precise historical analog, \nand the closest analogs are forum-based equitable de-\nfenses, which were historically decided by judges, not \nby juries.  \nThis understanding endures even where the facts \nunderlying the question of exhaustion are intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim. In this circum-\nstance, a judge\u2019s determination as to exhaustion does \nnot impinge on the \u201csubstance\u201d of the jury trial right\u2014\nthat right remains preserved. Where the prisoner has \nproperly exhausted administrative remedies, a jury \nmay then be impaneled to find the facts concerning \nthe underlying claims and will not be bound by the \njudge\u2019s earlier factual determinations. This division of \nduties is consistent with a judge\u2019s gatekeeping role, \ncomports with the goals of the PLRA, and protects the \nright to trial by jury. \n \n \n\n4 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The PLRA Framework \nIn 1970, just over 2,000 prisoner civil rights suits \nwere filed in federal courts. Margo Schlanger, Trends \nin Prisoner Litigation, as the PLRA Approaches 20, 28 \nCorr. L. Reporter, 69, 71 (2017). Shortly after that, fil-\nings exploded. Id.  \nIn 1980, Congress took a first stab at an exhaus-\ntion provision for prisoner suits filed under \u00a7 1983. \nUnder the Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons \nAct, 94 Stat. 352, as amended, district courts could \nstay a prisoner\u2019s \u00a7 1983 suit for up to 180 days while \nthe prisoner pursued \u201cplain, speedy, and effective ad-\nministrative remedies.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a)(1) (for-\nmer). The exhaustion requirement was discretionary \nthough\u2014exhaustion could be required only if the \nstate\u2019s prison grievance system met federal standards \nand if exhaustion was \u201cappropriate and in the inter-\nests of justice.\u201d \u00a7 1997e(a)(1), (2). \nBut that exhaustion provision did not stem the \ntide of prisoner litigation. By the mid-1990s, correc-\ntional systems and federal courts were overburdened \nby a mammoth caseload of prisoner litigation. In 1995 \nalone, 39,053 prisoner lawsuits were filed in federal \ncourt, a rate of 24.6 per 1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, \nTrends in Prisoner Litigation, supra, at 71. Not sur-\nprisingly, this strained the resources of the federal \ncourt system, not to mention correctional systems.  \nIn 1996, Congress enacted the PLRA \u201cin the wake \nof a sharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal \ncourts.\u201d Woodford v. Ngo, 548 U.S. 81, 84 (2006) \n\n5 \n \n(citing Alexander v. Hawk, 159 F.3d 1321, 1324\u201325 \n(11th Cir. 1998) (citing statistics)). A significant com-\nponent of the PLRA was a robust, mandatory exhaus-\ntion requirement. Congress \u201cinvigorated the exhaus-\ntion prescription\u201d that had existed under the prior re-\ngime, now requiring prisoners to fully exhaust all of \ntheir available administrative remedies through the \ngrievance process as a prerequisite to filing suit in fed-\neral court. Porter v. Nussle, 534 U.S. 516, 524 (2002).  \nAs stated by this Court, \u201cBeyond doubt, Congress \nenacted \u00a7 1997e(a) to reduce the quantity and improve \nthe quality of prisoner suits.\u201d Id. at 524. To further \nthis end, \u201cCongress afforded corrections officials time \nand opportunity to address complaints internally\u201d \nprior to prisoners seeking relief in federal court. Id. at \n525. By giving correctional officials the opportunity to \naddress grievances, \u201ccorrective action taken in re-\nsponse to an inmate\u2019s grievance might improve prison \nadministration and satisfy the inmate, thereby obvi-\nating the need for litigation.\u201d Id. (citing Booth v. \nChurner, 532 U.S. 731, 737 (2001)). In addition, a \nprison\u2019s \u201cinternal review might \u2018filter out some frivo-\nlous claims.\u2019 \u201d Id. (quoting Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). \nAnd the administrative record created by the prisons\u2019 \ninternal grievance processes would facilitate consider-\nation of those \u201ccases ultimately brought to court.\u201d Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nThe PLRA has been tremendously successful in \nreducing the burden on both prison officials and fed-\neral courts. From the peak of filings in 1995, within \nfive years of the passage of the PLRA prisoner law-\nsuits had fallen by 43%, even though the total prisoner \npopulation grew by 23%. Margo Schlanger, Inmate \n\n6 \n \nLitigation, 116 Harv. L. Rev. 1555, 1694 (2003). This \ndecline continued for several more years. By 2006, the \ndecline reached 60%. Margo Schlanger & Giovanna \nShay, Preserving the Rule of Law in America\u2019s Jails \nand Prisons: The Case for Amending the Prison Liti-\ngation Reform Act, 11 U. Pa. J. Const. L. 139, 141\u201342 \n(2008). Although the decline gradually plateaued, by \n2014, prisoners filed 25,324 lawsuits, a rate of 11.6 per \n1,000 prisoners. Schlanger, Trends in Prisoner Litiga-\ntion, supra, at 71. Compared to 1995, this represents \na 34% decrease in the number of prisoner lawsuits and \na 53% decline in the rate of lawsuits filed per 1,000 \nprisoners. See id. The exhaustion requirement has \nbeen a critical component of the PLRA\u2019s success.  \nB. MDOC\u2019s grievance process \nThe Michigan Department of Corrections (MDOC) \nhas two separate processes for grievances. One is the \nstandard grievance procedure, governed by MDOC \nPolicy Directive 03.02.130, which is not applicable \nhere. J.A. 41\u201361. The other is the administrative pro-\ncess under the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA), \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 15601, et seq., and the Prohibited Sexual \nConduct Involving Prisoners policy (effective date \n04/24/2017), governed by MDOC Policy Directive \n03.03.140. J.A. 62\u201387.  \nThe PREA grievance procedure applies to Rich-\nards\u2019 claims of sexual abuse, harassment, and miscon-\nduct. MDOC uses a two-step process for PREA griev-\nances, both of which must be exhausted. J.A. 74\u201375. \nMDOC will not facially reject or deny grievances al-\nleging sexual abuse. J.A. 74\u201375. Instead, such \n\n7 \n \ngrievances must be investigated. J.A. 76. \u201cA prisoner \nmay file a PREA grievance at any time.\u201d J.A. 75.  \nA prisoner initiates the first step of the process by \nfiling a PREA Prisoner Grievance Form (Step I). \nJ.A. 75. Prisoners may grieve retaliation for reporting \nsexual abuse, harassment, or misconduct through the \nPREA grievance process. J.A. 72\u201373. PREA griev-\nances may not be referred to MDOC staff who are the \nsubject of the grievance. J.A. 76.  \nAt Step I, the PREA Coordinator1 must ensure \nthat \u201ca written response is provided to the prisoner \nwithin 60 calendar days of receipt of the Step I PREA \nGrievance,\u201d although an extension of up to 70 calen-\ndar days may be requested. J.A. 76\u201377. Prisoners \nmust be notified in writing of any extensions and the \ndue date for a response. J.A. 76\u201377.  \nPrisoners may appeal a Step I decision to Step II \nif they are unsatisfied with the response or the re-\nsponse was not timely. J.A. 77. MDOC\u2019s response to a \nStep II appeal is due within 90 calendar days of re-\nceipt, absent an extension, and it constitutes the final \ndecision in the matter. J.A. 77.  \nC. District Court Proceedings and Eviden-\ntiary Hearing \nRichards and co-Plaintiffs Kenneth Damon Pruitt \nand Robert Kissee filed suit under \u00a7 1983, alleging \nthat Perttu, a Resident Unit Manager (RUM) for the \nMDOC, sexually harassed them and other prisoners, \n \n1 Every prison has a PREA Coordinator designated by the war-\nden. J.A. 67.  \n\n8 \n \nretaliated against them, and destroyed their property, \nin violation of the First, Fifth, and Eighth Amend-\nments. J.A. 1\u201338. Perttu moved for summary judg-\nment, asserting that Richards and his co-Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust administrative remedies before filing \ntheir complaint. Pet. App. 3a. Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs alleged that Perttu had destroyed their \ngrievances or otherwise prevented them from being \nprocessed, making the grievance process unavailable. \nPet. App. 30a, 37a, 59a\u201360a. \nThe district court denied Perttu\u2019s motion, finding \nthat there was a question of fact as to whether the \ngrievance process was available to Richards due to his \nallegation that Perttu interfered with his grievance \nfilings. Pet. App. 79a\u201381a, 83a.  \nFollowing this ruling, the magistrate judge con-\nducted an evidentiary hearing on the issue of exhaus-\ntion. J.A. 88\u2013368. Evaluating the testimony, evidence, \nand arguments presented, the magistrate judge rec-\nommended that the district court conclude that Perttu \ncarried his burden of establishing \u201cthat Plaintiffs \nfailed to exhaust any of their claims before filing suit,\u201d \nPet. App. 64a, 76a, and that the \u201cadministrative rem-\nedies were generally available\u201d to Richards and his co-\nPlaintiffs. Pet. App. 68a.  \nIn reaching that conclusion, the magistrate judge \nfound that Richards\u2019 direct examinations, which re-\nlied on leading questions, undermined the credibility \nof his witnesses. Pet. App. 69a. The magistrate judge \nthen discussed how the circumstances surrounding \nthe alleged observations of Perttu destroying griev-\nances similarly undermined Plaintiffs\u2019 credibility. Pet. \nApp. 71a\u201373a. Notably, the evidence \u201cdemonstrate[d] \n\n9 \n \nthat RUM Perttu could not, and in fact did not, inter-\ncept and destroy all grievances filed by Plaintiffs in \nthe relevant time\u201d: \n[E]ven on the dates that RUM Perttu worked, \nhe testified that he only works from 7:00am to \n3:30pm. Moreover, RUM Perttu did not work \nseven days a week every week from June 2019 \nto March 2020. Indeed, on at least one of the \ndates on which Richards alleges Perttu de-\nstroyed his grievances, January 1, 2020, \nPerttu testified that he was not working due \nto the New Years holiday. \nPet. App. 73a. \nMoreover, the evidence showed that Richards had \naccess to the grievance process: \nBut even had Perttu been working every hour \nof every day . . . Richards actually took ad-\nvantage of the grievance procedure by filing \nStep I grievance forms twenty-six times be-\ntween June 6, 2019, and April 23, 2020.  \n* * * \nMoreover, of Richards\u2019s six Step I grievance \nforms entered into evidence, three specifically \ngrieved RUM Perttu, undermining any allega-\ntion that Perttu sorted through the grievances \nand discarded those directed towards him.  \nPet. App. 73a\u201374a.  \n\n10 \n \nThe magistrate judge noted that \u201cRichards\u2019s suc-\ncessful use of the grievance procedure . . . directly con-\ntradicts Plaintiffs\u2019 claim that administrative remedies \nwere effectively unavailable, and Plaintiffs\u2019 failure \n[to] use any of the alternative reporting methods . . . \ncasts doubt on their alleged attempts to file PREA \ngrievances.\u201d Pet. App. 75a.  \nThe magistrate judge found that \u201cPlaintiffs pro-\nvided no evidence that RUM Perttu\u201d influenced the \ncorrections officers he supervised to destroy or not \nprocess their grievances. Pet. App. 75a. Indeed, \u201cthe \ncredibility of Plaintiffs\u2019 witnesses was undermined by \ntheir inability to independently recollect the time or \nlocation of RUM Perttu\u2019s alleged destruction of Plain-\ntiff\u2019s grievances, as well as the unlikely circumstances \nunder which they claimed they observed such destruc-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 75a\u201376a. For instance, as a matter of \n\u201ccommon sense,\u201d Perttu could not have been \u201cpresent \nto intercept every grievance\u201d filed by Plaintiffs. Pet. \nApp. 76a. Based on these findings, the magistrate \njudge recommended that the district court conclude \nthat Richards and his co-Plaintiffs failed to exhaust \ntheir claims against Perttu and dismiss their claims \nwithout prejudice. Pet. App. 76a.  \nRichards and his co-Plaintiffs filed nine objec-\ntions, which the district court overruled. Pet. App. \n22a\u201328a. The district court adopted the report and \nrecommendation and entered judgment for Perttu. \nPet. App. 29a. Richards alone appealed the district \ncourt\u2019s ruling.  \n\n11 \n \nD. Sixth Circuit Proceedings \nOn appeal, Richards argued that the district court \nerred by not granting him a jury trial to resolve the \nexhaustion issue, which he claimed was intertwined \nwith the merits of his case.  \nThe Sixth Circuit began its analysis by discussing \nwhether the exhaustion issue was intertwined with \nRichards\u2019 underlying retaliation claim, noting that \nRichards alleged that Perttu destroyed his grievances, \npreventing him from exhausting the grievance re-\nquirements. Richards\u2019 complaint, the Sixth Circuit \nsaid, \u201clays out several specific instances when Perttu \nallegedly destroyed grievances that Richards had in-\ntended to file.\u201d Pet. App. 2a\u20133a. This allegedly \u201cinter-\nfered with Richards\u2019s speech.\u201d Pet. App. 10a. Under \nthese circumstances, the court concluded that \u201cthe \nfactual disputes regarding exhaustion . . . are inter-\ntwined with the merits of Richards\u2019s retaliation \nclaim.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \nThe Sixth Circuit turned its attention to whether \nthis intertwining implicated the Seventh Amendment \nright to a jury trial. The court recognized that, in Lee \nv. Willey, 789 F.3d 673 (6th Cir. 2015), it held that the \nprisoner had no right to a jury trial for an exhaustion \ndefense under the PLRA. Pet. App. 13a. But the court \nnoted that Lee did not govern the present case because \nthe disputed facts of the exhaustion issue were not \n\u201c \u2018bound up with the merits of the underlying dis-\npute.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting Lee, 789 F.3d at 678).  \nThe Sixth Circuit then looked to the other circuits, \nnoting that only the Seventh Circuit had squarely ad-\ndressed the issue, in Pavey v. Conley, 544 F.3d 739 \n\n12 \n \n(7th Cir. 2008). There, the Seventh Circuit held that \nprisoners had no right to a jury trial to determine \nwhether they had exhausted their administrative \nremedies under the PLRA, regardless of whether the \nexhaustion issue is intertwined with the merits of the \ncase. Pet. App. 14a (citing Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342). \nAccording to the Seventh Circuit, \u201c[j]uries decide \ncases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d Pavey, 544 \nF.3d at 741. The Ninth Circuit agreed with the rea-\nsoning of Pavey in Albino v. Baca, 747 F.3d 1162, 1171 \n(9th Cir. 2014) (en banc) (citations omitted). Pet. App. \n14a. \nInstead of following the reasoning of the Seventh \nand Ninth Circuits, the Sixth Circuit found \u201cseveral \ndistrict-court decisions in the Second Circuit\u201d more \nconvincing. Pet. App. 15a\u201317a. It ultimately con-\ncluded that \u201cRichards was stripped of his right to a \njury\u2019s resolution of the ultimate dispute\u201d because he \nwas denied a jury trial on the exhaustion issue. Pet. \nApp. 17a (internal citation omitted). The Sixth Circuit \nalso relied on Fireman\u2019s Fund Insurance Co. v. Rail-\nway Express Agency, Inc., 253 F.2d 780, 784 (6th Cir. \n1958). Pet. App. 17a\u201319a. In Fireman\u2019s Fund, the \nSixth Circuit had held that when jurisdiction is inter-\ntwined with the merits of the case, the issue cannot be \nsummarily decided where factual claims would not be \nsubject to cross-examination. 253 F.2d at 784 (\u201cthe \nmerits of a controversy could be summarily decided, \npartly on affidavits without the right of cross-exami-\nnation\u201d) (citation omitted). \nThe Sixth Circuit held that the district court erred \nby ordering an evidentiary hearing rather than a jury \ntrial on the issue of exhaustion, \u201cemphasiz[ing] that a \n\n13 \n \njury trial is appropriate in these circumstances only if \nthe district court finds that genuine disputes of mate-\nrial fact concerning PLRA exhaustion are \u2018decisive of \nthe merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim.\u2019 \u201d Pet. App. 19a \n(quoting Fireman\u2019s Fund, 253 F.2d at 784). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe PLRA mandates that prisoners exhaust ad-\nministrative remedies before filing a lawsuit in fed-\neral court. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1997e(a). Despite this precon-\ndition to suit, the Sixth Circuit held that prisoners are \nentitled to a jury trial when exhaustion disputes are \nintertwined with the merits of their claims. This con-\nclusion is not grounded in the Seventh Amendment. \n1. The Seventh Amendment permits courts to re-\nsolve disputed facts bearing on whether prisoners \nhave exhausted their claims. The Amendment pre-\nserves the right to a jury trial as it existed under the \nEnglish common law in 1791. Consistent with the \nAmendment\u2019s language, this Court has adhered to a \n\u201chistorical test,\u201d which asks two questions: (1) \nwhether the cause of action at issue \u201ceither was tried \nat law at the time of the founding or is at least analo-\ngous to one that was,\u201d Markman v. Westview Instru-\nments, Inc., 517 U.S. 370, 376 (1996) (citation omit-\nted), and (2) \u201c[i]f the action in question belongs in the \nlaw category, . . . whether the particular [issue] . . . \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791,\u201d id.  \nThis case turns on the second question, which, as \nthis Court has emphasized, \u201cmust depend on whether \nthe jury must shoulder this responsibility as neces-\nsary to preserve the \u2018substance of the common-law \n\n14 \n \nright of trial by jury.\u2019 \u201d Tull v. United States, 481 U.S. \n412, 426 (1987) (quoting Colgrove v. Battin, 413 U.S. \n149, 157 (1973)). The Court answers this question \nmuch like its first\u2014by using a historical method, and \n\u201c[w]here there is no exact antecedent,\u201d by \u201ccomparing \nthe modern practice to earlier ones whose allocation \nto court or jury we do know.\u201d Markman, 517 U.S. at \n378 (citations omitted).  \nExhaustion did not exist in 1791, and it was not \nuntil the twentieth century that courts fully articu-\nlated the doctrine. Thus, there is no exact antecedent \nto look to for answers. But exhaustion\u2019s roots in courts \nof equity provide helpful guidance. Exhaustion was \napplied by those courts to promote an orderly proce-\ndure whereby an administrative forum was the appro-\npriate starting point for a dispute. Other forum-based \nequitable defenses\u2014such as the adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine, forum non conveniens, abstention, and \nhabeas corpus bars\u2014therefore provide a suitable his-\ntorical analog.  \nAt common law, these defenses were not afforded \na jury trial right. This was true regardless of whether \nthose defenses were interposed in courts of law, in \nwhich case a court of equity would first dispose of the \nissue. Only where an issue at law remained would \nthat issue be jury-triable. Because these equitable de-\nfenses were not subject to a jury determination at \ncommon law, neither should exhaustion.  \nEven if these historical analogs are insufficient, \nfunctional considerations should guide this Court\u2019s \ndecision. In this regard, the PLRA\u2019s goals\u2014\u201cto reduce \nthe quantity and improve the quality of prisoner \nsuits,\u201d \nPorter, \n534 \nU.S. \nat \n524\u2014would \nbe \n\n15 \n \ncompromised, if not outright defeated, by a jury trial \non exhaustion. The PLRA allows prison officials the \nopportunity to address prisoner complaints prior to \nfederal-court interference. This, in turn, obviates the \nneed for some prisoner lawsuits and creates an admin-\nistrative record for those that are filed.  \nJudges also frequently decide threshold issues \nand are thus better positioned than juries to decide \nexhaustion questions. And due to the significant num-\nber of prisoner cases judges see, they are particularly \nwell-equipped to deal with questions about a prison\u2019s \ninternal operations. Consequently, an exhaustion \nquestion should be allocated to the judge, not a jury.  \n2. That a question of exhaustion is intertwined \nwith the merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not change \nthis outcome. While Beacon Theatres, Inc. v. Westover, \n359 U.S. 500 (1959), establishes a general rule priori-\ntizing legal issues over equitable ones, it is a pruden-\ntial rule that is premised on the recognition that an \nequitable determination could have a collateral-estop-\npel effect on the merits of a legal claim. These con-\ncerns are not present for an exhaustion determina-\ntion, which is a threshold, pre-merits ruling that the \njury may revisit if an exhausted claim goes to trial. \nFurther, this Court has previously considered \nwhether application of the Beacon Theatres rule would \nundermine a federal statute. Here, the PLRA\u2019s pur-\nposes would be severely undercut by a jury trial on ex-\nhaustion.  \nFor these reasons, the Seventh Amendment does \nnot preserve the right to a jury trial on exhaustion of \nadministrative remedies where disputed facts regard-\ning exhaustion are intertwined with merits of a claim. \n\n16 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion. \nJudges frequently decide disputed questions of \nfact without violating the Seventh Amendment, par-\nticularly with respect to threshold issues. It is thus no \nsurprise that all courts of appeal to have considered \nthe issue have held that \u201cjudges may resolve factual \ndisputes relevant to the exhaustion issue without the \nparticipation of a jury.\u201d Small v. Camden Cnty., 728 \nF.3d 265, 269\u201371 (3d Cir. 2013); see also Lee, 789 F.3d \nat 677\u201378; Albino, 747 F.3d at 1170\u201371; Messa v. \nGoord, 652 F.3d 305, 308\u201310 (2d Cir. 2011) (per cu-\nriam); Dillon v. Rogers, 596 F.3d 260, 270\u201372 (5th Cir. \n2010); Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741\u201342; Bryant v. Rich, 530 \nF.3d 1368, 1373\u201377 (11th Cir. 2008). These holdings \nare consistent with the Seventh Amendment, which \napplies only to issues tried by a jury in suits at com-\nmon law in 1791. Exhaustion, although unknown at \ncommon law, is rooted in equity and closely analogous \nto traditional equitable defenses, which were not his-\ntorically determined by juries.  \nA. This Court has held that judges can de-\ncide facts related to threshold issues\u2014\nlike exhaustion\u2014without violating the \nSeventh Amendment.  \nAs a general matter, \u201cissues of law are to be re-\nsolved by the court and issues of fact are to be deter-\nmined by the jury.\u201d Baltimore & Carolina Line, Inc. v. \nRedman, 295 U.S. 654, 657 (1935). But this broad \nproposition overstates the Amendment\u2019s sweep, for \n\n17 \n \n\u201cthe Seventh Amendment was never intended to es-\ntablish the jury as the exclusive mechanism for fact-\nfinding in civil cases.\u201d Atlas Roofing Co. v. Occupa-\ntional Safety & Health Review Comm\u2019n, 430 U.S. 442, \n460 (1977); see also Galloway v. United States, 319 \nU.S. 372, 390 (1943) (\u201cThe jury was not absolute mas-\nter of fact in 1791.\u201d). In this vein, this Court has held \nthat the Seventh Amendment \u201cwas designed to pre-\nserve the basic institution of jury trial in only its most \nfundamental elements, not the great mass of proce-\ndural forms and details, varying even then [in 1791] \nso widely among common-law jurisdictions.\u201d Gallo-\nway, 319 U.S. at 392; see also Walker v. N. M. & S. P. \nR. Co., 165 U.S. 593, 596 (1897) (\u201cThe seventh amend-\nment . . . does not attempt to regulate matters of \npleading or practice[.]\u201d).  \nJudges thus frequently decide disputed questions \nof fact without violating the Seventh Amendment. For \nexample, this Court has held that judges may decide \nquestions of fact related to subject-matter jurisdiction, \nWetmore v. Rymer, 169 U.S. 115, 120\u201322 (1898); dis-\ncovery disputes, Herbert v. Lando, 441 U.S. 153, 177 \n(1979); class certifications, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. \nDukes, 564 U.S. 338, 351\u201352 (2011); evidentiary objec-\ntions, Galloway, 319 U.S. at 390; motions for sum-\nmary judgment, Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, 439 \nU.S. 322, 336 (1979); motions for directed verdict, Gal-\nloway, 283 U.S. at 391\u201395; and motions to set aside \nthe verdict, Gasoline Products Co. v. Champlin Refin-\ning Co., 283 U.S. 494, 497\u201398 (1943).  \n \n \n\n18 \n \nThis makes sense for at least two reasons. First, a \njudge\u2019s ability to determine fact disputes related to \nthreshold questions is consistent with the under-\nstanding that \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not \nconfer the right to a trial, but only the right to have a \njury hear the case once it is determined that the litiga-\ntion should proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley v. Gulf-\nstream Aerospace Corp., 428 F.3d 1359, 1371 (11th \nCir. 2005) (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co. v. Orr, \n294 F.3d 702, 711 (5th Cir. 2002)), cert. denied, 548 \nU.S. 1128 (2006). In this sense a judge acts as a gate-\nkeeper, guarding the courthouse doors from those who \nseek entry but have not yet satisfied mandatory pre-\nconditions to suit. Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741 (\u201cJuries de-\ncide cases, not issues of judicial traffic control.\u201d).  \nSecond, and relatedly, \u201c[t]he limitation imposed \nby the [Seventh] [A]mendment is merely that enjoy-\nment of the right of trial by jury be not obstructed, and \nthat the ultimate determination of issues of fact by the \njury be not interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. \n300, 310 (1920) (emphasis added). In other words, the \nSeventh Amendment \u201cis concerned with substance \nand not with form.\u201d Dimick v. Schiedt, 293 U.S. 474, \n490 (1935); see also id. (\u201cThere is nothing in its history \nor language to suggest that the amendment had any \npurpose but to preserve the essentials of the jury trial \nas it was known to the common law before the adop-\ntion of the Constitution.\u201d); Walker, 165 U.S. at 596 \n(\u201cSo long as this substance of right is preserved, the \nprocedure by which this result shall be reached is \nwholly within the discretion of the legislature . . . .\u201d). \nWhere the jury\u2019s ultimate determination of the facts is \nnot obviated, the judge may serve as factfinder. \n\n19 \n \nBoth of these underpinnings apply with full force \nin the exhaustion context. Exhaustion is a threshold \nquestion. Under the PLRA, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of ex-\nhaustion is resolved, the court cannot know whether \nit is to decide the case or the prison authorities are to.\u201d \nPavey, 544 F.3d at 741. Further, a judge\u2019s exhaustion \ndetermination does not interfere with a jury\u2019s ulti-\nmate factfinding responsibility because dismissals for \nfailure to exhaust are generally without prejudice.2 \nSee Snider v. Melindez, 199 F.3d 108, 111\u201312 (2d Cir. \n1999) (explaining that exhaustion \u201cis often a tempo-\nrary, curable, procedural flaw\u201d). A prisoner may later \nrefile the lawsuit, so long as the prison\u2019s grievance \nprocedure is satisfied. And if the prisoner\u2019s case ulti-\nmately proceeds to trial, the jury may revisit facts \nfound by the judge that may have been relevant to the \nexhaustion determination. See Part II; see also Pavey, \n544 F.3d at 742.  \nB. The Seventh Amendment does not pre-\nserve the right to a jury trial on any fac-\ntual questions concerning exhaustion be-\ncause exhaustion derives from equity.  \nAlthough the types of claims Richards brought are \nthose to which a jury trial applies, this Court has \n \n2 Along these lines, some courts have identified exhaustion as \nmatter in abatement, Bryant, 530 F.3d at 1374; Small, 728 F.3d \nat 269 n.3 (citation omitted), which is unsurprising since \u201cabate-\nment defense[s] defeat the particular action for procedural de-\nfects that are unrelated to the merits of the plaintiff\u2019s claim,\u201d and \nthe plaintiff can therefore \u201ctypically correct the defects and pro-\nceed in another action,\u201d Hyman v. City of Gastonia, 466 F.3d 284, \n287 (4th Cir. 2006) (citing Bowles v. Wilke, 175 F.2d 35, 38 (7th \nCir. 1949)).  \n\n20 \n \nrecognized the need for a separate historical analysis \nfor particular issues or trial decisions within jury-ap-\npropriate claims. Under this analysis, there is no ex-\nact antecedent for exhaustion. But its equitable ori-\ngins and the characteristics of the doctrine show that \nits closest parallel lies in equitable defenses\u2014which \nwere historically decided by judges, not juries.  \n1. The Seventh Amendment guarantees \na jury trial right only as to issues \ntried by a jury in suits at common law \nat the time the Seventh Amendment \nwas adopted.  \nThe Seventh Amendment \u201cpreserve[s]\u201d the right \nto jury trial \u201c[i]n Suits at common law.\u201d U.S. Const. \namend. VII. Because the Amendment speaks in terms \nof preservation, this Court has long held that the \nscope of the right must be determined by reference to \nhistory. Indeed, \u201c[f]rom the beginning, it has been re-\ngarded as but subservient to the single purpose of the \nAmendment, to preserve the essentials of the jury \ntrial in actions at law, serving to distinguish them \nfrom suits in equity and admiralty[.]\u201d Dimick, 293 \nU.S. at 490\u201391 (citation omitted); Granfinanciera, \nS.A. v. Nordberg, 492 U.S. 33, 42 (1989) (explaining \nthat the Seventh Amendment applies to actions \u201cthat \nare analogous to common-law causes of action ordi-\nnarily decided in English law courts in the late 18th \ncentury, as opposed to those customarily heard by \ncourts of equity or admiralty\u201d) (citation omitted). Con-\nsistent with this command, \u201cresort must be had to the \nappropriate rules of the common law established at \nthe time of the adoption of that constitutional provi-\nsion in 1791.\u201d Dimick, 293 U.S. at 476. See also \n\n21 \n \nBaltimore & Carolina Line, Inc., 295 U.S. at 657 \n(\u201c[T]he right of trial by jury thus preserved is the right \nwhich existed under the English common law when \nthe Amendment was adopted.\u201d).  \nThis historical lens does not mean that the right \nto a jury trial is available only in suits \u201cwhich the com-\nmon law recognized among its old and settled proceed-\nings.\u201d Parsons v. Bedford, Breedlove & Robeson, 28 \nU.S. 433, 447 (1830). As this Court has noted, histori-\ncal analysis allows for reasoning by analogy. There-\nfore, the determination whether the Seventh Amend-\nment confers a right to a jury trial entails a two-part \ninquiry. A court first considers whether it is \u201c \u2018dealing \nwith a cause of action that either was tried at law at \nthe time of the founding or is at least analogous to one \nthat was.\u2019 \u201d City of Monterey v. Del Monte Dunes at \nMonterey, Ltd., 526 U.S. 687, 708 (1999) (quoting \nMarkman, 517 U.S. at 376). If a court determines that \n\u201cthe action in question belongs in the law category,\u201d it \nmust \u201cthen ask whether the particular trial decision \nmust fall to the jury in order to preserve the substance \nof the common-law right as it existed in 1791.\u201d Mark-\nman, 517 U.S. at 708 (emphasis added). See also Tull, \n481 U.S. at 426 (\u201c \u2018Only those incidents which are re-\ngarded as fundamental, as inherent in and of the es-\nsence of the system of trial by jury, are placed beyond \nthe reach of the legislature.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Colgrove, 413 \nU.S. at 156 n.11.).  \nAs applied to this case, the first inquiry is \nstraightforward. While the scope of prisoners\u2019 federal \nrights was significantly limited at common law, see, \ne.g., Ruffin v. Commonwealth, 62 Va. 790, 799 (1871); \nBethea v. Crouse, 417 F.2d 504, 505 (10th Cir. 1969), \n\n22 \n \nfollowing Del Monte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720\u201321, the \ntypes of claims that Richards brought\u2014\u00a7 1983 claims \nfor damages\u2014are those for which a jury trial applies.  \nThis conclusion is not the end of the inquiry, \nthough. Rather, it leads to the second question\u2014\nwhether the particular issue of exhaustion is \u201cproper \nfor determination by the jury.\u201d3 Id. at 718; see also id. \nat 731 (Scalia, J., concurring in part and in concurring \nin the judgment) (\u201cTo say that respondents had the \nright to a jury trial on their \u00a7 1983 claim is not to say \nthat they were entitled to have the jury decide every \nissue.\u201d); Google LLC v. Oracle Am., Inc. 593 U.S. 1, 25 \n(2021) (rejecting an argument that the jury should de-\ncide a fair-use defense). As explained below, it is not.  \n2. Exhaustion did not exist at the com-\nmon law, but closely analogous equi-\ntable issues were not decided by ju-\nries in 1791.  \nTo answer the second question\u2014whether exhaus-\ntion should be determined by a judge or jury\u2014this \nCourt again looks to history, asking \u201cwhether the par-\nticular issue, or analogous ones, were decided by judge \nor by jury in suits at common law at the time the Sev-\nenth Amendment was adopted.\u201d Del Monte Dunes, 526 \nU.S. at 718; see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 378 \n(\u201cWhere there is no exact antecedent, the best hope \n \n3 The practice of submitting some issues for judicial determina-\ntion, while others are submitted to the jury, is consistent with \nFed. R. Civ. P. 39(a) and (a)(2), which provides that a \u201ctrial on all \nissues so demanded must be by jury unless . . . the court . . . finds \nthat on some or all of those issues there is no federal right to a \njury trial.\u201d (Emphasis added).  \n\n23 \n \nlies in comparing the modern practice to earlier ones \nwhose allocation to court or jury we do know . . . seek-\ning the best analogy we can draw between an old and \nthe new.\u201d) (citations omitted); Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u2013\n21 (explaining that courts must search the common \nlaw for \u201cappropriate analogies\u201d instead of a \u201cprecisely \nanalogous common-law cause of action\u201d). \nAlthough no exact antecedent for exhaustion ex-\nisted at common law, its origins lie in equity. These \norigins and exhaustion\u2019s characteristics result in an \nappropriate analog\u2014equitable defenses\u2014for which \nthere was no traditional right to a jury trial. \na. No historical antecedent to exhaustion \nexisted at common law, but its origins \nare equitable in nature. \nThe doctrine of exhaustion \u201cis as old as federal ad-\nministrative law,\u201d meaning that it did not begin to \ntake shape until the creation of the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission in 1887. Raoul Berger, Exhaustion \nof Administrative Remedies, 48 Yale L.J. 981, 981 n.1 \n(1939). Intended as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure de-\nsigned to allow administrative bodies to perform their \nstatutory functions without preliminary interference \nfrom the courts, United States v. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. \n161, 168 (1904), the concept first arose in tax cases in \nwhich courts of equity refused to grant injunctive re-\nlief where a plaintiff failed to pursue administrative \nremedies.  \nIn Dundee Mortgage Trust Invest Co. v. Charlton, \n32 F. 192, 192\u201393 (C.C.D. Ore. 1887), for example, a \ncorporation brought suit in equity to enjoin the \n\n24 \n \ncollection of its taxes, arguing that the county asses-\nsor and county board of equalization had erred in their \nassessment. While the court agreed that the corpora-\ntion \u201cappear[ed] to be entitled to an injunction,\u201d id. at \n193, it nevertheless held that the corporation was not \nentitled to relief because it did not seek redress from \nthe county board of equalization, as provided by stat-\nute, id. at 193\u201394. \u201c[T]he plaintiff, having neglected to \navail itself of this means of redress, cannot maintain \na suit for relief in this court.\u201d Id. at 195; see also Alt-\nschul v. Gittings, 86 F. 200, 202 (C.C.D. Ore. 1898) \n(No. 2,236) (same); Brown v. Drain, 112 F. 582, 585 \n(C.C.S.D. Cal. 1901) (\u201cThe remedy of one who consid-\ners himself unfairly assessed is to apply for redress to \nthe statutory tribunal, if one is provided with the \npower to review.\u201d).  \nThe exhaustion concept was applied in courts of \nequity in other contexts as well. In Sing Tuck, an im-\nmigration case in which the Court denied a writ a ha-\nbeas corpus, the Court concluded that the petitioner \nfailed to comply with the \u201cmode of procedure which \nmust be followed before there can be resort to the \ncourts.\u201d 194 U.S. at 167. Explaining that \u201cit is one of \nthe necessities of the administration of justice that \neven fundamental questions should be determined in \nan orderly way,\u201d the Court reasoned that the peti-\ntioner failed to first file an appeal with the Secretary \nof Commerce and Labor. Id. at 168. The Court analo-\ngized the exhaustion requirement to habeas corpus \ncases arising out of state confinement:  \nA familiar illustration is that of a person im-\nprisoned upon criminal process by a state \ncourt, under a state law alleged to be \n\n25 \n \nunconstitutional. If the law is unconstitu-\ntional the prisoner is wrongfully held. Yet, ex-\ncept under exceptional circumstances, the \ncourts of the United States do not interfere by \nhabeas corpus. The prisoner must, in the first \nplace, take his case to the highest court of the \nstate to which he can go, and after that he gen-\nerally is left to the remedy by writ of error if \nhe wishes to bring the case here.  \nId. (citations omitted). Because the petitioner failed to \nfirst resort to his administrative remedy, any attempt \n\u201cto swamp the courts by resort to them in the first in-\nstance[ ] must fail.\u201d Id. at 170; see also id. (\u201c[B]efore \nthe courts can be called upon, the preliminary sifting \nprocess provided by the statutes must be gone through \nwith. Whether after that a further trial may be had \nwe do not decide.\u201d). Other cases highlight exhaustion\u2019s \nequitable origins. E.g. Pittsburgh Ry. v. Bd. of Pub. \nWorks, 172 U.S. 32, 47 (1898); United States v. Abilene \n& S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. 274, 282 (1924); United States \nv. Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. 457, 463 (1934); Natural \nGas Pipeline Co. v. Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, 310\u201311 \n(1937).  \nWhile these cases confirm exhaustion\u2019s equitable \norigins, the doctrine, as we understand it today, did \nnot fully emerge until the twentieth century. See John \nF. Duffy, Administrative Common Law in Judicial Re-\nview, 77 Tex. L. Rev. 113, 154 (1998) (explaining that \n\u201c[i]n the early part of th[e] [twentieth] century, the \ndoctrine was still quite amorphous, and as late as the \n1920\u2019s, courts were still using other equitable doc-\ntrines . . . to decide cases that would later be consid-\nered exhaustion precedents\u201d). Indeed, it was only in \n\n26 \n \n1938, in Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Co., 303 \nU.S. 41 (1938), that this Court expressly articulated \nthe modern underpinning of the doctrine. See Duffy, \nsupra, at 155.  \nIn Myers, the Court declined a request to enjoin \nthe National Labor Relations Board\u2019s administrative \nproceedings despite allegations that the NLRB lacked \njurisdiction. Id. at 43, 46. The Court refused to grant \ninjunctive relief, in part on the ground that \u201cno one is \nentitled to judicial relief for a supposed or threatened \ninjury until the prescribed administrative remedy has \nbeen exhausted.\u201d Id. at 50. The Court recognized the \nexhaustion doctrine\u2019s equitable roots, see id. at 51 n.9 \n(\u201cThe rule has been most frequently applied in equity \nwhere relief by injunction was sought\u201d) (citation omit-\nted), and noted the extension of the doctrine to courts \nof law, id. (\u201cbecause the rule is one of judicial admin-\nistration\u2014not merely a rule governing the exercise of \ndiscretion\u2014it is applicable to proceedings at law as \nwell as suits in equity\u201d) (citations omitted). Myers \nstands as \u201cthe seminal decision\u201d on the exhaustion \ndoctrine and has been described as \u201ccomplet[ing] the \ndoctrine\u2019s evolution.\u201d Duffy, supra, at 155. \nIn short, although exhaustion has deep roots in \nequity, the doctrine as we know it today was unknown \nin the late eighteenth century. Consequently, there is \nno \u201cclear historical evidence that the very . . . ques-\ntion\u201d of exhaustion was a question for the jury under \nthe common law. Markman, 517 U.S. at 377. \n\n27 \n \nb. Traditional equitable defenses such as \nadequate remedy at law, forum non \nconveniens, abstention, and habeas \ncorpus bars are an appropriate com-\nmon-law analog for exhaustion.  \nWith no precise analog existing in the English \ncommon law, \u201cthe best hope lies in comparing the \nmodern practice to earlier ones whose allocation to \ncourt or jury we do know, . . . seeking the best analogy \nwe can draw between the old and the new.\u201d Markman, \n517 U.S. at 378 (citations omitted). In this regard, this \nCourt has instructed that the analog be \u201cappropriate\u201d \nrather than \u201cprecise[ ],\u201d Tull, 481 U.S. at 420\u201321, and \ncan be drawn on the basis of function, Markman, 517 \nU.S. at 379\u201380.  \nExhaustion\u2019s foundations in courts of equity pro-\nvide a logical starting point in the search for an appro-\npriate analog. As explained in the prior section, from \nits earliest articulations, it was viewed as a limitation, \nalbeit discretionary, on a court\u2019s equitable jurisdic-\ntion. See Charlton, 32 F. at 195; Altschul, 86 F. at 202. \nIn other words, a court of equity would not exercise its \nextraordinary powers where a plaintiff failed to avail \nitself of an available administrative process. Gorham \nMfg. Co. v. State Tax Comm\u2019n of N.Y., 266 U.S. 265, \n270 (1924) (holding that the petitioner, \u201chaving failed \nto avail itself of the administrative remedy provided \nby the statute . . . was not entitled to maintain a bill \nin equity\u201d); Ill. Cent. R.R. Co., 291 U.S. at 463 (\u201cThe \nvarious steps to be taken constitute parts of the ad-\nministrative process which must be completed before \nthe extraordinary powers of a court of equity may be \ninvoked.\u201d) (citation omitted); Slattery, 302 U.S. 300, \n310\u201311 (1937) (\u201cThe rule that a suitor must exhaust \n\n28 \n \nhis administrative remedies before seeking the ex-\ntraordinary relief of a court of equity . . . is of special \nforce when resort is had to the federal courts to re-\nstrain the action of state officers.\u201d) (citations omitted); \nIsland Creek Coal Co. v. Bryan, 937 F.3d 738, 748 (6th \nCir. 2019) (noting that \u201cthe exhaustion \u2018doctrine had \nits origin in a discretionary rule adopted by courts of \nequity to the effect that a petitioner will be denied eq-\nuitable relief when he has failed to pursue an availa-\nble administrative remedy by which he might obtain \nthe same relief.\u2019 \u201d) (quoting Smith v. United States, \n199 F.2d 377, 381 (1st Cir. 1952)).  \nThus, historically, exhaustion was an equitable \ndefense applied by courts when another forum\u2014an \nadministrative tribunal or agency\u2014was the more ap-\npropriate starting point for a dispute. Tracking this \nprinciple, this Court has said that exhaustion \u201cserves \nthe twin purposes of protecting administrative agency \nauthority and promoting judicial efficiency.\u201d McCar-\nthy v. Madigan, 503 U.S. 140, 145 (1992), superseded \nby statute, \u00a7 1997e(a), as recognized in Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 84\u201385. As to the first purpose, the exhaustion \nrequirement \u201crecognizes the notion, grounded in def-\nerence to Congress\u2019 delegation of authority to coordi-\nnate branches of Government, that agencies, not the \ncourts, ought to have primary responsibility for the \nprograms that Congress has charged them to admin-\nister.\u201d Id.; see id. (\u201cThe exhaustion doctrine recognizes \nthe commonsense notion of dispute resolution that an \nagency ought to have an opportunity to correct its own \nmistakes . . . before it is haled into federal court.\u201d) (em-\nphasis added); Preiser v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 475, 492 \n(1973) (\u201cSince the[ ] internal problems of state prisons \ninvolve issues so peculiarly within state authority and \n\n29 \n \nexpertise, the States have an important interest in not \nbeing bypassed in the correction of those problems.\u201d). \nAs to the second purpose, \u201c[w]hen an agency has the \nopportunity to correct its own errors, a judicial contro-\nversy may well be mooted, or at least piecemeal ap-\npeals may be avoided.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145 (ci-\ntations omitted).  \nThese twin purposes call back to early articula-\ntions of the exhaustion doctrine as a rule of \u201corderly\u201d \nprocedure. Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 173. And alt-\nhough the exhaustion doctrine was discretionary, as \nopposed to jurisdictional, Slattery, 302 U.S. at 311 (ex-\nplaining that the rule \u201crests in the sound discretion \nwhich guides exercise of equity jurisdiction\u201d) (cita-\ntions omitted); Abilene & S. Ry. Co., 265 U.S. at 282, \nit nevertheless was treated by courts of equity as a \nthreshold inquiry, see Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at 168, 170.  \nThese guideposts offer a clear path in the search \nfor an appropriate common law analog. Indeed, ex-\nhaustion\u2019s origins as a forum-based equitable defense \ncall to mind other similar equitable defenses\u2014the ad-\nequate remedy at law doctrine, forum non conveniens, \nabstention, and habeas corpus bars.  \nAdequate remedy at law. The adequate remedy at \nlaw doctrine was a fundamental principle guiding \ncourts of equity. These courts \u201cstood ready to fashion \nremedies for legal wrongs, so long as the basic require-\nments of equity\u2014such as irreparable injury and no \nadequate remedy at law\u2014were met.\u201d Duffy, supra, at \n124. See also Younger v. Harris, 401 U.S. 37, 43\u201344 \n(1971) (\u201cOne is the basic doctrine of equity jurispru-\ndence that courts of equity should not act . . . when the \nmoving party has an adequate remedy at law and will \n\n30 \n \nnot suffer irreparable injury if denied equitable re-\nlief.\u201d); Morales v. Trans World Airlines, Inc., 504 U.S. \n374, 381 (1992) (\u201cIt is a \u2018basic doctrine of equity juris-\nprudence that courts of equity should not act . . . when \nthe moving party has an adequate remedy at law[.]\u2019 \u201d) \n(citations omitted).  \nThe adequate remedy at law doctrine was \ngrounded in comity and federalism concerns, with fed-\neral equity courts refusing to provide relief where it \nwas available at law in federal courts of law, Great \nLakes Co. v. Huffman, 319 U.S. 293, 297 (1943) (cita-\ntion omitted), as well as in state proceedings, Trainor \nv. Hernandez, 431 U.S. 434, 441 (1977). This doctrine, \nlike exhaustion, thus focused on whether a court of eq-\nuity should defer to another court (or forum) to hear \nthe dispute. And, like exhaustion, courts viewed the \ndoctrine as a threshold issue. Brown, Bonnell & Co. v. \nLake Superior Iron Co., 134 U.S. 530, 536 (1890) (ex-\nplaining that the adequate remedy at law objection \n\u201cshould be taken at the earliest opportunity\u201d). \nForum non conveniens. Under this equitable, com-\nmon-law doctrine, a federal court may dismiss an ac-\ntion in favor of an alternative forum when, among \nother things, \u201cthe chosen forum [is] inappropriate be-\ncause of considerations affecting the court\u2019s own ad-\nministration and legal problems.\u201d Koster v. Am. Lum-\nbermens Mut. Cas. Co., 330 U.S. 518, 524 (1947); see \nalso Gulf Oil Corp. v. Gilbert, 330 U.S. 501, 506\u201307 \n(1947) (explaining that the doctrine is premised on the \nassumption that there are \u201cat least two forums in \nwhich the defendant is amenable to process\u201d). Both fo-\nrum non conveniens and exhaustion therefore permit \ncourts to consider judicial efficiency in deciding \n\n31 \n \nwhether they are the appropriate forum for a case to \nbe heard. See Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia Int\u2019l \nShipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 432 (2007) (\u201cA district \ncourt . . . may dispose of an action by a forum non con-\nveniens dismissal, bypassing questions of subject-mat-\nter and personal jurisdiction, when considerations of \nconvenience, fairness, and judicial economy so war-\nrant.\u201d).  \nAbstention. \u201c[E]xhaustion of administrative reme-\ndies\u201d in general and \u201cabstention\u201d are \u201crelated doc-\ntrines.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 144. As with exhaus-\ntion, the power of a federal court to dismiss a case via \nabstention \u201cderives from the discretion historically \nenjoyed by courts of equity.\u201d Quackenbush v. Allstate \nIns. Co., 517 U.S. 706, 728 (1996). The driving princi-\nples behind exhaustion and abstention also share a \ncommon root\u2014deference to state or administrative \nauthority. See id. at 728 (quoting Burford v. Sun Oil \nCo., 319 U.S. 315, 334 (1943)). Younger abstention, for \nexample, respects a \u201cState\u2019s interest in pursuing an \nongoing state proceeding,\u201d Ohio Bureau of Emp. \nServs. v. Hodory, 431 U.S. 471, 477 (1977) (citations \nomitted), barring a federal court from enjoining a \nstate prosecution, a civil enforcement action, or a \nunique state action that \u201cimplicate[s] a State\u2019s inter-\nest in enforcing the orders and judgments of its \ncourts,\u201d Sprint Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. Jacobs, 571 U.S. 69, \n72\u201373 (2013). Likewise, PLRA exhaustion requires a \nfederal court to stay its hand where a state has not \nhad its full opportunity to regulate its own prisons by \nconsidering a prisoner\u2019s grievance. \nHabeas Corpus. Federal habeas principles rein-\nforce the analogy between exhaustion and equitable \n\n32 \n \ndefenses. Indeed, this Court explicitly linked PLRA \nexhaustion requirements to certain habeas defenses, \ndeeming them \u201csubstantively similar.\u201d Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92; see also Schlesinger v. Councilman, 420 \nU.S. 738, 756 (1975) (noting that \u201cthe practical consid-\nerations supporting . . . the exhaustion requirement in \nhabeas corpus . . . are similar to those that underlie \nthe requirement of exhaustion of administrative rem-\nedies\u201d) (citation omitted).  \nHabeas exhaustion, like PLRA exhaustion, \nsounds in equity. Withrow v. Williams, 507 U.S. 680, \n699 (1993) (\u201cConcerns for equity and federalism reso-\nnate throughout our habeas jurisprudence.\u201d) (Scalia, \nJ., concurring in part); Erica Hashimoto, Reclaiming \nthe Equitable Heritage of Habeas, 108 Nw. U. L. Rev. \n139, 142 (2013) (habeas defenses \u201cshare features that \ncorrespond with the [habeas] remedy\u2019s historical equi-\ntable origins\u201d). Premised on the same equitable under-\npinnings as administrative exhaustion, habeas ex-\nhaustion requires a prisoner to avail himself of all \n\u201cavailable\u201d state-court remedies before entering fed-\neral court to seek a writ of habeas corpus. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(c); see also O\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. \n838, 847 (1999). \nThe doctrine of procedural default, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2254(b)(1)(A), (c), another limitation on habeas re-\nlief, also shares similarities with exhaustion. It pre-\nvents federal court review of a claim that has not been \nproperly presented to the state courts. Woodford, 548 \nU.S. at 92. Procedural default guards against \u201cover-\nturning a state-court conviction without the state \ncourts having had an opportunity to correct the con-\nstitutional violation in the first instance.\u201d Id. (quoting \n\n33 \n \nO\u2019Sullivan, 526 U.S. at 845). That requirement mir-\nrors PLRA exhaustion\u2014giving prison systems the op-\nportunity to correct violations before litigating in fed-\neral court. See Rose v. Lundy, 455 U.S. 509, 518\u201319 \n(1982). \n3. Juries did not historically determine \nquestions of fact related to equitable \ndefenses analogous to exhaustion.  \nWith these similarities in mind, these equitable \ndefenses offer a sound analog to exhaustion, and \neighteenth-century practices concerning these de-\nfenses are instructive. It is well understood that a \nplaintiff is not entitled to have a jury determine a dis-\nputed affirmative defense that is equitable in nature. \nLiberty Oil Co. v. Condon Nat\u2019l Bank, 260 U.S. 235, \n242\u201343 (1922) (\u201cThe equitable defense makes the is-\nsue equitable, and it is to be tried to the judge as a \nchancellor.\u201d); Tull, 481 U.S. at 417 (\u201c[T]hose actions \nthat are analogous to 18th-century cases tried in \ncourts of equity . . . do not require a jury trial.\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted); Granite State Ins. Co. v. Smart Modular \nTechs., 76 F.3d 1023, 1027 (9th Cir. 1996) (\u201cA litigant \nis not entitled to have a jury resolve a disputed affirm-\native defense if the defense is equitable in nature.\u201d) \n(citation omitted); Smith v. World Ins. Co., 38 F.3d \n1456, 1462 (8th Cir. 1994) (\u201c[T]he determination of eq-\nuitable defenses and equitable remedies is a matter \nfor the court to decide, not the jury.\u201d). This was true \neven where an equitable defense was \u201cinterposed in \n[an] action at law,\u201d in which circumstance the equita-\nble defense was generally \u201cfirst . . . disposed of as in a \ncourt of equity, and then, if an issue at law remain[ed], \nit [was] triable to a jury.\u201d Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n242 (citations omitted). This equity-first order of oper-\nations was laid out by this Court over 100 years ago:  \nThe same order is preserved as under the sys-\ntem of separate courts. If a defendant at law \nhad an equitable defense, he resorted to a bill \nin equity to enjoin the suit at law, until he \ncould make his equitable defense effective by \na hearing before the chancellor. The hearing \non that bill was before the chancellor, and not \nbefore a jury, and, if the prayer of the bill was \ngranted, the injunction against the suit at law \nwas made perpetual, and no jury trial ensued. \nIf the injunction was denied, the suit at law \nproceeded to verdict and judgment. This was \nthe practice in the courts of law and chancery \nin England when our Constitution and the \nSeventh Amendment were adopted, and it is \nin the light of such practice that the Seventh \nAmendment is to be construed. \nId. at 243.  \n* * * \nIn sum, exhaustion was not part of the common \nlaw in 1791, and it has its origins in equity. This his-\ntorical background, along with exhaustion\u2019s func-\ntional similarities to forum-based equitable defenses \nsuch as adequate remedy at law, forum non conven-\niens, abstention, and habeas bars\u2014all historically \nnon-jury issues\u2014leads to the conclusion that the Sev-\nenth Amendment does not require juries to try ex-\nhaustion inquiries.  \n\n35 \n \n4. Functional considerations demon-\nstrate that judges, not juries, should \ndetermine exhaustion questions.  \nEven if history did not provide a clear answer, this \nCourt can, as a last resort, \u201clook elsewhere\u201d\u2015including \nat \u201cstatutory policies\u201d and the respective skills of \njudges and juries\u2015to inform the proper allocation be-\ntween a court or jury for purposes of the Seventh \nAmendment. Markman, 517 U.S. at 384; see also Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 718 (citation omitted). \nBeginning with the statutory policies at issue, the \nPLRA\u2019s statutory history is well documented. \u201cCon-\ngress enacted the [PLRA] . . . in 1996 in the wake of a \nsharp rise in prisoner litigation in the federal courts.\u201d \nWoodford, 548 U.S. at 84 (citing Alexander, 159 F.3d \nat 1324\u201325). The statute thus contains a variety of \ngatekeeping provisions \u201cdesigned to bring this litiga-\ntion under control.\u201d Id. (citations omitted). A \u201ccenter-\npiece\u201d of this effort is the PLRA\u2019s exhaustion require-\nment. Id. (citation omitted). \nThe PLRA\u2019s exhaustion requirement was, \u201cbeyond \ndoubt,\u201d \u201cenacted . . . to reduce the quantity and im-\nprove the quality of prisoner suits[.]\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. \nat 524. To this end, the provision \u201cafford[s] corrections \nofficials time and opportunity to address complaints \ninternally before allowing the initiation of a federal \ncase.\u201d Id. at 525 (emphasis added); see also Woodford, \n548 U.S. at 93 (\u201cThe PLRA attempts to eliminate un-\nwarranted federal-court interference with the admin-\nistration of prisons . . . .\u201d). This might \u201cobviat[e] the \nneed for litigation\u201d in some instances, or it might \u201cfil-\nter out some frivolous claims.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 525 \n(citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737). For cases that do make \n\n36 \n \nit to court, \u201cadjudication could be facilitated by an ad-\nministrative record that clarifies the contours of the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. (citing Booth, 532 U.S. at 737); see \nalso Woodford, 548 U.S. at 95 (\u201cWhen a grievance is \nfiled shortly after the event giving rise to the griev-\nance, witnesses can be identified and questioned while \nmemories are still fresh, and evidence can be gathered \nand preserved.\u201d). These goals mirror the purposes of \ntraditional administrative exhaustion\u2014they safe-\nguard \u201cadministrative agency authority and pro-\nmot[e] judicial efficiency.\u201d McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145.  \nThese goals would be severely undercut if a court \nwere to permit an exhaustion question to go to the \njury. Prison officials would be denied the opportunity \nto address and potentially rectify complaints inter-\nnally. Unexhausted claims could proceed to discovery \nwithout the benefits of full administrative record. \nMost critically, exhaustion questions would require ei-\nther a mini-jury trial before the merits adjudication or \na jury trial heard simultaneously with the merits. In \neither scenario, judicial resources and jurors\u2019 time \nwould be expended on claims that should never have \nreached the courthouse doors. Such a result directly \ncontradicts the PLRA\u2019s aims. \nOn the second point, judges\u2019 established role as \ngatekeepers in prisoner lawsuits supports the conclu-\nsion that judges, not juries, are \u201cbetter suited\u201d to as-\ncertain a prisoner\u2019s compliance with the exhaustion \nrequirement. See Markman, 517 U.S. at 384, 388\u201389 \n(consulting \u201cexisting precedent\u201d and considering \u201cthe \nrelative interpretive skills of judges and juries\u201d); Del \nMonte Dunes, 526 U.S. at 720 (looking to \u201cconsidera-\ntions of process and function\u201d). As explained in Part \n\n37 \n \nI(A), judges routinely resolve threshold issues and act \nas gatekeepers on factual questions that would other-\nwise be presented to the jury. This is especially true \nin PLRA cases, where, due to the sheer volume of pris-\noner lawsuits, Alexander, 159 F.3d at 1324, judges are \nwell-acquainted with the internal operations of prison \nsystems and their multi-level grievance processes. \nThe screening requirement of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1915A rein-\nforces this notion, as judges already ensure compli-\nance with other aspects of the PLRA. This knowledge \nbase has well prepared the judiciary to settle ques-\ntions surrounding exhaustion under the PLRA. \nThese considerations provide sufficient reason to \ntreat the disposition of questions of fact concerning ex-\nhaustion like many other factfinding responsibilities \nceded to judges in the normal course of litigation.  \nII. The Seventh Amendment does not preserve \nthe right to a jury trial on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion even when those fac-\ntual questions are intertwined with the un-\nderlying merits. \nAt common law, the Seventh Amendment did not \npreserve the right to a jury trial on equitable defenses \nsuch as exhaustion. Following the merger of the courts \nof law and equity in 1938, however, courts have recog-\nnized that \u201c[d]ifficulties may arise . . . when the legal \nand equitable issues overlap and the evidence is inter-\ntwined.\u201d Danjaq LLC v. Sony Corp., 263 F.3d 942, 962 \n(9th Cir. 2001); Ross v. Bernhard, 396 U.S. 531, 536\u2013\n39 (1970). This Court has held that, as a prudential \nmatter, where factual issues overlap between legal \nand equitable issues, jury-triable issues should \n\n38 \n \ngenerally be prioritized. See, e.g., Beacon Theatres, \n359 U.S. at 510\u201311; Dairy Queen, Inc. v. Wood, 369 \nU.S. 469, 472\u201373 (1962).  \nBut exhaustion remains a threshold precondition \nto suit that, by its nature, must be determined before \nthe merits. With that that order of operation in mind, \nthis Court has applied the Beacon Theatres principle \nonly where an equitable claim could, through collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata, bar a subsequent jury \ntrial on a legal claim. Exhaustion does not present \nsuch a circumstance. And, in any event, this Court has \nconsidered departure from the Beacon Theatres pru-\ndential rule when it would undercut congressional in-\ntent, as it would here. For these reasons, Richards \ndoes not have a jury trial right on factual questions \nconcerning exhaustion\u2014even when those questions \nare intertwined with the merits of his claims.  \nA. Beacon Theatres created a presumption \nthat juries should decide intertwined le-\ngal and equitable issues, but that pre-\nsumption does not apply here.  \nBeacon Theatres stands for the proposition that, \nwhere legal and equitable claims are grounded in the \nsame set of facts, the right to a jury trial on the legal \nclaims should prevail, precluding a prior determina-\ntion of the equitable claims. This \u201cgeneral prudential \nrule,\u201d Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 334, is primarily \nconcerned with the collateral estoppel or res judicata \neffect that an inverse ordering would present, id. See \nalso Katchen v. Landy, 382 U.S. 323, 339\u201340 (1966) \n(explaining that Beacon Theatres announced an \u201cequi-\ntable doctrine,\u201d not a bright-line rule). Consequently, \n\n39 \n \nall order-of-trial problems should, \u201cwherever possi-\nble,\u201d be resolved in favor of granting a jury trial to pre-\nserve the Seventh Amendment right. Beacon Thea-\ntres, 359 U.S. at 510. The resolution of an exhaustion \nquestion, however, does not present such a scenario.  \nBeacon Theatres involved a dispute between two \ntheatres regarding the validity of contracts in which \nthe film distributors had given one of the theatres, \nFox, the exclusive right to show \u201cfirst run pictures\u201d in \nthe area. Id. at 502. Because another theatre, Beacon, \n\u201cnotified Fox that it considered [the] contracts . . . to \nbe overt acts in violation of antitrust laws,\u201d id., Fox \nfiled suit seeking both declaratory judgment and an \ninjunction against Beacon asserting an antitrust \nclaim against it. Id. at 502\u201303. Beacon then filed a \ncounterclaim and cross-claim that the contracts vio-\nlated antitrust laws and requested treble damages. Id. \nat 503. Despite an issue of common fact among the \ncomplaint and counterclaim and Beacon\u2019s request for \na jury trial on legal issues, the district court ordered \nFox\u2019s claims, which were traditional suits in equity, to \nbe tried by the court before a determination of Bea-\ncon\u2019s claims. Id. at 503\u201304. The court of appeals af-\nfirmed, holding that the district judge could try the \nequitable claim first, even if it might preclude a jury \ntrial on the legal claims. Id. at 505.  \nThis Court disagreed. Reasoning that trying the \nequitable claims first could, by way of collateral estop-\npel or res judicata, bar a subsequent trial on the mer-\nits of Beacon\u2019s legal claims, the Court held that order-\nof-trial problems be resolved in favor of granting a \njury trial unless there are \u201cimperative circumstances, \ncircumstances which in view of the flexible procedures \n\n40 \n \nof the Federal Rules we cannot now anticipate.\u201d Id. at \n508; see id. at 504 (\u201c[I]f Beacon would have been enti-\ntled to a jury trial in a treble damage suit against Fox, \nit cannot be deprived of the right merely because Fox \ntook advantage of the availability of declaratory relief \nto sue Beacon first.\u201d); see also Parklane Hosiery, 439 \nU.S. at 333 (\u201cRecognition that an equitable determi-\nnation could have collateral-estoppel effect in a subse-\nquent legal action was the major premise of . . . Beacon \nTheatres.\u201d).  \nDairy Queen, decided three years later, involved \nsimilar timing concerns. There, the claims were both \nlegal (monetary damages for breach of contract) and \nequitable (relief in the form of injunction), and the dis-\ntrict court denied the defendants\u2019 demand for a jury \ntrial on the ground that the jury claim was only \u201cinci-\ndental\u201d to the non-jury claim. 369 U.S. at 470. This \nCourt, relying on Beacon Theatres, explained that \u201cthe \nright to trial by jury may [not] be lost as to legal issues \nwhere those are characterized as \u2018incidental\u2019 to equi-\ntable issues.\u201d Id. Again, the Court was concerned with \nthe preclusive effect that a determination on equitable \nissues would have on legal ones. Id. at 472\u201373. \nBeacon Theatres is therefore instructive in deter-\nmining the order of trial on merits-based arguments. \nWhere a party has a right to a jury trial on a legal \nclaim, the order of trial should be arranged to preserve \nthat right. This is consistent with \u201c[t]he limitation im-\nposed by the [Seventh] [A]mendment . . . that the ul-\ntimate determination of issues of fact by the jury be \nnot interfered with.\u201d In re Peterson, 253 U.S. at 310 \n(emphasis added); see also Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 \n(asking \u201cwhether a particular issue . . . is itself \n\n41 \n \nnecessarily a jury issue, the guarantee being essential \nto preserve the right to a jury\u2019s resolution of the ulti-\nmate dispute\u201d). \nExhaustion questions, whether intertwined with \nthe merits or not, do not raise the same concerns as \nthose in Beacon Theatres for two interrelated reasons. \nFirst, unlike the substantive claims in Beacon Thea-\ntres, exhaustion is a threshold precondition to reach-\ning the merits. Second, unlike the concerns of collat-\neral estoppel or res judicata in Beacon Theatres, a \njudge\u2019s factual findings on exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s ability to consider those same facts when \ndetermining the merits of the legal claim.  \n1. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause exhaustion is a threshold issue \nthat is logically precedent to the mer-\nits.  \nBeacon Theatres involved competing causes of ac-\ntion\u2014claims for declaratory and injunctive relief on \nthe one hand and claims for treble damages on the \nother. Under the historical equity-first order of opera-\ntions, see Liberty Oil Co., 260 U.S. at 242, the latter \nmerits claims would have been bound by the determi-\nnation of the former and thus never tried before a jury. \nThis Court held that this would violate the Seventh \nAmendment.  \nNo such scenario is present here. Unlike the \nclaims at issue in Beacon Theatres, exhaustion is a \nthreshold precondition to suit that, by its nature, \nmust be determined before the merits. Given that it is \na rule of \u201corderly\u201d procedure, Sing Tuck, 194 U.S. at \n\n42 \n \n168, \u201c[u]ntil the issue of exhaustion is resolved, a \ncourt cannot know whether it is to decide the case or \nthe prison authorities are to,\u201d Pavey, 544 F.3d at 741. \nSee also Perez v. Wis. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 182 F.3d 532, 534 \n(7th Cir. 1999) (explaining that exhaustion is \u201cde-\nsigned to prevent [a] decision on the merits\u201d). To do \notherwise would flip exhaustion on its head\u2014defer-\nence to agency authority would be bypassed and judi-\ncial efficiency lost. See McCarthy, 503 U.S. at 145; Pe-\nrez, 182 F.3d at 534 (explaining that \u201c[e]xamining the \nmerits first and then ordering a case dismissed on ex-\nhaustion grounds . . . would disregard the statutory \napproach\u201d).  \nBecause exhaustion is a threshold issue, it does \nnot have any bearing on a prisoner\u2019s jury trial right. \nIndeed, \u201c \u2018[t]he Seventh Amendment does not confer \nthe right to a trial, but only the right to have a jury \nhear the case once it is determined that the litigation \nshould proceed before a court.\u2019 \u201d Caley, 428 F.3d at \n1372 (quoting Am. Heritage Life Ins. Co., 294 F.3d at \n711); see also Sydnor v. Conseco Fin. Serv. Corp., 252 \nF.3d 302, 307 (4th Cir. 2001) (same). In contrast to \nBeacon Theatres, in which there were competing equi-\ntable and legal causes of action, exhaustion presents \na threshold precondition to suit. Legal claims that are \nsubject to trial by jury may be tried by that jury only \nafter determination of the threshold issue. Beacon \nTheatres is therefore distinguishable and does not \ncompel a different result.  \n\n43 \n \n2. The presumption does not apply be-\ncause a judge\u2019s factual findings re-\ngarding exhaustion would not pre-\nclude a jury\u2019s consideration of the \nsame facts when determining the \nmerits of the legal claim.  \nThis case differs from Beacon Theatres for a sec-\nond reason. A jury can reexamine factual determina-\ntion made by a judge regarding exhaustion when de-\nciding the merits of the claim.  \nBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen involved \ncircumstances in which the right to a jury trial on a \nlegal issue would be lost through the determination of \nan equitable issue. And Beacon Theatres itself recog-\nnized that there would be cases in which a trial court \nhas \u201cdiscretion in deciding whether the legal or equi-\ntable cause should be tried first,\u201d 359 U.S. at 510, \nkeeping in mind that this discretion \u201cmust, wherever \npossible, be exercised to preserve jury trial.\u201d Id. See \nalso Markman, 517 U.S. at 377 (asking whether the \njury must hear this question to \u201cpreserve the \u2018sub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u2019 \u201d) \n(quoting Tull, 481 U.S. at 426) (emphasis omitted). \nHere, that right can be preserved through a jury\u2019s \nability to reexamine the fact questions common to ex-\nhaustion and the underlying legal claim at trial. As \nexplained in Pavey:  \n[A]ny finding that the judge makes, relating \nto exhaustion, that might affect the merits \nmay be reexamined by the jury if\u2014and only \nafter\u2014the prisoner overcomes the exhaustion \ndefense and the case proceeds to the merits. \n544 F.3d at 742.  \n\n44 \n \nThis approach is consistent with the \u201cflexible\u201d na-\nture of collateral estoppel. Duvall v. Att\u2019y Gen. of the \nUnited States, 436 F.3d 382, 390 (3d Cir. 2006) \n(\u201cCourts and commentators have consistently recog-\nnized that collateral estoppel was borne of equity and \nis therefore \u2018flexible,\u2019 bending to satisfy its underlying \npurpose in light of the nature of the proceedings.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted); United States v. Stauffer Chem. Co., \n464 U.S. 165, 176 (1984) (White, J., concurring) (ex-\nplaining that collateral estoppel \u201cis a flexible, judge-\nmade doctrine\u201d). Cf. Parklane Hosiery, 439 U.S. at 331 \n(explaining that trial courts have \u201cbroad discretion\u201d in \ndetermining \nwhen \noffensive \ncollateral \nestoppel \n\u201cshould be applied\u201d). \nPavey\u2019s pragmatic approach disposes of the pri-\nmary concern at issue in Beacon Theatres and Dairy \nQueen\u2014namely, that the \u201cright to a jury trial of legal \nissues [would] be lost through prior determination of \nequitable claims.\u201d 359 U.S. at 511 (citation omitted). \nFollowing Pavey\u2019s approach, \u201c[i]f and when the judge \ndetermines that the prisoner has properly exhausted \nhis administrative remedies, the case will proceed to \npretrial discovery, and if necessary a trial, on the mer-\nits[.]\u201d 544 F.3d at 742; see also id. at 741 (explaining \nthat \u201cin many cases the only consequence of a failure \nto exhaust is that the prisoner must go back to the \nbottom rung of the administrative ladder\u201d).4 Then, \u201cif \nthere is a jury trial, the jury will make all necessary \nfindings of fact without being bound by (or even \n \n4 This approach also allays the concerns in Fireman\u2019s Fund, \nwhich the Sixth Circuit relied on below, that \u201cthe merits of a con-\ntroversy could be summarily decided\u201d \u201cwithout the ordinary inci-\ndents of trial.\u201d 253 F.2d at 784 (citing Smithers v. Smith, 204 \nU.S. 632, 645 (1907)).  \n\n45 \n \ninformed of) any of the findings made by the district \njudge in determining that the prisoner had exhausted \nhis administrative remedies.\u201d5 Id. In short, the \u201csub-\nstance of the common-law right of trial by jury\u201d is pre-\nserved. Colgrove, 413 U.S. at 156.  \nOf course, some prisoners will be unable to refile \ntheir lawsuit after a judge\u2019s determination that they \nfailed to properly exhaust administrative remedies. \nSee Pavey, 544 F.3d at 742 (explaining that where a \njudge decides that \u201cthe failure to exhaust was the pris-\noner\u2019s fault . . . the case is over\u201d). But this is simply a \nconsequence of the exhaustion requirement function-\ning as intended. See, e.g., Woodford, 548 U.S. at 89\u2013\n92 (discussing the purposes of exhaustion); id. at 95 \n(\u201cA prisoner who does not want to participate in the \nprison grievance system will have little incentive to \ncomply with the system\u2019s procedural rules unless non-\ncompliance carries a sanction.\u201d). And again, this con-\nsequence has no bearing on the Seventh Amendment, \nwhich guarantees a jury trial only after it is deter-\nmined that the case belongs in court.  \n \n5 As recognized in Pavey, the ability of a prisoner to refile a case \nafter proper exhaustion \u201cdistinguishes the issue of exhaustion \nfrom [other] deadline lines issues that juries decide.\u201d Id. at 741. \nFor example, \u201c[a] statute of limitations defense if successfully in-\nterposed ends the litigation rather than shunting it to another \nforum.\u201d Id.; see also Messa, 652 F.3d at 309\u201310 (explaining that \nthe doctrines of exhaustion and statutes of limitations \u201cplay . . . \nimportant\u2014and distinct\u2014roles in our system of justice\u201d) (cita-\ntion omitted).  \n\n46 \n \nB. Unlike in Beacon Theatres, a judicial de-\ntermination of exhaustion would imple-\nment congressional intent.  \nEven assuming Beacon Theatres applies generally \nto threshold issues that would not implicate the jury\u2019s \nultimate determination of the merits, its presumption \nshould not apply in the PLRA exhaustion context.  \nPost-Beacon Theatres, this Court has noted the \nlimitations of its order-of-trial presumption. In \nKatchen, for example, the Court explained that \u201c[b]oth \nBeacon Theatres and Dairy Queen recognize that \nthere might be situations in which the Courts could \nproceed to resolve the equitable claims first even \nthough the results might be dispositive of the issues \ninvolved in the legal claim.\u201d 382 U.S. at 339 (emphasis \nadded). The Katchen Court addressed \u201cthe mode of \nprocedure for trying out the issue\u201d of voidable prefer-\nences against an estate in bankruptcy proceedings. \n382 U.S. at 325, 326. Recognizing the equitable juris-\ndiction of bankruptcy courts and the \u201cspecific statu-\ntory scheme contemplating the prompt trial of a dis-\nputed claim but without the intervention of a jury,\u201d \nthis Court permitted a bankruptcy court to decide the \npreference issues in an equitable proceeding notwith-\nstanding the argument that it would \u201crender unneces-\nsary a trial in a [legal] action.\u201d Id. at 336, 339. The \nCourt rejected the petitioner\u2019s reliance on Beacon The-\natres and Dairy Queen, noting that the rule of those \ncases \u201cis itself an equitable doctrine\u201d and that appli-\ncation of the rule would \u201cdismember a scheme which \nCongress has prescribed.\u201d Id. at 339; see also id. at \n339\u201340 (\u201cBoth Beacon Theatres and Dairy Queen rec-\nognize that there might be situations in which the \nCourt could proceed to resolve the equitable claim \n\n47 \n \nfirst even though the results might be dispositive of \nthe issues involved in the legal claim.\u201d); but see Gran-\nfinanciera, 492 U.S. at 58\u201359 (noting the limitations \non the scope of Congress\u2019s ability to \u201cdivest [parties] of \ntheir Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial\u201d).  \nAs in Katchen, this case involves a specific statu-\ntory scheme whose purpose would be compromised ab-\nsent prompt resolution of disputed facts by the court. \nSee Katchen, 383 U.S. at 339. Congress passed the \nPLRA \u201cto reduce the quantity and improve the quality \nof prisoner suits.\u201d Porter, 534 U.S. at 524. The \u201cinvig-\norated\u201d exhaustion requirements is the \u201ccenterpiece\u201d \nof this legislation, Woodford, 548 U.S. at 84, and it \nserves dual purposes. It allows prisons to rectify their \nown mistakes before they are \u201chaled into federal \ncourt,\u201d id. at 89, and promotes judicial efficiency by \nreducing litigation and creating an administrative \nrecord for the litigation that does occur, id. \nAllowing potentially unexhausted claims to pro-\nceed to a jury trial subverts both purposes. See also \nPart I(B)(4). This subversion is further reason why the \nprudential rule set forth in Beacon Theatres should \nnot apply to PLRA exhaustion.  \nThat an exhaustion question is intertwined with \nthe merits of a prisoner\u2019s claim does not transform ex-\nhaustion into a jury-triable issue. Exhaustion is a \nthreshold issue that is logically precedent to the mer-\nits. And Beacon Theatres\u2019 presumption would not ap-\nply where any judicial determination of overlapping \nfacts remains subject to later review by a jury in a trial \non the merits. Finally, that a judicial determination of  \n \n \n\n48 \n \nexhaustion would implement congressional intent \nserves as yet another reason why Beacon Theatres\u2019 \nprudential rule should not apply to exhaustion ques-\ntions. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be  \nreversed.  \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nAnn M.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation has decisively filled the \"argumentative gap\" I previously identified, providing the substantive arguments for the Respondent's position via a key amicus brief. This significantly shifts my predictive model.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Question:** Stable. The case remains focused on the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial for PLRA exhaustion disputes where facts are intertwined with the merits.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** Stable. Perttu's argument rests on the historical analog of PLRA exhaustion as an **equitable defense**, which would be decided by a judge. The new observation does not alter my understanding of this position, but it provides the powerful counter-narrative.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** **Significantly Updated and Elaborated.** The Cato Institute's amicus brief has filled the major void in my understanding of the Respondent's case. My knowledge has evolved from a simple reliance on the \"plea in traverse\" concept from the BIO to a multi-faceted constitutional and policy argument. The key pillars of this position are now understood to be:\n    *   **Broad Historical Framing:** The argument is not just about a specific common-law writ, but about the fundamental *purpose* of the Seventh Amendment. The Cato brief powerfully frames the civil jury as a \"vital check on state power,\" specifically intended to prevent government officials from using procedural mechanisms (like the historical vice-admiralty courts) to evade scrutiny by a jury of peers. This is a much more robust historical analog than a simple \"plea in traverse.\"\n    *   **Constitutional Separation of Powers:** The argument asserts that juries are the constitutionally designated fact-finders (*Dimick v. Schiedt*). Since the question of whether administrative remedies were \"available\" is a factual dispute (e.g., did the officer destroy the grievances?), it must be resolved by a jury, not a judge.\n    *   **Pragmatic Policy Argument:** The brief highlights the \"self-evident moral hazard\" of allowing prison officials, who have a direct stake in the outcome, to control the grievance process and then have a judge, not a jury, decide factual disputes about whether that process was thwarted. It cites *Ross v. Blake* for the principle that remedies are unavailable when \"thwart[ed]...through machination, misrepresentation, or intimidation.\"\n    - **Preservation of the Ultimate Right:** Citing the \"intertwined facts\" doctrine, the argument is that allowing a judge to make a dispositive factual finding on exhaustion would effectively nullify the prisoner's core Seventh Amendment right to have a jury decide the merits of their \u00a7 1983 claim.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** **Updated and Shifted.** The predictive state has moved from a **50/50 toss-up** to a **clear lean in favor of the Respondent (Richards)**. The previous state of paralysis is broken. The \"equitable defense\" argument from the Petitioner now faces a formidable, multi-pronged counter-argument grounded in constitutional history, separation of powers, and the practical realities of the prison system. The Respondent's position, as articulated by Cato, appears more constitutionally resonant and aligned with the historical purpose of the Seventh Amendment as a check on government actors. My confidence has shifted, and I now predict a higher probability of reversal (in favor of Richards).",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for a strategic pivot and adds a new layer of sophistication to my understanding of how to use different types of legal documents.\n\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** Confirmed.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** **Evolved and Validated.** The corollary that one must pivot when a primary source is inaccessible has been proven highly effective. The failure to find the Respondent's brief was correctly diagnosed, and the pivot to amicus briefs was the correct strategic response.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** **Confirmed and Refined.** The search results included a Certificate of Compliance and Affidavit of Service. These documents, while not substantive, served as valuable \"information scent,\" confirming the existence and filing date of the main brief before I even opened it.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** **Validated.** The shift from \"refine the query\" to \"change the target document type\" was a successful strategic leap, not a failure of tactics.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** Confirmed.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** **Strongly Validated.** This principle has been proven to be a cornerstone of effective strategy. The agent's prediction that a libertarian group like the Cato Institute would forcefully argue for the jury right as a check on government power was correct. This brief provided the exact information needed to fill the argumentative gap.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** Strongly Confirmed. The successful resolution of the previously identified gap validates the utility of this diagnostic heuristic.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition:** Confirmed.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors:** **Confirmed and Deepened.** The Cato brief reinforces the importance of anchors like *City of Monterey* and *Ross v. Blake*, demonstrating how they are woven into a compelling narrative.\n16. **The Battle of Historical Analogs:** **Deepened.** My understanding has evolved. The battle is not merely a technical matching of old writs to new procedures. It is a battle of historical *narratives*. The Cato brief's narrative about the *purpose* of the Seventh Amendment (checking government power) is far more expansive and potentially persuasive than a narrow focus on a single type of plea.\n17. **The \"Exception vs. Application\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n18. **Diagnosing Search Failures:** Confirmed.\n19. **Tool Skepticism and Verification:** Confirmed.\n20. **Information Scent and Pivoting:** **Strongly Validated.** This observation is the successful outcome of the pivot initiated in the previous step. The \"cold scent\" for the Respondent's brief led to a pivot that found a \"hot scent\" with the amicus brief. This confirms the heuristic's practical value.\n21. **New Heuristic - The \"Philosophical Framing\" Heuristic:** Amicus briefs from ideologically-motivated groups are uniquely valuable not just for their legal arguments, but for the broader historical and philosophical *framing* they provide. The Cato brief's focus on \"liberty,\" \"tyranny,\" and the jury as a \"bulwark\" against the sovereign is a distinct form of persuasion that can be highly influential and provides context that a party's more technical brief might lack. This framing is a key piece of the predictive puzzle."

The case remains focused on the Seventh Amendment right to a jury trial for PLRA exhaustion disputes where facts are intertwined with the merits.\n2.  **Petitioner's Position (Perttu):** **Significantly Updated and Elaborated.** I have now moved from the summary of arguments in the cert petition to the full, detailed reasoning in the merits brief. This provides a much more robust and technical foundation for their position. The core argument that PLRA exhaustion is an equitable defense decided by a judge is now broken down into two major prongs:\n    *   **Argument I: The Seventh Amendment does not apply to exhaustion at all.**\n        *   **Threshold Issue:** Judges can always decide facts related to threshold, non-merits issues.\n        *   **Historical/Equitable Analog:** This is the heart of their case. They argue that since exhaustion did not exist at common law in 1791, the court must look for the closest historical analog. They assert the closest analogs are **equitable defenses** which were historically decided by judges.\n        *   **Specified Analogs:** They concretize this by likening PLRA exhaustion to doctrines like *forum non conveniens*, abstention doctrines (*Younger*, *Burford*), and the requirement to exhaust state remedies in habeas corpus.\n        *   **Functional Rationale:** Citing *Markman v. Westview Instruments*, they argue that functional considerations\u2014namely, the unique expertise of judges and the importance of implementing the PLRA's goal of filtering frivolous lawsuits\u2014favor having a judge decide the issue.\n    *   **Argument II: Even if facts are intertwined, the Seventh Amendment right is not implicated.**\n        *   **The *Beacon Theatres* Exception:** They argue that the presumption from *Beacon Theatres* (that a jury must decide factual issues common to both legal and equitable claims) does not apply here for two key reasons.\n        *   **\"Logically Precedent\":** First, exhaustion is a threshold issue that is \"logically precedent\" to the merits, not a competing claim running in parallel.\n        *   **No Preclusion (The Linchpin):** Second, and most critically, they argue that a judge's factual findings on exhaustion **would not have a preclusive (collateral estoppel) effect** on a jury's later consideration of the merits. In their view, a judge could find the prisoner failed to prove he was thwarted for the *purpose of exhaustion*, but a jury could still later find he *was* thwarted for the *purpose of his underlying retaliation claim*. This is their direct answer to the \"intertwined facts\" problem.\n        *   **Congressional Intent:** They argue that judicial determination of exhaustion *implements* Congressional intent (the PLRA's gatekeeping function), distinguishing it from cases like *Beacon Theatres* where judicial action might frustrate a jury trial right.\n3.  **Respondent's Position (Richards):** Stable. My understanding of the Respondent's position, primarily informed by the Cato Institute amicus brief, remains unchanged. It is grounded in the historical purpose of the jury as a check on government power, the constitutional role of the jury as fact-finder, and the practical moral hazard of letting government officials police themselves without jury oversight. The key test will be how the Respondent's own merits brief (which I have not yet seen) counters the Petitioner's specific \"no preclusion\" argument.\n4.  **The Central Clash & Predictive State:** **Updated and Rebalanced.** The central clash is now more technical and sharply defined. It is not just a battle of historical narratives (Petitioner's \"equitable procedure\" vs. Respondent's \"jury as a bulwark against tyranny\"). It is now also a direct confrontation over the scope of the *Beacon Theatres* doctrine and the technical application of collateral estoppel. The Petitioner's \"no preclusion\" argument is a sophisticated attempt to sidestep the entire \"intertwined facts\" problem.\n    *   My predictive state has shifted from a **clear lean in favor of the Respondent (Richards)** to a **slight lean in favor of the Respondent**. The Petitioner's argument is stronger and more technically sound than I had previously understood. The \"no preclusion\" argument, while perhaps feeling like a legal fiction, provides a plausible path for the Court to rule for the Petitioner without overturning precedent. However, the practical awkwardness of having a judge and jury potentially find the same fact differently in the same case may be unappealing. The Respondent's broader, constitutionally-grounded argument about the jury's purpose still feels more fundamental. The case is now much closer to a 55-45 or 60-40 proposition, pending review of the Respondent's direct rebuttal.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a \"failed\" search that yielded a critical document, refines my understanding of search strategy and reinforces the core principle of prioritizing primary source analysis.\n\n1.  **Cert Petition as Primary Source:** Confirmed.\n2.  **\"Split, Statute, Constitution\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n3.  **Prioritization within Documents:** Confirmed.\n4.  **Sequential, Dialectical Analysis:** **Strongly Validated and Deepened.** This observation perfectly illustrates the dialectical process. I had the Respondent's argument (Antithesis) and now have the Petitioner's full Merits Brief (a new, stronger Thesis). The next essential step is to find the Respondent's Merits Brief to see their direct response (the new Antithesis), followed by the Petitioner's Reply Brief (the final Synthesis). This iterative, point-counterpoint approach is essential for accurate prediction.\n5.  **Primary Source Primacy:** **Strongly Validated.** The Petitioner's Merits Brief contained a crucial, technical argument (the \"no preclusion\" theory) that was not fully developed or apparent in the cert-stage petition. This confirms that for a high-fidelity prediction, there is no substitute for analyzing the full merits briefs from the parties themselves.\n6.  **The Critical Role of Metacognitive Synthesis:** Confirmed.\n7.  **The Value of Metadata:** Confirmed.\n8.  **Tracking Procedural Posture:** Confirmed.\n9.  **Search Strategy Refinement:** Confirmed.\n10. **Reflective Action Planning:** Confirmed.\n11. **The \"Off-Ramp\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n12. **Value of Ideologically-Aligned Amici:** Confirmed.\n13. **Identifying the \"Argumentative Gap\":** Confirmed.\n14. **Value of Briefs in Opposition:** Confirmed.\n15. **Tracking Doctrinal Anchors:** **Deepened.** The Petitioner's brief clearly lays out the doctrinal battleground. They seek to frame the case under the logic of *Markman* (functionalism) and *Katchen v. Landy* (statutory schemes), while explicitly trying to distinguish it from *Beacon Theatres* (intertwined facts). Mapping the case onto these competing lines of precedent is a key predictive task.\n16. **The Battle of Historical Analogs:** **Deepened.** The Petitioner has now named their specific analogs: equitable defenses like forum non conveniens and abstention. This moves the debate from a general appeal to \"equity\" to a more concrete comparison of specific legal doctrines, which I must now evaluate against the Respondent's broader historical narrative.\n17. **The \"Exception vs. Application\" Framework:** Confirmed.\n18. **Diagnosing Search Failures:** **Refined.** My search for the \"reply brief\" failed to return that document. However, it returned the main \"merits brief,\" which was even more valuable at this stage. This refines the heuristic: a query that fails to return the *intended* document is not a strategic failure if it results in significant, relevant information gain.\n19. **Tool Skepticism and Verification:** Confirmed.\n20. **Information Scent and Pivoting:** Confirmed.\n21. **The \"Philosophical Framing\" Heuristic:** Confirmed.\n22. **New Heuristic - \"Unexpected Search Windfalls\":** A search query that \"fails\" on its explicit terms can still be a success if it uncovers an equally or more valuable document that was not the original target. The ultimate goal is information gain, not perfect query execution. My search for a reply brief yielding the main merits brief is a prime example.\n23. **New Heuristic - \"Argumentative Linchpin\" Identification:** In a complex brief, it is critical to identify the single argument upon which a major part of the case hinges. For the Petitioner, their entire response to the \"intertwined facts\" problem rests on the \"no preclusion\" argument. Identifying this linchpin focuses future research and analysis on the viability of that specific point, as the Court's acceptance or rejection of it could be dispositive."
