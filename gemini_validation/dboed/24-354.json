    "facts_of_the_case": "The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established in 1934 to regulate interstate communications and ensure widespread access to telecommunications services. To further this mission, Congress in 1996 instructed the FCC to establish and maintain a universal service fund, requiring telecommunications carriers to contribute quarterly based on their revenues. The FCC partners with the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), a private entity, to manage this process\u2014USAC calculates projected demand and contribution factors using FCC formulas, submits these proposals to the FCC for approval, and then uses the approved figures to determine individual contribution amounts.\n\nConsumers\u2019 Research challenged the constitutionality of the 1996 Telecommunications Act\u2019s universal service requirements and the FCC\u2019s implementation of those requirements. Their primary arguments were twofold: first, that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC through the universal service provisions, and second, that the FCC improperly delegated its authority to a private entity (USAC) to manage the universal service fund.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the petition, finding no constitutional violations in either delegation. The Court determined that Congress provided sufficient guidance (an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d) to the FCC in the statute, and that the FCC maintained adequate control and oversight over USAC\u2019s activities in managing the universal service fund, preventing any improper delegation of government authority to a private entity.",

Wallison & John Yoo eds., Am. Enter. Inst. 2022). Administrative law lies at the intersection of civics, political science, and constitutional law, with each field contributing to the structure of and justification for the administrative state that governs much of contemporary life. Fortunately, administrative law attracts some of the brightest and most prolific scholars in the academy and legal profession. Through books, articles, and blog posts, they regularly debate the competing positions on how the regulatory state should be structured and how a particular architecture advances the public interest while remaining faithful (or not) to the tenets of the three fields noted above. There is an enormous body of literature in this field, and, given the subject\u2019s importance, there is no reason to believe that this scholarly output will slow down in the foreseeable future.[1] A recently published book\u2014The Administrative State Before the Supreme Court: Perspectives on the Nondelegation Doctrine\u2014is a timely and valuable contribution to that literature.[2] It addresses a subject of intense scrutiny in today\u2019s administrative law scholarship: the Nondelegation Doctrine.[3] Nondelegation literature focuses on the issue of what limits, if any, there are on Congress\u2019s ability to delegate to agencies the power to adopt rules that bind the public.[4] The editors, Peter Wallison and John Yoo, persuaded more than a dozen scholars and practitioners to examine the Nondelegation Doctrine and draft predictions about its future. The authors do not disappoint. The collection of essays brings to mind a remark made by President John F. Kennedy at a White House dinner for Nobel laureates. With his typical eloquence, President Kennedy said that \u201cthis is the most extraordinary collection of talent . . . that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\u201d[5] The same could be said about Nondelegation Perspectives. The goal of this book review is to do justice to the essayists and their work in this valuable book. The vitality of the Nondelegation Doctrine is an important public policy issue. Statutes and rules reflect a tradeoff between often-conflicting values, such as \u201chuman health versus economic growth.\u201d[6] Different people balance those interests differently, and the theory of our system is that the electorate chooses representatives to express its different views. But the citizenry elects none of the executive agency officials whom Congress vests with the authority to manage the national government\u2019s business, which perennially raises questions about the administrative state\u2019s legitimate role in governance.[7] Moreover, \u201c[a]dministrative agencies are issuing about 3,000 regulations with the force of law each year, roughly 28 times the number of public laws enacted annually by the Congress.\u201d[8] The legitimacy of delegated administrative governance, therefore, is no small potatoes matter. The Supreme Court has allowed Congress to use broadly and imprecisely written laws to substitute appointed for elected officials as policymakers. A vibrant Nondelegation Doctrine would return to the public a sizeable portion of its ability to choose its lawmakers. Part I of this review will summarize the Nondelegation Doctrine for the benefit of readers who are unfamiliar with it. (Administrative law professors, scholars, practitioners, and buffs can skip ahead to Part II). Part II will summarize the essays in Nondelegation Perspectives and discuss how they hope not only to advance the ball down the field, but also to persuade the most important potential participants\u2014the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\u2014to play the game. Part III will offer an observation from a fan of the game. I. Nondelegation Stirrings The Constitution is a delegation of \u201cPowers\u201d[9] from \u201cWe the People of the United States\u201d[10] to three different branches of a newly created national government.[11] Article I vests \u201call legislative Power\u201d over specified issues[12] in a Congress comprised of a Senate and a House of Representatives;[13] both chambers must agree to pass a law, and then persuade the President to sign it.[14] To ensure that most law-making happens in state legislatures and state courts, Article I makes the federal legislative process slow, deliberate, and onerous. To ensure that the electorate can hold legislators accountable for their votes, Article I also requires transparency by forcing each legislator\u2019s votes to be made public and requiring each chamber to keep a publicly available \u201cJournal of its Proceedings.\u201d[15] The predominant 18th-century legal theory also held that a legislature could not hand its lawmaking responsibilities over to an executive official.[16] The theory was that the people had delegated that authority to elected officials, and those officials could not abandon their post by vesting it\u2014and its attendant accountability\u2014in someone else. At least that was the theory.[17] From its earliest days, however, Congress empowered executive officials to find facts that triggered or eliminated the need for application of a particular law.[18] The Supreme Court saw no constitutional objection to that practice. As Chief Justice William Howard Taft wrote in J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, Congress may delegate to the executive the power to find facts or apply the law to the facts as long as Congress affords the President an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d that he or she must use.[19] Over time, however, Congress began to expand the authority of executive officials beyond the factfinding and law-applying responsibilities at issue in the Supreme Court\u2019s early decisions. Now, Congress sought to palm off difficult policy choices by delegating its lawmaking power to federal agencies with only the vaguest guidance as to how they should exercise it. Some delegations merely provide that an agency must act \u201cin the public interest,\u201d a requirement that would seem to apply without Congress even saying it.[20] Despite the tectonic shift in the practice of delegation, the Supreme Court did not enforce separation of powers principles by demanding that Congress itself use its legislative power. In fact, but for two 1935 decisions holding unconstitutional delegations to executive officials,[21] the Court has sustained every federal law challenged on this ground.[22] The Court explained why in Mistretta v. United States, where it reasoned (if starting from a premise that assumes the conclusion counts as \u201creasoning\u201d) that \u201cCongress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.\u201d[23] The Nondelegation Doctrine looked dead.[24] Nonetheless, several commentators have attempted to revive the doctrine over the last few decades.[25] They have argued that the Nondelegation Doctrine can and should address the economic, social, and political ills that result from the relentless growth of the administrative state. Among those ills are the continually expanding power regulators have over public and private life; the unwillingness of Congress to do anything other than shovel more responsibility over to unelected executive officials to avoid taking responsibility for making hard choices; and the ceaseless parade of Presidents succumbing to their desire to undertake ever more regal governance of what they treat as their kingdom. Those baneful consequences, this insurgency notes, followed from the Supreme Court\u2019s willful refusal to enforce the separation of powers principles that a vital Nondelegation Doctrine would protect. In 1980, the Supreme Court offered a tantalizing suggestion that there might be life left in the Nondelegation Doctrine.[26] Perhaps, the doctrine would become a phoenix rather than a corpse. But that hint was all we saw; there was nary a holding.[27] The Court declined several later opportunities to revive the doctrine.[28] The Court did so even in a case asking whether Congress could delegate taxation authority to an agency, a subject of particular interest to the Founding Generation.[29] At the beginning of the new century, Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to dash all hope for a rebirth of the Nondelegation Doctrine. Writing for the Court in 2001 in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, he rejected the argument that Congress had unconstitutionally delegated lawmaking power to the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator by allowing her to set an ambient air quality standard containing \u201can adequate margin of safety\u201d that is \u201crequisite to protect the public health.\u201d[30] With the American Trucking decision, whatever hope there was for a rebirth of the Nondelegation Doctrine seemed to have vanished. But in 2019, five Justices expressed a willingness in two different cases\u2014Gundy v. United States[31] and Paul v. United States[32]\u2014to reconsider the Court\u2019s Nondelegation Doctrine precedents. Gundy was a nondelegation challenge to a provision in the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)[33] directing the U.S. Attorney General to decide whether the act\u2019s provisions should apply to offenders convicted before the act became law.[34] The nondelegation issue arose because SORNA did not identify any factors that the Attorney General should consider or any finding that the Attorney General must make when deciding whether to apply SORNA retroactively. Put into Nondelegation Doctrine terms, SORNA identified no \u201cintelligible principle\u201d for the Attorney General to use, even though the presence of some such standard had been critical to the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence. Only eight Justices participated in the Gundy decision because Justice Brett Kavanaugh had not yet joined the Court. The Court upheld the SORNA delegation to the Attorney General by a 5-3 vote, but Justice Samuel Alito, who voted with the majority, wrote separately to express his willingness to reconsider the Nondelegation Doctrine in a different case.[35] The three dissenters would have struck down this provision of SORNA as a violation of the Nondelegation Doctrine.[36] That made four Justices willing to breathe life into the doctrine. Paul was a different case involving the same statute, but this time Justice Kavanaugh had joined the Court. In an opinion accompanying the denial of review in Paul given the Court\u2019s ruling in Gundy, Justice Kavanaugh also signaled a willingness to reconsider the Nondelegation Doctrine. That made five Justices willing to revisit the subject. Atop that, another new member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined the roster in 2020, and she has not yet expressed her views on the subject. As a result, there is reason to believe that the Court is now willing to decide whether the Nondelegation Doctrine is a living part of our law or just a phantasm like Jacob Marley\u2019s ghost. Nondelegation Perspectives therefore appears at an auspicious time. It no longer is a hopeless task to argue the Nondelegation Doctrine should be given new life.[37] The book\u2019s essayists make an impressive case that the Court should do just that. II. Laying Out the Playing Field, Defining the Rules of the Game, and Encouraging People to Play The essays in Nondelegation Perspectives fit neatly into three categories. Two of them\u2014the ones by Professors Jonathan Adler and John Harrison[38]\u2014demarcate the playing field within which the Nondelegation Doctrine should operate, thereby limiting its reach. Another group of essays\u2014by Professors Gary Lawson, Michael Rappaport, and David Schoenbrod, as well as by litigators Todd Gaziano and Ethan Bevins of the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) and Mark Chenoweth and Richard Samp of the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA)\u2014offer different rules by which the game should be played.[39] The remaining essays\u2014by Professors Saikrishna Bangalore Prakash and Joseph Postell (along with brief repeat performances by Schoenbrod, Gaziano, and Blevins)\u2014encourage people (read: Supreme Court Justices) to play the game by arguing that the consequences of revitalizing the Nondelegation Doctrine would not be as disastrous as supporters of today\u2019s administrative state would claim.[40] A. Laying Out the Playing Field Rather than start by suggesting an alternative to the J.W. Hampton \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test, Professor Adler takes a step back to consider what should be the boundaries of the Nondelegation Doctrine. Borrowing language from the analysis used in cases applying the Chevron Doctrine, he proposes that the Supreme Court start its nondelegation analysis at what he calls \u201cStep Zero\u201d and ask whether Congress intended to authorize an agency to engage in internal or external regulation. That is, the threshold question should be whether Congress merely empowered government officials to regulate their own performance of the government\u2019s business or instead empowered an agency to regulate the conduct of private parties or the private market. The first kind of delegation concerns the internal operation of (for example) the Postal Service, while the other allows officials to direct the conduct of private parties so that the Post Office can execute its mail delivery responsibilities.[41] The former would allow a Postmaster to decide when to be open for business and whom to hire as a Pony Express rider; the latter, to fix the size and sturdiness of mailboxes for home delivery.[42] The latter is far more intrusive, so it makes sense for courts to decide whether Congress intended to allow agencies to order compliance with federal dictates and, if so, just how far agencies may go. Professor Harrison steps back even further. Like Prof. Adler, he wants courts to distinguish between regulations governing the conduct of government officials and regulations directing the actions of nongovernment parties in the private sector. But he simply would not apply the Nondelegation Doctrine to the former type of actions. The federal government owns and manages property just as private individuals do, as the Constitution recognizes.[43] Professor Harrison asks whether it makes sense for the Nondelegation Doctrine\u2014developed to address Congress\u2019s decisions to vest executive officials with the power to regulate private conduct and private property\u2014to govern how the national government regulates public conduct and public property. He answers that question, \u201cNo.\u201d[44] Professors Adler and Harrison are spot-on about their proposals. Consider the way Professor Adler\u2019s Step Zero proposal is analogous to the common law. The laws of contracts, torts, and crime affect how individuals live and work, but the rules of civil and criminal procedure do not have that effect unless someone is involved in litigation. While it makes sense for Congress to adopt substantive legal rules, Congress could reasonably empower the courts to regulate their own operations, even when the rules they make affect private parties. Deciding what should be contained in a complaint or indictment, an answer or arraignment, or a judgment is precisely the type of task that the Framers might reasonably have believed the judiciary is better suited to than are members of Congress, who are not all lawyers. Professor Adler\u2019s Step Zero proposal asks the Supreme Court to pursue just that type of analysis. It also helps make sense of two Marshall Court decisions that went in different directions regarding delegation. On the one hand, in Wayman v. Southard, Chief Justice John Marshall found unobjectionable a provision in the Judiciary Act of 1789[45] that delegated to the courts the authority to define the necessary elements and format of a judgment;[46] on the other hand, Justice William Johnson, Jr., concluded in United States v. Hudson and Goodwin that the federal courts could not define federal crimes.[47] Step Zero analysis resolves the apparent tension between these decisions by applying the Nondelegation Doctrine to defining substantive crimes, but not to creating procedural rules. Professor Harrison\u2019s essay also offers a valuable insight. Congress\u2019s purpose is to exercise the authority vested in its members to create new federal law to govern the private conduct of the entire nation or some subset of its members in one of the categories set forth in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Once Congress has completed its task, executive officials carry those laws into effect, and courts adjudicate disputes arising under them.[48] But when an executive official manages federal property or money, he or she is not regulating the conduct of private parties. On the contrary, that official is acting as a landlord, caretaker, or trustee charged with the proper management of whatever property the national government holds in the public\u2019s name for its use. That property might be real estate in the form of a forest or open land that will be used to construct federal ships or buildings, or it might be the ships and buildings after they are built. Congress can tell executive officials not to allow that property to waste away, which is a sufficiently intelligible principle for that purpose. Indeed, Congress might not need to do even that because that duty would be an implicit requirement of the responsibility for managing it. Either way, as Professor Harrison explains, the J.W. Hampton intelligible principle standard (and a healthy dose of common sense) is a sufficient guideline for the President to know what to do in this regard. The issue is more complicated when the property is characterized as a \u201clicense,\u201d as it is in the case of radio and television broadcast licenses, or as the \u201cintangible right\u201d to freely navigate interstate waterways, rather than as realty or personalty. Nonetheless, as Professor Harrison maintains, the same principle should govern.[49] If the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV[50] guarantees the freedom to travel by water from one state to another,[51] to the 18th-century mind, that right would be protected as a communal form of \u201cproperty\u201d that the national government would manage for the benefit of all.[52] Adler and Harrison do the helpful preliminary work of establishing where a revived Nondelegation Doctrine should and should not apply\u2014of setting the foul lines. The doctrine is meant to protect citizens from an overzealous executive branch hampering their freedom without democratic warrant or accountability, not to make it difficult for the executive branch to set rules for itself. B. Defining the Rules of the Game The English and American common law was the canvas upon which the Framers painted. Professor Lawson extracts from that canvas principles of agency law that distinguish between what the principals\u2014members of the public\u2014expect that their agents\u2014Representatives and Senators\u2014must carry out themselves and what those agents may subdelegate to others\u2014executive and judicial branch officials.[53] As Professor Lawson explains, the Constitution contains a delegation from \u201cWe the People\u201d of the \u201clegislative Power\u201d to the \u201cCongress.\u201d Eighteenth-century law governing the relationship between principals and agents was strict. An agent could not subdelegate his or her responsibilities to third parties whom the principal did not select for an assigned job.[54] There was, however, a small amount of wiggle room. Atop their assigned powers, agents possessed certain ancillary powers, limited in number and scope, that were necessary to complete their assigned tasks.[55] Assign John Doe the job of building a barn or a ship, and he may hire carpenters and purchase supplies.[56] Chief Justice Marshall drew on those principal-agent rules in his opinion in Wayman, which upheld a delegation allowing the federal court to draft rules of procedure.[57] Applying these principles to the Constitution, Professor Lawson explains, Congress could assign nonlegislative tasks to executive officials and judges for the proper execution and smooth operation of the government\u2019s business.[58] Among them would be making factual findings (such as deciding whether Tom Roe was a soldier in General George Washington\u2019s colonial army and therefore is entitled to a pension); applying the law to the facts (such as determining the amount of customs due to the government from a particular shipment[59]); and deciding what to do when the facts and law are clear but do not answer a given question (such as deciding what to do with people convicted of a crime and sentenced to incarceration[60]). Relying on common-law agency principles might not provide as bright a line for delegation purposes as might be available in other areas of constitutional law\u2014the Sixth Amendment begins with the phrase \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions,\u201d so its requirements do not apply to ordinary civil contract disputes\u2014but it is miles from drawing an arbitrary line and also from the type of line-drawing that divided Judges Benjamin Cardozo and William Andrews in Palsgraf.[61] Professor Rappaport offers a two-tiered approach to delegation questions, an approach that will be familiar to anyone who has dealt with equal protection law. Just as equal protection law applies strict scrutiny for classifications based on race or lineage and a less exacting review to economic legislation,[62] the professor would employ strict or lenient review for different types of delegations. Strict review is appropriate for \u201crules that regulate the private rights of individuals in the domestic sphere.\u201d[63] The effect of applying strict scrutiny would be to bar executive officials from \u201cexercising any policymaking discretion.\u201d[64] Three types of activities lie outside of \u201cpolicymaking\u201d: (1) finding the facts, (2) interpreting the law, and (3) applying the law to the facts.[65] Those exceptions, in my opinion, certainly make sense. After all, the Constitution and Bill of Rights require a jury trial in criminal and (most) civil cases, and the first and third categories just mentioned are the classic roles for a jury to fill.[66] The second activity is inherent in the President\u2019s sworn obligation to enforce the law.[67] To do so, he must decide, with the advice of his chief lieutenants, what that law is.[68] Accordingly, the category for which strict nondelegation review is appropriate is internally coherent. It also parallels the \u201cprivate rights\u201d doctrine under which a party is entitled to have an Article III judge act as ultimate decisionmaker, rather allow an Article II official to have the final say.[69] By contrast, lenient review is appropriate for subjects that fall within traditional executive responsibilities.[70] Among them are regulation of the military;[71] the conduct of foreign affairs, including foreign commerce;[72] managing federal property;[73] and spending appropriated funds.[74] Professor Rappaport\u2019s approach avoids requiring the type of undirected line-drawing that has scared off the Supreme Court for nearly 90 years, and it also has the virtue of exempting subject matters that fit comfortably with the powers that the Framers expressly vested in the President. NCLA\u2019s Chenoweth and Samp offer a similar proposal. They say that the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test has \u201cgradually expanded with repeated use\u2014like a worn-out elastic band\u201d\u2014so that every imaginable statutory formulation satisfies it.[75] They propose instead a three-step inquiry. First, if Congress has literally or effectively provided the agency with no standard at all other than a vacuous goal, the delegation should be held per se invalid. A directive to regulate \u201cin the public interest,\u201d say Chenoweth and Samp, is equivalent to having no standard at all because an agency would be obliged to pursue that goal even if Congress wrote nothing in the statute to focus the agency\u2019s conduct.[76] Second, they would require Congress to provide guidance to executive officials that is sufficiently clear that a reviewing court can discern whether the agency has complied with its directive. That \u201cclear statement principle\u201d would \u201cshift the focus from whether Congress has given an \u2018intelligible principle\u2019 to the executive (which judges may be ill-equipped to ascertain) to ask instead whether Congress has provided sufficient standards to the judiciary\u201d for judges to determine whether an agency has gone off on a frolic and detour of its own devise.[77] Finally, they argue certain core legislative powers should be deemed nondelegable. Rather than ask whether an issue is sufficiently important that a court would expect that Congress would have resolved it rather than delegate it to an agency\u2014the essence of the Supreme Court\u2019s Major Questions Doctrine[78]\u2014Chenoweth and Samp urge the Court to identify \u201ccore legislative functions\u201d that Congress cannot hand over to executive officials. The taxing power, the spending power (at least as to the amount and source of appropriated funds), the power to define criminal laws, the authority to make policy-based tradeoffs, the ability to engage in oversight of the executive branch\u2014those are core legislative functions that Congress should not be allowed to pass off to the executive, regardless of whether an agency has superior expertise in the field at issue or the members want to avoid accountability for taking a politically unpopular position.[79] PLF\u2019s Gaziano and Blevins argue that the answer to our nondelegation conundrum has been standing there right before our eyes all along. The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine is the offspring of the marriage of criminal and constitutional law. The century-plus-old doctrine provides that a statute must afford \u201cordinary people\u201d[80]\u2014 people of \u201ccommon\u201d[81] or \u201cordinary\u201d intelligence[82]\u2014fair notice of what is a crime.[83] A criminal law is impermissibly vague when its text \u201ceither forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application\u201d[84] or its \u201cmandates are so uncertain that they will reasonably admit of different constructions.\u201d[85] The Void-for-Vagueness and Nondelegation Doctrines share a common denominator: \u201cA law must not allow those enforcing it to essentially make it up as they go along.\u201d[86] An added feature of this argument is that, if a regulatory scheme can be enforced through the criminal law, the Supreme Court must apply the Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine to the substantive provisions of the underlying statute to satisfy the notice concerns that doctrine enforces.[87] Finally, Professor Schoenbrod, a 30-year student of the Nondelegation Doctrine, comes at the issue from a unique direction. Rather than address nondelegation concerns by tightening the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d standard or by enhancing the degree of scrutiny that the courts should use to review delegated rulemaking, he suggests that courts approach the problem by capping the costs that an agency should be able to impose on the nation at $100 million. That amount didn\u2019t come from nowhere. Under the last five Presidents, any rule that would have an annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more is a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d that must be submitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review.[88] That standard also defines a \u201cmajor\u201d rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act,[89] which requires new agency rules to be submitted to Congress for its review.[90] Schoenbrod urges the Supreme Court to use that dollar amount as the limit of a permissible delegation. If the President and Congress have made it clear by executive order and statute that they\u2014the political branches\u2014must review \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cmajor\u201d rules before they can take effect, the Court will only be enforcing what the other branches of government have already found to be a reasonable dividing line. The bottom line is this: The essays discussed above offer the Supreme Court a handful of different nondelegation standards to use to ensure that Congress and agencies respect the limitations on Articles I and II. The Court could even combine two or more of them. Collectively, they answer the argument that there is no principled way to decide which delegations are in the field of play and which are out of bounds. C. Encouraging People to Play the Game The essays discussed above matter little if a majority of Supreme Court Justices proves unwilling to awaken the slumbering Nondelegation Doctrine. As I noted earlier, the Court has not held unconstitutional any congressional delegation to an executive agency since Panama Refining and Schechter Poultry in 1935, but five of the current Justices have signaled a willingness to reconsider the Court\u2019s precedents. Add in the fact that the newest member\u2014Justice Barrett\u2014has not opined publicly on the issue, and you see a possibility that the Court might revisit the doctrine. The burden of the remaining essays is to give the Court a reason to take that step. They do so by addressing a claim that always arises whenever the Court is asked to reject or modify a longstanding body of case law: namely, that the roof will fall in if the Court removes even one of the columns supporting it. It is sensible for the courts to be concerned about the potentially destabilizing consequences of revitalizing the Nondelegation Doctrine. But the risk that Congress\u2019s ability to do its job would collapse is not a severe one. There is federal precedent to support that conclusion. The Supreme Court has ample experience deciding when a legislature has punted its responsibility to draft an easily understandable law under the Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine.[91] The successful application of that doctrine shows that the Court is capable of making reasoned judgments of this kind, and that the sky won\u2019t fall when the Court holds a statute unconstitutional. Besides, says Professor Postell, chaos hasn\u2019t befallen the states that have enforced their own versions of a Nondelegation Doctrine. Professor Postell reaches that conclusion after surveying what state courts have done when resolving nondelegation claims.[92] In his opinion, the state decisions have generally adopted a standard similar to the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test adopted in J.W. Hampton and found in the Supreme Court\u2019s later case law.[93] Moreover, the \u201cprevailing\u201d approach in the \u201cvast\u201d majority of the states has been to follow the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s practice of applying a rather \u201clax\u201d review to state legislative delegations.[94] What is different is that some states have been more willing to examine critically whether \u201cstatutes seem to have been carelessly drafted and have contained no limits on agency discretion\u201d and whether \u201cstatutes adequately define an agency\u2019s scope of authority by examining whether the persons subject to the agency\u2019s authority are carefully identified in the statute.\u201d[95] State courts in Alaska, Florida, Illinois, Montana, Oklahoma, and Vermont have been more willing to scrutinize state legislative delegations. Even then, those states that use a slightly more rigorous analysis have not demanded the impossible from their legislatures.[96] Contra Justice Elena Kagan, those state courts have not declared that most of state government is unconstitutional.[97] Most importantly, nothing in Professor Postell\u2019s discussion of state law suggests that the sky has fallen in those states. Professor Prakash offers a variety of ways that the Supreme Court could prevent the \u201cchaos\u201d that allegedly would arise from tasking Congress with doing its job.[98] To begin with, the Court could proceed incrementally, making clear that its initial ruling striking down a particular act on nondelegation grounds does not doom a host of other statutes.[99] A modest beginning might force the Court to consider a large number of cases, but the Court recently has been willing to follow that case-by-case or statute-by-statute course when deciding which agency appointment and removal provisions satisfy the Article II Appointments Clause.[100] That slow-but-steady approach does not mean that the Court is just putting off the inevitable, or that the roof will eventually collapse. In 1995, in United States v. Lopez, the Court held unconstitutional an act of Congress making it a crime to possess a firearm in the vicinity of a school, ruling that Congress had exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause in criminalizing intrastate conduct.[101] Despite prophecies of impending doom, ten years later the Court held in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress could make it unlawful to possess cannabis grown and used entirely in-state.[102] A revived Nondelegation Doctrine does not mean that all statutes with delegations will be struck down. Some will; some won\u2019t.[103] The Supreme Court also could delay the issuance of a nondelegation judgment to give Congress time to consider revising the offending statute and adopting all or some of the existing corpus of agency rules. The Court used its remedial power in this way when it held bankruptcy laws unconstitutional in 1982 in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.[104] The Court issued its opinion on June 28, but stayed the issuance of its judgment until October 4 to \u201cafford Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the bankruptcy courts or to adopt other valid means of adjudication, without impairing the interim administration of the bankruptcy laws.\u201d[105] On the latter date, the Court further stayed the issuance of its judgment until December 24.[106] The two stays gave Congress nearly six months to revise the bankruptcy laws in light of the Court\u2019s ruling in Northern Pipeline. The Court could do the same if it were to hold a congressional delegation unconstitutional to avoid potential deleterious disruption. Congress could then decide not only whether and how to revise the relevant statute, but also which agency rules to adopt as an act of Congress to avoid future challenges.[107] Professor Prakash also reminds us that members of Congress and the President will be under intense political pressure from the electorate and various interest groups to prevent chaos and significant societal harm by allowing agency rules to disintegrate.[108] Both political branches will have a strong interest in responding quickly to a rebirth of the Nondelegation Doctrine by passing some legislation that codifies some of thousands of existing agency rules for some period of time, even if only as a stop-gap measure so that members and the President can negotiate a reasonable response to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Congress and the President could take that burden up themselves or create a bipartisan and bicameral regulatory commission to offer its suggestions about which existing rules Congress ought to codify into law. In making those decisions, Congress could consider all of an agency\u2019s rules in one omnibus bill\u2014a \u201cCongressional Adoption Act\u201d[109]\u2014or Congress could group rules into separate categories across multiple bills. Congress could also adopt agency rules for a limited period\u2014say, one year, which is the standard life for an appropriations bill\u2014rather than in perpetuity. That course would effectively sunset those rules.[110] To make matters easier for Congress, agencies could identify statutes they believe need clarification and postpone new rulemakings until the status of their current rules has been clarified. Critics will contend that Congress could never pass legislation as clear, specific, and multifarious as would be necessary to consider an entire tranche of regulations, particularly in the Senate given the filibuster. But Professor Schoenbrod correctly notes that Congress has succeeded in that regard before by using a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure that requires an \u201cup or down\u201d vote on an entire package of proposals. The Trade Act of 1974[111] and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990[112] use just such a procedure when Congress must vote on international trade agreements or the closure of domestic military bases. Another example is the Congressional Review Act, which gives the members of each chamber the opportunity to hold an up-or-down vote after limited debate on an agency\u2019s new rules.[113] That is a complete legal answer to the critics\u2019 argument that Congress could not expedite its consideration and hold a vote on an overall package of agency rules. Is there a guarantee that Congress would adopt predicate legislation establishing such an expedited procedure and up-or-down vote? No, of course not. Congress would need to pass that legislation before voting on a package of agency rules, and anyone who does not want to cast a vote on the latter bill certainly would use every available tool and trick, legitimate or not, to keep the predicate bill from becoming law. But if that were to happen, the blame for any ensuing chaos would fall on the members of Congress, not the Justices, for it would be the members who would be responsible for scuttling the agency rules. Would the absence of a guarantee that Congress will act responsibly influence how the Justices vote? The Justices\u2019 job is to give the public their honest interpretation of what the Constitution demands, not to anticipate whether members of Congress will engage in shenanigans to avoid having to cast a vote that would anger their constituents and cost them their sinecures. Still, the Justices could try to peer over the horizon to guess how Congress would respond and let that guess influence their decisionmaking. Only time will tell how that possibility plays out. III. Suggestions From a Fan of the Game I have but three points to add to the perspectives of the fine essays discussed above. The first one is this: It makes sense to consider the potential relevance of Article 39 of Magna Carta to the mix of considerations discussed in Nondelegation Perspectives.[114] Magna Carta was a peace treaty between the English barons and King John adopted to end a rebellion against the crown because of the king\u2019s abusive exercise of royal powers. The best-known provision of the Great Charter is Article 39, once described as \u201ca plain, popular statement of the most elementary rights\u201d of Englishmen.[115] It provided that \u201cno free man is to be imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or damaged without lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.\u201d[116] Chapter 39 placed the king under the \u201crule of law\u201d by prohibiting him from taking the law into his own hands. It achieved that goal by guaranteeing that the Crown would be subject to \u201cthe law of the land,\u201d[117] which, according to Sir Edward Coke, was \u201cthe Common Law, Statute Law, or Custome of England.\u201d[118] The First Congress carried that obligation forward in the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.[119] The phrases \u201claw of the land\u201d and \u201cdue process of law,\u201d integral to the English law, became equally central to the American understanding of the rule of law.[120] The First Congress incorporated those principles by including the Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment, added via the Bill of Rights. Magna Carta bolsters the argument that the Constitution limits the type of lawmaking that nonelected federal officials may undertake. Would the English barons have understood the term \u201claw of the land\u201d to include diktats from King John, the very person that Chapter 39 was designed to restrain? If he could unilaterally change the common law by his own pronouncements, what good would Chapter 39 have been? Given the circumstances surrounding its adoption, Chapter 39 would have made no difference if the crown could make new law simply by signing a piece of parchment containing an order and the king\u2019s signature. When executive officials make new law without adequate congressional warrant, they are acting as King John did apart from the restraint of Magna Carta. Our Constitution\u2014the descendant of the Great Charter\u2014should be held to prevent them from doing so. Second, a principal explanation for why the Court has been reluctant to hold congressional delegations invalid is the line-drawing problem that an aggressive application of that doctrine would require. At bottom, the Court does not want to substitute judicial lawmaking for executive lawmaking because the public cannot boot the courts out of office when they go too far. Deciding which delegations are just right and which ones are a tad too much is like deciding whether Helen Palsgraf proved her negligence claim.[121] There is no easy, neat, clean, and subjectivity-free way to slice that pie, the Supreme Court has concluded, so why even try?[122] The answer is that it is the judiciary\u2019s job to force Congress and the President to do theirs. The Framers created a system that would compel elected officials to make the difficult policy decisions, tradeoffs, and compromises necessary for our government to make law, and to do so in a manner that allows the public to hold those officials electorally accounta\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 42,000 characters]\n\n30: U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Nondelegation Case (score: 0.682)\nTopic: Nondelegation doctrine analysis in administrative law\nFound via search query: Nondelegation doctrine administrative law analysis\nU.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Nondelegation Case | Insights | Holland & Knight Skip to content Practices Professionals Industries Insights Events News Offices Careers Menu Refine search by section Refine Search Filters Full Site Professionals Practices Industries Insights Events News Case Studies View All Matching Results July 5, 2023 U.S. Supreme Court Agrees to Hear Nondelegation Case Decision Holds Potential Implications for Climate Regulation Holland & Knight Alert Andy Kriha | Susan G. Lafferty | Alexander S. Holtan Highlights The U.S. Supreme Court announced that it has agreed to hear the case of SEC v. Jarkesy. The case is on appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which held that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) use of administrative law judges is unconstitutional under multiple theories. Though all of the theories accepted by the Fifth Circuit would restrain the authority of regulatory agencies, one theory, the nondelegation doctrine, would have significantly wider-ranging effect. Multiple energy and environmental regulations would be threatened by a stronger nondelegation doctrine, including the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC)\u00a0Green Guides, SEC's proposed climate disclosure rule and several U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The U.S. Supreme Court on June 30, 2023, agreed to hear the case of SEC v. Jarkesy.1 The case is an appeal of a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decision that held that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) use of administrative law judges (ALJs) is unconstitutional.2 The Fifth Circuit's decision was based on three separate theories: 1) that the use of administrative proceedings to seek civil penalties for common law claims violates the Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution's right to a jury trial; 2) that the SEC's discretion to choose between enforcing securities laws through administrative proceedings or through court actions violates the nondelegation doctrine; and 3) that the multiple levels of for-cause removal protection for SEC ALJs violates the appointments clause of Article II of the Constitution. Though a decision upholding the Fifth Circuit on any of those three theories could be used to constrain the authority of multiple federal agencies, a decision based on the nondelegation doctrine could be the most restrictive on agency authority of any Supreme Court decision to date. Background The nondelegation doctrine is rooted in Article I of the Constitution's grant of legislative authority to Congress. Proponents of the theory believe that this implies Congress is not allowed to delegate discretion to the executive branch that amounts to policymaking authority. The nondelegation doctrine was last used to strike down two laws in 1935.3 Since then, courts have applied the \"intelligible principle\" test to uphold exercises of agency discretion where Congress provided at least some minimal level of guidance as to how that discretion should be exercised. In the past few years, multiple justices of the Court's conservative wing have advocated for a strengthening of the nondelegation doctrine to eliminate any agency discretion with respect to setting policy. Most recently the nondelegation doctrine was raised in a 2019 case, Gundy v. United States.4 All four conservative justices participating in the case signaled support for strengthening the nondelegation doctrine, although the effort did not receive enough votes to succeed at that time. The nondelegation doctrine is related to the major questions doctrine as established in last year's West Virginia v. EPA5 but goes a step further in its implications for agency authority. The major questions doctrine is utilized when an agency has been granted broad discretion and it has exercised that discretion in a manner that has major policy implications and that was not clearly authorized by law. When an agency violates the major questions doctrine, the underlying rule is vacated but the agency can still regulate in the same area with a more narrowly tailored or less impactful rule. A stronger nondelegation doctrine could be used whenever an agency exercises any amount of policy discretion, not just major policy discretion. Additionally, the remedy is not to vacate the agency's rule but to hold that the statute granting that policy discretion is unconstitutional, removing the agency's ability to regulate in that area entirely and potentially affecting more rules than just the challenged rule. A strengthened nondelegation doctrine could have profound implications for climate regulations. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, has broad statutory authority to prosecute \"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\"6 The terms \"unfair methods of competition\" and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" are not defined by law, giving the FTC nearly unfettered discretion to make policy choices about what types of business practices are unfair. The FTC is currently considering updates to its \"Green Guides\" that provide the agency's definitive interpretation of how it will exercise its unfair and deceptive practices authority to target environmental marketing claims such as \"carbon-neutral\" and \"net zero.\" This broad authority, however, may run afoul of a strengthened nondelegation doctrine. Other examples include the SEC's proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require publicly traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and business risks related to climate change. That proposed rule relies on multiple provisions in the securities laws that give the SEC authority to make rules that it deems \"necessary or appropriate\" for the public interest or protection of investors.7 Such broad authority to define \"necessary or appropriate\" measures that may rest on policy decisions may also be challenged under a nondelegation doctrine theory. Other climate rules administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agencies rely on similar statutory provisions to consider undefined factors in rulemaking or to consider specific, often competing, policy factors without defining how to weight each factor.8 It is anticipated that SEC v. Jarkesy will be heard in the Court's next term and likely decided by the end of June 2024. Impacts to climate rules would be realized only after those rules are separately challenged, meaning that even if the nondelegation doctrine is strengthened, the impacts to climate rules could be years away. The government has argued that the type of discretion at play in Jarkesy is simple enforcement discretion \u2013 a traditional executive power, not policy discretion. If the Court agrees with that argument, the Court could overturn or uphold the Fifth Circuit on one of the other two theories without strengthening the nondelegation doctrine at this time.

Adler The Delegation Doctrine \u2013 Jonathan H. AdlerBy JLPP / June 20, 2024 Download a PDF THE DELEGATION DOCTRINE Jonathan H. Adler* After Gundy v. United States[1] the Supreme Court seemed poised to revive the nondelegation doctrine.[2] Four justices expressed a willingness to consider nondelegation arguments in a future case, and they were joined by a fifth just a few months later.[3] It was only matter of time before five justices would vote to limit the extent to which Congress could delegate core legislative power to administrative agencies.[4] Reports of the nondelegation doctrine\u2019s resuscitation were greatly exaggerated.[5] Despite all the anticipation and trepidation, the doctrine has yet to be disinterred, and a revival may be as far off as ever. Over the past five years, the Court has taken no meaningful step toward a resuscitation of this moribund constraint on delegation. A majority of the Court has not even been willing to cite nondelegation concerns as sufficient justification for invoking constitutional avoidance to avoid broad constructions of statutory delegations.[6] The nondelegation doctrine may remain moribund, but the outlines of a delegation doctrine may be visible in the Court\u2019s recent jurisprudence. Instead of policing the limits on Congress\u2019s power to delegate authority to administrative agencies, the Court has instead been focusing on whether the power administrative agencies seek to exercise has been properly delegated by Congress in the first place. This is a meaningful check on agency self-aggrandizement. For without such a delegation of power from the legislature, administrative agencies lack the power to issue regulations or otherwise act with the force of law. The most obvious manifestation of this emerging delegation doctrine is the Court\u2019s recent quartet of \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d cases.[7] In these cases, the Court has emphasized that administrative agencies are born without any regulatory authority in the domestic sphere.[8] Federal administrative agencies have no inherent power to adopt regulations or impose constraints on private conduct. Rather, agencies only have that power which Congress has affirmatively bestowed upon them.[9] And because the constitutional baseline is that all legislative power is vested in Congress, the existence of such power in another branch cannot be presumed. It must be shown. Federal agencies must affirmatively demonstrate that the power they seek to exercise was actually delegated to them by Congress.[10] A corollary of this delegation principle is that the more expansive, unusual, or unprecedented the authority the agency seeks to exercise, the greater the necessary showing must be. Thus, in the major questions doctrine cases\u2014both those in the latest quartet and those before\u2014the Court has insisted upon clear evidence, if not an actual clear statement, that Congress delegated broad regulatory authority concerning matters of great economic or political significance.[11] Despite the focus on the Court\u2019s recent major questions cases, signs of an emergent delegation doctrine can also be found elsewhere. Most significantly, seeds of a delegation doctrine have been planted within the Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence. The Court\u2019s increased reluctance to grant Chevron deference to administrative agencies\u2013and its insistence that courts first conclude that interpretive authority has been delegated before deferring to any agency interpretation\u2014rests on the same core premise as the Court\u2019s recent major questions doctrine decisions.[12] It also suggests that the \u201cnew\u201d major questions doctrine is not as new as it might seem, but rather a logical outgrowth of principles the Court has already embraced: Agencies may only exercise power delegated to them by Congress, and the amount of evidence required to demonstrate that authority has been delegated should correlate with the nature and scope of the authority claimed.[13] In making this claim this essay is both descriptive and prescriptive. It is descriptive in that it seeks to identify doctrinal threads that cut across administrative law doctrine. It is prescriptive in that it suggests that fully embracing the delegation doctrine would result in a more coherent jurisprudence and address many contemporary concerns about the administrative state and the proper role of the judiciary in policing the exercise of delegated power. Rationalizing (and perhaps reforming) the Court\u2019s recent major questions holdings in purer delegation terms would insulate them from some of the criticisms levied by scholars and would reduce concerns that they are unprincipled assaults on administrative power. At the same time, focusing on delegation can constrain judicial deference to agency interpretations without requiring a complete abandonment of the Chevron doctrine. Following through on the implications of using delegation as a unifying principle can also help move the Court\u2019s administrative law jurisprudence in a more positive direction, both by placing the major questions doctrine cases on firmer footing, as well as by making sense of what sorts of delegations\u2014and resulting deference to agency authority\u2014should or should not be troubling to those skeptical of administrative power. I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Delegation Doctrine Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests the federal government\u2019s legislative powers in Congress.[14] Since early in the nation\u2019s history, jurists and commentators have maintained that this places some limit on Congress\u2019s ability to delegate (or, as some would say, subdelegate[15]) power to other branches of government.[16] As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in Wayman v. Southard \u201cIt will not be contended that Congress can delegate . . . powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\u201d[17] This nondelegation principle has been oft repeated in Supreme Court opinions, but rarely observed.[18] Some have said the nondelegation doctrine has had only one good year.[19] The problem, as even Chief Justice Marshall acknowledged, has been identifying a judicially administrable line between permissible delegations of policy-making authority and purportedly impermissible delegations of \u201cstrictly and exclusively legislative\u201d powers.[20] While some academics have purported to identify sufficiently determinate measures upon which a judicially enforced nondelegation doctrine could be constructed,[21] the Court has yet to settle on a test that meaningfully constrains the delegation of legislative authority. The current requirement of an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d is readily met by all but the most open-ended statutes.[22] Signs of a reinvigorated and more constraining doctrine are sometimes found within the Court\u2019s opinions, but not as part of a definitive holding.[23] Somewhat like the Loch Ness Monster, we think we have glimpsed the doctrine\u2019s outlines, but no one has glimpsed it in the flesh. Whether or not the Article I vesting clause contains a judicially enforceable nondelegation principle, it is unquestionably the source of a delegation principle.[24] Specifically, the vesting of all the federal government\u2019s legislative powers in the Congress creates a baseline allocation of power, departures from which must be enacted by the legislature. Whether or not some amount of legislative (or quasi-legislative) power is exclusive and inalienable, all such power starts in the legislature\u2019s hands and is only ever delegated to administrative agencies because Congress has chosen to do so. Administrative agencies\u2014as a part of the executive branch\u2014execute the laws that Congress enacts.[25] Any power such agencies wish to exercise in the domestic sphere is the result of a legislative delegation. As the Supreme Court has made explicit, \u201can agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.\u201d[26] This is particularly true\u2014indeed, \u201caxiomatic\u201d\u2014when it comes to an agency\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations that bind private conduct.[27] The fact that all power administrative agencies exercise must be the result of a delegation from Congress is a foundational principle within administrative law. What the delegation doctrine is, then, is the instantiation of that fact into a broader principle that informs how courts understand, interpret, and enforce those delegations. This central fact about agency power should inform how the Court considers questions about whether agency power exists in any particular circumstance.[28] It further calls upon courts to carefully consider what sorts of power have been delegated, the scope of that power, and what sorts of incidental authority (if any) may be reasonably implied from the affirmative legislative grant. [29] In any given instance in which an agency seeks to assert authority, the reviewing court must conclude both that Congress delegated to the agency the authority to act, but also that the action the agency wishes to take is within the scope of the granted authority.[30] That an agency has authority to act in a related area or parallel fashion is not, in itself, evidence of delegated authority unless there is evidence to think Congress delegated the related authority.[31] II.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Major Questions as Delegation Questions In four decisions over the past three years, the Supreme Court has stressed the importance of identifying the legislative source of agency power when agencies assert broad authority.[32] In each of these cases, a majority of justices found the agency\u2019s assertion of authority lacking, and the evidence of a delegation of authority to be insufficient. These cases, the latter of which expressly embrace the \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d by name,[33] have prompted substantial commentary and much criticism.[34] In this essay I am less interested in joining the debate over how and why the Court reached its conclusions in each of these cases, or whether the Court has properly identified what questions count as \u201cmajor,\u201d than in highlighting the importance of delegation in the Court\u2019s reasoning and outcome in each case. While the precise methodology and interpretive approaches deployed arguably varied across these cases, each emphasized the need for federal agencies to affirmatively demonstrate that Congress had delegated to them the power they sought to exercise, and in each case the Court found the agency\u2019s claim wanting. For the first of these cases, Alabama Association of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Services,[35] the outcome was never in doubt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had first imposed a residential eviction moratorium in September 2020, citing its authority under the Public Health Service Act.[36] The only thing that had prevented five justices from holding it unlawful in the summer of 2021 was that the initial challenge to the CDC\u2019s claimed authority reached the Court a month before it was due to expire on its own accord.[37] There was little question Congress had the power to impose an eviction moratorium, or that Congress could expressly authorize the CDC to impose one.[38] Congress had, in fact, done that already.[39] But once Congress refused to extend any such moratorium, the argument that the CDC retained the delegated authority to take that step stood on shaky ground. Despite the clear indication that a renewed moratorium would not withstand judicial review, the CDC reimposed it with only superficial modifications.[40] Unsurprisingly, a majority of the Court refused to accept the CDC\u2019s argument that it was authorized to issue an eviction moratorium pursuant to its authority to \u201cmake and enforce such regulations as in [the Surgeon General\u2019s] judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.\u201d[41] Unlike the sorts of measures identified in the relevant statutory text, an eviction moratorium does not \u201cdirectly relate to the interstate spread of disease by identifying, isolating, and destroying the disease itself.\u201d[42] Reading the CDC\u2019s statutory authority as a whole, and in context, the Court\u2019s majority recognized that it was \u201ca stretch to maintain that \u00a7 361(a) gives the CDC the authority to impose this eviction moratorium.\u201d[43] Further, the Court explained, even if the language in question could be considered ambiguous, \u201cthe sheer scope of the CDC\u2019s claimed authority . . . would counsel against the Government\u2019s interpretation.\u201d[44] As it had noted before, courts \u201cexpect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise powers of \u201cvast \u2018economic and political significance.\u2019\u201d[45] And Congress had not clearly stated that the CDC could regulate housing markets.[46] Several months later, when the Court was confronted with a challenge to the \u00a0Occupational Safety & Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) vaccinate-or-test mandate, the story was much the same.[47] As in Alabama Realtors, a federal agency was using a longstanding power in a manner that it had not been used before, and in way that was not directly related to the sort of authority Congress had clearly delegated to it. Congress had delegated to the CDC the authority to control the interstate transmission of disease, and the CDC sought to use that authority to reduce hardship to renters facing eviction. Congress had delegated authority to OSHA to control workplace risks to health and safety, and the Biden Administration sought to use that power to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates.[48] Citing Alabama Realtors, the Court in NFIB again stressed the need for the agency to show that Congress had delegated such broad authority.[49] While there was no question that the OSH Act delegated to OSHA expansive authority to set occupational health and safety standards, it did not confer the sort of authority OSHA asserted here, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, OSHA had never claimed otherwise.[50] Indeed, as the Court noted, the vaccinate-or-test mandate was \u201cstrikingly unlike the workplace regulations that OSHA has typically imposed.\u201d[51] Moreover, the authority OSHA sought to invoke\u2014that of authorizing \u201cemergency temporary standards\u201d\u2014was narrower than that authorizing the adoption of permanent workplace safety standards, making it even more difficult for OSHA to demonstrate that it had, in fact, been delegated the authority it sought to exercise.[52] Both the CDC eviction moratorium and OSHA vaccinate-or-test mandate cases were considered and decided on an expedited basis. Accordingly, neither opinion offers a fulsome explanation of the doctrinal rationale for the Court\u2019s conclusions, but both made quite clear that the burden was upon the agency to demonstrate that Congress had, in fact, delegated to it the sort of broad, expansive authority it sought to exercise. The question in each case was not whether Congress could authorize the agencies to adopt expansive disease-control measures, but whether it had actually done so in either of the relevant statutes. Although it has its own unusual procedural history, West Virginia v. EPA was not considered on an expedited basis.[53] With the benefit of a full briefing schedule, the Court had another opportunity to consider an agency\u2019s assertion of broad regulatory authority never before deployed under the relevant statutory provisions. And here, again, a majority of the Court was unconvinced that Congress had in fact delegated such authority to the agency.[54] In West Virginia, however, the Court offered greater explanation for why such a demonstration is necessary: That while the language of Section 111 allowing the EPA to define and impose a \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d on fossil-fuel-fired power plants might be plausible \u201cas a matter of \u2018definitional possibilities,\u2019\u201d when the language is \u201cshorn of all context\u201d there was not enough to justify an assertion of authority as broad as the EPA claimed.[55] Rather, as the Court had emphasized in prior cases (including Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, which likewise concerned the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act), \u00a0\u201ccourts \u2018expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.\u2019\u201d[56] And as the Court had made explicit in UARG, that controlling greenhouse gas emissions presents a different challenge than does controlling traditional air pollutants does not authorize the EPA to take liberties with the Clean Air Act\u2019s text.[57] As in the COVID-19 cases, the Court expected broad assertions of agency authority to be supported by clear evidence that Congress delegated such authority in statutory text. And as explained by Chief Justice Roberts, all three cases relied upon an \u201cidentifiable body of law\u201d addressing the \u201crecurring problem\u201d of \u201cagencies asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.\u201d[58] Biden v. Nebraska did not concern an agency assertion of regulatory authority, but it again presented the Court with an agency seeking to pour new wine out of an old bottle.[59] In this case, the Department of Education sought to use authority under the HEROES Act[60] to forgive an estimated $430 billion in student loans, ostensibly for the purpose of ensuring that loan recipients were \u201cnot placed in a worse position financially in relation to\u201d their student loans due to the national emergency triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.[61] The Secretary of Education claimed that his statutory authority to \u201cwaive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable\u201d to covered student loan assistance programs authorized the erasure of loan principle.[62] Once again, the Supreme Court was not convinced. In Biden v. Nebraska, more so than in West Virginia, Chief Justice Roberts engaged in a thorough analysis of the relevant statutory text. He further stressed that agencies only have that power and authority that Congress has delegated to them, and that any delegation from Congress has limits that can be identified in the statutory text.[63] The greater the exercise of power sought, the more evidence of delegation is required. After surveying the relevant statutory provisions, the Chief Justice stressed that any authority the Education Department sought to exercise must be pursuant to a legislative delegation. Acting without such an authorization would amount to \u201cseizing the power of the Legislature,\u201d thereby allowing it \u201cto enact a program that Congress has chosen not to enact itself.\u201d[64] Where an agency seeks to exercise broad and consequential power, more than \u201ca wafer-thin reed\u201d of statutory text is necessary.[65] These four decisions all apply a variant of the major questions doctrine\u2014the latter two explicitly so.[66] In West Virginia, the Chief Justice suggested whether a case presents a \u201cmajor question\u201d is a threshold inquiry that should color and shape a reviewing court\u2019s assessment of the statutory language at issue.[67] In Nebraska, on the other hand, Chief Justice Roberts deployed the major questions doctrine as a means to confirm his statutory interpretation, and reinforce the conclusion that the delegation of power the agency sought to exercise could not be found within the relevant statute.[68] While both rely expressly on the notion that Congress must authorize agency action, Nebraska stepped back from the notion that the presence of a \u201cmajor question\u201d justifies a departure from traditional approaches to statutory interpretation or judicial review of agency action. Viewed as a progression, Nebraska suggests that the Court may be moving toward a delegation doctrine that can be applied across the board to all cases in which courts are called upon to consider whether an agency is acting beyond the scope of its delegated authority. This would be a welcome development, as it would avoid the inherently arbitrary effort to distinguish \u201cmajor\u201d from ordinary questions, and instead allow reviewing courts to engage in a more traditional judicial inquiry about the scope of delegated authority (an inquiry that is hardly exclusive to the administrative law context). Under such an approach the magnitude or scope of the asserted agency power informs the analysis but is not a separate threshold inquiry, nor would this approach preclude consideration of the extent to which an agency\u2019s assertion of power is unusual, unprecedented, or likely unforeseen by the enacting Congress. To the contrary, this approach would embrace such considerations where they are relevant to interpreting the nature and scope of the power delegated by Congress. III.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chevron Questions as Delegation Questions Well before the Roberts Court\u2019s major questions quartet, seeds of a delegation doctrine could be seen in the Supreme Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence, particularly as it has developed over the past twenty-five years. The role of delegation was not entirely clear in the Chevron decision itself, perhaps because Justice Stevens offered multiple rationales for acceding to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s preferred understanding of what would constitute a \u201csource\u201d for given provisions of the Clean Air Act.[69] Subsequent decisions, however, have made express what may only been implicit in Chevron itself: That any authority agencies possess to interpret statutory provisions in line with an administration\u2019s policy preferences derives from a delegation of such authority from the legislative branch. As has been rehearsed many times, the Supreme Court did not understand Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council[70] to depart from preexisting approaches to judicial review of agency action.[71] Its concise formulation of a deceptively easy test took on a life of its own nonetheless.[72] First, a reviewing court must look to the statute itself to see whether Congress spoke directly to the question at issue. If so, the statutory text controls, without regard for the agency\u2019s preferences. If, however, the statute is ambiguous on the precise question at hand, a reviewing court is to defer to the interpretation offered by the implementing agency, provided that interpretation represents a \u201cpermissible\u201d interpretation of the relevant text.[73] As Justice Stevens\u2019s opinion for the Court made clear, the analysis was meant to identify what matters Congress had determined, and what matters Congress had left to resolution by the agency as a policy matter.[74] In practice, it has often meant that agencies have wide latitude to implement complex statutory programs in accord with the executive branch\u2019s policy preferences, even if this means departing from the most plausible understanding of the statute.[75] As the Chevron doctrine became a fixture in administrative law, various justifications were offered for it. Some argued courts should defer to agencies because agencies, unlike courts, are politically accountable.[76] Others stressed the value of agency expertise and familiarity with the subject matter, particularly when compared to that of judges.[77] Others noted that deferring to agency interpretations would produce more uniformity in federal law than relying upon the potentially disparate interpretations offered by judges in various circuits and districts across the country.[78] Still others suggested that Chevron may be a logical outgrowth of constitutional separation of powers principles.[79] The Supreme Court, for its part, recognized the strength of various policy rationales for a Chevron-like deference regime, but ultimately made clear that none of these arguments could explain when or why courts should defer to agency interpretations. After all, agencies have no inherent authority to explain or interpret what the law means for anyone but themselves.[80] Any justification for deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation or binding policy decision had to rest with Congress and its choice to delegate such authority to an agency.[81] If agencies have the power to resolve ambiguities or fill gaps in complex statutory schemes, it is not because giving agencies such authority is a good idea that courts should respect. It is because Congress has delegated such power to them. One of the first decisions to make this explicit was Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, in which the Court explained that \u201ca precondition to deference under Chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority.\u201d[82] For there to be deference, it must be the result of legislative intent.[83] And while legislative intent need not always be explicit on the face of the statutory text, it cannot not be presumed without reason. In Christensen v. Harris County, for instance, the Court concluded that a delegation of interpretive authority could not be implied where Congress failed to delegate to an agency the authority to act with the force of law.[84] The Court made explicit that Chevron deference must rest on a delegation rationale in United States v. Mead, in which the Court denied deference to the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s tariff classification rulings because the Court could not find any reason to believe Congress had intended these classifications to carry such weight.[85] Indeed, the structure of the program made any claim that Congress had sought to delegate such authority \u201cself-refuting.\u201d[86] Rather than automatically applying whenever there is a statutory ambiguity, Mead explained that Chevron would only apply \u201cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d[87] Thus, while a statutory ambiguity may be necessary for Chevron deference, it is not sufficient, for there can be no deference unless the Court can conclude that Congress actually conferred the authority to resolve that ambiguity to the agency. The facts of Chevron serve as a useful illustration. The choice between competing interpretations of the phrase \u201cstationary source\u201d was not a linguistic or interpretive exercise. Rather, it was a policy choice.[88] Congress had instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to implement a permitting regime for such sources and left to the agency the authority to fill in the details about how that program would operate, within the confines of the enacted statutory text.[89] There was nothing in the text of the statute (or, for that matter, in the legislative history[90]) upon which to rest the choice between a definition of \u201csource\u201d that would impose more rigid emission caps and one that would provide firms with more operational flexibility.[91] It was a policy question to be resolved by the administrative agency to which Congress had delegated the authority to issue regulations with the force of law to implement the program. Recognizing that Chevron deference rests on delegation has a range of implications, some of which I have sketched out elsewhere.[92] A few are worth highlighting here. First, as already suggested, it is not ambiguities or statutory gaps or poor legislative drafting that triggers Chevron deference. It is rather the delegation of authority. Just because a statute is difficult to parse or does not make sense is no reason to defer to the agency. After all, unless Congress has delegated such authority to the agency, it has no such authority. Second, and relatedly, it is the job of the reviewing court to interpret the statute in the first instance, and that necessarily includes determining what power has been delegated to the agency. This is a question for the court, and not one that can be resolved by the agency, for if delegation is the basis for deference, a judicial determination that a delegation has taken place must precede any consideration of the agency\u2019s views.[93] To be sure, the Court has not always been steadfast in hewing to this understanding of Chevron. City of Arlington v. FCC, in particular, is a notable departure,[94] but it is not alone.[95] Nonetheless, the weight of the Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence has rested on the delegation rationale, as have many decisions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.[96] Just as clarifying that recent \u201cmajor questions\u201d holdings can be understood as operationalizing the principle that all agency power must have been delegated by Congress, ensuring that any deference to agencies is likewise the result of a legislative delegation would clarify and ground existing doctrine. IV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chevron Questions and Major Questions as Delegation Questions It has become common to claim that there are \u201ctwo major questions doctrines\u201d and that the Roberts Court\u2019s recent major questions decisions represent a stronger or more aggressive version of the doctrine.[97] Yet as the foregoing discussion should make clear, both the major questions doctrine and the Court\u2019s post-Mead conception of Chevron share a common root: Delegation. In this regard both should be understood as instantiations of the delegation doctrine. Both seek to determine whether Congress delegated power to an agency. In a widely cited 2021 article, Professor Cass Sunstein argued that \u201cthe major questions doctrine has been understood in two radically different ways\u2014weak and strong\u2014and that the two have radically different implications.\u201d[98] The \u201cweak version\u201d entails denying Chevron deference to agencies in cases involving a major question, whereas the \u201cstrong version . . . operates as a clear statement principle\u201d that precludes certain agency interpretations, such as those that expand agency authority.[99] While it is certainly true that some applications of the major questions doctrine arise in a Chevron context and others do not, this account glosses over the unifying principle that can be found across major questions cases and that aligns them with the delegation conception of Chevron that has become dominant in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence. Denying Chevron deference about matters of profound economic and political significance means denying agencies the fundamentally legislative-like authority of deciding whether or not to regulate such matters. As Sunstein notes, granting Chevron deference in such instances \u201cmight seem to create a nondelegation problem,\u201d particularly insofar as it might allow agencies to define the scope of their own jurisdiction.[100] Thus the \u201cweak version\u201d of the major questions doctrine, no less than the \u201cstrong version,\u201d entails greater judicial reluctance to find that Congress has delegated authority to an agency. To illustrate this point consider FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., in which the Court concluded that the Food and Drug Administration lacked the authority to regulate tobacco and cigarettes as drugs and drug-delivery devices.[101] At one level, the Court rejected the claim that the FDA had the power\u2014indeed, the obligation\u2014to subject tobacco products to the broader regulatory regime governing drugs and medical devices because Congress had \u201cclearly precluded\u201d applying the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to tobacco products.[102] Yet the Court also explained that, insofar as the text of the FDCA could be considered to be ambiguous, the broader context and the stakes involved undercut the claim that any residual ambiguity in the statute represented \u201can implicit delegation\u201d to the FDA.[103] Brown & Williamson is often cited as an early major questions case, but it also fits comfortably into the Court\u2019s jurisprudence requiring evidence of Congress\u2019s intent to delegate authority before conferring deference to an agency. Note further that had the Court granted Chevron deference to the FDA in Brown & Williamson, it would have done more than allow for the FDA regulation of tobacco products under the FDCA. Granting Chevron deference would have granted the FDA the truly awesome power to decide whether tobacco products should be regulated under the FDCA. Such legislative-like authority is broader and more consequential than a statutory obligation to regulate tobacco products as drugs or medical devices. Thus, the power the FDA would have claimed under Chevron in Brown & Williamson is actually far greater than that which Congress ultimately delegated to the FDA in subsequent tobacco legislation.[104] King v. Burwell further illustrates the point.[105] Despite concluding that the relevant statutory text was ambiguous, the Chief Justice concluded that Chevron deference was inappropriate because there was no indication that Congress had sought to delegate to the Internal Revenue Service the authority to determine whether or not tax credits would be available on exchanges established by the federal government.[106] This was a question of vast economic and political significance but not solely because millions of dollars from the federal treasury were at stake. Had the Court granted Chevron deference to the IRS, it would have been granting more than mere interpretive authority. It would have been giving the IRS the discretionary authority to exercise the momentous policy choice of whether tax credits to support the purchase of individual health insurance policies would be available in the vast majority of states.[107] And while conferring Chevron deference would have produced the same immediate outcome\u2014making such tax credits available\u2014it would also have given the IRS the authority to change its mind in the future in accord with changes in control of the executive branch. So, although the Court ultimately agreed with the agency\u2019s interpretation, it could not conclude that Congress had delegated to the agency authority to make that determination. As cases like Brown & Williamson and King illustrate, decisions to deny Chevron deference to agency interpretations where the scope of the agency\u2019s own authority or other major questions are at stake, are just as much about determining how much power Congress has delegated to an agency as are major questions cases in which the Court directly addresses the substantive scope of agency authority without mention of Chevron at all. It is misleading to suggest that the former cases involve a \u201cweaker\u201d version of the major questions doctrine, as they are just as much about the delegation of power to an administrative agency. If, as the Court has repeatedly held, broad assertions of regulatory authority require greater or more explicit evidence of legislative delegation, there is no reason that the most recent quartet of major questions cases should have come out differently than the Chevron-related major questions cases that preceded them. V.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finding Answers in Arlington Seeds of a broader delegation doctrine can be seen in both the Court\u2019s recent major questions decisions, as well as in the Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence. Indeed, both sets of cases spring from the same roots: A recognition that agencies only have that authority that Congress has delegated to them. Thus, whenever an agency asserts authority to regulate, or even to interpret a law that the agency administers, the agency bears the burden of demonstrating that it has been granted the power it seeks to exercise. As it happens, Chief Justice Roberts outlined the foundation of a unified delegation doctrine in City of Arlington v. FCC, albeit in dissent.[108] As it also happens, Chief Justice Roberts was the author of both West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v. Nebraska. The question presented in City of Arlington was whether courts should apply Chevron deference to statutory ambiguities that implicate the scope or existence of an agency authority.[109] Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, refused to accept that applying Chevron deference to such questions should be treated differently from any other statutory ambiguity.[110] While acknowledging that \u201cChevron is rooted in a background presumption of congressional intent,\u201d he concluded that there was no basis for subjecting agency interpretations to greater scrutiny when the scope of an agency\u2019s authority was arguably at stake.[111] More significantly, he rejected the idea that the burden should be upon the agency to show that the power it would assert has in fact been delegated. Whereas the delegation doctrine would counsel that the question is whether a desired exercise of agency power was delegated, Justice Scalia concluded that \u201cthe question in every case is, simply, whether the statutory text forecloses the agency\u2019s assertion of authority, or not.\u201d[112] Chief Justice Roberts took the opposite view, articulating the foundational premises of a delegation doctrine. Wrote Roberts: A court should not defer to an agency until the court decides, on its own, that the agency is entitled to deference. Courts defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of law when and because Congress has conferred on the agency interpretive authority over the question at issue. An agency cannot exercise interpretive authority until it has it; the question whether an agency enjoys that authority must be decided by a court, without deference to the agency.[113] Whereas Justice Scalia heralded the use of Chevron to provide \u201ca stable background rule against which Congress can legislate,\u201d[114] Chief Justice Roberts noted that this formulation \u201cbegs the question of what that stable background rule is.\u201d[115] Added Roberts, \u201cif the legitimacy of Chevron deference is based on a congressional delegation of interpretive authority, then the line is one the Court must draw.\u201d[116] The power to offer a binding interpretation of a federal statute, like any other power an administrative agency might seek to exercise, must derive from a grant from Congress. And as when other agency powers are challenged, it is up to the courts, in the first instance, to determine whether the power claimed has been delegated. Conclusion Now that Justice Scalia is no longer on the Court, it appears that Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s vision of Chevron\u2019s applicability may be on the ascendance. If this delegation doctrine is to flower, the Court will need to take a broader and more principled approach to delegation than has been exhibited in the major questions doctrine cases to date. Rather than sorting cases artificially into those that are \u201cmajor\u201d and those that are not, the Court should instead recognize that it is always the agency\u2019s burden to demonstrate that power it seeks to exercise has been delegated, and that evaluating agency claims of authority requires a broad, context-sensitive inquiry into what Congress enacted. Such inquiries must start with the statutory text, to be sure, but they must also be sensitive to the nature of statutory drafting. As then-Judge Breyer noted in a 1985 lecture, \u201cCongress is more likely to have focused upon, and answered, major questions, while leaving interstitial matters to answer themselves in the course of [a] statute\u2019s daily administration.\u201d[117] The question of what power has been delegated to an agency is not meaningfully different from other inquiries courts routinely engage in to determine the scope and extent of power any other principal has delegated to an agent. In all such contexts, the broader, more extensive, more unusual, less precedented, or less expected the power claimed, the more evidence that such power has been delegated one would expect to find. This is not an innovation in statutory interpretation, but a restatement of what Courts have done in many contexts for quite some time.[118] The foundation of the delegation doctrine is that Article I vests legislative power in the hands of the Congress, and only through congressional action\u2014legislation\u2014can power to act with the force of law be given to administrative agencies. In every case, whether and how much power has been given is a matter for courts to decide, and both the magnitude and nature of the power asserted should inform the inquiry into whether such power was delegated. If Congress wishes to depart from the Constitution\u2019s baseline allocation of power, it must affirmatively do so, and courts should not presume such departures without evidence they have been accomplished. * Johan Verheij Memorial Professor of Law and Director of the Coleman P.

Wallison & John Yoo eds., Am. Enter. Inst. 2022). Administrative law lies at the intersection of civics, political science, and constitutional law, with each field contributing to the structure of and justification for the administrative state that governs much of contemporary life. Fortunately, administrative law attracts some of the brightest and most prolific scholars in the academy and legal profession. Through books, articles, and blog posts, they regularly debate the competing positions on how the regulatory state should be structured and how a particular architecture advances the public interest while remaining faithful (or not) to the tenets of the three fields noted above. There is an enormous body of literature in this field, and, given the subject\u2019s importance, there is no reason to believe that this scholarly output will slow down in the foreseeable future.[1] A recently published book\u2014The Administrative State Before the Supreme Court: Perspectives on the Nondelegation Doctrine\u2014is a timely and valuable contribution to that literature.[2] It addresses a subject of intense scrutiny in today\u2019s administrative law scholarship: the Nondelegation Doctrine.[3] Nondelegation literature focuses on the issue of what limits, if any, there are on Congress\u2019s ability to delegate to agencies the power to adopt rules that bind the public.[4] The editors, Peter Wallison and John Yoo, persuaded more than a dozen scholars and practitioners to examine the Nondelegation Doctrine and draft predictions about its future. The authors do not disappoint. The collection of essays brings to mind a remark made by President John F. Kennedy at a White House dinner for Nobel laureates. With his typical eloquence, President Kennedy said that \u201cthis is the most extraordinary collection of talent . . . that has ever been gathered together at the White House, with the possible exception of when Thomas Jefferson dined alone.\u201d[5] The same could be said about Nondelegation Perspectives. The goal of this book review is to do justice to the essayists and their work in this valuable book. The vitality of the Nondelegation Doctrine is an important public policy issue. Statutes and rules reflect a tradeoff between often-conflicting values, such as \u201chuman health versus economic growth.\u201d[6] Different people balance those interests differently, and the theory of our system is that the electorate chooses representatives to express its different views. But the citizenry elects none of the executive agency officials whom Congress vests with the authority to manage the national government\u2019s business, which perennially raises questions about the administrative state\u2019s legitimate role in governance.[7] Moreover, \u201c[a]dministrative agencies are issuing about 3,000 regulations with the force of law each year, roughly 28 times the number of public laws enacted annually by the Congress.\u201d[8] The legitimacy of delegated administrative governance, therefore, is no small potatoes matter. The Supreme Court has allowed Congress to use broadly and imprecisely written laws to substitute appointed for elected officials as policymakers. A vibrant Nondelegation Doctrine would return to the public a sizeable portion of its ability to choose its lawmakers. Part I of this review will summarize the Nondelegation Doctrine for the benefit of readers who are unfamiliar with it. (Administrative law professors, scholars, practitioners, and buffs can skip ahead to Part II). Part II will summarize the essays in Nondelegation Perspectives and discuss how they hope not only to advance the ball down the field, but also to persuade the most important potential participants\u2014the Justices of the Supreme Court of the United States\u2014to play the game. Part III will offer an observation from a fan of the game. I. Nondelegation Stirrings The Constitution is a delegation of \u201cPowers\u201d[9] from \u201cWe the People of the United States\u201d[10] to three different branches of a newly created national government.[11] Article I vests \u201call legislative Power\u201d over specified issues[12] in a Congress comprised of a Senate and a House of Representatives;[13] both chambers must agree to pass a law, and then persuade the President to sign it.[14] To ensure that most law-making happens in state legislatures and state courts, Article I makes the federal legislative process slow, deliberate, and onerous. To ensure that the electorate can hold legislators accountable for their votes, Article I also requires transparency by forcing each legislator\u2019s votes to be made public and requiring each chamber to keep a publicly available \u201cJournal of its Proceedings.\u201d[15] The predominant 18th-century legal theory also held that a legislature could not hand its lawmaking responsibilities over to an executive official.[16] The theory was that the people had delegated that authority to elected officials, and those officials could not abandon their post by vesting it\u2014and its attendant accountability\u2014in someone else. At least that was the theory.[17] From its earliest days, however, Congress empowered executive officials to find facts that triggered or eliminated the need for application of a particular law.[18] The Supreme Court saw no constitutional objection to that practice. As Chief Justice William Howard Taft wrote in J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, Congress may delegate to the executive the power to find facts or apply the law to the facts as long as Congress affords the President an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d that he or she must use.[19] Over time, however, Congress began to expand the authority of executive officials beyond the factfinding and law-applying responsibilities at issue in the Supreme Court\u2019s early decisions. Now, Congress sought to palm off difficult policy choices by delegating its lawmaking power to federal agencies with only the vaguest guidance as to how they should exercise it. Some delegations merely provide that an agency must act \u201cin the public interest,\u201d a requirement that would seem to apply without Congress even saying it.[20] Despite the tectonic shift in the practice of delegation, the Supreme Court did not enforce separation of powers principles by demanding that Congress itself use its legislative power. In fact, but for two 1935 decisions holding unconstitutional delegations to executive officials,[21] the Court has sustained every federal law challenged on this ground.[22] The Court explained why in Mistretta v. United States, where it reasoned (if starting from a premise that assumes the conclusion counts as \u201creasoning\u201d) that \u201cCongress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate power under broad general directives.\u201d[23] The Nondelegation Doctrine looked dead.[24] Nonetheless, several commentators have attempted to revive the doctrine over the last few decades.[25] They have argued that the Nondelegation Doctrine can and should address the economic, social, and political ills that result from the relentless growth of the administrative state. Among those ills are the continually expanding power regulators have over public and private life; the unwillingness of Congress to do anything other than shovel more responsibility over to unelected executive officials to avoid taking responsibility for making hard choices; and the ceaseless parade of Presidents succumbing to their desire to undertake ever more regal governance of what they treat as their kingdom. Those baneful consequences, this insurgency notes, followed from the Supreme Court\u2019s willful refusal to enforce the separation of powers principles that a vital Nondelegation Doctrine would protect. In 1980, the Supreme Court offered a tantalizing suggestion that there might be life left in the Nondelegation Doctrine.[26] Perhaps, the doctrine would become a phoenix rather than a corpse. But that hint was all we saw; there was nary a holding.[27] The Court declined several later opportunities to revive the doctrine.[28] The Court did so even in a case asking whether Congress could delegate taxation authority to an agency, a subject of particular interest to the Founding Generation.[29] At the beginning of the new century, Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to dash all hope for a rebirth of the Nondelegation Doctrine. Writing for the Court in 2001 in Whitman v. American Trucking Associations, he rejected the argument that Congress had unconstitutionally delegated lawmaking power to the Environmental Protection Agency Administrator by allowing her to set an ambient air quality standard containing \u201can adequate margin of safety\u201d that is \u201crequisite to protect the public health.\u201d[30] With the American Trucking decision, whatever hope there was for a rebirth of the Nondelegation Doctrine seemed to have vanished. But in 2019, five Justices expressed a willingness in two different cases\u2014Gundy v. United States[31] and Paul v. United States[32]\u2014to reconsider the Court\u2019s Nondelegation Doctrine precedents. Gundy was a nondelegation challenge to a provision in the Sex Offender Registration and Notification Act (SORNA)[33] directing the U.S. Attorney General to decide whether the act\u2019s provisions should apply to offenders convicted before the act became law.[34] The nondelegation issue arose because SORNA did not identify any factors that the Attorney General should consider or any finding that the Attorney General must make when deciding whether to apply SORNA retroactively. Put into Nondelegation Doctrine terms, SORNA identified no \u201cintelligible principle\u201d for the Attorney General to use, even though the presence of some such standard had been critical to the Supreme Court\u2019s jurisprudence. Only eight Justices participated in the Gundy decision because Justice Brett Kavanaugh had not yet joined the Court. The Court upheld the SORNA delegation to the Attorney General by a 5-3 vote, but Justice Samuel Alito, who voted with the majority, wrote separately to express his willingness to reconsider the Nondelegation Doctrine in a different case.[35] The three dissenters would have struck down this provision of SORNA as a violation of the Nondelegation Doctrine.[36] That made four Justices willing to breathe life into the doctrine. Paul was a different case involving the same statute, but this time Justice Kavanaugh had joined the Court. In an opinion accompanying the denial of review in Paul given the Court\u2019s ruling in Gundy, Justice Kavanaugh also signaled a willingness to reconsider the Nondelegation Doctrine. That made five Justices willing to revisit the subject. Atop that, another new member, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, joined the roster in 2020, and she has not yet expressed her views on the subject. As a result, there is reason to believe that the Court is now willing to decide whether the Nondelegation Doctrine is a living part of our law or just a phantasm like Jacob Marley\u2019s ghost. Nondelegation Perspectives therefore appears at an auspicious time. It no longer is a hopeless task to argue the Nondelegation Doctrine should be given new life.[37] The book\u2019s essayists make an impressive case that the Court should do just that. II. Laying Out the Playing Field, Defining the Rules of the Game, and Encouraging People to Play The essays in Nondelegation Perspectives fit neatly into three categories. Two of them\u2014the ones by Professors Jonathan Adler and John Harrison[38]\u2014demarcate the playing field within which the Nondelegation Doctrine should operate, thereby limiting its reach. Another group of essays\u2014by Professors Gary Lawson, Michael Rappaport, and David Schoenbrod, as well as by litigators Todd Gaziano and Ethan Bevins of the Pacific Legal Foundation (PLF) and Mark Chenoweth and Richard Samp of the New Civil Liberties Alliance (NCLA)\u2014offer different rules by which the game should be played.[39] The remaining essays\u2014by Professors Saikrishna Bangalore Prakash and Joseph Postell (along with brief repeat performances by Schoenbrod, Gaziano, and Blevins)\u2014encourage people (read: Supreme Court Justices) to play the game by arguing that the consequences of revitalizing the Nondelegation Doctrine would not be as disastrous as supporters of today\u2019s administrative state would claim.[40] A. Laying Out the Playing Field Rather than start by suggesting an alternative to the J.W. Hampton \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test, Professor Adler takes a step back to consider what should be the boundaries of the Nondelegation Doctrine. Borrowing language from the analysis used in cases applying the Chevron Doctrine, he proposes that the Supreme Court start its nondelegation analysis at what he calls \u201cStep Zero\u201d and ask whether Congress intended to authorize an agency to engage in internal or external regulation. That is, the threshold question should be whether Congress merely empowered government officials to regulate their own performance of the government\u2019s business or instead empowered an agency to regulate the conduct of private parties or the private market. The first kind of delegation concerns the internal operation of (for example) the Postal Service, while the other allows officials to direct the conduct of private parties so that the Post Office can execute its mail delivery responsibilities.[41] The former would allow a Postmaster to decide when to be open for business and whom to hire as a Pony Express rider; the latter, to fix the size and sturdiness of mailboxes for home delivery.[42] The latter is far more intrusive, so it makes sense for courts to decide whether Congress intended to allow agencies to order compliance with federal dictates and, if so, just how far agencies may go. Professor Harrison steps back even further. Like Prof. Adler, he wants courts to distinguish between regulations governing the conduct of government officials and regulations directing the actions of nongovernment parties in the private sector. But he simply would not apply the Nondelegation Doctrine to the former type of actions. The federal government owns and manages property just as private individuals do, as the Constitution recognizes.[43] Professor Harrison asks whether it makes sense for the Nondelegation Doctrine\u2014developed to address Congress\u2019s decisions to vest executive officials with the power to regulate private conduct and private property\u2014to govern how the national government regulates public conduct and public property. He answers that question, \u201cNo.\u201d[44] Professors Adler and Harrison are spot-on about their proposals. Consider the way Professor Adler\u2019s Step Zero proposal is analogous to the common law. The laws of contracts, torts, and crime affect how individuals live and work, but the rules of civil and criminal procedure do not have that effect unless someone is involved in litigation. While it makes sense for Congress to adopt substantive legal rules, Congress could reasonably empower the courts to regulate their own operations, even when the rules they make affect private parties. Deciding what should be contained in a complaint or indictment, an answer or arraignment, or a judgment is precisely the type of task that the Framers might reasonably have believed the judiciary is better suited to than are members of Congress, who are not all lawyers. Professor Adler\u2019s Step Zero proposal asks the Supreme Court to pursue just that type of analysis. It also helps make sense of two Marshall Court decisions that went in different directions regarding delegation. On the one hand, in Wayman v. Southard, Chief Justice John Marshall found unobjectionable a provision in the Judiciary Act of 1789[45] that delegated to the courts the authority to define the necessary elements and format of a judgment;[46] on the other hand, Justice William Johnson, Jr., concluded in United States v. Hudson and Goodwin that the federal courts could not define federal crimes.[47] Step Zero analysis resolves the apparent tension between these decisions by applying the Nondelegation Doctrine to defining substantive crimes, but not to creating procedural rules. Professor Harrison\u2019s essay also offers a valuable insight. Congress\u2019s purpose is to exercise the authority vested in its members to create new federal law to govern the private conduct of the entire nation or some subset of its members in one of the categories set forth in Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. Once Congress has completed its task, executive officials carry those laws into effect, and courts adjudicate disputes arising under them.[48] But when an executive official manages federal property or money, he or she is not regulating the conduct of private parties. On the contrary, that official is acting as a landlord, caretaker, or trustee charged with the proper management of whatever property the national government holds in the public\u2019s name for its use. That property might be real estate in the form of a forest or open land that will be used to construct federal ships or buildings, or it might be the ships and buildings after they are built. Congress can tell executive officials not to allow that property to waste away, which is a sufficiently intelligible principle for that purpose. Indeed, Congress might not need to do even that because that duty would be an implicit requirement of the responsibility for managing it. Either way, as Professor Harrison explains, the J.W. Hampton intelligible principle standard (and a healthy dose of common sense) is a sufficient guideline for the President to know what to do in this regard. The issue is more complicated when the property is characterized as a \u201clicense,\u201d as it is in the case of radio and television broadcast licenses, or as the \u201cintangible right\u201d to freely navigate interstate waterways, rather than as realty or personalty. Nonetheless, as Professor Harrison maintains, the same principle should govern.[49] If the Privileges and Immunities Clause of Article IV[50] guarantees the freedom to travel by water from one state to another,[51] to the 18th-century mind, that right would be protected as a communal form of \u201cproperty\u201d that the national government would manage for the benefit of all.[52] Adler and Harrison do the helpful preliminary work of establishing where a revived Nondelegation Doctrine should and should not apply\u2014of setting the foul lines. The doctrine is meant to protect citizens from an overzealous executive branch hampering their freedom without democratic warrant or accountability, not to make it difficult for the executive branch to set rules for itself. B. Defining the Rules of the Game The English and American common law was the canvas upon which the Framers painted. Professor Lawson extracts from that canvas principles of agency law that distinguish between what the principals\u2014members of the public\u2014expect that their agents\u2014Representatives and Senators\u2014must carry out themselves and what those agents may subdelegate to others\u2014executive and judicial branch officials.[53] As Professor Lawson explains, the Constitution contains a delegation from \u201cWe the People\u201d of the \u201clegislative Power\u201d to the \u201cCongress.\u201d Eighteenth-century law governing the relationship between principals and agents was strict. An agent could not subdelegate his or her responsibilities to third parties whom the principal did not select for an assigned job.[54] There was, however, a small amount of wiggle room. Atop their assigned powers, agents possessed certain ancillary powers, limited in number and scope, that were necessary to complete their assigned tasks.[55] Assign John Doe the job of building a barn or a ship, and he may hire carpenters and purchase supplies.[56] Chief Justice Marshall drew on those principal-agent rules in his opinion in Wayman, which upheld a delegation allowing the federal court to draft rules of procedure.[57] Applying these principles to the Constitution, Professor Lawson explains, Congress could assign nonlegislative tasks to executive officials and judges for the proper execution and smooth operation of the government\u2019s business.[58] Among them would be making factual findings (such as deciding whether Tom Roe was a soldier in General George Washington\u2019s colonial army and therefore is entitled to a pension); applying the law to the facts (such as determining the amount of customs due to the government from a particular shipment[59]); and deciding what to do when the facts and law are clear but do not answer a given question (such as deciding what to do with people convicted of a crime and sentenced to incarceration[60]). Relying on common-law agency principles might not provide as bright a line for delegation purposes as might be available in other areas of constitutional law\u2014the Sixth Amendment begins with the phrase \u201cIn all criminal prosecutions,\u201d so its requirements do not apply to ordinary civil contract disputes\u2014but it is miles from drawing an arbitrary line and also from the type of line-drawing that divided Judges Benjamin Cardozo and William Andrews in Palsgraf.[61] Professor Rappaport offers a two-tiered approach to delegation questions, an approach that will be familiar to anyone who has dealt with equal protection law. Just as equal protection law applies strict scrutiny for classifications based on race or lineage and a less exacting review to economic legislation,[62] the professor would employ strict or lenient review for different types of delegations. Strict review is appropriate for \u201crules that regulate the private rights of individuals in the domestic sphere.\u201d[63] The effect of applying strict scrutiny would be to bar executive officials from \u201cexercising any policymaking discretion.\u201d[64] Three types of activities lie outside of \u201cpolicymaking\u201d: (1) finding the facts, (2) interpreting the law, and (3) applying the law to the facts.[65] Those exceptions, in my opinion, certainly make sense. After all, the Constitution and Bill of Rights require a jury trial in criminal and (most) civil cases, and the first and third categories just mentioned are the classic roles for a jury to fill.[66] The second activity is inherent in the President\u2019s sworn obligation to enforce the law.[67] To do so, he must decide, with the advice of his chief lieutenants, what that law is.[68] Accordingly, the category for which strict nondelegation review is appropriate is internally coherent. It also parallels the \u201cprivate rights\u201d doctrine under which a party is entitled to have an Article III judge act as ultimate decisionmaker, rather allow an Article II official to have the final say.[69] By contrast, lenient review is appropriate for subjects that fall within traditional executive responsibilities.[70] Among them are regulation of the military;[71] the conduct of foreign affairs, including foreign commerce;[72] managing federal property;[73] and spending appropriated funds.[74] Professor Rappaport\u2019s approach avoids requiring the type of undirected line-drawing that has scared off the Supreme Court for nearly 90 years, and it also has the virtue of exempting subject matters that fit comfortably with the powers that the Framers expressly vested in the President. NCLA\u2019s Chenoweth and Samp offer a similar proposal. They say that the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test has \u201cgradually expanded with repeated use\u2014like a worn-out elastic band\u201d\u2014so that every imaginable statutory formulation satisfies it.[75] They propose instead a three-step inquiry. First, if Congress has literally or effectively provided the agency with no standard at all other than a vacuous goal, the delegation should be held per se invalid. A directive to regulate \u201cin the public interest,\u201d say Chenoweth and Samp, is equivalent to having no standard at all because an agency would be obliged to pursue that goal even if Congress wrote nothing in the statute to focus the agency\u2019s conduct.[76] Second, they would require Congress to provide guidance to executive officials that is sufficiently clear that a reviewing court can discern whether the agency has complied with its directive. That \u201cclear statement principle\u201d would \u201cshift the focus from whether Congress has given an \u2018intelligible principle\u2019 to the executive (which judges may be ill-equipped to ascertain) to ask instead whether Congress has provided sufficient standards to the judiciary\u201d for judges to determine whether an agency has gone off on a frolic and detour of its own devise.[77] Finally, they argue certain core legislative powers should be deemed nondelegable. Rather than ask whether an issue is sufficiently important that a court would expect that Congress would have resolved it rather than delegate it to an agency\u2014the essence of the Supreme Court\u2019s Major Questions Doctrine[78]\u2014Chenoweth and Samp urge the Court to identify \u201ccore legislative functions\u201d that Congress cannot hand over to executive officials. The taxing power, the spending power (at least as to the amount and source of appropriated funds), the power to define criminal laws, the authority to make policy-based tradeoffs, the ability to engage in oversight of the executive branch\u2014those are core legislative functions that Congress should not be allowed to pass off to the executive, regardless of whether an agency has superior expertise in the field at issue or the members want to avoid accountability for taking a politically unpopular position.[79] PLF\u2019s Gaziano and Blevins argue that the answer to our nondelegation conundrum has been standing there right before our eyes all along. The Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine is the offspring of the marriage of criminal and constitutional law. The century-plus-old doctrine provides that a statute must afford \u201cordinary people\u201d[80]\u2014 people of \u201ccommon\u201d[81] or \u201cordinary\u201d intelligence[82]\u2014fair notice of what is a crime.[83] A criminal law is impermissibly vague when its text \u201ceither forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and differ as to its application\u201d[84] or its \u201cmandates are so uncertain that they will reasonably admit of different constructions.\u201d[85] The Void-for-Vagueness and Nondelegation Doctrines share a common denominator: \u201cA law must not allow those enforcing it to essentially make it up as they go along.\u201d[86] An added feature of this argument is that, if a regulatory scheme can be enforced through the criminal law, the Supreme Court must apply the Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine to the substantive provisions of the underlying statute to satisfy the notice concerns that doctrine enforces.[87] Finally, Professor Schoenbrod, a 30-year student of the Nondelegation Doctrine, comes at the issue from a unique direction. Rather than address nondelegation concerns by tightening the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d standard or by enhancing the degree of scrutiny that the courts should use to review delegated rulemaking, he suggests that courts approach the problem by capping the costs that an agency should be able to impose on the nation at $100 million. That amount didn\u2019t come from nowhere. Under the last five Presidents, any rule that would have an annual effect on the national economy of $100 million or more is a \u201csignificant regulatory action\u201d that must be submitted to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs for review.[88] That standard also defines a \u201cmajor\u201d rule for purposes of the Congressional Review Act,[89] which requires new agency rules to be submitted to Congress for its review.[90] Schoenbrod urges the Supreme Court to use that dollar amount as the limit of a permissible delegation. If the President and Congress have made it clear by executive order and statute that they\u2014the political branches\u2014must review \u201csignificant\u201d or \u201cmajor\u201d rules before they can take effect, the Court will only be enforcing what the other branches of government have already found to be a reasonable dividing line. The bottom line is this: The essays discussed above offer the Supreme Court a handful of different nondelegation standards to use to ensure that Congress and agencies respect the limitations on Articles I and II. The Court could even combine two or more of them. Collectively, they answer the argument that there is no principled way to decide which delegations are in the field of play and which are out of bounds. C. Encouraging People to Play the Game The essays discussed above matter little if a majority of Supreme Court Justices proves unwilling to awaken the slumbering Nondelegation Doctrine. As I noted earlier, the Court has not held unconstitutional any congressional delegation to an executive agency since Panama Refining and Schechter Poultry in 1935, but five of the current Justices have signaled a willingness to reconsider the Court\u2019s precedents. Add in the fact that the newest member\u2014Justice Barrett\u2014has not opined publicly on the issue, and you see a possibility that the Court might revisit the doctrine. The burden of the remaining essays is to give the Court a reason to take that step. They do so by addressing a claim that always arises whenever the Court is asked to reject or modify a longstanding body of case law: namely, that the roof will fall in if the Court removes even one of the columns supporting it. It is sensible for the courts to be concerned about the potentially destabilizing consequences of revitalizing the Nondelegation Doctrine. But the risk that Congress\u2019s ability to do its job would collapse is not a severe one. There is federal precedent to support that conclusion. The Supreme Court has ample experience deciding when a legislature has punted its responsibility to draft an easily understandable law under the Void-for-Vagueness Doctrine.[91] The successful application of that doctrine shows that the Court is capable of making reasoned judgments of this kind, and that the sky won\u2019t fall when the Court holds a statute unconstitutional. Besides, says Professor Postell, chaos hasn\u2019t befallen the states that have enforced their own versions of a Nondelegation Doctrine. Professor Postell reaches that conclusion after surveying what state courts have done when resolving nondelegation claims.[92] In his opinion, the state decisions have generally adopted a standard similar to the \u201cintelligible principle\u201d test adopted in J.W. Hampton and found in the Supreme Court\u2019s later case law.[93] Moreover, the \u201cprevailing\u201d approach in the \u201cvast\u201d majority of the states has been to follow the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s practice of applying a rather \u201clax\u201d review to state legislative delegations.[94] What is different is that some states have been more willing to examine critically whether \u201cstatutes seem to have been carelessly drafted and have contained no limits on agency discretion\u201d and whether \u201cstatutes adequately define an agency\u2019s scope of authority by examining whether the persons subject to the agency\u2019s authority are carefully identified in the statute.\u201d[95] State courts in Alaska, Florida, Illinois, Montana, Oklahoma, and Vermont have been more willing to scrutinize state legislative delegations. Even then, those states that use a slightly more rigorous analysis have not demanded the impossible from their legislatures.[96] Contra Justice Elena Kagan, those state courts have not declared that most of state government is unconstitutional.[97] Most importantly, nothing in Professor Postell\u2019s discussion of state law suggests that the sky has fallen in those states. Professor Prakash offers a variety of ways that the Supreme Court could prevent the \u201cchaos\u201d that allegedly would arise from tasking Congress with doing its job.[98] To begin with, the Court could proceed incrementally, making clear that its initial ruling striking down a particular act on nondelegation grounds does not doom a host of other statutes.[99] A modest beginning might force the Court to consider a large number of cases, but the Court recently has been willing to follow that case-by-case or statute-by-statute course when deciding which agency appointment and removal provisions satisfy the Article II Appointments Clause.[100] That slow-but-steady approach does not mean that the Court is just putting off the inevitable, or that the roof will eventually collapse. In 1995, in United States v. Lopez, the Court held unconstitutional an act of Congress making it a crime to possess a firearm in the vicinity of a school, ruling that Congress had exceeded its authority under the Commerce Clause in criminalizing intrastate conduct.[101] Despite prophecies of impending doom, ten years later the Court held in Gonzales v. Raich that Congress could make it unlawful to possess cannabis grown and used entirely in-state.[102] A revived Nondelegation Doctrine does not mean that all statutes with delegations will be struck down. Some will; some won\u2019t.[103] The Supreme Court also could delay the issuance of a nondelegation judgment to give Congress time to consider revising the offending statute and adopting all or some of the existing corpus of agency rules. The Court used its remedial power in this way when it held bankruptcy laws unconstitutional in 1982 in Northern Pipeline Construction Co. v. Marathon Pipe Line Co.[104] The Court issued its opinion on June 28, but stayed the issuance of its judgment until October 4 to \u201cafford Congress an opportunity to reconstitute the bankruptcy courts or to adopt other valid means of adjudication, without impairing the interim administration of the bankruptcy laws.\u201d[105] On the latter date, the Court further stayed the issuance of its judgment until December 24.[106] The two stays gave Congress nearly six months to revise the bankruptcy laws in light of the Court\u2019s ruling in Northern Pipeline. The Court could do the same if it were to hold a congressional delegation unconstitutional to avoid potential deleterious disruption. Congress could then decide not only whether and how to revise the relevant statute, but also which agency rules to adopt as an act of Congress to avoid future challenges.[107] Professor Prakash also reminds us that members of Congress and the President will be under intense political pressure from the electorate and various interest groups to prevent chaos and significant societal harm by allowing agency rules to disintegrate.[108] Both political branches will have a strong interest in responding quickly to a rebirth of the Nondelegation Doctrine by passing some legislation that codifies some of thousands of existing agency rules for some period of time, even if only as a stop-gap measure so that members and the President can negotiate a reasonable response to the Supreme Court\u2019s ruling. Congress and the President could take that burden up themselves or create a bipartisan and bicameral regulatory commission to offer its suggestions about which existing rules Congress ought to codify into law. In making those decisions, Congress could consider all of an agency\u2019s rules in one omnibus bill\u2014a \u201cCongressional Adoption Act\u201d[109]\u2014or Congress could group rules into separate categories across multiple bills. Congress could also adopt agency rules for a limited period\u2014say, one year, which is the standard life for an appropriations bill\u2014rather than in perpetuity. That course would effectively sunset those rules.[110] To make matters easier for Congress, agencies could identify statutes they believe need clarification and postpone new rulemakings until the status of their current rules has been clarified. Critics will contend that Congress could never pass legislation as clear, specific, and multifarious as would be necessary to consider an entire tranche of regulations, particularly in the Senate given the filibuster. But Professor Schoenbrod correctly notes that Congress has succeeded in that regard before by using a \u201cfast-track\u201d procedure that requires an \u201cup or down\u201d vote on an entire package of proposals. The Trade Act of 1974[111] and the Defense Base Closure and Realignment Act of 1990[112] use just such a procedure when Congress must vote on international trade agreements or the closure of domestic military bases. Another example is the Congressional Review Act, which gives the members of each chamber the opportunity to hold an up-or-down vote after limited debate on an agency\u2019s new rules.[113] That is a complete legal answer to the critics\u2019 argument that Congress could not expedite its consideration and hold a vote on an overall package of agency rules. Is there a guarantee that Congress would adopt predicate legislation establishing such an expedited procedure and up-or-down vote? No, of course not. Congress would need to pass that legislation before voting on a package of agency rules, and anyone who does not want to cast a vote on the latter bill certainly would use every available tool and trick, legitimate or not, to keep the predicate bill from becoming law. But if that were to happen, the blame for any ensuing chaos would fall on the members of Congress, not the Justices, for it would be the members who would be responsible for scuttling the agency rules. Would the absence of a guarantee that Congress will act responsibly influence how the Justices vote? The Justices\u2019 job is to give the public their honest interpretation of what the Constitution demands, not to anticipate whether members of Congress will engage in shenanigans to avoid having to cast a vote that would anger their constituents and cost them their sinecures. Still, the Justices could try to peer over the horizon to guess how Congress would respond and let that guess influence their decisionmaking. Only time will tell how that possibility plays out. III. Suggestions From a Fan of the Game I have but three points to add to the perspectives of the fine essays discussed above. The first one is this: It makes sense to consider the potential relevance of Article 39 of Magna Carta to the mix of considerations discussed in Nondelegation Perspectives.[114] Magna Carta was a peace treaty between the English barons and King John adopted to end a rebellion against the crown because of the king\u2019s abusive exercise of royal powers. The best-known provision of the Great Charter is Article 39, once described as \u201ca plain, popular statement of the most elementary rights\u201d of Englishmen.[115] It provided that \u201cno free man is to be imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or damaged without lawful judgement of his peers or by the law of the land.\u201d[116] Chapter 39 placed the king under the \u201crule of law\u201d by prohibiting him from taking the law into his own hands. It achieved that goal by guaranteeing that the Crown would be subject to \u201cthe law of the land,\u201d[117] which, according to Sir Edward Coke, was \u201cthe Common Law, Statute Law, or Custome of England.\u201d[118] The First Congress carried that obligation forward in the Fifth Amendment Due Process Clause.[119] The phrases \u201claw of the land\u201d and \u201cdue process of law,\u201d integral to the English law, became equally central to the American understanding of the rule of law.[120] The First Congress incorporated those principles by including the Due Process Clause in the Fifth Amendment, added via the Bill of Rights. Magna Carta bolsters the argument that the Constitution limits the type of lawmaking that nonelected federal officials may undertake. Would the English barons have understood the term \u201claw of the land\u201d to include diktats from King John, the very person that Chapter 39 was designed to restrain? If he could unilaterally change the common law by his own pronouncements, what good would Chapter 39 have been? Given the circumstances surrounding its adoption, Chapter 39 would have made no difference if the crown could make new law simply by signing a piece of parchment containing an order and the king\u2019s signature. When executive officials make new law without adequate congressional warrant, they are acting as King John did apart from the restraint of Magna Carta. Our Constitution\u2014the descendant of the Great Charter\u2014should be held to prevent them from doing so. Second, a principal explanation for why the Court has been reluctant to hold congressional delegations invalid is the line-drawing problem that an aggressive application of that doctrine would require. At bottom, the Court does not want to substitute judicial lawmaking for executive lawmaking because the public cannot boot the courts out of office when they go too far. Deciding which delegations are just right and which ones are a tad too much is like deciding whether Helen Palsgraf proved her negligence claim.[121] There is no easy, neat, clean, and subjectivity-free way to slice that pie, the Supreme Court has concluded, so why even try?[122] The answer is that it is the judiciary\u2019s job to force Congress and the President to do theirs. The Framers created a system that would compel elected officials to make the difficult policy decisions, tradeoffs, and compromises necessary for our government to make law, and to do so in a manner that allows the public to hold those officials electorally accountable for their votes. The judiciary must refrain from doing the work assigned to the elected branches and also avoid giving the public the impression that it has substituted government by judicial order for government by executive lawmaking. The essays in Nondelegation Perspectives give the Justices multiple nonexclusive options to force Congress to do its job, to prevent the President from doing Congress\u2019s work, and to avoid taking on that responsibility themselves. That\u2019s a trifecta worth accomplishing for the public\u2019s benefit. My third point is this: In several decisions rendered over the last decade, including one handed down on the last day of the Supreme Court\u2019s October 2021 Term, the Court has restrained the adventurous campaigns of some federal agencies via what it has called the Major Questions Doctrine.[123] Under that doctrine, agencies cannot pursue regulatory initiatives with vast economic or social effects unless Congress has clearly authorized them to do so.[124] In other words, the doctrine directs the courts not to read broad, generally phrased statutory provisions as empowering agencies to make decisions of tremendous economic or social importance.[125] The effect of that doctrine is much the same as the effect of the Nondelegation Doctrine. Both require Congress to legislate with some level of specificity if it seeks to delegate power, both prevent agencies from manufacturing congressional authority by stretching the meanings of terms past their breaking point, and both send back to Congress the lawmaking responsibility that every member of Congress voluntarily sought and assumed. The Major Questions Doctrine only strikes down agency rules rather than holding statutory provisions unconstitutional, but it could force Congress to make the important but potentially unpopular decisions that our nation needs it to make. Even if it is only a second-best option, the Major Questions Doctrine gets us at least halfway to nondelegation. IV. Conclusion Nondelegation Perspectives deserves a place in the library of anyone interested either in the development of administrative law or in any of the three rivers that run together to create it. The authors who wrote the essays it contains are accomplished scholars or litigators, and their chapters illuminate a variety of different ways that the Supreme Court could revive the Nondelegation Doctrine without causing the administrative law world to come to an end. If you believe that the administrative state has grown too large for effective oversight and too powerful for a democratic republic to justify because Congress has grown too reluctant to do the heavy lifting that modern-day governance demands and too willing to punt difficult problems to regulators, you will find that Nondelegation Perspectives is an excellent discussion of how the Supreme Court could become re-engaged in the review of congressional delegations. The wisdom found in this book is well worth the time spent reading it. * The views expressed in this article are the author\u2019s own and should not be construed as representing any official position of The Heritage Foundation.

[2] The Administrative State Before the Supreme Court: Perspectives on the Nondelegation Doctrine (Peter J. Wallison & John Yoo eds. Am. Enter. Inst. 2022) (hereafter Nondelegation Perspectives). [3] Several other issues are also the subject of ongoing debate. One is what deference, if any, should the courts afford an agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute or agency rule. See, e.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. 837 (1984) (statute); Kisor v. Wilkie, 139 S. Ct. 2400 (2019) (agency rule). Another is what limitations, if any, may Congress place on the President\u2019s authority to remove agency officials. See, e.g., Collins v. Yellen, 141 S. Ct. 1761 (2021) (presidential removal); Free Enter. Fund v. Pub. Co. Accounting Oversight Bd., 561 U.S. 477 (2010) (same). A third issue is the clarity and specificity required of Congress to grant agencies broad authority to decide major economic- and social-policy issues. See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, 142 S. Ct. 2587 (2022); Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n Indep. Business (NFIB) v. OSHA, 142 S. Ct. 661 (2022); Ala. Ass\u2019n of Realtors v. HHS, 141 S. Ct. 1485 (2021); Utility Air Reg\u2019y Grp. v. EPA, 573 U.S. 302 (2014). Still another issue is the application of the Seventh Amendment civil jury trial guarantee to common law actions that an agency seeks to litigate before an administrative law judge rather than in federal district court. See Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 445, 451-59 (5th Cir. 2022). Finally, there is the issue of what, if any, limitations there are on a legislature\u2019s power to delegate lawmaking authority to private parties. See, e.g., Carter v. Carter Coal, 298 U.S. 238 (1936); Eubank v. Richmond, 226 U.S. 137 (1912). For a sample of the literature discussing those issues, see Thomas W. Merrill, The Chevron Doctrine: Its Rise and Fall, and the Future of the Administrative State (2022); Aditya Bamzai,\u00a0The Origins of Judicial Deference to Executive Interpretation, 126\u00a0Yale L.J.\u00a0908 (2017); Paul J.

See The Cargo of the Brig Aurora v. United States, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) 382 (1813) (upholding that delegation).

A plurality of the Court ruled that the standard was not supported by substantial evidence. Id. at 630-62 (plurality opinion). Justice Rehnquist concurred only in the judgment.

[41] Professor Adler also would have Congress address the back end of the regulatory process by using sunset provisions to force Congress to re-examine whether regulatory programs make sense given new technological, societal, and legal developments since the members last voted on the relevant regulatory scheme. Adler 166-71. Professor Adler elaborated on that point in Jonathan H. Adler & Christopher J. Walker, Delegation and Time, 105 Iowa L. Rev. 1931 (2020). For example, by 2022, the internet has completely upended the foundation of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 101-104, 110 Stat. 56 (codified at 47 U.S.C. ch. 5 (2018)). Adler argued that Congress should reconsider whether that law remains a sensible regulation of private conduct. The same is true in the area of environmental law. Congress last revised the Clean Air Act in 1990. Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Pub. L. No. 101-549, 104 Stat. 2468 (codified at 42 U.S.C. ch. 85 (2018)). At that time, Congress did not adopt rules specifically governing greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide. Nonetheless, a 5-4 majority of the Supreme Court held that the EPA could regulate greenhouse gases under that act in Massachusetts v. EPA, 549 U.S. 497 (2007). Sunset provisions in regulatory schemes would force Congress to revisit such governing statutes on a regular basis and update or repeal them as necessary. A sunset provision is an excellent idea, but the Supreme Court cannot impose it on Congress under the Nondelegation Doctrine or any other. The Constitution contains but one statutory sunset provision: appropriations for the army cannot extend more than two years. U.S. Const. art. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 12. Congress itself must adopt any others. [42] A Brief History of Mailboxes, National Mailboxes, https://www.nationalmailboxes.com/learn/ (last visited June 20, 2022).

Larkin, Jr., The Original Understanding of \u201cProperty\u201d in the Constitution, 100 Marq. L. Rev. 1, 18-19 (2016) (footnotes omitted): The term \u201cright\u201d acquired its modern understanding in the seventeenth century.\u00a0Originally, that term referred only to a valid title of ownership, such as the title to real estate. The terms \u201cliberty\u201d or \u201cprivilege\u201d were more commonly used than \u201cright.\u201d They referred either to the protections all enjoyed against the arbitrary actions of the Crown or to a benefit bestowed on particular individuals by the king. Yet, the modern-day notion of a \u201cright\u201d as an enforceable legal guarantee arose during the great religious and political battles between the Crown and Parliament during the seventeenth century. Parliament, for example, opposed the efforts of the Stuart kings to raise revenue without authorization from Parliament by arguing that the king's actions undercut the right of the people to be governed by their elected representatives. Defenders of religious and political dissenters also argued that individuals have a fundamental right of freedom of conscience that disabled the government from coercing them to adopt a particular belief. The understanding of a \u201cright\u201d therefore changed in two important ways during that period. The first was that the concept of \u201cright\u201d had expanded \u201cto embrace and even subsume the variety of claims and activities formerly classified as \u2018liberties and privileges.\u2019\u201d\u00a0The second change was that \u201cthe notion of ownership that lay at the core of the original meaning of right now described just what it was that the holders of rights enjoyed.\u201d Unlike a liberty or privilege that the state could withdraw, a right was something that its possessor owned, just as he owned land. [53] Lawson 123-60. [54] \u201cGenerally speaking, the principal would specify what the agent was entrusted to do, and the agent could not pass that responsibility on to someone else because the principal chose a particular assignment for a specific task.\u201d Id. at 143. [55] \u201cBut the agency agreement could expressly or impliedly allow for Subdelegation given the nature of the instrument, the task, or both.\u201d Id. [56] \u201cUnder founding-era agency-law principles, agents could authorize subagents to \u2018fill up the details\u2019 of powers granted to the agents, but only with respect to incidental matters, and under founding-era principles of government, federal executive and judicial officials applying congressional laws were subagents to the background rules of agency law.\u201d Id. at 126 (citation omitted).

[59] Congress might set the rate per ton, but somebody else must weigh the cargo and calculate the payment. [60] Congress must pass criminal laws that authorize imprisonment, but somebody else must decide where a prisoner should be confined and when to let him go. That was not as readily answerable a question as it would be today. Early in our history, there were no federal prisons. Federal courts sentenced convicted offenders to confinement in any in-state prison willing to accept them. Otherwise, the federal marshal had to rent space elsewhere as a temporary jail until other arrangements could be made. Paul J. Larkin, Jr., Parole: Corpse or Phoenix?, 50 Am. Crim. L.

Lafferty | Alexander S. Holtan Highlights The U.S. Supreme Court announced that it has agreed to hear the case of SEC v. Jarkesy. The case is on appeal from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which held that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) use of administrative law judges is unconstitutional under multiple theories. Though all of the theories accepted by the Fifth Circuit would restrain the authority of regulatory agencies, one theory, the nondelegation doctrine, would have significantly wider-ranging effect. Multiple energy and environmental regulations would be threatened by a stronger nondelegation doctrine, including the Federal Trade Commission's (FTC)\u00a0Green Guides, SEC's proposed climate disclosure rule and several U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulations. The U.S. Supreme Court on June 30, 2023, agreed to hear the case of SEC v. Jarkesy.1 The case is an appeal of a U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit decision that held that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) use of administrative law judges (ALJs) is unconstitutional.2 The Fifth Circuit's decision was based on three separate theories: 1) that the use of administrative proceedings to seek civil penalties for common law claims violates the Seventh Amendment of the U.S. Constitution's right to a jury trial; 2) that the SEC's discretion to choose between enforcing securities laws through administrative proceedings or through court actions violates the nondelegation doctrine; and 3) that the multiple levels of for-cause removal protection for SEC ALJs violates the appointments clause of Article II of the Constitution. Though a decision upholding the Fifth Circuit on any of those three theories could be used to constrain the authority of multiple federal agencies, a decision based on the nondelegation doctrine could be the most restrictive on agency authority of any Supreme Court decision to date. Background The nondelegation doctrine is rooted in Article I of the Constitution's grant of legislative authority to Congress. Proponents of the theory believe that this implies Congress is not allowed to delegate discretion to the executive branch that amounts to policymaking authority. The nondelegation doctrine was last used to strike down two laws in 1935.3 Since then, courts have applied the \"intelligible principle\" test to uphold exercises of agency discretion where Congress provided at least some minimal level of guidance as to how that discretion should be exercised. In the past few years, multiple justices of the Court's conservative wing have advocated for a strengthening of the nondelegation doctrine to eliminate any agency discretion with respect to setting policy. Most recently the nondelegation doctrine was raised in a 2019 case, Gundy v. United States.4 All four conservative justices participating in the case signaled support for strengthening the nondelegation doctrine, although the effort did not receive enough votes to succeed at that time. The nondelegation doctrine is related to the major questions doctrine as established in last year's West Virginia v. EPA5 but goes a step further in its implications for agency authority. The major questions doctrine is utilized when an agency has been granted broad discretion and it has exercised that discretion in a manner that has major policy implications and that was not clearly authorized by law. When an agency violates the major questions doctrine, the underlying rule is vacated but the agency can still regulate in the same area with a more narrowly tailored or less impactful rule. A stronger nondelegation doctrine could be used whenever an agency exercises any amount of policy discretion, not just major policy discretion. Additionally, the remedy is not to vacate the agency's rule but to hold that the statute granting that policy discretion is unconstitutional, removing the agency's ability to regulate in that area entirely and potentially affecting more rules than just the challenged rule. A strengthened nondelegation doctrine could have profound implications for climate regulations. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC), for example, has broad statutory authority to prosecute \"unfair methods of competition in or affecting commerce, and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce.\"6 The terms \"unfair methods of competition\" and \"unfair or deceptive acts or practices\" are not defined by law, giving the FTC nearly unfettered discretion to make policy choices about what types of business practices are unfair. The FTC is currently considering updates to its \"Green Guides\" that provide the agency's definitive interpretation of how it will exercise its unfair and deceptive practices authority to target environmental marketing claims such as \"carbon-neutral\" and \"net zero.\" This broad authority, however, may run afoul of a strengthened nondelegation doctrine. Other examples include the SEC's proposed climate disclosure rule, which would require publicly traded companies to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and business risks related to climate change. That proposed rule relies on multiple provisions in the securities laws that give the SEC authority to make rules that it deems \"necessary or appropriate\" for the public interest or protection of investors.7 Such broad authority to define \"necessary or appropriate\" measures that may rest on policy decisions may also be challenged under a nondelegation doctrine theory. Other climate rules administered by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and other agencies rely on similar statutory provisions to consider undefined factors in rulemaking or to consider specific, often competing, policy factors without defining how to weight each factor.8 It is anticipated that SEC v. Jarkesy will be heard in the Court's next term and likely decided by the end of June 2024. Impacts to climate rules would be realized only after those rules are separately challenged, meaning that even if the nondelegation doctrine is strengthened, the impacts to climate rules could be years away. The government has argued that the type of discretion at play in Jarkesy is simple enforcement discretion \u2013 a traditional executive power, not policy discretion. If the Court agrees with that argument, the Court could overturn or uphold the Fifth Circuit on one of the other two theories without strengthening the nondelegation doctrine at this time.

Adler The Delegation Doctrine \u2013 Jonathan H. AdlerBy JLPP / June 20, 2024 Download a PDF THE DELEGATION DOCTRINE Jonathan H. Adler* After Gundy v. United States[1] the Supreme Court seemed poised to revive the nondelegation doctrine.[2] Four justices expressed a willingness to consider nondelegation arguments in a future case, and they were joined by a fifth just a few months later.[3] It was only matter of time before five justices would vote to limit the extent to which Congress could delegate core legislative power to administrative agencies.[4] Reports of the nondelegation doctrine\u2019s resuscitation were greatly exaggerated.[5] Despite all the anticipation and trepidation, the doctrine has yet to be disinterred, and a revival may be as far off as ever. Over the past five years, the Court has taken no meaningful step toward a resuscitation of this moribund constraint on delegation. A majority of the Court has not even been willing to cite nondelegation concerns as sufficient justification for invoking constitutional avoidance to avoid broad constructions of statutory delegations.[6] The nondelegation doctrine may remain moribund, but the outlines of a delegation doctrine may be visible in the Court\u2019s recent jurisprudence. Instead of policing the limits on Congress\u2019s power to delegate authority to administrative agencies, the Court has instead been focusing on whether the power administrative agencies seek to exercise has been properly delegated by Congress in the first place. This is a meaningful check on agency self-aggrandizement. For without such a delegation of power from the legislature, administrative agencies lack the power to issue regulations or otherwise act with the force of law. The most obvious manifestation of this emerging delegation doctrine is the Court\u2019s recent quartet of \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d cases.[7] In these cases, the Court has emphasized that administrative agencies are born without any regulatory authority in the domestic sphere.[8] Federal administrative agencies have no inherent power to adopt regulations or impose constraints on private conduct. Rather, agencies only have that power which Congress has affirmatively bestowed upon them.[9] And because the constitutional baseline is that all legislative power is vested in Congress, the existence of such power in another branch cannot be presumed. It must be shown. Federal agencies must affirmatively demonstrate that the power they seek to exercise was actually delegated to them by Congress.[10] A corollary of this delegation principle is that the more expansive, unusual, or unprecedented the authority the agency seeks to exercise, the greater the necessary showing must be. Thus, in the major questions doctrine cases\u2014both those in the latest quartet and those before\u2014the Court has insisted upon clear evidence, if not an actual clear statement, that Congress delegated broad regulatory authority concerning matters of great economic or political significance.[11] Despite the focus on the Court\u2019s recent major questions cases, signs of an emergent delegation doctrine can also be found elsewhere. Most significantly, seeds of a delegation doctrine have been planted within the Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence. The Court\u2019s increased reluctance to grant Chevron deference to administrative agencies\u2013and its insistence that courts first conclude that interpretive authority has been delegated before deferring to any agency interpretation\u2014rests on the same core premise as the Court\u2019s recent major questions doctrine decisions.[12] It also suggests that the \u201cnew\u201d major questions doctrine is not as new as it might seem, but rather a logical outgrowth of principles the Court has already embraced: Agencies may only exercise power delegated to them by Congress, and the amount of evidence required to demonstrate that authority has been delegated should correlate with the nature and scope of the authority claimed.[13] In making this claim this essay is both descriptive and prescriptive. It is descriptive in that it seeks to identify doctrinal threads that cut across administrative law doctrine. It is prescriptive in that it suggests that fully embracing the delegation doctrine would result in a more coherent jurisprudence and address many contemporary concerns about the administrative state and the proper role of the judiciary in policing the exercise of delegated power. Rationalizing (and perhaps reforming) the Court\u2019s recent major questions holdings in purer delegation terms would insulate them from some of the criticisms levied by scholars and would reduce concerns that they are unprincipled assaults on administrative power. At the same time, focusing on delegation can constrain judicial deference to agency interpretations without requiring a complete abandonment of the Chevron doctrine. Following through on the implications of using delegation as a unifying principle can also help move the Court\u2019s administrative law jurisprudence in a more positive direction, both by placing the major questions doctrine cases on firmer footing, as well as by making sense of what sorts of delegations\u2014and resulting deference to agency authority\u2014should or should not be troubling to those skeptical of administrative power. I.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Delegation Doctrine Article I, Section 1 of the Constitution vests the federal government\u2019s legislative powers in Congress.[14] Since early in the nation\u2019s history, jurists and commentators have maintained that this places some limit on Congress\u2019s ability to delegate (or, as some would say, subdelegate[15]) power to other branches of government.[16] As Chief Justice Marshall wrote in Wayman v. Southard \u201cIt will not be contended that Congress can delegate . . . powers which are strictly and exclusively legislative.\u201d[17] This nondelegation principle has been oft repeated in Supreme Court opinions, but rarely observed.[18] Some have said the nondelegation doctrine has had only one good year.[19] The problem, as even Chief Justice Marshall acknowledged, has been identifying a judicially administrable line between permissible delegations of policy-making authority and purportedly impermissible delegations of \u201cstrictly and exclusively legislative\u201d powers.[20] While some academics have purported to identify sufficiently determinate measures upon which a judicially enforced nondelegation doctrine could be constructed,[21] the Court has yet to settle on a test that meaningfully constrains the delegation of legislative authority. The current requirement of an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d is readily met by all but the most open-ended statutes.[22] Signs of a reinvigorated and more constraining doctrine are sometimes found within the Court\u2019s opinions, but not as part of a definitive holding.[23] Somewhat like the Loch Ness Monster, we think we have glimpsed the doctrine\u2019s outlines, but no one has glimpsed it in the flesh. Whether or not the Article I vesting clause contains a judicially enforceable nondelegation principle, it is unquestionably the source of a delegation principle.[24] Specifically, the vesting of all the federal government\u2019s legislative powers in the Congress creates a baseline allocation of power, departures from which must be enacted by the legislature. Whether or not some amount of legislative (or quasi-legislative) power is exclusive and inalienable, all such power starts in the legislature\u2019s hands and is only ever delegated to administrative agencies because Congress has chosen to do so. Administrative agencies\u2014as a part of the executive branch\u2014execute the laws that Congress enacts.[25] Any power such agencies wish to exercise in the domestic sphere is the result of a legislative delegation. As the Supreme Court has made explicit, \u201can agency literally has no power to act . . . unless and until Congress confers power upon it.\u201d[26] This is particularly true\u2014indeed, \u201caxiomatic\u201d\u2014when it comes to an agency\u2019s authority to promulgate regulations that bind private conduct.[27] The fact that all power administrative agencies exercise must be the result of a delegation from Congress is a foundational principle within administrative law. What the delegation doctrine is, then, is the instantiation of that fact into a broader principle that informs how courts understand, interpret, and enforce those delegations. This central fact about agency power should inform how the Court considers questions about whether agency power exists in any particular circumstance.[28] It further calls upon courts to carefully consider what sorts of power have been delegated, the scope of that power, and what sorts of incidental authority (if any) may be reasonably implied from the affirmative legislative grant. [29] In any given instance in which an agency seeks to assert authority, the reviewing court must conclude both that Congress delegated to the agency the authority to act, but also that the action the agency wishes to take is within the scope of the granted authority.[30] That an agency has authority to act in a related area or parallel fashion is not, in itself, evidence of delegated authority unless there is evidence to think Congress delegated the related authority.[31] II.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Major Questions as Delegation Questions In four decisions over the past three years, the Supreme Court has stressed the importance of identifying the legislative source of agency power when agencies assert broad authority.[32] In each of these cases, a majority of justices found the agency\u2019s assertion of authority lacking, and the evidence of a delegation of authority to be insufficient. These cases, the latter of which expressly embrace the \u201cmajor questions doctrine\u201d by name,[33] have prompted substantial commentary and much criticism.[34] In this essay I am less interested in joining the debate over how and why the Court reached its conclusions in each of these cases, or whether the Court has properly identified what questions count as \u201cmajor,\u201d than in highlighting the importance of delegation in the Court\u2019s reasoning and outcome in each case. While the precise methodology and interpretive approaches deployed arguably varied across these cases, each emphasized the need for federal agencies to affirmatively demonstrate that Congress had delegated to them the power they sought to exercise, and in each case the Court found the agency\u2019s claim wanting. For the first of these cases, Alabama Association of Realtors v. Department of Health and Human Services,[35] the outcome was never in doubt. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention had first imposed a residential eviction moratorium in September 2020, citing its authority under the Public Health Service Act.[36] The only thing that had prevented five justices from holding it unlawful in the summer of 2021 was that the initial challenge to the CDC\u2019s claimed authority reached the Court a month before it was due to expire on its own accord.[37] There was little question Congress had the power to impose an eviction moratorium, or that Congress could expressly authorize the CDC to impose one.[38] Congress had, in fact, done that already.[39] But once Congress refused to extend any such moratorium, the argument that the CDC retained the delegated authority to take that step stood on shaky ground. Despite the clear indication that a renewed moratorium would not withstand judicial review, the CDC reimposed it with only superficial modifications.[40] Unsurprisingly, a majority of the Court refused to accept the CDC\u2019s argument that it was authorized to issue an eviction moratorium pursuant to its authority to \u201cmake and enforce such regulations as in [the Surgeon General\u2019s] judgment are necessary to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases from foreign countries into the States or possessions, or from one State or possession into any other State or possession.\u201d[41] Unlike the sorts of measures identified in the relevant statutory text, an eviction moratorium does not \u201cdirectly relate to the interstate spread of disease by identifying, isolating, and destroying the disease itself.\u201d[42] Reading the CDC\u2019s statutory authority as a whole, and in context, the Court\u2019s majority recognized that it was \u201ca stretch to maintain that \u00a7 361(a) gives the CDC the authority to impose this eviction moratorium.\u201d[43] Further, the Court explained, even if the language in question could be considered ambiguous, \u201cthe sheer scope of the CDC\u2019s claimed authority . . . would counsel against the Government\u2019s interpretation.\u201d[44] As it had noted before, courts \u201cexpect Congress to speak clearly when authorizing an agency to exercise powers of \u201cvast \u2018economic and political significance.\u2019\u201d[45] And Congress had not clearly stated that the CDC could regulate housing markets.[46] Several months later, when the Court was confronted with a challenge to the \u00a0Occupational Safety & Health Administration\u2019s (OSHA) vaccinate-or-test mandate, the story was much the same.[47] As in Alabama Realtors, a federal agency was using a longstanding power in a manner that it had not been used before, and in way that was not directly related to the sort of authority Congress had clearly delegated to it. Congress had delegated to the CDC the authority to control the interstate transmission of disease, and the CDC sought to use that authority to reduce hardship to renters facing eviction. Congress had delegated authority to OSHA to control workplace risks to health and safety, and the Biden Administration sought to use that power to increase COVID-19 vaccination rates.[48] Citing Alabama Realtors, the Court in NFIB again stressed the need for the agency to show that Congress had delegated such broad authority.[49] While there was no question that the OSH Act delegated to OSHA expansive authority to set occupational health and safety standards, it did not confer the sort of authority OSHA asserted here, and prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, OSHA had never claimed otherwise.[50] Indeed, as the Court noted, the vaccinate-or-test mandate was \u201cstrikingly unlike the workplace regulations that OSHA has typically imposed.\u201d[51] Moreover, the authority OSHA sought to invoke\u2014that of authorizing \u201cemergency temporary standards\u201d\u2014was narrower than that authorizing the adoption of permanent workplace safety standards, making it even more difficult for OSHA to demonstrate that it had, in fact, been delegated the authority it sought to exercise.[52] Both the CDC eviction moratorium and OSHA vaccinate-or-test mandate cases were considered and decided on an expedited basis. Accordingly, neither opinion offers a fulsome explanation of the doctrinal rationale for the Court\u2019s conclusions, but both made quite clear that the burden was upon the agency to demonstrate that Congress had, in fact, delegated to it the sort of broad, expansive authority it sought to exercise. The question in each case was not whether Congress could authorize the agencies to adopt expansive disease-control measures, but whether it had actually done so in either of the relevant statutes. Although it has its own unusual procedural history, West Virginia v. EPA was not considered on an expedited basis.[53] With the benefit of a full briefing schedule, the Court had another opportunity to consider an agency\u2019s assertion of broad regulatory authority never before deployed under the relevant statutory provisions. And here, again, a majority of the Court was unconvinced that Congress had in fact delegated such authority to the agency.[54] In West Virginia, however, the Court offered greater explanation for why such a demonstration is necessary: That while the language of Section 111 allowing the EPA to define and impose a \u201cbest system of emission reduction\u201d on fossil-fuel-fired power plants might be plausible \u201cas a matter of \u2018definitional possibilities,\u2019\u201d when the language is \u201cshorn of all context\u201d there was not enough to justify an assertion of authority as broad as the EPA claimed.[55] Rather, as the Court had emphasized in prior cases (including Utility Air Regulatory Group v. EPA, which likewise concerned the regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act), \u00a0\u201ccourts \u2018expect Congress to speak clearly if it wishes to assign to an agency decisions of vast economic and political significance.\u2019\u201d[56] And as the Court had made explicit in UARG, that controlling greenhouse gas emissions presents a different challenge than does controlling traditional air pollutants does not authorize the EPA to take liberties with the Clean Air Act\u2019s text.[57] As in the COVID-19 cases, the Court expected broad assertions of agency authority to be supported by clear evidence that Congress delegated such authority in statutory text. And as explained by Chief Justice Roberts, all three cases relied upon an \u201cidentifiable body of law\u201d addressing the \u201crecurring problem\u201d of \u201cagencies asserting highly consequential power beyond what Congress could reasonably be understood to have granted.\u201d[58] Biden v. Nebraska did not concern an agency assertion of regulatory authority, but it again presented the Court with an agency seeking to pour new wine out of an old bottle.[59] In this case, the Department of Education sought to use authority under the HEROES Act[60] to forgive an estimated $430 billion in student loans, ostensibly for the purpose of ensuring that loan recipients were \u201cnot placed in a worse position financially in relation to\u201d their student loans due to the national emergency triggered by the COVID-19 pandemic.[61] The Secretary of Education claimed that his statutory authority to \u201cwaive or modify any statutory or regulatory provision applicable\u201d to covered student loan assistance programs authorized the erasure of loan principle.[62] Once again, the Supreme Court was not convinced. In Biden v. Nebraska, more so than in West Virginia, Chief Justice Roberts engaged in a thorough analysis of the relevant statutory text. He further stressed that agencies only have that power and authority that Congress has delegated to them, and that any delegation from Congress has limits that can be identified in the statutory text.[63] The greater the exercise of power sought, the more evidence of delegation is required. After surveying the relevant statutory provisions, the Chief Justice stressed that any authority the Education Department sought to exercise must be pursuant to a legislative delegation. Acting without such an authorization would amount to \u201cseizing the power of the Legislature,\u201d thereby allowing it \u201cto enact a program that Congress has chosen not to enact itself.\u201d[64] Where an agency seeks to exercise broad and consequential power, more than \u201ca wafer-thin reed\u201d of statutory text is necessary.[65] These four decisions all apply a variant of the major questions doctrine\u2014the latter two explicitly so.[66] In West Virginia, the Chief Justice suggested whether a case presents a \u201cmajor question\u201d is a threshold inquiry that should color and shape a reviewing court\u2019s assessment of the statutory language at issue.[67] In Nebraska, on the other hand, Chief Justice Roberts deployed the major questions doctrine as a means to confirm his statutory interpretation, and reinforce the conclusion that the delegation of power the agency sought to exercise could not be found within the relevant statute.[68] While both rely expressly on the notion that Congress must authorize agency action, Nebraska stepped back from the notion that the presence of a \u201cmajor question\u201d justifies a departure from traditional approaches to statutory interpretation or judicial review of agency action. Viewed as a progression, Nebraska suggests that the Court may be moving toward a delegation doctrine that can be applied across the board to all cases in which courts are called upon to consider whether an agency is acting beyond the scope of its delegated authority. This would be a welcome development, as it would avoid the inherently arbitrary effort to distinguish \u201cmajor\u201d from ordinary questions, and instead allow reviewing courts to engage in a more traditional judicial inquiry about the scope of delegated authority (an inquiry that is hardly exclusive to the administrative law context). Under such an approach the magnitude or scope of the asserted agency power informs the analysis but is not a separate threshold inquiry, nor would this approach preclude consideration of the extent to which an agency\u2019s assertion of power is unusual, unprecedented, or likely unforeseen by the enacting Congress. To the contrary, this approach would embrace such considerations where they are relevant to interpreting the nature and scope of the power delegated by Congress. III.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chevron Questions as Delegation Questions Well before the Roberts Court\u2019s major questions quartet, seeds of a delegation doctrine could be seen in the Supreme Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence, particularly as it has developed over the past twenty-five years. The role of delegation was not entirely clear in the Chevron decision itself, perhaps because Justice Stevens offered multiple rationales for acceding to the Environmental Protection Agency\u2019s preferred understanding of what would constitute a \u201csource\u201d for given provisions of the Clean Air Act.[69] Subsequent decisions, however, have made express what may only been implicit in Chevron itself: That any authority agencies possess to interpret statutory provisions in line with an administration\u2019s policy preferences derives from a delegation of such authority from the legislative branch. As has been rehearsed many times, the Supreme Court did not understand Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council[70] to depart from preexisting approaches to judicial review of agency action.[71] Its concise formulation of a deceptively easy test took on a life of its own nonetheless.[72] First, a reviewing court must look to the statute itself to see whether Congress spoke directly to the question at issue. If so, the statutory text controls, without regard for the agency\u2019s preferences. If, however, the statute is ambiguous on the precise question at hand, a reviewing court is to defer to the interpretation offered by the implementing agency, provided that interpretation represents a \u201cpermissible\u201d interpretation of the relevant text.[73] As Justice Stevens\u2019s opinion for the Court made clear, the analysis was meant to identify what matters Congress had determined, and what matters Congress had left to resolution by the agency as a policy matter.[74] In practice, it has often meant that agencies have wide latitude to implement complex statutory programs in accord with the executive branch\u2019s policy preferences, even if this means departing from the most plausible understanding of the statute.[75] As the Chevron doctrine became a fixture in administrative law, various justifications were offered for it. Some argued courts should defer to agencies because agencies, unlike courts, are politically accountable.[76] Others stressed the value of agency expertise and familiarity with the subject matter, particularly when compared to that of judges.[77] Others noted that deferring to agency interpretations would produce more uniformity in federal law than relying upon the potentially disparate interpretations offered by judges in various circuits and districts across the country.[78] Still others suggested that Chevron may be a logical outgrowth of constitutional separation of powers principles.[79] The Supreme Court, for its part, recognized the strength of various policy rationales for a Chevron-like deference regime, but ultimately made clear that none of these arguments could explain when or why courts should defer to agency interpretations. After all, agencies have no inherent authority to explain or interpret what the law means for anyone but themselves.[80] Any justification for deferring to an agency\u2019s interpretation or binding policy decision had to rest with Congress and its choice to delegate such authority to an agency.[81] If agencies have the power to resolve ambiguities or fill gaps in complex statutory schemes, it is not because giving agencies such authority is a good idea that courts should respect. It is because Congress has delegated such power to them. One of the first decisions to make this explicit was Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett, in which the Court explained that \u201ca precondition to deference under Chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority.\u201d[82] For there to be deference, it must be the result of legislative intent.[83] And while legislative intent need not always be explicit on the face of the statutory text, it cannot not be presumed without reason. In Christensen v. Harris County, for instance, the Court concluded that a delegation of interpretive authority could not be implied where Congress failed to delegate to an agency the authority to act with the force of law.[84] The Court made explicit that Chevron deference must rest on a delegation rationale in United States v. Mead, in which the Court denied deference to the U.S. Customs Service\u2019s tariff classification rulings because the Court could not find any reason to believe Congress had intended these classifications to carry such weight.[85] Indeed, the structure of the program made any claim that Congress had sought to delegate such authority \u201cself-refuting.\u201d[86] Rather than automatically applying whenever there is a statutory ambiguity, Mead explained that Chevron would only apply \u201cwhen it appears that Congress delegated authority to the agency generally to make rules carrying the force of law, and that the agency interpretation claiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of that authority.\u201d[87] Thus, while a statutory ambiguity may be necessary for Chevron deference, it is not sufficient, for there can be no deference unless the Court can conclude that Congress actually conferred the authority to resolve that ambiguity to the agency. The facts of Chevron serve as a useful illustration. The choice between competing interpretations of the phrase \u201cstationary source\u201d was not a linguistic or interpretive exercise. Rather, it was a policy choice.[88] Congress had instructed the Environmental Protection Agency to implement a permitting regime for such sources and left to the agency the authority to fill in the details about how that program would operate, within the confines of the enacted statutory text.[89] There was nothing in the text of the statute (or, for that matter, in the legislative history[90]) upon which to rest the choice between a definition of \u201csource\u201d that would impose more rigid emission caps and one that would provide firms with more operational flexibility.[91] It was a policy question to be resolved by the administrative agency to which Congress had delegated the authority to issue regulations with the force of law to implement the program. Recognizing that Chevron deference rests on delegation has a range of implications, some of which I have sketched out elsewhere.[92] A few are worth highlighting here. First, as already suggested, it is not ambiguities or statutory gaps or poor legislative drafting that triggers Chevron deference. It is rather the delegation of authority. Just because a statute is difficult to parse or does not make sense is no reason to defer to the agency. After all, unless Congress has delegated such authority to the agency, it has no such authority. Second, and relatedly, it is the job of the reviewing court to interpret the statute in the first instance, and that necessarily includes determining what power has been delegated to the agency. This is a question for the court, and not one that can be resolved by the agency, for if delegation is the basis for deference, a judicial determination that a delegation has taken place must precede any consideration of the agency\u2019s views.[93] To be sure, the Court has not always been steadfast in hewing to this understanding of Chevron. City of Arlington v. FCC, in particular, is a notable departure,[94] but it is not alone.[95] Nonetheless, the weight of the Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence has rested on the delegation rationale, as have many decisions in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit.[96] Just as clarifying that recent \u201cmajor questions\u201d holdings can be understood as operationalizing the principle that all agency power must have been delegated by Congress, ensuring that any deference to agencies is likewise the result of a legislative delegation would clarify and ground existing doctrine. IV.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Chevron Questions and Major Questions as Delegation Questions It has become common to claim that there are \u201ctwo major questions doctrines\u201d and that the Roberts Court\u2019s recent major questions decisions represent a stronger or more aggressive version of the doctrine.[97] Yet as the foregoing discussion should make clear, both the major questions doctrine and the Court\u2019s post-Mead conception of Chevron share a common root: Delegation. In this regard both should be understood as instantiations of the delegation doctrine. Both seek to determine whether Congress delegated power to an agency. In a widely cited 2021 article, Professor Cass Sunstein argued that \u201cthe major questions doctrine has been understood in two radically different ways\u2014weak and strong\u2014and that the two have radically different implications.\u201d[98] The \u201cweak version\u201d entails denying Chevron deference to agencies in cases involving a major question, whereas the \u201cstrong version . . . operates as a clear statement principle\u201d that precludes certain agency interpretations, such as those that expand agency authority.[99] While it is certainly true that some applications of the major questions doctrine arise in a Chevron context and others do not, this account glosses over the unifying principle that can be found across major questions cases and that aligns them with the delegation conception of Chevron that has become dominant in the Court\u2019s jurisprudence. Denying Chevron deference about matters of profound economic and political significance means denying agencies the fundamentally legislative-like authority of deciding whether or not to regulate such matters. As Sunstein notes, granting Chevron deference in such instances \u201cmight seem to create a nondelegation problem,\u201d particularly insofar as it might allow agencies to define the scope of their own jurisdiction.[100] Thus the \u201cweak version\u201d of the major questions doctrine, no less than the \u201cstrong version,\u201d entails greater judicial reluctance to find that Congress has delegated authority to an agency. To illustrate this point consider FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., in which the Court concluded that the Food and Drug Administration lacked the authority to regulate tobacco and cigarettes as drugs and drug-delivery devices.[101] At one level, the Court rejected the claim that the FDA had the power\u2014indeed, the obligation\u2014to subject tobacco products to the broader regulatory regime governing drugs and medical devices because Congress had \u201cclearly precluded\u201d applying the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA) to tobacco products.[102] Yet the Court also explained that, insofar as the text of the FDCA could be considered to be ambiguous, the broader context and the stakes involved undercut the claim that any residual ambiguity in the statute represented \u201can implicit delegation\u201d to the FDA.[103] Brown & Williamson is often cited as an early major questions case, but it also fits comfortably into the Court\u2019s jurisprudence requiring evidence of Congress\u2019s intent to delegate authority before conferring deference to an agency. Note further that had the Court granted Chevron deference to the FDA in Brown & Williamson, it would have done more than allow for the FDA regulation of tobacco products under the FDCA. Granting Chevron deference would have granted the FDA the truly awesome power to decide whether tobacco products should be regulated under the FDCA. Such legislative-like authority is broader and more consequential than a statutory obligation to regulate tobacco products as drugs or medical devices. Thus, the power the FDA would have claimed under Chevron in Brown & Williamson is actually far greater than that which Congress ultimately delegated to the FDA in subsequent tobacco legislation.[104] King v. Burwell further illustrates the point.[105] Despite concluding that the relevant statutory text was ambiguous, the Chief Justice concluded that Chevron deference was inappropriate because there was no indication that Congress had sought to delegate to the Internal Revenue Service the authority to determine whether or not tax credits would be available on exchanges established by the federal government.[106] This was a question of vast economic and political significance but not solely because millions of dollars from the federal treasury were at stake. Had the Court granted Chevron deference to the IRS, it would have been granting more than mere interpretive authority. It would have been giving the IRS the discretionary authority to exercise the momentous policy choice of whether tax credits to support the purchase of individual health insurance policies would be available in the vast majority of states.[107] And while conferring Chevron deference would have produced the same immediate outcome\u2014making such tax credits available\u2014it would also have given the IRS the authority to change its mind in the future in accord with changes in control of the executive branch. So, although the Court ultimately agreed with the agency\u2019s interpretation, it could not conclude that Congress had delegated to the agency authority to make that determination. As cases like Brown & Williamson and King illustrate, decisions to deny Chevron deference to agency interpretations where the scope of the agency\u2019s own authority or other major questions are at stake, are just as much about determining how much power Congress has delegated to an agency as are major questions cases in which the Court directly addresses the substantive scope of agency authority without mention of Chevron at all. It is misleading to suggest that the former cases involve a \u201cweaker\u201d version of the major questions doctrine, as they are just as much about the delegation of power to an administrative agency. If, as the Court has repeatedly held, broad assertions of regulatory authority require greater or more explicit evidence of legislative delegation, there is no reason that the most recent quartet of major questions cases should have come out differently than the Chevron-related major questions cases that preceded them. V.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Finding Answers in Arlington Seeds of a broader delegation doctrine can be seen in both the Court\u2019s recent major questions decisions, as well as in the Court\u2019s Chevron jurisprudence. Indeed, both sets of cases spring from the same roots: A recognition that agencies only have that authority that Congress has delegated to them. Thus, whenever an agency asserts authority to regulate, or even to interpret a law that the agency administers, the agency bears the burden of demonstrating that it has been granted the power it seeks to exercise. As it happens, Chief Justice Roberts outlined the foundation of a unified delegation doctrine in City of Arlington v. FCC, albeit in dissent.[108] As it also happens, Chief Justice Roberts was the author of both West Virginia v. EPA and Biden v. Nebraska. The question presented in City of Arlington was whether courts should apply Chevron deference to statutory ambiguities that implicate the scope or existence of an agency authority.[109] Justice Scalia, writing for the majority, refused to accept that applying Chevron deference to such questions should be treated differently from any other statutory ambiguity.[110] While acknowledging that \u201cChevron is rooted in a background presumption of congressional intent,\u201d he concluded that there was no basis for subjecting agency interpretations to greater scrutiny when the scope of an agency\u2019s authority was arguably at stake.[111] More significantly, he rejected the idea that the burden should be upon the agency to show that the power it would assert has in fact been delegated. Whereas the delegation doctrine would counsel that the question is whether a desired exercise of agency power was delegated, Justice Scalia concluded that \u201cthe question in every case is, simply, whether the statutory text forecloses the agency\u2019s assertion of authority, or not.\u201d[112] Chief Justice Roberts took the opposite view, articulating the foundational premises of a delegation doctrine. Wrote Roberts: A court should not defer to an agency until the court decides, on its own, that the agency is entitled to deference. Courts defer to an agency\u2019s interpretation of law when and because Congress has conferred on the agency interpretive authority over the question at issue. An agency cannot exercise interpretive authority until it has it; the question whether an agency enjoys that authority must be decided by a court, without deference to the agency.[113] Whereas Justice Scalia heralded the use of Chevron to provide \u201ca stable background rule against which Congress can legislate,\u201d[114] Chief Justice Roberts noted that this formulation \u201cbegs the question of what that stable background rule is.\u201d[115] Added Roberts, \u201cif the legitimacy of Chevron deference is based on a congressional delegation of interpretive authority, then the line is one the Court must draw.\u201d[116] The power to offer a binding interpretation of a federal statute, like any other power an administrative agency might seek to exercise, must derive from a grant from Congress. And as when other agency powers are challenged, it is up to the courts, in the first instance, to determine whether the power claimed has been delegated. Conclusion Now that Justice Scalia is no longer on the Court, it appears that Chief Justice Roberts\u2019s vision of Chevron\u2019s applicability may be on the ascendance. If this delegation doctrine is to flower, the Court will need to take a broader and more principled approach to delegation than has been exhibited in the major questions doctrine cases to date. Rather than sorting cases artificially into those that are \u201cmajor\u201d and those that are not, the Court should instead recognize that it is always the agency\u2019s burden to demonstrate that power it seeks to exercise has been delegated, and that evaluating agency claims of authority requires a broad, context-sensitive inquiry into what Congress enacted. Such inquiries must start with the statutory text, to be sure, but they must also be sensitive to the nature of statutory drafting. As then-Judge Breyer noted in a 1985 lecture, \u201cCongress is more likely to have focused upon, and answered, major questions, while leaving interstitial matters to answer themselves in the course of [a] statute\u2019s daily administration.\u201d[117] The question of what power has been delegated to an agency is not meaningfully different from other inquiries courts routinely engage in to determine the scope and extent of power any other principal has delegated to an agent. In all such contexts, the broader, more extensive, more unusual, less precedented, or less expected the power claimed, the more evidence that such power has been delegated one would expect to find. This is not an innovation in statutory interpretation, but a restatement of what Courts have done in many contexts for quite some time.[118] The foundation of the delegation doctrine is that Article I vests legislative power in the hands of the Congress, and only through congressional action\u2014legislation\u2014can power to act with the force of law be given to administrative agencies. In every case, whether and how much power has been given is a matter for courts to decide, and both the magnitude and nature of the power asserted should inform the inquiry into whether such power was delegated. If Congress wishes to depart from the Constitution\u2019s baseline allocation of power, it must affirmatively do so, and courts should not presume such departures without evidence they have been accomplished. * Johan Verheij Memorial Professor of Law and Director of the Coleman P.

[25] For purposes of this discussion, it is not particularly important whether so-called \u201cindependent agencies\u201d are properly conceived as a part of the executive branch, for even if such agencies are viewed as existing somewhere outside the bounds of the Constitution\u2019s formal tripartite structure, there is still no claim that such agencies have any inherent power. Like those agencies that are indisputably a part of the executive branch, independent agencies only have that power which has been delegated to them. [26] La. Pub. Serv. Comm\u2019n v.

Although the Court did not reach the question, there were other problems with the CDC\u2019s actions. Among other things, the eviction moratorium was issued as an order, not as a regulation. Thus, in order to be lawful, the moratorium would have to have been a valid order under the CDC\u2019s applicable regulations which, as written, did not contemplate something like an eviction moratorium any more than the statutory language did.

[48] In announcing the policy, the Biden Administration made explicit that it was part of \u201ca new plan to require more Americans to be vaccinated.\u201d NFIB, 595 U.S. at 114. That broader protection of public health, as opposed to workplace safety, was a driver of the OSHA rule can also be seen in the design of the rule itself. Among other things, the requirement applied to individual firms based upon the number of employees on the firm\u2019s payroll, and not factors one might expect to correlate with the spread of disease, such as the number of workers at a single worksite, the degree of contact among workers, and the like. See COVID-19 Vaccination and Testing; Emergency Temporary Standard, 86 Fed. Reg. 61402, 61460 (Nov. 5, 2021). [49] See NFIB, 595 U.S. at 117. [50] See id. For example, when OSHA had previously sought to control the spread of communicable disease in the workplace, it required employers to make vaccines available, but did not require employees to be vaccinated. See 29 C.F.R. \u00a7 1910.1030 (f)(1)(i). [51] NFIB, 595 U.S. at 118.\u00a0 Just as OSHA\u2019s historical practice implementing the OSH Act cut against its ability to adopt a vaccinate-or-test requirement at larger firms, CMS\u2019s historical practice imposing conditions on Medicaid and Medicare service providers supported its adoption of a more stringent vaccination requirement at covered health care service providers.

Based on the agent's internal reasoning, my understanding has been refined. I now know that the case presents two distinct but related constitutional challenges:\n1.  **Non-Delegation Doctrine:** Whether Congress, in the 1996 Telecommunications Act, unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC by providing an insufficiently \"intelligible principle\" to guide the collection of Universal Service Fund money.\n2.  **Private Non-Delegation:** Whether the FCC, in turn, unconstitutionally delegated its own governmental authority to a private entity, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), to manage the fund's collection.\n\nCrucially, I've learned that the current Supreme Court has a \"renewed interest\" in the non-delegation doctrine. This context suggests that this is not a routine case where existing precedent will be straightforwardly applied. The Eleventh Circuit's decision to uphold the scheme based on established precedent may face significant skepticism. The outcome is therefore highly uncertain, and the petitioners may have a stronger chance of success than is typical for a challenge to a long-standing federal program. My uncertainty about the specific arguments the parties will make remains, but the legal battleground is now clearly defined.",

The agent's reasoning has provided the first, foundational principles for my design-level knowledge. I have learned:\n1.  **A \"Framework-First\" Strategy:** For complex constitutional cases involving evolving doctrines, it is a more effective strategy to first build a meta-level understanding of the doctrine and the Court's current thinking on it (updating D) before analyzing case-specific facts (updating \u03b8). This provides an essential analytical framework.\n2.  **Identification of Key Predictive Factors:** For predicting outcomes in non-delegation cases, the most important factors are not just the statutory text or old precedents. The critical variables are:\n    *   The individual jurisprudence of each justice regarding administrative power and separation of powers.\n    *   The influence of recent, pivotal precedents, specifically *Gundy v. United States*, which likely serves as the primary modern touchstone for this debate.\n    *   The broader academic and judicial conversation surrounding the administrative state, which indicates the ideological direction of the Court.\n3.  **Source Prioritization:** To build this initial framework, scholarly articles and high-level legal analyses are more valuable starting points than primary source documents from the case itself (e.g., party briefs). These meta-documents efficiently synthesize the key players, precedents, and arguments that define the current state of the doctrine."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *FCC v. Consumers' Research* continues to deepen. My initial belief state, which began as complete uncertainty, was refined to understand the case presents two core constitutional challenges: the non-delegation doctrine (Congress to FCC) and the private non-delegation doctrine (FCC to USAC). I had learned that the Supreme Court's \"renewed interest\" in this area, particularly in light of *Gundy v. United States*, made the outcome highly uncertain and suggested the petitioners had a stronger-than-usual chance.\n\nThe latest observation significantly sharpens this understanding and decreases my confidence in the Eleventh Circuit's decision being upheld. I now see several specific and sophisticated lines of argument available to the petitioners, moving beyond a simple reliance on the *Gundy* dissent.\n\n1.  **A Menu of New Legal Tests:** The petitioners are not just arguing that the \"intelligible principle\" test was failed; they can now propose a variety of alternative, stricter tests for the Court to adopt, drawn from current conservative legal scholarship. These include:\n    *   **Two-Tiered Scrutiny (Rappaport):** Arguing that because the Universal Service Fund scheme regulates the private rights of telecommunications carriers, it should be subject to strict scrutiny, which it would likely fail.\n    *   **Non-Delegable Core Powers (Chenoweth & Samp):** Arguing that the power to compel contributions based on revenue is a form of taxation, a \"core legislative function\" that cannot be delegated at all, regardless of the intelligibility of the principle.\n    *   **The \"Step Zero\" Inquiry (Adler):** Arguing that the scheme is an \"external\" regulation of private parties, not an \"internal\" government matter, and thus warrants a much stricter application of the non-delegation doctrine. This directly counters any government argument that USAC is merely managing a fund.\n\n2.  **The \"Delegation Doctrine\" as a Fallback Argument:** I've learned about a crucial alternative framework: the \"delegation doctrine\" articulated by Jonathan Adler. This provides an \"off-ramp\" for the Court. Instead of a broad constitutional ruling, the Court could decide the case on narrower, statutory grounds. The petitioners could argue that even if the delegation is not unconstitutional, Congress did not \"speak clearly\" enough to authorize such a vast and unusual delegation of power to a private entity, applying the logic from recent major questions doctrine cases like *West Virginia v. EPA* and *Biden v. Nebraska*. This is a powerful, less disruptive way for the Court to strike down the scheme.\n\n3.  **The Private Delegation Is a Key Vulnerability:** The fact that the FCC delegated authority to a private entity, USAC, is a more significant vulnerability than I previously understood. The scholarly frameworks I've reviewed consistently distinguish between the government regulating itself and the government regulating private parties. The delegation to USAC to determine and collect contributions from private carriers falls squarely into the category that conservative legal thinkers believe requires the highest scrutiny.\n\n4.  **The Court is Actively Seeking a Vehicle:** The most concrete new fact is that the Supreme Court has already granted certiorari in *SEC v. Jarkesy*, another case that squarely presents a non-delegation challenge. This is a powerful signal that the Court's interest is not theoretical; the conservative justices are actively looking for a case to reshape this area of law. This places the present case within a clear trend, increasing the likelihood that the Court will use it to make a significant statement.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of how to predict Supreme Court outcomes in complex constitutional cases has evolved from a blank slate to a more sophisticated, multi-layered strategy.\n\n1.  **\"Framework-First\" Strategy Confirmed and Enhanced:** My initial learning was that understanding the doctrinal framework and the Court's thinking *before* analyzing case facts is critical. This observation confirms and enhances that principle. The most effective strategy is not just to identify the doctrine in question (non-delegation) but to research the *specific alternative frameworks and new legal tests* being proposed in influential legal circles (e.g., Federalist Society, major law journals). These academic theories often serve as the intellectual blueprint for future judicial opinions.\n\n2.  **The Power of Conceptual Reframing:** A highly effective predictive heuristic is to identify scholarly work that reframes or unifies existing legal doctrines. Jonathan Adler's distinction between the moribund \"non-delegation doctrine\" and the emerging \"delegation doctrine\" is a prime example. This reframing connected the dots between the Court's *Chevron*, major questions, and non-delegation jurisprudence, revealing a single, underlying principle: an agency must always prove that Congress affirmatively and clearly granted it the power it seeks to wield. Identifying these unifying theories provides a more accurate map of the Court's trajectory than analyzing each doctrine in isolation.\n\n3.  **Source Prioritization Refined:** My initial heuristic to prioritize meta-documents (scholarly articles, legal analyses) over primary case documents at the outset has been strongly validated. The observation demonstrates that the highest-value sources are those that:\n    *   Synthesize academic debate on a contested legal issue (e.g., the review of the \"Perspectives on the Nondelegation Doctrine\" book).\n    *   Track the Court's docket and analyze cert grants as signals of the Court's agenda (e.g., the Holland & Knight alert on *Jarkesy*).\n    *   Offer novel conceptual reframings of legal doctrines (e.g., Adler's essay).\n\n4.  **Identify Judicial \"Off-Ramps\":** A new, crucial principle for my design is to actively search for potential \"off-ramps\" or narrower grounds for a decision. In cases where a broad constitutional ruling would be highly disruptive, the Court often prefers a more limited, statutory holding that achieves a similar result. The \"delegation doctrine\" / major questions analysis serves as a perfect off-ramp here, allowing the Court to invalidate the FCC's scheme without formally overturning nearly 90 years of non-delegation precedent. Predicting these less disruptive paths is key to accurately forecasting outcomes."

      "complexity_reasoning": "The task beliefs demonstrate a highly sophisticated and nuanced understanding of complex legal doctrines, multiple interrelated arguments, and judicial trends, culminating in a testable hypothesis rather than mere possibilities, meriting a score near the top of the scale. The design beliefs show advanced meta-cognitive strategic reasoning, including framework-first approaches, conceptual reframing, source prioritization, and explicit articulation of uncertainty, reflecting complex adaptive strategy and meta-heuristics. The beliefs are highly coherent, with seamless integration between task and design beliefs, and internal reasoning that bridges theory and practice. Information density is extremely high, with detailed references to legal doctrines, scholarly work, judicial signals, and methodological principles, providing a comprehensive and richly detailed belief state. The confidence is slightly below perfect to reflect some inherent uncertainty in prediction tasks but remains very high given the depth and integration observed.",

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

This Court \nhas jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1).  \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nArticle I, Section 1 of the U.S. Constitution \nprovides: \u201cAll legislative Powers herein granted shall \nbe vested in a Congress of the United States, which \nshall \nconsist \nof \na \nSenate \nand \nHouse \nof \nRepresentatives.\u201d \nPertinent statutory and regulatory provisions are \nreproduced at App. 1a-127a to this brief. \n \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. The FCC\u2019s History of Promoting Universal \nService  \nThe FCC\u2019s history of promoting universal service \nlong predates the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(\u201c1996 Act\u201d). Congress created the FCC in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Congress defined universal service and \nadopted specific, detailed principles to guide and \ncabin the FCC\u2019s exercise of delegated authority. \nSee 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b), (c), (d), (h).  \nFollowing Congress\u2019s directive in Section 254, the \nFCC has administered the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d or the \u201cFund\u201d) for decades, with ministerial \nsupport from the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany (\u201cUSAC\u201d or the \u201cAdministrator\u201d). The \nFCC\u2019s rules limit USAC\u2019s role to administrative \nmatters, \nprohibit \nUSAC \nfrom \nmaking \npolicy \ndecisions, and provide for de novo FCC review of any \nUSAC decision upon request. \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine \nby \nauthorizing \nthe \nCommission \nto \ndetermine, within the limits set forth in Section 254, \nthe amount that providers must contribute to the \nFund. \n2. \nWhether \nthe \nCommission \nviolated \nthe \nnondelegation doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s \nfinancial projections in computing universal service \ncontribution rates. \n3. \nWhether \nthe \ncombination \nof \nCongress\u2019s \nconferral of authority on the Commission and the \nCommission\u2019s \ndelegation \nof \nadministrative \n\nii \n \nresponsibilities to the Administrator violates the \nnondelegation doctrine. \n4. Whether this case is moot in light of the \nchallengers\u2019 failure to seek preliminary relief before \nthe Fifth Circuit. \n\niii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nAND RULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-354 are the Federal \nCommunications Commission and the United States \nof America. \nPetitioners in Case No. 24-422 are the Schools, \nHealth & Libraries Broadband Coalition (\u201cSHLB \nCoalition\u201d), Benton Institute for Broadband & \nSociety, National Digital Inclusion Alliance, and \nCenter for Media Justice dba MediaJustice, Competi-\ntive \nCarriers \nAssociation, \nNational \nTele-\ncommunications Cooperative Association dba NTCA, \nand USTelecom \u2013 The Broadband Association. \nRespondents in both cases are Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch; Cause Based Commerce, Inc.; Kersten Con-\nway; Suzanne Bettac; Robert Kull; Kwang Ja Kirby; \nTom Kirby; Joseph Bayly; Jeremy Roth; Deanna \nRoth; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; and Rhonda Thomas. \nThe disclosure statement included in the Petition \nfor Writ of Certiorari in Case No. 24-422 remains ac-\ncurate as to SHLB Coalition, Benton Institute for \nBroadband & Society, National Digital Inclusion \nAlliance, and Center for Media Justice dba Media-\nJustice. \n  \n \n\niv \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQUESTIONS PRESENTED ....................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE 29.6 \nSTATEMENT ............................................................ iii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ....................................... vi \nOPINIONS BELOW .................................................... 1 \nJURISDICTIONAL STATEMENT ............................. 1 \nCONSTITUTIONAL, STATUTORY, AND \nREGULATORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED .............. 1 \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE .................................... 2 \nA.

The FCC\u2019s History of Promoting Universal \nService  \nThe FCC\u2019s history of promoting universal service \nlong predates the Telecommunications Act of 1996 \n(\u201c1996 Act\u201d). Congress created the FCC in the \nCommunications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-416, 48 \nStat. 1064 (1934) (\u201cthe Act\u201d or \u201cCommunications \nAct\u201d), with a charge to promote universal service\u2014\ni.e., \u201cto make available \u2026 to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide \n\u2026 \ncommunication \nservice \n\u2026 \nat \nreasonable charges.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \nIn 1934, \u201cAT&T \u2026 held a virtual monopoly over \nthe Nation\u2019s telephone service.\u201d MCI Telecomms. \nCorp. v. Am. Tel. & Tel. Co., 512 U.S. 218, 220 \n(1994). AT&T\u2019s vertical business model enabled it to \nprovide long-distance telephone service at higher \nrates to help subsidize its subsidiaries\u2019 local service.  \nIn the early 1980s, following antitrust litigation \nresulting from the development of competition in the \nlong-distance market, AT&T was forced to divest its \nlocal telephone subsidiaries. Because AT&T could no \nlonger internally subsidize local service, the FCC \nbegan assessing charges on all interstate long-\ndistance carriers to finance a \u201cUniversal Service \nFund\u201d to support high-cost areas.1 That Fund used \nrevenues from \u201ceasy-to-reach customers, such as city \ndwellers, to implicitly subsidize service to those in \n \n1 See Access Charges; MTS and WATS Market Structure, \n48 Fed. Reg. 10319, \u00b6 123 (Mar. 11, 1983) (\u201c1983 Access \nCharge Order\u201d). \n\n3 \n \nareas that were hard to reach.\u201d AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, \n886 F.3d 1236, 1242 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (citation \nomitted). \nAt that time, the FCC derived the authority to \npromote universal service from several general \nprovisions of the Communications Act. See 1983 \nAccess Charge Order \u00b6\u00b6 36-55, 83; infra p.20 & n.27. \nSee generally Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n Regul. Util. Comm\u2019rs v. \nFCC, 737 F.2d 1095, 1108 n.6 (D.C. Cir. 1984) \n(\u201cNARUC\u201d) (affirming the FCC\u2019s implicit universal \nservice goal and related authority).  \nThe FCC also allowed providers to assess end-\nuser charges.2 Out of concern that these new charges \ncould impact telephone subscribership levels, and \nthus \nundermine \nuniversal \nservice, \nthe \nFCC \nimplemented the Lifeline program to waive the end-\nuser charges for qualifying households.3  \nB. Congress\u2019s Direction to the FCC to Promote \nUniversal Service in the 1996 Act \nIn 1996, Congress adopted fundamental changes \nthat moved away from a monopoly-based system for \nlocal telephone service to a competitive market-\ndriven \napproach. \nBecause \ncompetition \nwas \ninconsistent with the use of implicit subsidies, \nCongress required the FCC to replace its implicit \nsubsidy system with explicit universal service \nmechanisms, as codified in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  \n \n2 1983 Access Charge Order \u00b6 3. \n3 See \nMTS \nand \nWATS \nMarket \nStructure; \nand \nEstablishment of a Joint Board; Amendment, 50 Fed. \nReg. 939 (Jan. 8, 1985); MTS and WATS Market \nStructure, 51 Fed. Reg. 1371 (Jan. 13, 1986). \n\n4 \n \nSection 254 directs the FCC\u2019s implementation of \nuniversal service in numerous ways.  \nUniversal Service Definition. Congress defined \nuniversal \nservice \nas \n\u201can \nevolving \nlevel \nof \ntelecommunications services that the Commission \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking \ninto account advances in telecommunications and \ninformation technologies and services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1); see also S. Rep. No. 104-23, at 27 (1995) \n(explaining the intention to \u201censure that the \ndefinition of universal service evolves over time to \nkeep pace with modern life\u201d). Congress authorized \nthe FCC to define the \u201cservices that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms,\u201d \nrequiring that the FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d the extent to \nwhich the services are \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety,\u201d \u201csubscribed to by a \nsubstantial majority of residential customers,\u201d \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks,\u201d \nand \u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D). \nPrinciples. Congress required the FCC to base its \nuniversal service policies on six limiting principles. \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b). The first three principles \nprovided direction for implementation, building on \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nprior \nuniversal \nservice \ntenets \nof \naffordability and nationwide availability: \n(1) QUALITY \nAND RATES. Quality services \nshould be available at just, reasonable, and \naffordable rates. \n(2) ACCESS TO ADVANCED SERVICES. Access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n\n5 \n \n(3) ACCESS IN RURAL AND HIGH COST AREAS. \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, \nincluding low-income consumers and those in \nrural, insular, and high cost areas, should \nhave \naccess \nto \ntelecommunications \nand \ninformation services \u2026 that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in \nurban areas and that are available at rates \nthat are reasonably comparable \u2026 .  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3). \nThe fourth and fifth enumerated principles \nestablished guidelines for a funding mechanism: \n(4) EQUITABLE \nAND \nNONDISCRIMINATORY \nCONTRIBUTIONS. All providers of telecomm-\nunications services should make an equitable \nand nondiscriminatory contribution to the \npreservation and advancement of universal \nservice. \n(5) SPECIFIC \nAND \nPREDICTABLE \nSUPPORT \nMECHANISMS. \nThere \nshould \nbe \nspecific, \npredictable and sufficient Federal and State \nmechanisms \nto \npreserve \nand \nadvance \nuniversal service.  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(4)-(5). \nIn the last enumerated principle, Congress \nestablished schools, libraries, and rural health care \nproviders as explicit beneficiaries: \n(6) ACCESS \nTO \nADVANCED \nTELECOMM-\nUNICATIONS SERVICES FOR SCHOOLS, HEALTH \nCARE, \nAND \nLIBRARIES. \nElementary \nand \nsecondary schools and classrooms, health care \nproviders, and libraries should have access to \n\n6 \n \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \nservices \nas \ndescribed in subsection (h). \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(6). \nCongress also authorized the FCC to adopt \nadditional principles, subject to the requirements \nthat they \u201care necessary and appropriate for the \nprotection of the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity and are consistent with this chapter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7).  \nFunding Mechanism. Congress established the \nframework for contributions to finance universal \nservice. It required every \u201ccarrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications service [to] contribute, \non an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis to the \nspecific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and \nadvance universal service.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(d). Congress \nspecified that the support be \u201cexplicit and sufficient \nto achieve the purposes\u201d of Section 254. Id. \u00a7 254(e). \nSpecific \nPrograms. \nFor \nthe \nnew \nsupport \nmechanisms for rural health care providers and \nschools and libraries, Congress required that \ntelecommunications carriers provide services at \ndiscounted rates. For rural health care facilities, the \nrate must be \u201creasonably comparable to rates \ncharged for similar services in urban areas in that \nState.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A). For \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d Congress directed \nthe Commission to provide a discount compared to \nthe rates for \u201csimilar services to other parties\u201d that \n\u201cthe Commission \u2026 determine[s] is appropriate and \nnecessary to ensure affordable access to and use of \nsuch services by such entities.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  \n\n7 \n \nOversight. \nCongress \nestablished \nperiodic \nreporting requirements in the 1996 Act and \nsubsequent \nlegislation \nto \noversee \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nimplementation of Section 254. For example, the \nFCC must conduct an annual inquiry into \u201cthe \navailability \nof \nadvanced \ntelecommunications \ncapability to all Americans\u201d and, if necessary, \u201ctake \nimmediate action to accelerate deployment of such \ncapability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1302(b). And in 1997, immediately \nafter the FCC issued rules implementing Section \n254, Congress required the FCC to submit a detailed \nreport on who was required to contribute, and who \nwas permitted to receive, universal service funds.4  \nLikewise in 2009, Congress mandated that the \nFCC assess the state of broadband deployment.5 The \nFCC published the National Broadband Plan the \nfollowing year.6 And in 2021, Congress further \nrequired the FCC to provide recommendations for \n\u201cimproving \nits \neffectiveness \nin \nachieving \nthe \nuniversal service goals for broadband,\u201d with a \nlimitation that the recommendations \u201cmay not in any \nway reduce the congressional mandate to achieve the \n \n4 Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, the \nJudiciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n1998, Pub.

To facilitate the FCC\u2019s determination, \nthe Administrator calculates and submits the \nprojected USF support amounts\u2014including \u201cthe \nbasis for those projections\u201d based on the FCC\u2019s \ndetailed rules for the programs\u2014at least sixty \ncalendar days before each quarter as well as its \nprojected administrative expenses. Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3); \nsee also Memorandum of Understanding Between the \nFederal \nCommunications \nCommission \nand \nthe \nUniversal Service Administrative Company \u00b6 13 \n(Oct. 17, 2024), https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/\nusac-mou.pdf (\u201cFCC/USAC MOU\u201d). \nContribution Base. Next, at least 30 days before \nthe start of the quarter, the Administrator submits \nthe total \u201ccontribution base\u201d (i.e., providers\u2019 projected \ninterstate and international revenues) to the FCC. \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nThe \nAdministrator \ndetermines projected revenue based on quarterly \nreports from service providers. Pursuant to the \n\n12 \n \nMemorandum of Understanding between the FCC \nand the Administrator, the FCC\u2019s Office of Managing \nDirector must \u201creview the contribution base and \nprovide any necessary feedback to USAC before \nUSAC publicly files the contribution base with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13.  \nContribution Factor. After reviewing the demand \nand \ncontribution \nbase \nprojections \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator, the FCC\u2014through its Office of \nManaging Director\u2014issues a public notice with a \nproposed contribution factor. \u201cThe Commission \nreserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative expenses at amounts that the \nCommission \ndetermines \nwill \nserve \nthe \npublic \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). If the FCC takes \nno further action within 14 days of the public notice, \nthe contribution factor is \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d Id.  \nWhile the contribution factor percentage has \nincreased over time, this increase is primarily due to \na decline in the contribution base (particularly the \nnumber of landline phones) rather than from \nsignificant growth in the Fund programs. Thus, USF \ndisbursements decreased from $8.71 billion in 2012 \nto $8.27 billion in 2020, while the contribution base \ndecreased from $65.9 billion in 2011 to $41.4 billion \nin 2020.19  \n4. The FCC has adjusted the four USF programs \nover time to reflect evolving technologies. The \ngrowing need for broadband support spurred the \nmost comprehensive reform of the USF programs. \nAfter Congress directed the FCC in 2009 to develop a \n \n19 See 2022 Future of USF Report \u00b6\u00b6 91-92. \n\n13 \n \nNational Broadband Plan to ensure every American \nhas \u201caccess to broadband capability,\u201d20 the FCC \nbegan to refocus Fund support from basic landline \nvoice telephone service to broadband deployment.21  \nToday, the High Cost program funds rural \nservices to consumers and businesses in every state \nand territory. Over 8.5 million households subscribe \nto the Lifeline program, including low-income \nhouseholds, Veterans, and people on tribal lands.22 \nFrom 2022 to 2024, over 106,000 schools and 12,500 \nlibraries received funding from the E-Rate program, \nbenefiting over 54 million students.23 From 2021 to \n2023, over 16,000 health care providers received \nfunding from the Rural Health Care program.24  \nD. This Litigation \nIn 2021, Respondents began challenging each \nsuccessive FCC quarterly contribution factor in the \nfederal courts of appeals. Respondents contended \nthat (1) Congress violated the nondelegation doctrine \nin granting the FCC authority regarding the \ncollection of contributions in support of universal \nservice in Section 254; and (2) the FCC violated the \nprivate nondelegation doctrine by relying on the \n \n20 2009 Recovery Act \u00a7 6001(k)(2). \n21 See, e.g., Connect America Fund, et al., 26 FCC Rcd. \n17663, \u00b6 115 (2011) (\u201c2011 USF Transformation Order\u201d). \n22 Program \nData: \nLifeline \nParticipation, \nUSAC, \nhttps://www.usac.org/lifeline/resources/program-data/ \n(last accessed Jan. 7, 2025) (figures from \u201cLifeline \nParticipation Rate\u201d Excel file). \n23 FCC, The Universal Service Fund: How It Impacts the \nUnited States, at 1 (2024). \n24 Id. \n\n14 \n \nAdministrator to calculate the projected demand and \ncontribution base that inform the FCC\u2019s quarterly \ncontribution factor. The Sixth and Eleventh Circuits \nrejected those challenges. See Pet. App. 14a, 127a; \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 778 (6th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied, 144 S.

The panel \nreasoned that Section 254(b) \u201cexpressly requires\u201d the \nFCC to ensure compliance with the enumerated \nprinciples, and Congress therefore \u201cprovided ample \ndirection.\u201d Pet. App. 133a. The Fifth Circuit panel \nalso \nconcluded \nthat \nthere \nwas \nno \nprivate \nnondelegation violation because the Administrator \ncannot make policy, lacks rulemaking power, and \ncompletes all of its functions subject to FCC \nsupervision and review. See id. at 139a-40a. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit, in a 9-7 vote, granted \nRespondents\u2019 petition for review.

It declined to reach that issue, however, \nconcluding that the challenge was justiciable \n\u201cbecause it is capable of repetition yet evading \nreview.\u201d Id. \nOn the merits, the court held the First Quarter \n2022 contribution factor unconstitutional.25 First, the \n \n25 The Fifth Circuit stayed the issuance of its mandate \npending this Court\u2019s disposition of a petition for a writ of \ncertiorari.

Aug. 26, 2024). \n\n15 \n \ncourt concluded that USF contributions were a tax, \nnot a fee, and that Congress therefore delegated its \npower to tax\u2014a \u201ccore legislative power\u201d\u2014to the FCC. \nPet. App. 23a-24a. The court nevertheless recognized \nthat delegations by Congress to agencies are \npermissible so long as Congress provides an \nintelligible principle to guide the exercise of \ndelegated authority. See id. at 24a-25a. It further \nrecognized that this Court \u201chas not in the past \nseveral decades held that Congress failed to provide \na requisite intelligible principle.\u201d Id. at 25a-26a \n(quoting Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, 462 (5th Cir. \n2022)). The Fifth Circuit did not conclude that \nSection 254 violated the nondelegation doctrine \nunder this Court\u2019s precedents. Instead, it expressed \n\u201cgrave concerns about \u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality.\u201d Id. \nat 42a. \nAs \nto \nRespondents\u2019 \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenge, the Fifth Circuit found that the FCC\u2019s \nreliance on the Administrator was problematic for \ntwo reasons. It first stated that FCC regulations \npermit the Administrator\u2019s projections to take effect \n\u201cwithout formal FCC approval.\u201d Pet. App. 49a. It \nthen stated that the FCC has \u201cde facto abdicat[ed]\u201d \nits duty to supervise the Administrator. Id. at 50a. \nHowever, \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nstopped \nshort \nof \nconcluding \nthat \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nreliance \non \nthe \nAdministrator was itself unconstitutional. See id. at \n55a. \nInstead, the court determined that it \u201cneed not \nresolve either question in this case \u2026 because the \ncombination of Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to \nFCC and FCC\u2019s unauthorized subdelegation to USAC \nviolates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \n\u00a7 1.\u201d Id. at 64a. The Fifth Circuit read this Court\u2019s \n\n16 \n \nopinions in Free Enterprise Fund v. Public Company \nAccounting Oversight Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010), \nand Seila Law LLC v. Consumer Financial Protection \nBureau, 591 U.S. 197 (2020), to stand for \u201ca general \nprinciple that \u2026 two constitutional parts do not \nnecessarily add up to a constitutional whole.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 66a-67a. Reviewing Congress\u2019s delegation to the \nFCC and the Administrator\u2019s role through this lens, \nthe court concluded that the \u201ccombination of \ndelegations, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the \nUSF Tax mechanism offends Article I, \u00a7 1 of the \nConstitution.\u201d Id. at 81a. \nJudge \nStewart, \nwriting \nfor \nseven \njudges, \ndissented and argued that Section 254 provides an \nintelligible principle, imposing on the FCC \u201ca duty to \nweigh the enumerated universal service principles.\u201d \nId. at 92a. The dissent also noted that Sections \n254(c) and (e) limit the FCC\u2019s discretion as to the \neligible recipients and services. See id. at 93a-96a. \nThese factors \u201csatisfie[d] the intelligible principle \ntest as articulated by the Supreme Court.\u201d Id. at 96a. \nAs to the private nondelegation doctrine, the \ndissent explained that the Administrator\u2019s authority \nis limited to billing, collection, and distribution of \ncontributions, as well as collecting information from \ncontributors to calculate inputs for the FCC\u2019s \ncontribution-factor determination, applying formulas \nthat the FCC provides. See id. at 99a. Finally, the \ndissent highlighted that the FCC\u2019s control over the \nAdministrator is evident in regulations barring the \nlatter from making policy, interpreting rules, or \nissuing anything that has the force of law. Id. at \n100a. \nIn a second dissent, Judge Higginson, writing for \nfive judges, disagreed with the majority\u2019s \u201cnovel \n\n17 \n \ntheory\u201d of nondelegation. Id. at 115a. He explained \nthat this Court had previously considered cases that \nraised \nboth \npublic \nand \nprivate \nnondelegation \nchallenges, but \u201cnever instructed \u2026 that a different \nstandard applies\u201d in cases involving both issues. Id. \nat 116a (citing Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. \n238, 311 (1936); Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 \n(1939); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 \nU.S. 381, 399 (1940)). \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n1. This case is not moot because it falls within the \n\u201ccapable of repetition yet evading review\u201d principle. \n2. In Section 254, Congress provided ample \ndirection to the Commission. This Court has never \napplied the nondelegation rule to strike down a \nstatute that provides intelligible principles as clear \nas those Congress provided here. Indeed, it has \napproved delegations that are far less detailed. \nMoreover, because Congress made the key policy \ndecisions, while instructing the FCC to engage in the \nkind of context-specific fact-finding that is not \ncontroversial under the nondelegation doctrine, the \nstatute \nsatisfies \nany \nreasonable \nalternative \nnondelegation test. See Gundy v. United States, 588 \nU.S. 128, 158 (2019) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \n3. The Fifth Circuit significantly exaggerated the \nscope of the Administrator\u2019s responsibilities. In fact, \nthe FCC relies upon the Administrator only for \nministerial duties and retains control over all of the \nAdministrator\u2019s \nactions. \nIn \nparticular, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role in connection with the FCC\u2019s \nadoption of the quarterly contribution factor is to \ncollect data and make projections pursuant to \ndetailed FCC rules. It would be surprising if the \n\n18 \n \nCommission needed to revise the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections frequently. \n4. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d approach fails \nhere, where both Congress\u2019s delegation and the \nFCC\u2019s reliance on the Administrator raise no serious \nconstitutional issue. In addition, no precedent \nsupports the use of a combination approach outside \nthe removal context.  \nMoreover, the reasoning of Free Enterprise Fund \nis inapplicable to nondelegation cases. In that case, \nthe Court identified a structural problem: the \ncombination of tenure protection at two levels meant \nthat \u201c[n]either the President \u2026 nor even an officer \nwhose conduct he may review only for good cause, \nha[d] full control over\u201d the entity at issue in that \ncase. 561 U.S. at 496. In contrast, the FCC has full \nauthority \nto \ncontrol \nthe \nAdministrator, \neven \nassuming (contrary to fact) that it is not adequately \nsupervising that entity under current rules. There is \nthus no structural problem analogous to the problem \nthe Court identified in Free Enterprise Fund.  \nARGUMENT \nI. This Case Is Not Moot. \nThe Fifth Circuit correctly found the injury \nalleged by the petitioners in that court capable of \nrepetition yet evading review. Pet. App. 13a. The \nFCC adopts the contribution factor each quarter, and \nthe three months during which the contribution \nmust be paid is too little time for \u201cconsidered plenary \nreview in this Court.\u201d Neb. Press Ass\u2019n v. Stuart, 427 \nU.S. 539, 547 (1976). \nThis Court has never held that a challenger must \nexhaust every potential avenue for preliminary relief \n\n19 \n \nfor this exception to mootness to apply. And while \nsome courts have denied application of the exception \nwhere a challenger\u2019s \u201cprocedural missteps \u2026 prevent \njudicial review,\u201d Protestant Mem\u2019l Med. Ctr., Inc. v. \nMaram, 471 F.3d 724, 731 (7th Cir. 2006), this is not \nsuch a case. The challengers filed their petition for \nreview promptly after the FCC adopted the First \nQuarter 2022 contribution factor. The FCC collects \ncontributions on a monthly basis,26 and those \ncollections are used for ongoing Fund operations, \nincluding disbursements to recipients of Fund \nsupport. In this context, mandating that a challenger \nseek a stay of the contribution factor to bring any \nchallenge would be extremely disruptive given the \ngrave harm that could ensue for other stakeholders. \nParticularly here, where there is no dispute that the \nobligation to contribute recurs on a clear, periodic \nbasis (as it has for many years), there is no benefit to \ndenying application of this mootness exception.  \nIf the Court does find the case moot, it should \nvacate the judgment below under its \u201cwell settled\u201d \nMunsingwear practice. Acheson Hotels, LLC v. \nLaufer, 601 U.S. 1, 5 (2023); see United States v. \nMunsingwear, Inc., 340 U.S. 36 (1950). If the case is \nmoot, it occurred before the Fifth Circuit decision, \nand that decision should not be binding in that \ncircuit.  \n \n26 See, e.g., How to Pay, USAC, https://www.usac.org/\nservice-providers/making-payments/how-to-pay/ (last upd-\nated Oct. 2024) (\u201cUSF payments are due on the 15th of \neach month.\u201d). \n\n20 \n \nII. Congress Provided Ample Direction to the \nFCC Regarding the Universal Service Fund.  \nSection 254 passes muster under any plausible \nunderstanding of the limits the Constitution places \non delegation to agencies.  \nA. Section 254 Provides Extensive Guidance \nto the FCC. \nWhen Congress adopted Section 254 in 1996, it \nwas well aware that the FCC had previously created \nhigh-cost and lifeline programs, relying in part on \nCongress\u2019s direction that the Commission \u201cmake \navailable, so far as possible, to all the people of the \nUnited States \u2026 a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide wire and radio communications service \nwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges,\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 151.27 Congress also recognized that the \npre-1996 Act universal service regime relied on \nimplicit subsidies under which some customers paid \nhigher fees to keep rates affordable for other, lower-\nincome and higher-cost consumers.  \nBecause implicit subsidies cannot survive in a \ncompetitive environment, Congress in the 1996 Act \ndirected the FCC to move to an explicit subsidy \nregime. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And, to create the \nnecessary parameters for such a new regime, \n \n27 See also 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 329 (citing 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 151, 154(i), 201, and 205 in summarizing pre-\n1996 Act authority); see NARUC, 737 F.2d at 1108 n.6 \n(rejecting argument that FCC had no authority over \nuniversal service because, in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151, \u201cCongress \ndirected that, \u2018so far as possible, ... all people of the \nUnited States\u2019 are to have adequate telephone facilities at \nreasonable prices\u201d). \n\n21 \n \nSection 254 provided significantly more statutory \ndirection as to the key inputs that determine the size \nof the universal service fund and thus the amount of \nthe quarterly contribution factor.  \nCongress specified the entities that must pay into \nthe regime: \u201cEvery telecommunications carrier that \nprovides interstate telecommunications services\u201d \nmust contribute toward the universal service \nmechanisms created under the statute. Id. \u00a7 254(d).28 \nCongress further provided that those payments must \nbe \u201cequitable and nondiscriminatory.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(d).  \nCongress \nlikewise \nconstrained \nthe \nFCC\u2019s \nauthority as to the services that could be part of the \n\u201cuniversal service\u201d program. While giving the FCC \nthe authority to determine the \u201cevolving level\u201d of \nservices that should be covered, Congress generally \nlimited \nthe \nagency \nto \nsupporting \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d\u2014a statutorily defined term that \ninvolves common carriage29\u2014as well as other \n \n28 Congress allowed the FCC to expand this class to \ninclude \u201cproviders of interstate telecommunications\u201d if it \nmade an appropriate public interest finding.

See id. \u00a7 254(c)(3); Tex. Off. of Pub. Util. \nCouns. v.

A number of \nthese principles are especially relevant to limiting \nthe size of the universal service fund, and thus the \namount of the quarterly contribution factor. The \nrequirement in Section 254(b)(1) that quality service \nremain \u201caffordable\u201d32 is significant because, as the \nFCC has explained, \u201cif the universal service burden \nis too high, the affordability of service will be placed \nin jeopardy, undermining the very purpose of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d33  \nLikewise, the principle enunciated in Section \n254(b)(5) (and Section 254(d)) that USF mechanisms \nbe not only \u201cspecific\u201d and \u201cpredictable,\u201d but also \n\u201csufficient\u201d imposes an obligation to ensure that the \nFund is large enough, but not too large, to achieve \nthe statutory goals. Addressing judicial decisions \ndiscussing the text of Section 254, the FCC thus \ndefined the term to mean \u201can affordable and \nsustainable amount of support that is adequate, but \n \n32 See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(i) (\u201cThe Commission \u2026 should \nensure that universal service is available at rates that are \njust, reasonable, and affordable.\u201d). \n33 Lifeline and Link Up Reform and Modernization, et al., \n27 \nFCC \nRcd. \n6656, \n\u00b6 37 \n(2012) \n(\u201c2012 \nLifeline \nModernization Order\u201d).  \n\n24 \n \nno greater than necessary, to achieve the goals of the \nuniversal service program.\u201d34 The Fifth Circuit itself \nhas read this language to confirm that \u201cexcessive \nfunding \nmay \nitself \nviolate \nthe \nsufficiency \nrequirements.\u201d Alenco Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. FCC, 201 \nF.3d 608, 620 (5th Cir. 2000).  \nSection \n254, \nmoreover, \nprovides \nadditional \nspecific guidance as to the amount that universal \nservice subsidies should reduce end-user rates, again \nlimiting the potential size of the universal service \nfund. Supported services for consumers in high-cost \nareas and low-income consumers should be \u201cat rates \nthat are reasonably comparable to rates charged for \nsimilar service in urban areas.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3). \nRural health care providers should be served at rates \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to those for similar services \nin urban areas in the same state.

For instance, the FCC has established \nannual monetary caps for the USF programs to fulfill \nits \u201cstatutory obligation to create a specific, \npredictable, and sufficient universal service support \nmechanism.\u201d37 Likewise, the FCC declined to extend \nsupport to rural home care providers, explaining that \nSection 254(h) limited support to statutorily defined \nhealth care providers.38 Similarly, just last year, the \nFCC rejected calls for it to support certain broadband \nwireless technologies because, as it explained, it \n\u201cremain[s] focused on the statutory obligation to \nestablish rules that enhance access to the extent it is \n\u2018economically reasonable.\u2019\u201d39  \nMoreover, \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nsuggestion that Section 254 is so lacking in guidance \nthat \u201cno reviewing court could ever possibly \ninvalidate any FCC action,\u201d Pet.

See, e.g., \n \n36 IIJA \u00a7 60104(c)(1)-(3). \n37 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 529 (establishing initial \ncap for the E-Rate program); id. \u00b6 705 (establishing initial \ncap for the Rural Health Care program). \n38 Id. \u00b6 656. \n39 Addressing the Homework Gap Through the E-Rate \nProgram, FCC 24-76, WC Docket No. 21-31, \u00b6 25 \n(rel.

That decision reinforces the importance of the \nstatutory guardrails that courts can and do impose \nby enforcing the extensive prescriptive language of \nSection 254.

See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 167 (Gorsuch, J., \ndissenting) (\u201cwe apply the major questions doctrine \nin service of\u201d nondelegation principles).  \n\n27 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Contrary Assessment \nof Section 254 Disregards the Significant \nConstraints on FCC Discretion. \nThe Fifth Circuit majority\u2019s contrary analysis of \nSection 254 is inconsistent with the statute\u2019s text \nand surrounding context.  \nTo begin, the Fifth Circuit suggests that \nSection 254\u2019s definition of \u201cuniversal service\u201d is not \n\u201cmeaningful\u201d because the concept of \u201cuniversal \nservice\u201d \nis \nnot \n\u201csufficiently \nintelligible.\u201d \nPet. \nApp. 26a. But the statutory text belies that \nconclusion. As noted above, Congress defined \nuniversal service to be an evolving level of \n\u201ctelecommunications services,\u201d which is a defined \nterm, see 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 153(53), and the statute \ngenerally authorizes support only for those services \nand other services such as broadband that use the \nsupported \nfacilities. \nSee \nid. \n\u00a7 254(e); \nsupra \npp.21-22.40 \nIn \naddition, \nSection 254(c) \nspecifies \nnearly \nmathematical criteria for FCC use in determining \nwhether a particular service qualifies for universal \nservice support. As noted, those criteria include \nwhether the service is subscribed to \u201cby a substantial \nmajority of residential customers\u201d and is \u201cbeing \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks by \ntelecommunications \ncarriers.\u201d \n47 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C).  \n \n40 As noted above, Section 254(c) authorizes the FCC to \nprovide additional support for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers, but only where that is consistent \nwith the policies in Section 254(h). See supra n.31. \n\n28 \n \nSection 254(c) further mandates that the FCC \nconsider whether a particular service is \u201cessential to \neducation, \npublic \nhealth, \nor \npublic \nsafety.\u201d \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A). \nAlthough \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nsuggested without explanation that \u201cessential\u201d is not \na meaningful direction, Pet. App. 29a, that is a \ncommon word that can be readily understood in \naccordance with its plain meaning. See American \nHeritage Dictionary (5th ed. 2022) (\u201c1. Constituting \nor being part of the nature or essence of something; \ninherent \n\u2026 \n2. Fundamentally \nimportant \nor \nnecessary \u2026 .\u201d). The FCC thus readily applied that \nterm in 1997 in establishing nine core services \nsupported \nby \nthe \nfederal \nuniversal \nservice \nmechanisms.41 For instance, the FCC concluded that \nsingle-party service was \u201cessential to public health \nand safety in that it allows residential consumers \naccess to emergency services without delay.\u201d42  \nBeyond that, as discussed above and as the Fifth \nCircuit previously explained, the fact that support \nshould be \u201csufficient\u201d to preserve and advance \nuniversal service itself limits the Fund to enough \nsupport, but not too much, to achieve Congress\u2019s \nobjectives. See supra pp.23-24. Although, as the Fifth \nCircuit noted, that requirement may not mandate \nsupport that precisely \u201c\u2018equal[s] the actual costs \nincurred\u2019\u201d by each carrier, Pet. App. 27a (quoting \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412), that is far from failing to \nprovide any meaningful limitation on FCC action. \nIndeed, in the portion of TOPUC I the circuit court \nmajority cited, the Fifth Circuit noted that, as used \nin Section 254, \u201csufficiency\u201d was a \u201cdirect statutory \n \n41 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6\u00b6 61-83. \n42 Id. \u00b6 62. \n\n29 \n \ncommand.\u201d Id. at 95a. And in that case, the Fifth \nCircuit approved the FCC\u2019s use of \u201cforward-looking \ncosts\u201d rather than historical costs, which reduces the \namount of support carriers receive and the size of the \nFund. See 183 F.3d at 411; see also Verizon \nCommc\u2019ns v. FCC, 535 U.S. 467, 475 (2002) \n(affirming the FCC\u2019s reliance on forward-looking \ncosts to set just and reasonable rates under 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 252(d)(1), which was also part of the 1996 Act).  \nSimilarly, the specific principles that Congress \nrequired the FCC to \u201cbase\u201d its \u201cpolicies\u201d on in \nSection 254(b) cannot be disregarded on the basis \nthat they are \u201caspirational.\u201d Pet. App. 28a. While it \nis undoubtedly the case that those principles cannot \n\u201coverrid[e] other portions of the Act,\u201d TOPUC I, 183 \nF.3d at 421, the FCC in fact \u201cmust work to achieve \neach one unless there is a direct conflict between it \nand either another listed principle or some other \nobligation or limitation on the FCC\u2019s authority.\u201d \nQwest, 258 F.3d at 1199.  \nTo be sure, as the Fifth Circuit noted (Pet. App. \n28a), the FCC has authority to adopt additional \nprinciples. Those principles themselves, however, \nmust \nbe \n\u201cnecessary \nand appropriate \nfor \nthe \nprotection of the public interest\u201d and \u201cconsistent with \nthis chapter,\u201d which includes all the limitations \ndiscussed above. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(7). Accordingly, \nin nearly three decades, the FCC has adopted only \ntwo \nsuch \nprinciples\u2014advancing \ncompetitive \nneutrality and using universal service funds to \nsupport advanced services\u2014both of which the FCC \nadopted because they are deeply grounded in the text \n\n30 \n \nof the statute.43 No party has challenged the FCC\u2019s \njudgments on those points in this case. \nSection 254 plainly does not permit the FCC to \nuse the Fund \u201cto create an endowment \u2026 to fund \nwhatever projects it might like.\u201d Pet App. 27a. \nCarriers may use universal service funding \u201conly for \nthe provision, maintenance, and upgrading of \nfacilities and services for which the support is \nintended.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e). And as discussed, \nSection 254 limits which services qualify as part of \n\u201cuniversal service.\u201d See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c). \nNor is there significant ambiguity regarding \n\u201cwhich \nschools \nand \nlibraries \nshould \nreceive \nsubsidized services.\u201d Pet. App. 29a. The statute \nmakes clear that all schools and libraries that are \neligible and that meet the statutory definition should \nreceive subsidized service. Section 254(h)(1)(B) states \nthat \u201c[a]ll telecommunications carriers\u201d receiving a \n\u201cbona fide\u201d request from \u201celementary schools, \nsecondary schools, and libraries,\u201d \u201cshall\u201d provide the \nrelevant \nsupported \nservices \nat \nthe \nrelevant \ndiscounted rate. (emphases added). See also 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(4), (h)(7)(A) (defining elementary and \nsecondary school and providing criteria for school \nand library eligibility).  \nNor was the Fifth Circuit correct in suggesting \neither \nthat \n(1) \u201cthe \nonly \nreal \nconstraint\u201d \nis \nSection 254(b)(1)\u2019s reference to rates remaining \n\u201caffordable\u201d or (2) that that term is \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever.\u201d Pet. App. 30a (internal quotation marks \nomitted). As explained, there are multiple additional \n \n43 See 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 43; 2011 USF \nTransformation Order \u00b6\u00b6 10, 44, 64-65. \n\n31 \n \nconstraints on the size of the universal service \ncontribution factor. See supra pp.20-24. Moreover, \nand \ncontrary \nto \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s \nunderstanding, the word \u201caffordable\u201d is not rendered \nmeaningless when a product is so necessary that \ndemand is \u201cuncommonly inelastic.\u201d Pet. App. 30a. \nThe FCC resolved this precise issue nearly 30 years \nago, concluding that it must \u201cconsider both the \nabsolute and relative components when making the \naffordability determinations required under section \n254.\u201d44 In determining affordability, it thus must \nassess not only rates, but also \u201cnon-rate factors, such \nas consumer income levels, that can be used to assess \nthe financial burden\u201d created by subscribing to a \nparticular service.45   \nC. Section 254 Is Consistent with Precedent \nand Constitutional History and Would \nSatisfy Any Reasonable Nondelegation \nTest. \nPrecedent strongly supports the conclusion that \nSection 254 does not improperly delegate legislative \npower in violation of Article I, Section 1\u2019s Vesting \nClause. That is equally true even under the more \nrestrictive delegation standards advocated by some \nJustices. \n1. \nAlthough \nthe \nVesting \nClause \nprohibits \ndelegating Congress\u2019s unique legislative power to an \nagency, it has long been established that Congress \nmay lawfully delegate \u201cthe authority to make policies \nand rules that implement its statutes.\u201d Loving v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 748, 771 (1996). Thus, the \n \n44 1997 Universal Service Order \u00b6 110.  \n45 Id. \n\n32 \n \nCourt has repeatedly held that there is no \nconstitutional issue where Congress identifies an \n\u201c\u2018intelligible principle\u2019 to guide the delegee\u2019s exercise \nof authority.\u201d Gundy, 588 U.S. at 145 (plurality) \n(quoting J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, \n276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928)). And as the Court has \nexplained in language that is particularly apt for the \nfast-changing world of telecommunications, \u201cin our \nincreasingly complex society, replete with ever \nchanging and more technical problems, Congress \nsimply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.\u201d Mistretta v. \nUnited States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 (1989).  \nThe \nCourt\u2019s \napplication \nof \nthat \nprinciple \ndemonstrates that Section 254 is a permissible \ndelegation. The Court, for instance, has upheld the \nFCC\u2019s issuance of regulations governing radio \nlicensing based on the \u201cpublic interest, convenience, \nor necessity.\u201d NBC v. United States, 319 U.S. 190, \n215 (1943) (citing 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 307(a), (d), 309(a), \n310, 312). In so doing, the Court rejected the claim \nthat the \u201cpublic interest\u201d standard is \u201cso vague and \nindefinite\u201d that the \u201cdelegation is unconstitutional,\u201d \nexplaining that \u201c\u2018[t]he purpose of the Act, the \nrequirements it imposes, and the context of the \nprovision\u2019\u201d make the statutory language more than a \n\u201c\u2018mere general reference to public welfare.\u2019\u201d Id. at \n225-26 (quoting Fed. Radio Comm\u2019n v. Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg. Co., 289 U.S. 266, 285 (1933)).  \nAs discussed above, the specific directions \nimposed by the text of Section 254 are far more \nreticulated \nand \nprescriptive \nthan \nthe \n\u201cpublic \ninterest\u201d standard upheld in NBC. See NARUC, 737 \nF.2d at 1129. Indeed, as it codified what services \nshould be supported, Congress mandated that the \n\n33 \n \nFCC consider a number of factual considerations in \naddition to the public interest. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1) (FCC \u201cshall consider\u201d what services are \n\u201cessential\u201d to education, health, or safety; are being \n\u201csubscribed \nto \nby \na \nsubstantial \nmajority \nof \nresidential consumers\u201d; and are being \u201cdeployed in \npublic telecommunications networks\u201d). Beyond that, \nCongress provided guidance as to what kinds of \nservices could be supported; which entities should be \nassessed to support those services; how those entities \nshould be assessed; and how much support could be \nrequired, among many other things. See, e.g., id. \n\u00a7 254(d), (e), (h). Unlike the statutory text at issue in \nNBC, \nSection \n254 \nexplicitly \nenumerates \nsix \nprinciples Congress sought to advance. See id. \n\u00a7 254(b). And, as in NBC, these provisions must be \nunderstood in the context of the goals of the 1996 Act \nand the FCC\u2019s history of universal service regulation.  \nNBC is only one of a number of cases to approve \ndelegations through language that is far more \ngeneral than that at issue here. Many of those cases \ninvolve public utility regulations setting rates.

Co. v. \nFCC, 395 U.S. 367, 375-77 (1969). Perhaps for that \nreason, the Fifth Circuit cites no language from NBC \nor any other case invoking such reasoning.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also erred in suggesting that, \nunlike in the many other cases where this Court has \napproved delegations far less constrained than the \none at issue here, the FCC lacks any \u201cspecial agency \nexpertise\u201d \nrelevant \nto \nuniversal \nservice. \nPet. \nApp. 40a. In fact, this Court has for nearly a century \nacknowledged the FCC\u2019s (and its predecessor\u2019s) \nexpertise \nin \nthe \nfast-changing \nworld \nof \ntelecommunications and technology. See Nelson Bros. \nBond & Mortg.

Mid-\nAm. Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 222-23 (1989). \n2. Section 254 does not raise the same issues \nthat concerned the Justices who dissented in Gundy. \nThe statute in Gundy allowed the Attorney General \nto \n\u201cspecify \nthe \napplicability\u201d \nof \nregistration \nrequirements to sex offenders convicted before the \nstatute\u2019s passage and \u201cprescribe rules.\u201d 588 U.S. at \n151, 177 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting). Justice Gorsuch \nconcluded that the statutory language \u201cgave the \nAttorney General free rein to write the rules for \nvirtually the entire existing sex offender population \nin this country.\u201d Id. at 151. Section 254, as discussed \nabove, bears no resemblance to that kind of \nlanguage.  \nLikewise, \nSection \n254 \nwould \nsatisfy \nthe \nalternative test proposed by Justice Gorsuch in \nGundy. In particular, Congress has \u201cannounced the \ncontrolling general polic[ies]\u201d underlying Section 254. \nId. at 157. Among other things, Congress has: \n\n36 \n \n\u2022 Made the decision to support universal service \nand told the FCC what factors to consider in \ndetermining \nwhich \nparticular \n\u201ctelecomm-\nunications services\u201d and associated facilities to \nsupport. See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1), (e).  \n\u2022 Defined which entities must pay fees to \nsupport universal service. See id. \u00a7 254(d).  \n\u2022 Established which entities are eligible to \nreceive universal service support, criteria \nthose entities must meet, and for what \nservices they can use that funding. See id. \n\u00a7\u00a7 214(e), 254(e).  \n\u2022 Adopted a series of principles that the FCC \nmust follow in making decisions under \nSection 254. See id. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(6). \n\u2022 Created, through those principles and other \nexplicit statutory text, meaningful limits on \nthe extent to which specific services can be \nfunded, thus limiting the size of the fund. \nSee supra pp.21-24.  \nIn all these instances, Congress has \u201cset forth \nstandards \u2018sufficiently definite and precise to enable \nCongress, the courts, and the public to ascertain\u2019 \nwhether Congress\u2019s guidance has been followed.\u201d \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 158 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(quoting Yakus, 321 U.S. at 426). \nThe decisions left to the FCC are thus reasonably \nunderstood to be authorizations to apply the \nstatutory text and policies to evolving factual \ncircumstances\u2014or, in other words, to \u201c\u2018fill up the \ndetails.\u2019\u201d Id. at 157 (quoting Wayman v. Southard, 23 \nU.S. 1, 43 (1825)); see id. at 158 (agencies permitted \nto engage in \u201cfact-finding\u201d). The FCC determines, for \ninstance, what services have \u201cbeen subscribed to by a \n\n37 \n \nsubstantial majority of residential customers\u201d and \nare \u201cbeing deployed in public telecommunications \nnetworks by telecommunications carriers.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(c)(1)(B)-(C); see, e.g., 1997 Universal Service \nOrder \u00b6 63 (concluding voice service should be \ncovered \u201cconsistent with section 254(c)(1)\u201d); 2012 \nLifeline Modernization Order \u00b6\u00b6 397-98 (declining to \nmake payphones eligible for Lifeline support upon \nfinding that they were not used by a substantial \nmajority of residential consumers).  \nThe \nagency \nlikewise \ndetermines \nwhat \nis \nnecessary for health care providers and those living \nin high-cost areas to have access at rates that are \n\u201creasonably comparable\u201d to access in urban areas, 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(3), (h)(1)(A), and for schools and \nlibraries to have access at rates \u201cless than the \namounts charged for similar services to other \nparties,\u201d id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B). For instance, in the Rural \nHealth Care program, the FCC determines what \nconstitutes sufficient funding by subtracting the \nurban rate in the state from the rural rate for similar \n(i.e., \u201creasonably comparable\u201d) services. See 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7\u00a7 54.603-605. \nSimilarly, \nthe \nFCC \nfulfills \nits \nstatutory directive in the E-Rate program through its \n\u201clowest corresponding price\u201d rules. See id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.500, \n54.511(b) (prohibiting providers from submitting bids \nhigher than the price charged to non-residential \ncustomers that are similarly situated to the \nparticular school or library \u201cfor similar services\u201d). \nThe fact that the FCC\u2019s granular implementation of \nthe program flows directly from the statutory \ndirectives cannot be squared with the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nconclusion that Congress left the agency at sea, \nwithout significant guidance. \n\n38 \n \n3. The delegation of authority in Section 254 is \nalso consistent with the practice of the early \nCongresses, \nwhich \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nrepeatedly \nemphasized are a good guide to the original \nunderstanding of the Constitution. See, e.g., Bowsher \nv. Synar, 478 U.S. 714, 723-24 (1986).  \nThe practice of those Congresses demonstrates \nthat the Founders understood that delegations far \nbroader than the one at issue here were consistent \nwith the constitutional structure. For instance, the \nFirst Congress passed a bill to authorize the \nPresident of the Senate, the Chief Justice, the \nSecretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury, \nand the Attorney General (or any three of them), to \npurchase an unspecified amount of certain debt \nwith the approbation of the President of the \nUnited States \u2026 in such manner, and under \nsuch regulations as shall appear to them best \ncalculated to fulfill the intent of this act: \nProvided, That the same be made openly, and \nwith due regard to the equal benefit of the \nseveral states \u2026 .  \nAct of Aug. 12, 1790, ch. 47, \u00a7 2, 1 Stat. 186, 186.  \nSimilarly, in 1798, the Fifth Congress\u2014which \nstill included in its ranks many Framers46\u2014adopted \na direct tax to be apportioned among the states. \n \n46 See Nevada Comm\u2019n on Ethics v. Carrigan, 564 U.S. \n117, 122 (2011) (\u201c[e]arly congressional enactments \nprovide contemporaneous and weighty evidence of the \nConstitution\u2019s meaning,\u201d and finding it \u201cdispositive\u201d that \n\u201c[w]ithin 15 years of the founding, both the House of \nRepresentatives and the Senate adopted \u2026 rules\u201d akin to \nthose at issue in the case) (cleaned up). \n\n39 \n \nSee Act of July 9, 1798, ch. 70, \u00a7 8, 1 Stat. 580, 585. \nCongress levied the tax, but then allowed tax \ncommissioners to \u201crevise, adjust and vary, the \nvaluations of lands and dwelling-houses in any \nassessment district \u2026 [at] such a rate \u2026 as shall \nappear to be just and equitable: Provided, that the \nrelative valuations of the different lots or tracts of \nland, or dwelling-houses, in the same assessment \ndistrict, shall not be changed or affected.\u201d Id. \u00a7 22, \n1 Stat. at 589. In other words, Congress again \nenacted a delegation far broader than the one at \nissue here: \u201c[F]ederal administrators had the power \nto raise or lower the tax assessments of thousands of \nproperty owners all at once, by any percentage \namount, so long as the change \u2018shall appear to be just \nand equitable.\u2019\u201d Nicholas R.

Rev. 367 (2024). \n\n40 \n \nIII. The FCC Exercises Direction and Control \nOver the Administrator. \nThe Administrator\u2019s role providing ministerial \nsupport to the FCC in managing the Fund is likewise \nwell within the bounds of this Court\u2019s private \nnondelegation \nprecedents. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nmajority\u2019s suggestion to the contrary is based on an \n\u201cexaggerated conception\u201d of the Administrator\u2019s \u201crole \nand discretion.\u201d Pet. App. 103a (Stewart, J., \ndissenting).  \nA. In determining whether a delegation to a \nprivate actor is permissible, this Court has focused \non whether \u201claw-making is \u2026 entrusted to\u201d a private \nactor and whether a private actor \u201cfunction[s] \nsubordinately to\u201d a government actor with the ability \nto exercise \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d over it. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. In this case, \nthose factors point decisively toward the lawfulness \nof the Commission\u2019s reliance on the Administrator. \nAdditionally, although the Fifth Circuit analyzed \nfactors that go beyond this Court\u2019s precedents, see \nPet. App. 46a-47a, those factors likewise support the \nlawfulness of the Administrator\u2019s ministerial role.  \nMost significantly, responsibility for carrying out \nCongress\u2019s direction in Section 254 is \u201cnot entrusted \nto\u201d the Administrator; rather, the Administrator \nremains subordinate to the FCC in all respects. \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399; see Pet. \nApp. 46a (agency \u201cmust have final decision-making \nauthority\u201d). The FCC adopts the rules defining the \nscope of the various Fund programs, the eligible \nrecipients consistent with the statute, and the \namounts of the subsidies (including through rules \ngoverning competitive bidding to determine subsidy \namounts for particular recipients). Those rules \n\n41 \n \ninclude \u201celigibility requirements,\u201d \u201ccaps on particular \ntypes of support,\u201d and \u201cprecise formulas for \ncalculating the amount of the subsidy\u201d in particular \nprograms.\u201d FCC Pet. 20 (citing 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.410, \n54.507, 54.604-606).  \nMoreover, FCC rules explicitly prohibit the \nAdministrator from \u201cmak[ing] policy, interpret[ing] \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules or \ninterpret[ing] the intent of Congress.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.702(c). Where the Administrator is in doubt, it \n\u201cshall seek guidance from the Commission.\u201d Id.  \nRegarding the quarterly contribution factor in \nparticular, the factor \u201cshall be determined by the \nCommission,\u201d \nnot \nthe \nAdministrator. \nId. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2) (emphasis added). The FCC rules and \ndecisions regarding the Fund programs provide the \nfoundation each quarter for determining both inputs \ninto the factor: the Fund programs\u2019 needs and the \nassessable contribution base.  \nThe Administrator, by contrast, plays only a \nministerial role. For example, on the demand side, \nthe Administrator prepares the \u201cquarterly projected \ncosts of the universal service support mechanisms\u201d \nand the \u201cprojected expenses for the federal universal \nservice support mechanisms for each quarter.\u201d Id. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2), (3). But those projections are no more \nthan calculations based on decisions already made by \nthe FCC, together with information provided by \nprivate parties under the FCC\u2019s rules. In this case, \nfor example, the Administrator determined the \nsupport amounts for the various Fund programs by \nwalking through the FCC rules and associated \ndecisions for each program. See, e.g., J.A. 21-33, 46-\n49. The FCC\u2019s caps and other funding limits further \nfactor into each program\u2019s demand calculation. See, \n\n42 \n \ne.g., id. at 46 (noting FCC \u201ccap for Funding Year \n2021\u201d in Rural Health Care program). \nOn top of that, the \u201c[t]otal projected expenses \u2026 \nfor \neach \nquarter \nmust \nbe \napproved \nby \nthe \nCommission before they are used to calculate the \nquarterly contribution factor,\u201d and the Commission \n\u201creserves the right to set projections of demand and \nadministrative \nexpenses \nat \namounts \nthat \n[it] \ndetermines will serve the public interest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nLikewise, on the contribution-base side the \nAdministrator \n\u201ccompile[s]\u201d \nthe \n\u201ctotal \nsubject \nrevenues\u201d to which the contribution factor will apply \neach quarter, \u201cbased on information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheets,\u201d the \ncontent of which is in turn mandated by the \nCommission\u2019s own rules. Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2); see id. \n\u00a7 54.711(a) (FCC rule requiring that contributors \n\u201ccalculate[] and file[]\u201d their contributions based on \nthis Worksheet as \u201cpublished in the Federal \nRegister\u201d by the FCC). In this case, again, the \nAdministrator\u2019s filing shows that the contribution \nbase \u201cwas derived\u201d from information on \u201cForm 499-Q \nsubmissions\u201d the FCC requires). Pet. App. 158a. See \ngenerally U.S. Gov\u2019t Accountability Off., GAO-24-\n106967, \nAdministration \nof \nUniversal \nService \nPrograms \nIs \nConsistent \nwith \nSelected \nFCC \nRequirements, app. II at 21-22 (2024). \nAdditionally, \nthe \nFCC \nsupervises \nall \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s functions. Pet. App. 47a. In addition \nto the FCC\u2019s direct role in determining the \ncontribution \nfactor \nand \nreviewing \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections, the FCC regularly \nexercises its authority to review the Administrator\u2019s \nministerial handling of claims for support. See 47 \n\n43 \n \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.719 (parties may seek review), 54.723 \n(review of Administrator decisions is de novo). The \nCommission has not hesitated in exercising that \nauthority and issues a monthly document disposing \nof appeals of the Administrator\u2019s actions. In April \n2024, the FCC granted 27 of 53 E-Rate and Rural \nHealth Care appeals. See Streamlined Resolution of \nRequests Related to Actions by the Universal Service \nAdministrative Company, 39 FCC Rcd. 2989, 2992 \nn.12 (2024) (\u201c[c]onsistent with our obligation to \nconduct a de novo review of appeals of decisions \nmade by USAC, we grant this request for review\u201d \nbased on \u201cdisagree[ment] with USAC\u2019s conclusion\u201d); \nsee also Streamlined Resolution of Requests Related \nto Actions by the Universal Service Administrative \nCompany, 34 FCC Rcd. 9870, 9872 n.9 (2019) \n(\u201cdirect[ing] USAC\u201d to review remanded applications \nwithin 90 days); Request for Review of a Decision of \nthe Universal Service Support Mechanism, 23 FCC \nRcd. \n15413, \n15416 \n\u00b6 7 \n(2008) \n(reviewing \nAdministrator decision and granting waiver in order \nto \u201cpromote[] the statutory requirements of section \n254(h)\u201d).

App. 101a. \nOther forms of FCC supervision and control \nabound. See, e.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.702(g) (annual \nreport from Administrator to FCC and Congress), \n54.702(h) \n(quarterly \nreport \nto \nFCC \n\u201con \nthe \ndisbursement of \u2026 program funds\u201d), 54.702(j) (FCC \nhas \n\u201cfull \naccess \nto \nthe \ndata \ncollected\u201d \nin \nAdministrator\u2019s \nduties), \n54.709(b) \n(FCC \n\u201cmay \ninstruct the Administrator\u201d on how to handle \u201cexcess \ncontributions\u201d beyond steps already provided by \nrule). \n\n44 \n \nB. Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s understanding, \nthe FCC \u201cactually exercise[s]\u201d its authority each \nquarter to adopt the contribution factor. Pet. \nApp. 47a (emphasis omitted). The Fifth Circuit \nstated that \u201cUSAC\u2019s projections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval,\u201d id. at 49a, but that is \ninconsistent with FCC rules and the actual process \nfor adopting the contribution factor. The FCC\u2019s Office \nof Managing Director\u2014not the Administrator\u2014\nissues the Public Notice announcing the proposed \ncontribution factor, and the absence of any further \naction within fourteen days of the release of that \nPublic Notice means the projections and resulting \ncontribution factor are \u201cdeemed approved by the \nCommission.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). It is thus the \nFCC\u2019s rules that govern approval and modifications.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the \u201c\u2018approval\u2019 \nprocess for [the Administrator\u2019s] proposals plays out \njust days before the new quarter begins,\u201d leaving the \nFCC \u201cno real choice but to accept [the] proposed \nfigures.\u201d Pet. App. 50a n.17. That, too, is inaccurate. \nThe Administrator must submit its quarterly \nprojections \nof \ndemand \n(including \nprogram \nadministrative expenses) and the \u201cbasis for those \nprojections\u201d to the FCC and its Office of Managing \nDirector \u201cat least sixty (60) calendar days\u201d before the \nstart of each quarter, and must submit the \u201ctotal \ncontribution base ... at least thirty (30) days before.\u201d \n47 \nC.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nIn \naddition, \nthe \nCommission\u2019s Office of Managing Director \u201cshall \nreview\u201d both submissions and provide \u201cany necessary \nfeedback\u201d before either is \u201cpublicly filed with the \nFCC.\u201d FCC/USAC MOU \u00b6 13. And after the \nCommission\u2019s own Office of Managing Director \nreleases the proposed contribution factor, the \nCommission reserves time within which it can revise \n\n45 \n \nthe projected demand and administrative expenses \namounts where necessary to \u201cserve the public \ninterest.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). That the window \nfor this final step is 14 days does not support a \nconclusion that the Commission cannot or does not \nexercise its authority over the Administrator. \nThe Fifth Circuit also stated that the relative \ninfrequency \nwith \nwhich \nthe \nCommission \n\u201csubstantive[ly] \nchange[s]\u201d \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections means that it is a mere rubber stamp. \nPet. App. 50a (emphasis omitted). The legally \nrelevant question is whether the FCC has such \nauthority, not the frequency with which it exercises \nit. See Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. \nRegardless, as discussed above, the Administrator\u2019s \nprojections are based on extensive FCC rules \ngoverning the various Universal Service Fund \nprograms. See supra pp.11-12. It is unsurprising that \nthe FCC, having established the policies and \ndetermined the amount of necessary revenues and \nthen tasked the Administrator with calculation and \nother \nministerial \ntasks \nto \nimplement \nthose \ndeterminations, does not frequently alter the output \nof that process. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s characterization \nof this system as an unsupervised \u201cblank check\u201d is \nthus incorrect. Pet. App. 53a.  \nIn any event, the government has identified \nmultiple occasions\u2014including before this litigation \nbegan\u2014on \nwhich \nit \nhas \ndeparted \nfrom \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s \nprojections \nfor \nthe \nquarterly \ncontribution factor. See FCC Pet. 23; Proposed \nFourth Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 8362, 8362-63 (2023); Proposed \nThird Quarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 38 FCC Rcd. 5670, 5670-71 (2023); Revised \n\n46 \n \nSecond Quarter 2003 Universal Service Contribution \nFactor, 18 FCC Rcd. 5097, 5097-98 (2003). The FCC \nhas also discussed its own revisions to the \nmethodology for calculating the contribution factor in \npublic notices for the proposed contribution factor. \nSee, e.g., Proposed First Quarter 2002 Universal \nService Contribution Factor, 16 FCC Rcd. 21334, \n21334 (2001) (FCC \u201creduce[d] the interval between \nthe accrual of revenues and the assessment of \nuniversal service contributions based on those \nrevenues\u201d from 12 months to 6 months). And at \nvarious times, the Commission has \u201cadjust[ed] the \ncontribution factor \u2026 if USAC collect[ed] insufficient \nfunds, or if USAC collect[ed] funds in excess of actual \nexpenses in the prior quarter.\u201d Universal Service \nContribution Methodology; A National Broadband \nPlan for Our Future, 27 FCC Rcd. 5357, \u00b6 351 (2012). \nIn \nmultiple \nways, \nthe \nFCC \nrevises \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s projections or the contribution factor \nitself. \nThe Fifth Circuit also suggested that the \npossibility that \u201cdisbursements often do not comply \nwith FCC policy\u201d means that the FCC\u2019s role in \ndefining the rules and scope of Fund programs \u201cdoes \nnothing to limit the revenue FCC allows private \nentities to exact from consumers.\u201d Pet. App. 51a. \nThere is no basis in this Court\u2019s precedent for such a \nstandard\u2014an improper payment does not give rise to \na private nondelegation doctrine issue. See id. \nat 122a (Higginson, J., dissenting) (waste and fraud \nhave \u201cnever been enough to declare a coequal \nbranch\u2019s act unconstitutional\u201d). In any event, as \ndiscussed above, the FCC\u2019s rules for Fund programs \nprovide significant oversight into the relevant \naspects of how recipients spend Fund support. See, \ne.g., 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 (extensive rules regarding the \n\n47 \n \ncompetitive bidding process Rural Health Care \nprogram participants must undertake to request \nservices and select a provider); id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.801-806 \n(rules \nregarding \ncompetitive \nbidding, \ncoverage \nobligations, reporting requirements, and more for \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund in High Cost \nprogram). The Administrator\u2019s work also is subject to \nindependent audit (with the participation of the \nFCC\u2019s Office of Managing Director). See id. \u00a7 54.717. \nC. The Fifth Circuit also stated that Section 254 \n\u201cdoes not authorize\u201d the role the FCC has assigned to \nthe Administrator. Pet. App. 55a. It acknowledged, \nhowever, that the challengers did not bring a \nstatutory claim. Id. at 63a & n.21. It also recognized \nthat its concerns regarding statutory authorization \ndo not apply to delegations of \u201cministerial tasks.\u201d \nId. at 56a-58a. \nAs \ndiscussed \nabove, \nthe \nAdministrator\u2019s role is ministerial\u2014the FCC adopts \nthe contribution factor, and the Administrator\u2019s role \nis \nlimited \nto \nproviding \ninputs \ninto \nthat \ndetermination, \nsubject \nto \nFCC \napproval \nand \nnumerous forms of supervision. Whether Section 254 \nor other provisions of the Communications Act \nauthorize \nthe \nFCC \nto \nassign \ntasks \nto \nthe \nAdministrator is therefore immaterial to deciding the \nprivate nondelegation issue in this case.48 \nIV. The Court Should Reject the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \n\u201cCombination\u201d Approach. \nDespite its concerns regarding the public and \nprivate nondelegation issues, the Fifth Circuit \n \n48 In any event, in responding to such a statutory \nchallenge, the FCC may point to 47 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 154(i), \n201(b), and other provisions. \n\n48 \n \nconcluded that it \u201cneed not resolve either question in \nthis case\u201d because, in its view, \u201cthe combination of \nCongress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the \nLegislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 64a.  \nA. As discussed above, the majority\u2019s reasons for \nbeing \u201chighly skeptical,\u201d Pet. App. 64a, of Congress\u2019s \ndelegation to the FCC are without merit. Rather, as \nthe principal dissent concluded, the text and context \nof Section 254 establish \u201ca clear intelligible principle \ndelimiting agency discretion.\u201d Id. at 97a. Likewise, \nthe court of appeals\u2019 reasons for being \u201cskeptical\u201d of \nthe FCC\u2019s use of the Administrator in a subordinate \ncapacity do not survive scrutiny. Rather, as Judge \nStewart put it in dissent, the majority adopted an \n\u201cexaggerated \nconception \nof \nUSAC\u2019s \nrole \nand \ndiscretion to create a private nondelegation doctrine \nproblem where none exists.\u201d Id. at 103a. The \ncombination of these two non-violations is not \nproblematic.  \nB. In addition, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach is \ninconsistent \nwith \nhow \nthis \nCourt \naddressed \nchallenges in Sunshine Anthracite, Currin, and other \ncases. \nSunshine Anthracite\u2014like this case\u2014involved \nboth public and private nondelegation claims. Yet, \nthis Court addressed those issues individually, \nrather than assessing the \u201ccombination\u201d of the two \nissues as the Fifth Circuit would. The Court first \nconcluded that Congress\u2019s authorization for the \nNational Bituminous Coal Commission to \u201cfix \nminimum prices\u201d and \u201cestablish maximum prices\u201d for \nmembers of the \u201cBituminous Coal Code\u201d was \npermissible, holding that \u201cin the hands of experts the \n\n49 \n \ncriteria which Congress has supplied are wholly \nadequate.\u201d 310 U.S. at 388-89, 397-98. Separately, \nthe Court concluded that \u201claw-making is not \nentrusted to the industry.\u201d Id. at 399. Were the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach correct, the Court would have \ngone \non \nto \nconsider \nwhether, \nwhile \n\u201cnot \nindependently unconstitutional,\u201d the alleged public \nand private nondelegation problems nonetheless \n\u201ccombine[d] to violate the Constitution\u2019s separation \nof powers.\u201d Pet. App. 64a.  \nCurrin likewise considered both public and \nprivate nondelegation issues. Congress authorized \nthe Secretary of Agriculture to designate markets \nwhere standards for tobacco would apply, subject to \nthe condition that growers in that market vote in \nfavor. See 306 U.S. at 6. The Court separately \nconsidered whether that scheme \u201cinvolve[d] any \ndelegation of legislative authority\u201d to the \u201cgrowers of \ntobacco,\u201d and concluded it did not. Id. at 15. The \nCourt \nthen \nconcluded \nthere \nwas \nalso \nno \n\u201cunconstitutional delegation to the Secretary of \nAgriculture.\u201d Id. at 16. The Court did not consider \nwhether the combination of those features separately \nviolated the separation of powers. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \nattempt \nto \ndistinguish \nSunshine Anthracite and Currin because \u201cthe Court \nfound the Government had not delegated any \nlegislative power to any private entity\u201d fails. Pet. \nApp. 78a-79a. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d \napproach was necessary in this case because that \ncourt did not hold that Section 254 or the FCC\u2019s \nadministration of the Fund violates either the public \nor \nprivate \nnondelegation \ndoctrine. \nSunshine \nAnthracite and Currin similarly rejected both public \nand private nondelegation challenges. The Fifth \n\n50 \n \nCircuit\u2019s approach thus would have called for an \nanalysis \nwhether \nthe \n\u201cnot \nindependently \nunconstitutional\u201d \nparts, \nid. \nat \n64a, \nwere \nan \nunconstitutional whole.  \nBeyond the specific context of public and private \nnondelegation challenges, this Court has often \nconsidered multiple separation-of-powers challenges \n(and other constitutional challenges) in the same \ncase. As in Sunshine Anthracite, the Court did not \nanalyze whether a \u201ccombination\u201d of non-violations \ntogether amounted to a constitutional violation. \nIn Mistretta, for example, prisoners challenging \nthe \nconstitutionality \nof \nthe \nU.S. \nSentencing \nCommission raised several \u201cseparation of powers\u201d \nconcerns, in addition to arguing that \u201cCongress [had] \ndelegated excessive authority to the Commission to \nstructure the [Sentencing] Guidelines.\u201d 488 U.S. at \n370. This Court first addressed and rejected the \nnondelegation \ndoctrine \nchallenge, \neven \nwhile \nagreeing that the Sentencing Commission \u201cenjoys \nsignificant discretion in formulating guidelines.\u201d Id. \nat 377. \u201cHaving determined\u201d that the nondelegation \nchallenge failed, the Court \u201cturn[ed] to\u201d the multiple \ndistinct separation-of-powers challenges regarding \nthe \n\u201c[l]ocation\u201d \nand \n\u201c[c]omposition\u201d \nof \nthe \nCommission and the President\u2019s ability to \u201cremove\u201d \nits members. Id. at 380, 384, 397, 409. Contrary to \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach here, the Court \naddressed the nondelegation doctrine issues and \neach of the purported separation-of-powers violations \nseparately, \nwithout \nconsidering \nwhether \nthe \ncombination of these independently constitutional \n\n51 \n \nfacets might together violate the Constitution. See, \ne.g., id. at 381-411.49 \nC. Neither Seila Law nor Free Enterprise Fund \nrequires that courts assess the \u201ccombination\u201d of \nmultiple, individually constitutional, aspects of any \nchallenged statutory or regulatory scheme. Both \ncases addressed a particular separation-of-powers \nquestion not at issue here: what restrictions on the \nPresident\u2019s \nauthority \nto \nremove \nofficers \nare \npermissible, \nconsistent \nwith \nthe \nConstitution\u2019s \nvesting of the \u201cexecutive Power\u201d in the President. See \nSeila Law, 591 U.S. at 227 (quoting Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 483).  \nThe removal question at issue in Seila Law was \nwhether the single head of an \u201cagency that wields \nsignificant executive power\u201d could constitutionally \nenjoy protection from at-will removal by the \nPresident. 591 U.S. at 204. While Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor v. United States, 295 U.S. 602 (1935), had \napproved removal protections for \u201cmultimember \n \n49 See also, e.g., Morrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654, 660 \n(1988) (considering whether provisions governing the \nfunction \nof \nan \nindependent \ncounsel \nviolated \nthe \nAppointments Clause of Article II or the \u201climitations of \nArticle III\u201d or otherwise \u201cimpermissibly interfere[d] with \nthe President\u2019s authority under Article II in violation of \nthe constitutional separation of powers); Yakus, 321 U.S. \nat \n418 \n(considering \nmultiple \nconstitutional \nissues \nalongside \na \npublic \nnondelegation \nchallenge); \nJ.W. \nHampton, Jr., 276 U.S. at 404-07, 411-13  (considering \nchallenges to both (1) Congress\u2019s grant of authority to the \nPresident to impose customs duties on certain goods and \n(2) whether such customs duties could be imposed for a \npurpose other than raising revenue).  \n\n52 \n \nexpert agencies that do not wield substantial \nexecutive power\u201d and Morrison had approved \nremoval protection for \u201cinferior officers with limited \nduties,\u201d the head of the Consumer Financial \nProtection Bureau fit neither description, and the \nCourt was unwilling to \u201cextend those precedents to \nth[is] \u2018new situation.\u2019\u201d 591 U.S. at 216-20. Thus, as \nJudge Higginson explained in dissent, the Court \nsimply \u201capplied precedent\u201d and \u201cdeclined to create a \nnew\u201d \nexception \nto \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \n\u201cotherwise \n\u2018unrestricted removal power.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 117a \n(quoting Seila Law, 591 U.S. at 204).  \nNor did Free Enterprise Fund establish an \napproach \nthat \nsupports \nthe \nFifth \nCircuit\u2019s \ncombination theory. In that removal case, the \nstatutory scheme provided that members of the \nPublic Company Accounting Oversight Board were \n\u201csubstantially insulated from the [Securities and \nExchange] \nCommission\u2019s \ncontrol,\u201d \nand \nSEC \ncommissioners were also understood to be protected \nfrom at-will removal. 561 U.S. at 486-87. For that \nreason, the Court was required to \u201cconsider a new \nsituation not yet encountered\u201d in its line of \nprecedents on removal authority\u2014\u201cwhether these \nseparate layers of protection may be combined.\u201d Id. \nat 483. \nBecause \nthe \n\u201cadded \nlayer \nof \ntenure \nprotection\u201d meant that the \u201cPresident is stripped of \nthe power [the Court\u2019s] precedents have preserved,\u201d \nthe Court struck it down. Id. at 495-96; see also id. at \n514 (\u201cWhile we have sustained in certain cases limits \non the President\u2019s removal power, the Act before us \nimposes a new type of restriction \u2026 .\u201d). \nContrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s reading, however, \nFree Enterprise Fund did not purport to announce a \n\u201cgeneral principle\u201d extending beyond a challenge to \n\n53 \n \nmultiple layers of removal protection. Pet. App. 66a. \nIndeed, Free Enterprise Fund itself also involved \nseveral additional challenges to the Board \u201cunder the \nAppointments Clause,\u201d 561 U.S. at 510, each of \nwhich \nthe \nCourt \nconsidered \nand \nrejected \nindependently, without considering whether their \ncombination \nmight \nnonetheless \nviolate \nthe \nConstitution.  \nMoreover, \nremoval \nissues \nare \nsignificantly \ndifferent from nondelegation issues. As this Court \nexplained, on account of the \u201csecond level of tenure \nprotection\u201d at issue in Free Enterprise Fund, \n\u201c[n]either \nthe \nPresident, \nnor \nanyone \ndirectly \nresponsible to him, nor even an officer whose conduct \nhe may review only for good cause, ha[d] full control \nover the Board.\u201d 561 U.S. at 496. Thus, even if both \nlevels of tenure protection were acceptable by \nthemselves, as was the case in Free Enterprise Fund, \nthey combined to create a structure that necessarily \nlimited the President\u2019s authority beyond permissible \nbounds.  \nIn \ncontrast, \nthere \nis \nnothing \ninherently \nproblematic about Congress delegating to an agency \nand the agency separately relying on another entity \nfor \nsome \nfunctions, \nsubject \nto \nthe \nagency\u2019s \nsupervision. Even assuming arguendo that the FCC \nis not adequately supervising the Administrator, the \nFCC retains full authority to do so.  Accordingly, this \nis not a case where \u201ceven\u201d officials \u201cwhose conduct \n[the President] may review only for good cause\u201d lack \ncontrol over the Administrator. Id. And if a court \nwere to determine that some agency lacked full \ncontrol over the entity to which it delegated \nauthority, the appropriate remedy would be to \ncorrect the impermissible delegation. \n\n54 \n \nFinally, the harm in removal cases is cumulative, \nwhile the harm in public and private nondelegation \ncases is not. That is, each layer of tenure protection \nlimits \nthe \nPresident\u2019s \nability \nto \ncontrol \nhis \nsubordinates\u2014each layer\u2019s harm is the same, with \ncumulative effect. In contrast, the harms in public \nnondelegation cases (Congress\u2019s improper delegation \nof its legislative powers) and the harm in private \nnondelegation \ncases \n(an \nagency\u2019s \nimproper \ndelegation of government power to private actors) \nare distinct and non-cumulative. Therefore, for \nexample, a grant of authority by Congress that \nsatisfies the public nondelegation doctrine is not \naffected by an agency\u2019s impermissible delegation of \nnon-ministerial duties to a private party.  \nD. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach also would create \nserious workability problems, which in turn would \nlead to confusion in the lower courts. Most notably, \nthe Fifth Circuit \u201coffers no test\u201d for adjudicating \nsituations \ninvolving \nauthorization \nfor \nboth \ngovernment agencies and private parties providing \nministerial support, Pet. App. 123a (Higginson, J., \ndissenting), let alone other separation-of-powers \ncontexts. Neither Free Enterprise Fund nor Seila \nLaw offered one, as neither case spoke so broadly as \nthe Fifth Circuit concluded they did.  \nIndeed, \nthis \nCourt \nhas \nraised \nworkability \nconcerns regarding such an interpretation of Seila \nLaw, \nrejecting \nthe \nargument \nthat \n\u201cthe \nconstitutionality of removal restrictions hinges on\u201d \nthe \u201crelative importance of the regulatory and \nenforcement authority of disparate agencies.\u201d Collins \nv. Yellen, 594 U.S. 220, 253 (2021). \u201cCourts are not \nwell-suited to weigh\u201d such matters. Id. Yet, the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s approach would require courts to go far \n\n55 \n \nbeyond \nsuch \nissues, \nweighing \nthe \n\u201crelative \nimportance\u201d of various constitutional aspects of \nvarious \nstatutory \nor \nregulatory \nschemes \nfor \ndetermining whether their combination exceeds a \nthus-far undefined limit.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be \nreversed.  \n \n \nAndrew Jay Schwartzman \n525 9th Street NW, 7th Fl. \nWashington, DC 20004 \n(202) 241-2408 \nAndySchwartzman \n@gmail.com \n \nCounsel for Benton \nInstitute, NDIA, and \nMediaJustice \n \n \n \nJANUARY 9, 2025 \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nChristopher J.

Thereafter, \nthe Commission shall complete any proceeding to \n\n13a \nimplement subsequent recommendations from any \nJoint Board on universal service within one year after \nreceiving such recommendations. \n(b) Universal service principles \nThe Joint Board and the Commission shall base \npolicies for the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service on the following principles: \n(1) Quality and rates \nQuality services should be available at just, rea-\nsonable, and affordable rates. \n(2) Access to advanced services \nAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n(3) Access in rural and high cost areas \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, including \nlow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and \nhigh cost areas, should have access to telecommunica-\ntions and information services, including interex-\nchange services and advanced telecommunications \nand information services, that are reasonably compa-\nrable to those services provided in urban areas and \nthat are available at rates that are reasonably compa-\nrable to rates charged for similar services in urban ar-\neas. \n(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntributions \nAll providers of telecommunications services \nshould make an equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service. \n\n14a \n(5) Specific and predictable support mech-\nanisms \nThere should be specific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. \n(6) Access to advanced telecommunications \nservices for schools, health care, and li-\nbraries \nElementary and secondary schools and class-\nrooms, health care providers, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunications services \nas described in subsection (h). \n(7) Additional principles \nSuch other principles as the Joint Board and the \nCommission determine are necessary and appropriate \nfor the protection of the public interest, convenience, \nand necessity and are consistent with this chapter. \n(c) Definition \n(1) In general \nUniversal service is an evolving level of telecom-\nmunications services that the Commission shall es-\ntablish periodically under this section, taking into ac-\ncount advances in telecommunications and infor-\nmation technologies and services. The Joint Board in \nrecommending, and the Commission in establishing, \nthe definition of the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms shall \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunications \nservices\u2014 \n(A) are essential to education, public health, \nor public safety; \n(B) have, through the operation of market \n\n15a \nchoices by customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecommuni-\ncations networks by telecommunications carriers; \nand \n(D) are consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. \n(2) Alterations and modifications \nThe Joint Board may, from time to time, recom-\nmend to the Commission modifications in the defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal uni-\nversal service support mechanisms. \n(3) Special services \nIn addition to the services included in the defini-\ntion of universal service under paragraph (1), the \nCommission may designate additional services for \nsuch support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers for the purposes of subsection \n(h). \n(d) Telecommunications carrier contribution \nEvery telecommunications carrier that provides \ninterstate telecommunications services shall contrib-\nute, on an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to \nthe specific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms \nestablished by the Commission to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service. The Commission may exempt \na carrier or class of carriers from this requirement if \nthe carrier\u2019s telecommunications activities are limited \nto such an extent that the level of such carrier\u2019s con-\ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service would be de minimis. Any other pro-\nvider of interstate telecommunications may be re-\nquired to contribute to the preservation and \n\n16a \nadvancement of universal service if the public interest \nso requires. \n(e) Universal service support \nAfter the date on which Commission regulations \nimplementing this section take effect, only an eligible \ntelecommunications carrier designated under section \n214(e) of this title shall be eligible to receive specific \nFederal universal service support. A carrier that re-\nceives such support shall use that support only for the \nprovision, maintenance, and upgrading of facilities \nand services for which the support is intended. Any \nsuch support should be explicit and sufficient to \nachieve the purposes of this section. \n(f) \nState authority \nA State may adopt regulations not inconsistent \nwith the Commission\u2019s rules to preserve and advance \nuniversal service. Every telecommunications carrier \nthat provides intrastate telecommunications services \nshall contribute, on an equitable and nondiscrimina-\ntory basis, in a manner determined by the State to the \npreservation and advancement of universal service in \nthat State. A State may adopt regulations to provide \nfor additional definitions and standards to preserve \nand advance universal service within that State only \nto the extent that such regulations adopt additional \nspecific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms to \nsupport such definitions or standards that do not rely \non or burden Federal universal service support mech-\nanisms. \n(g) Interexchange and interstate services \nWithin 6 months after February 8, 1996, the Com-\nmission shall adopt rules to require that the rates \ncharged by providers of interexchange telecommuni-\ncations services to subscribers in rural and high cost \n\n17a \nareas shall be no higher than the rates charged by \neach such provider to its subscribers in urban areas. \nSuch rules shall also require that a provider of inter-\nstate interexchange telecommunications services \nshall provide such services to its subscribers in each \nState at rates no higher than the rates charged to its \nsubscribers in any other State. \n(h) Telecommunications services for certain \nproviders \n(1) In general \n(A) Health care providers for rural areas \nA telecommunications carrier shall, upon receiv-\ning a bona fide request, provide telecommunications \nservices which are necessary for the provision of \nhealth care services in a State, including instruction \nrelating to such services, to any public or nonprofit \nhealth care provider that serves persons who reside in \nrural areas in that State at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in ur-\nban areas in that State. A telecommunications carrier \nproviding service under this paragraph shall be enti-\ntled to have an amount equal to the difference, if any, \nbetween the rates for services provided to health care \nproviders for rural areas in a State and the rates for \nsimilar services provided to other customers in com-\nparable rural areas in that State treated as a service \nobligation as a part of its obligation to participate in \nthe mechanisms to preserve and advance universal \nservice. \n(B) Educational providers and libraries \nAll telecommunications carriers serving a geo-\ngraphic area shall, upon a bona fide request for any of \nits services that are within the definition of universal \nservice under subsection (c)(3), provide such services \n\n18a \nto elementary schools, secondary schools, and librar-\nies for educational purposes at rates less than the \namounts charged for similar services to other parties. \nThe discount shall be an amount that the Commis-\nsion, with respect to interstate services, and the \nStates, with respect to intrastate services, determine \nis appropriate and necessary to ensure affordable ac-\ncess to and use of such services by such entities. A tel-\necommunications carrier providing service under this \nparagraph shall\u2014 \n(i) have an amount equal to the amount \nof the discount treated as an offset to its ob-\nligation to contribute to the mechanisms to \npreserve and advance universal service, or \n(ii) notwithstanding the provisions of \nsubsection (e) of this section, receive reim-\nbursement utilizing the support mecha-\nnisms to preserve and advance universal \nservice. \n(2) Advanced services \nThe Commission shall establish competitively neu-\ntral rules\u2014 \n(A) to enhance, to the extent technically \nfeasible and economically reasonable, access to \nadvanced telecommunications and information \nservices for all public and nonprofit elementary \nand secondary school classrooms, health care \nproviders, and libraries; and \n(B) to define the circumstances under \nwhich a telecommunications carrier may be re-\nquired to connect its network to such public in-\nstitutional telecommunications users. \n \n\n19a \n(3) Terms and conditions \nTelecommunications services and network capac-\nity provided to a public institutional telecommunica-\ntions user under this subsection may not be sold, re-\nsold, or otherwise transferred by such user in consid-\neration for money or any other thing of value. \n(4) Eligibility of users \nNo entity listed in this subsection shall be entitled \nto preferential rates or treatment as required by this \nsubsection, if such entity operates as a for-profit busi-\nness, is a school described in paragraph (7)(A) with an \nendowment of more than $50,000,000, or is a library \nor library consortium not eligible for assistance from \na State library administrative agency under the Li-\nbrary Services and Technology Act [20 U.S.C. 9121 et \nseq.]. \n(5) Requirements for certain schools with \ncomputers having Internet access \n(A) Internet safety \n(i) \nIn general \nExcept as provided in clause (ii), an elementary or \nsecondary school having computers with Internet ac-\ncess may not receive services at discount rates under \nparagraph (1)(B) unless the school, school board, local \neducational agency, or other authority with responsi-\nbility for administration of the school\u2014 \n \n(I) \nsubmits to the Commission the \ncertifications \ndescribed \nin \nsubpara-\ngraphs (B) and (C); \n \n(II) submits to the Commission a \ncertification that an Internet safety pol-\nicy has been adopted and implemented \n\n20a \nfor the school under subsection (l); and \n \n(III) ensures the use of such comput-\ners in accordance with the certifications. \n(ii) Applicability \nThe prohibition in clause (i) shall not apply with \nrespect to a school that receives services at discount \nrates under paragraph (1)(B) only for purposes other \nthan the provision of Internet access, Internet service, \nor internal connections. \n(iii) Public notice; hearing \nAn elementary or secondary school described in \nclause (i), or the school board, local educational \nagency, or other authority with responsibility for ad-\nministration of the school, shall provide reasonable \npublic notice and hold at least one public hearing or \nmeeting to address the proposed Internet safety pol-\nicy.

and \n(viii) If the subscriber is seeking to qualify for \nLifeline under the income-based criterion, as set \nforth in \u00a7 54.409, the number of individuals in his \nor her household. \n \n(3) The form provided by the entity enrolling sub-\nscribers shall require each prospective subscriber to \n\n54a \ninitial his or her acknowledgement of each of the cer-\ntifications in paragraphs (d)(3)(i) through (viii) of this \nsection individually and under penalty of perjury: \n(i) The subscriber meets the income-based or \nprogram-based eligibility criteria for receiving \nLifeline, provided in \u00a7 54.409; \n(ii) The subscriber will notify the carrier within \n30 days if for any reason he or she no longer satis-\nfies the criteria for receiving Lifeline including, as \nrelevant, if the subscriber no longer meets the in-\ncome-based or program-based criteria for receiving \nLifeline support, the subscriber is receiving more \nthan one Lifeline benefit, or another member of the \nsubscriber\u2019s household is receiving a Lifeline ben-\nefit. \n(iii) If the subscriber is seeking to qualify for \nLifeline as an eligible resident of Tribal lands, he \nor she lives on Tribal lands, as defined in 54.400(e); \n(iv) If the subscriber moves to a new address, \nhe or she will provide that new address to the eli-\ngible telecommunications carrier within 30 days; \n(v) The subscriber\u2019s household will receive only \none Lifeline service and, to the best of his or her \nknowledge, the subscriber\u2019s household is not al-\nready receiving a Lifeline service;

or \n \n(ii) Querying the appropriate income data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber continues to \nmeet the income-based eligibility requirements for \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview. \n \n(iii) If the subscriber\u2019s program-based or \n\n56a \nincome-based eligibility for Lifeline cannot be de-\ntermined by accessing one or more eligibility data-\nbases, then the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust obtain a signed certification from the sub-\nscriber confirming the subscriber\u2019s continued eligi-\nbility. If the subscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously \nconfirmed through an eligibility database during \nenrollment or a prior recertification and the sub-\nscriber is no longer included in any eligibility da-\ntabase, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust obtain both an Annual Recertification Form \nand documentation meeting the requirements of \nparagraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or (c)(1)(i)(B) from that sub-\nscriber to complete the process. Eligible telecom-\nmunications carriers must use the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau-approved universal Annual Recer-\ntification Form, except where state law, state reg-\nulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or a state \nagency requires eligible telecommunications carri-\ners to use state-specific Lifeline recertification \nforms. \n \n(iv) In states in which the National Verifier has \nbeen implemented, the eligible telecommunica-\ntions carrier cannot re-certify subscribers not \nfound in the National Verifier by obtaining a certi-\nfication form from the subscriber. \n \n(3) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of a subscriber\u2019s Lifeline eligibility, the \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must confirm a subscriber\u2019s current eli-\ngibility to receive a Lifeline service by: \n \n(i) Querying the appropriate eligibility data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber still meets \nthe program-based eligibility requirements for \n\n57a \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview; or \n \n(ii) Querying the appropriate income data-\nbases, confirming that the subscriber continues to \nmeet the income-based eligibility requirements for \nLifeline, and documenting the results of that re-\nview. \n \n(iii) If the subscriber\u2019s program-based or in-\ncome-based eligibility for Lifeline cannot be deter-\nmined by accessing one or more eligibility data-\nbases, then the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or state agency must obtain a signed \ncertification from the subscriber confirming the \nsubscriber\u2019s continued eligibility. If the sub-\nscriber\u2019s eligibility was previously confirmed \nthrough an eligibility database during enrollment \nor a prior recertification and the subscriber is no \nlonger included in any eligibility database, the Na-\ntional Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nstate agency must obtain both an approved Annual \nRecertification Form and documentation meeting \nthe requirements of paragraph (b)(1)(i)(B) or \n(c)(1)(i)(B) from that subscriber to complete the \ncertification process. Entities responsible for re-\ncertification under this section must use the Wire-\nline Competition Bureau-approved universal An-\nnual Recertification Form, except where state law, \nstate regulation, a state Lifeline administrator, or \na state agency requires eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers to use state-specific Lifeline recerti-\nfication forms, or where the National Verifier \nRecertification Form is required. \n \n(4) Where the National Verifier, state Lifeline ad-\nministrator, or other state agency is responsible for re-\ncertification of subscribers\u2019 Lifeline eligibility, the \n\n58a \nNational Verifier, state Lifeline administrator, or \nother state agency must provide to each eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier the results of its annual re-\ncertification efforts with respect to that eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier\u2019s subscribers. \n \n(5) If an eligible telecommunications carrier is un-\nable to re-certify a subscriber or has been notified by \nthe National Verifier, a state Lifeline administrator, \nor other state agency that it is unable to re-certify a \nsubscriber, the eligible telecommunications carrier \nmust comply with the de-enrollment requirements \nprovided for in \u00a7 54.405(e)(4). \n(g) One-Per-Household Worksheet. If the prospec-\ntive subscriber shares an address with one or more ex-\nisting Lifeline subscribers according to the National \nLifeline Accountability Database or National Verifier, \nthe prospective subscriber must complete a form cer-\ntifying compliance with the one-per-household rule \nupon initial enrollment. Eligible telecommunications \ncarriers must fulfill the requirement in this para-\ngraph (g) by using the Household Worksheet, as pro-\nvided by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Where \nstate law, state regulation, a state Lifeline adminis-\ntrator, or a state agency requires eligible telecommu-\nnications carriers to use state-specific Lifeline enroll-\nment forms, eligible telecommunications carriers may \nuse those forms in place of the Commission\u2019s House-\nhold Worksheet. At re-certification, if there are \nchanges to the subscriber\u2019s household that would pre-\nvent the subscriber from accurately certifying to par-\nagraph (d)(3)(vi) of this section, then the subscriber \nmust complete a new Household Worksheet. Eligible \ntelecommunications carriers must mark subscribers \nas having completed a Household Worksheet in the \nNational Lifeline Accountability Database if and only \n\n59a \nif the subscriber shares an address with an existing \nLifeline subscriber, as reported by the National Life-\nline Accountability Database. \n(h) National Verifier transition. As the National \nVerifier is implemented in a state, the obligations in \nparagraphs (b) through (g) of this section with respect \nto the National Verifier and eligible telecommunica-\ntions carriers will also take effect. \n(i) Survivors of domestic violence. All survivors \nseeking to receive emergency communications sup-\nport from the Lifeline program must have their eligi-\nbility to participate in the program confirmed through \nthe National Verifier. The National Verifier will also \ntransition survivors approaching the end of their six-\nmonth emergency support period in a manner con-\nsistent with the requirements applied to eligible tele-\ncommunications carriers at paragraph (f) of this sec-\ntion, and the National Verifier will de-enroll survivors \nwhose continued eligibility to participate in the Life-\nline program cannot be confirmed, consistent with \n\u00a7 54.405(e)(6). \n \n\n60a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.500 provides, in relevant part: \nTerms and definitions. \n[\u2026] \nLowest corresponding price. \u201cLowest corresponding \nprice\u201d is the lowest price that a service provider \ncharges to non-residential customers who are simi-\nlarly situated to a particular school, library, or library \nconsortium for similar services. \n \n \n\n61a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.507 provides: \nCap. \n(a) Amount of the annual cap. The aggregate an-\nnual cap on federal universal service support for \nschools and libraries shall be $3.9 billion per funding \nyear, of which $1 billion per funding year will be avail-\nable for category two services, as described in \n\u00a7 54.502(a)(2), unless demand for category one ser-\nvices is higher than available funding. \n \n(1) Inflation increase. In funding year 2016 and \nsubsequent funding years, the $3.9 billion funding cap \non federal universal service support for schools and li-\nbraries shall be automatically increased annually to \ntake into account increases in the rate of inflation as \ncalculated in paragraph (a)(2) of this section. \n \n(2) Increase calculation. To measure increases \nin the rate of inflation for the purposes of this para-\ngraph (a), the Commission shall use the Gross Domes-\ntic Product Chain-type Price Index (GDP-CPI). To \ncompute the annual increase as required by this par-\nagraph (a), the percentage increase in the GDP-CPI \nfrom the previous year will be used. For instance, the \nannual increase in the GDP-CPI from 2008 to 2009 \nwould be used for the 2010 funding year. The increase \nshall be rounded to the nearest 0.1 percent by round-\ning 0.05 percent and above to the next higher 0.1 per-\ncent and otherwise rounding to the next lower 0.1 per-\ncent. This percentage increase shall be added to the \namount of the annual funding cap from the previous \nfunding year. If the yearly average GDP-CPI de-\ncreases or stays the same, the annual funding cap \nshall remain the same as the previous year. \n\n62a \n \n(3) Public notice. When the calculation of the \nyearly average GDP-CPI is determined, the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau shall publish a public notice in \nthe FEDERAL REGISTER within 60 days announcing \nany increase of the annual funding cap including any \nincrease to the $1 billion funding level available for \ncategory two services based on the rate of inflation. \n \n(4) Filing window requests. At the close of the \nfiling window, if requests for category one services are \ngreater than the available funding, the Administrator \nshall shift category two funds to provide support for \ncategory one services. If available funds are sufficient \nto meet demand for category one services, the Admin-\nistrator, at the direction of the Wireline Competition \nBureau, shall direct the remaining additional funds to \nprovide support for category two requests. \n \n(5) Amount of unused funds. All funds collected \nthat are unused shall be carried forward into subse-\nquent funding years for use in the schools and librar-\nies support mechanism in accordance with the public \ninterest and notwithstanding the annual cap. The \nChief, Wireline Competition Bureau, is delegated au-\nthority to determine the proportion of unused funds, \nif any, needed to meet category one demand, and to \ndirect the Administrator to use any remaining funds \nto provide support for category two requests. The Ad-\nministrator shall report to the Commission, on a quar-\nterly basis, funding that is unused from prior years of \nthe schools and libraries support mechanism. \n \n(6) Application of unused funds. On an annual \nbasis, in the second quarter of each calendar year, all \nfunds that are collected and that are unused from \nprior years shall be available for use in the next full \nfunding year of the schools and libraries mechanism \nin \naccordance \nwith \nthe \npublic \ninterest \nand \n\n63a \nnotwithstanding the annual cap as described in this \nparagraph (a). \n(b) Funding year. A funding year for purposes of the \nschools and libraries cap shall be the period July 1 \nthrough June 30. \n(c) Requests. The Administrator shall implement an \ninitial filing period that treats all schools and libraries \nfiling an application within that period as if their ap-\nplications were simultaneously received. The initial \nfiling period shall begin and conclude on dates to be \ndetermined by the Administrator with the approval of \nthe Chief of the Wireline Competition Bureau. The \nAdministrator shall maintain on the Administrator\u2019s \nWeb site a running tally of the funds already commit-\nted for the existing funding year. The Administrator \nmay implement such additional filing periods as it \ndeems necessary. \n(d) Annual filing requirement. \n \n(1) Schools and libraries, and consortia of such eli-\ngible entities shall file new funding requests for each \nfunding year no sooner than the July 1 prior to the \nstart of that funding year. Schools, libraries, and eli-\ngible consortia must use recurring services for which \ndiscounts have been committed by the Administrator \nwithin the funding year for which the discounts were \nsought. \n \n(2) Installation of category one non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on January 1 prior to the July 1 start \nof the funding year, provided the following conditions \nare met: \n \n(i) Construction begins after selection of the \nservice provider pursuant to a posted FCC Form \n470, \n\n64a \n \n(ii) A category one recurring service must de-\npend on the installation of the infrastructure, and \n \n(iii) The actual service start date for that recur-\nring service is on or after the start of the funding \nyear (July 1). \n(3) Installation of category two non-recurring ser-\nvices may begin on April 1 prior to the July 1 start of \nthe funding year. \n(4) The deadline for implementation of all non-re-\ncurring services will be September 30 following the \nclose of the funding year. An applicant may request \nand receive from the Administrator an extension of \nthe implementation deadline for non-recurring ser-\nvices if it satisfies one of the following criteria: \n(i) The applicant\u2019s funding commitment deci-\nsion letter is issued by the Administrator on or af-\nter March 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(ii) The applicant receives a service provider \nchange authorization or service substitution au-\nthorization from the Administrator on or after \nMarch 1 of the funding year for which discounts \nare authorized; \n(iii) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unable \nto complete implementation for reasons beyond the \nservice provider\u2019s control; or \n(iv) The applicant\u2019s service provider is unwill-\ning to complete installation because funding dis-\nbursements are delayed while the Administrator \ninvestigates the application for program compli-\nance. \n(e) Long term contracts. If schools and libraries en-\nter into long term contracts for eligible services, the \n\n65a \nAdministrator shall only commit funds to cover the \npro rata portion of such a long term contract sched-\nuled to be delivered during the funding year for which \nuniversal service support is sought. \n(f) Rules of distribution. When the filing period de-\nscribed in paragraph (c) of this section closes, the Ad-\nministrator shall calculate the total demand for both \ncategory one and category two support submitted by \napplicants during the filing period. If total demand for \nthe funding year exceeds the total support available \nfor category one or both categories, the Administrator \nshall take the following steps: \n \n(1) Category one. The Administrator shall first \ncalculate the demand for category one services for all \ndiscount levels. The Administrator shall allocate the \ncategory one funds to these requests for support, be-\nginning with the most economically disadvantaged \nschools and libraries, as determined by the schools \nand libraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). Schools \nand libraries eligible for a 90 percent discount shall \nreceive first priority for the category one funds. The \nAdministrator shall next allocate funds toward the re-\nquests submitted by schools and libraries eligible for \nan 80 percent discount, then for a 70 percent discount, \nand shall continue committing funds for category one \nservices in the same manner to the applicants at each \ndescending discount level until there are no funds re-\nmaining. \n \n(2) Category two. The Administrator shall next \ncalculate the demand for category two services for all \ndiscount categories as determined by the schools and \nlibraries discount matrix in \u00a7 54.505(c). If that de-\nmand exceeds the category two budget for that fund-\ning year, the Administrator shall allocate the category \ntwo funds beginning with the most economically \n\n66a \ndisadvantaged schools and libraries, as determined by \nthe schools and libraries discount matrix in \n\u00a7 54.505(c). The Administrator shall allocate funds to-\nward the category two requests submitted by schools \nand libraries eligible for an 85 percent discount first, \nthen for a 80 percent discount, and shall continue \ncommitting funds in the same manner to the appli-\ncants at each descending discount level until there are \nno category two funds remaining. \n \n(3) To the extent that there are single discount per-\ncentage levels associated with \u201cshared services\u201d under \n\u00a7 54.505(b)(4), the Administrator shall allocate funds \nto the applicants at each descending discount level \n(e.g., 90 percent, 89 percent, then 88 percent) until \nthere are no funds remaining. \n \n(4) In the event that demand exceeds available \nfunding, requests for category one services used off-\npremises shall be funded after on-premises category \none and category two services. \n \n(5) For paragraphs (f)(1) through (4) of this section, \nif the remaining funds are not sufficient to support all \nof the funding requests within a particular discount \nlevel, the Administrator shall allocate funds at that \ndiscount level using the percentage of students eligi-\nble for the National School Lunch Program. Thus, if \nthere is not enough support to fund all requests at the \n40 percent discount level, the Administrator shall al-\nlocate funds beginning with those applicants with the \nhighest percentage of NSLP eligibility for that dis-\ncount level by funding those applicants with 19 per-\ncent NSLP eligibility, then 18 percent NSLP eligibil-\nity, and shall continue committing funds in the same \nmanner to applicants at each descending percentage \nof NSLP until there are no funds remaining. \n \n\n67a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.511 provides: \nOrdering services. \n(a) Selecting a provider of eligible services. Ex-\ncept as exempted in \u00a7 54.503(e), in selecting a provider \nof eligible services, schools, libraries, library consor-\ntia, and consortia including any of those entities shall \ncarefully consider all bids submitted and must select \nthe most cost-effective service offering. In determin-\ning which service offering is the most cost-effective, \nentities may consider relevant factors other than the \npre-discount prices submitted by providers, but price \nshould be the primary factor considered. \n(b) Lowest corresponding price. Providers of eligi-\nble services shall not submit bids for or charge schools, \nschool districts, libraries, library consortia, or consor-\ntia including any of these entities a price above the \nlowest corresponding price for supported services, un-\nless the Commission, with respect to interstate ser-\nvices or the state commission with respect to intra-\nstate services, finds that the lowest corresponding \nprice is not compensatory. Promotional rates offered \nby a service provider for a period of more than 90 days \nmust be included among the comparable rates upon \nwhich the lowest corresponding price is determined. \n \n \n\n68a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.603 provides: \nConsortia, telecommunications services, and \nexisting contracts. \n(a) Consortia. \n \n(1) Under the Telecommunications Program, an el-\nigible health care provider may join a consortium with \nother eligible health care providers; with schools, li-\nbraries, and library consortia eligible under subpart F \nof this part; and with public sector (governmental) en-\ntities to order telecommunications services. With one \nexception, eligible health care providers participating \nin consortia with ineligible private sector members \nshall not be eligible for supported services under this \nsubpart. A consortium may include ineligible private \nsector entities if such consortium is only receiving ser-\nvices at tariffed rates or at market rates from those \nproviders who do not file tariffs. \n \n(2) For consortia, universal service support under \nthe Telecommunications Program shall apply only to \nthe portion of eligible services used by an eligible \nhealth care provider. \n(b) Telecommunications services. Any telecommu-\nnications service that is the subject of a properly com-\npleted bona fide request by a rural health care pro-\nvider shall be eligible for universal service support. \nUpon submitting a bona fide request to a telecommu-\nnications carrier, each eligible rural health care pro-\nvider is entitled to receive the most cost-effective, com-\nmercially-available telecommunications service, and a \ntelecommunications service carrier that is eligible for \nsupport under the Telecommunications Program shall \nprovide such service at the urban rate, as defined in \n\u00a7 54.604. \n\n69a \n(c) Existing contracts. A signed contract for services \neligible for Telecommunications Program support \npursuant to this subpart between an eligible health \ncare provider, as defined under \u00a7 54.600, and a service \nprovider shall be exempt from the competitive bid re-\nquirements as set forth in \u00a7 54.622(i). \n \n \n\n70a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.604 provides: \nDetermining the urban rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024: \n \n(1) If a rural health care provider requests support \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications Program that is to be provided over a dis-\ntance that is less than or equal to the \u201cstandard urban \ndistance,\u201d as defined in paragraph (a)(3) of this sec-\ntion, for the state in which it is located, the \u201curban \nrate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher than the \nhighest tariffed or publicly-available rate charged to a \ncommercial customer for a functionally similar service \nin any city with a population of 50,000 or more in that \nstate, calculated as if it were provided between two \npoints within the city. \n \n(2) If a rural health care provider requests an eli-\ngible service to be provided over a distance that is \ngreater than the \u201cstandard urban distance,\u201d as de-\nfined in paragraph (a)(3) of this section, for the state \nin which it is located, the urban rate for that service \nshall be a rate no higher than the highest tariffed or \npublicly-available rate charged to a commercial cus-\ntomer for a functionally similar service provided over \nthe standard urban distance in any city with a popu-\nlation of 50,000 or more in that state, calculated as if \nthe service were provided between two points within \nthe city. \n \n(3) The \u201cstandard urban distance\u201d for a state is the \naverage of the longest diameters of all cities with a \npopulation of 50,000 or more within the state. \n \n(4) The Administrator shall calculate the \u201cstand-\nard urban distance\u201d and shall post the \u201cstandard ur-\nban distance\u201d and the maximum supported distance \n\n71a \nfor each state on its website. \n(b) As of funding year 2025, if a rural health care pro-\nvider requests support for an eligible service to be \nfunded from the Telecommunications Program the \n\u201curban rate\u201d for that service shall be a rate no higher \nthan the highest tariffed or publicly-available rate \ncharged to a commercial customer for a functionally \nsimilar service in any city with a population of 50,000 \nor more in that state, calculated as if it were provided \nbetween two points within the city. \n \n \n\n72a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.605 provides: \nDetermining the rural rate. \n(a) Effective funding year 2024, the rural rate shall be \nthe average of the rates actually being charged to com-\nmercial customers, other than health care providers, \nfor identical or similar services provided by the tele-\ncommunications carrier providing the service in the \nrural area in which the health care provider is located. \nThe rates included in this average shall be for services \nprovided over the same distance as the eligible ser-\nvice. The rates averaged to calculate the rural rate \nmust not include any rates reduced by universal ser-\nvice support mechanisms. The \u201crural rate\u201d shall be \nused as described in this subpart to determine the \ncredit or reimbursement due to a telecommunications \ncarrier that provides eligible telecommunications ser-\nvices to eligible health care providers. \n(b) If the telecommunications carrier serving the \nhealth care provider is not providing any identical or \nsimilar services in the rural area, then the rural rate \nshall be the average of the tariffed and other publicly \navailable rates, not including any rates reduced by \nuniversal service programs, charged for the same or \nsimilar services in that rural area over the same dis-\ntance as the eligible service by other carriers. If there \nare no tariffed or publicly available rates for such ser-\nvices in that rural area, or if the carrier reasonably \ndetermines that this method for calculating the rural \nrate is unfair, then the carrier shall submit for the \nstate commission\u2019s approval, for intrastate rates, or \nfor the Commission\u2019s approval, for interstate rates, a \ncost-based rate for the provision of the service in the \nmost economically efficient, reasonably available \nmanner. \n\n73a \n \n(1) The carrier must provide, to the state commis-\nsion, for intrastate rates, or to the Commission, for in-\nterstate rates, a justification of the proposed rural \nrate, including an itemization of the costs of providing \nthe requested service. \n \n(2) The carrier must provide such information pe-\nriodically thereafter as required, by the state commis-\nsion for intrastate rates or the Commission for inter-\nstate rates. In doing so, the carrier much take into ac-\ncount anticipated and actual demand for telecommu-\nnications services by all customers who will use the \nfacilities over which services are being provided to el-\nigible health care providers. \n \n \n\n74a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.606 provides: \nCalculating support. \n(a) The amount of universal service support provided \nfor an eligible service to be funded from the Telecom-\nmunications program shall be the difference, if any, \nbetween the urban rate and the rural rate charged for \nthe services, as defined in this section. In addition, all \nreasonable charges that are incurred by taking such \nservices, such as state and federal taxes, shall be eli-\ngible for universal service support. Charges for termi-\nnation liability, penalty surcharges, and other charges \nnot included in the cost of taking such service shall \nnot be covered by the universal service support mech-\nanisms. \n(b) The universal service support mechanisms shall \nprovide support for intrastate telecommunications \nservices, as set forth in \u00a7 54.101(a), provided to rural \nhealth care providers as well as interstate telecommu-\nnications services. \n(c) Mobile rural health care providers \u2014 \n \n(1) Calculation of support. The support amount \nallowed under the Telecommunications Program for \nsatellite services provided to mobile rural health care \nproviders is calculated by comparing the rate for the \nsatellite service to the rate for an urban wireline ser-\nvice with a similar bandwidth. Support for satellite \nservices shall not be capped at an amount of a func-\ntionally similar wireline alternative. Where the mo-\nbile rural health care provider provides service in \nmore than one state, the calculation shall be based on \nthe urban areas in each state, proportional to the \nnumber of locations served in each state. \n\n75a \n \n(2) Documentation of support. \n \n(i) Mobile rural health care providers shall pro-\nvide to the Administrator documentation of the \nprice of bandwidth equivalent wireline services in \nthe urban area in the state or states where the ser-\nvice is provided. Mobile rural health care providers \nshall provide to the Administrator the number of \nsites the mobile health care provider will serve \nduring the funding year. \n \n(ii) Where a mobile rural health care provider \nserves less than eight different sites per year, the \nmobile rural health care provider shall provide to \nthe Administrator documentation of the price of \nbandwidth equivalent wireline services. In such \ncase, the Administrator shall determine on a case-\nby-case basis whether the telecommunications ser-\nvice selected by the mobile rural health care pro-\nvider is the most cost-effective option. Where a mo-\nbile rural health care provider seeks a more expen-\nsive satellite-based service when a less expensive \nwireline alternative is most cost-effective, the mo-\nbile rural health care provider shall be responsible \nfor the additional cost. \n \n \n\n76a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.622 provides: \nCompetitive bidding requirements and exemp-\ntions. \n(a) Competitive bidding requirement. All appli-\ncants are required to engage in a competitive bidding \nprocess for supported services, facilities, or equip-\nment, as applicable, consistent with the requirements \nset forth in this section and any additional applicable \nstate, Tribal, local, or other procurement require-\nments, unless they qualify for an exemption listed in \nparagraph (i) in this section. In addition, applicants \nmay engage in competitive bidding even if they qual-\nify for an exemption. Applicants who utilize a compet-\nitive bidding exemption may proceed directly to filing \na funding request as described in \u00a7 54.623. \n(b) Fair and open process. \n \n(1) Applicants participating in the Telecommuni-\ncations Program or Healthcare Connect Fund Pro-\ngram must conduct a fair and open competitive bid-\nding process. The following actions are necessary to \nsatisfy the \u201cfair and open\u201d competitive standard in the \nTelecommunications Program and the Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program: \n \n(i) All potential bidders and service providers \nmust have access to the same information and \nmust be treated in the same manner throughout \nthe procurement process. \n \n(ii) Service providers who intend to bid on sup-\nported services many not simultaneously help the \napplicant complete its request for proposal (RFP) \nor Request for Services form. \n \n(iii) Service providers who have submitted a bid \nto provide supported services, equipment, or \n\n77a \nfacilities to a health care provider may not simul-\ntaneously help the health care provider evaluate \nsubmitted bids or choose a winning bid. \n \n(iv) Applicants must respond to all service pro-\nviders that have submitted questions or proposals \nduring the competitive bidding process. \n \n(v) All applicants and service providers must \ncomply with any applicable state, Tribal, or local \nprocurement laws, in addition to the Commission\u2019s \ncompetitive bidding requirements. The competi-\ntive bidding requirements in this section are not \nintended to preempt such state, Tribal, or local re-\nquirements. \n(c) Selecting a cost-effective service. In selecting a \nprovider of eligible services, the applicant shall care-\nfully consider all bids submitted and must select the \nmost cost-effective means of meeting its specific \nhealth care needs. \u201cCost-effective\u201d is defined as the \nmethod that costs the least after consideration of the \nfeatures, quality of transmission, reliability, and \nother factors that the health care provider deems rel-\nevant to choosing a method of providing the required \nhealth care services. In the Healthcare Connect Fund \nProgram, when choosing the most \u201ccost-effective\u201d bid, \nprice must be a primary factor, but need not be the \nonly primary factor. A non-price factor may receive an \nequal weight to price, but may not receive a greater \nweight than price. \n(d) Bid evaluation criteria. Applicants must de-\nvelop weighted evaluation criteria (e.g., a scoring ma-\ntrix) that demonstrates how the applicant will choose \nthe most cost-effective bid before submitting its re-\nquest for services. The applicant must specify on its \nbid evaluation worksheet and/or scoring matrix the \n\n78a \nrequested services for which it seeks bids, the infor-\nmation provided to bidders to allow bidders to reason-\nably determine the needs of the applicant, its mini-\nmum requirements for the developed weighted evalu-\nation criteria, and each service provider\u2019s proposed \nservice levels for the criteria. The applicant must also \nspecify the disqualification factors, if any, that it will \nuse to remove bids or bidders from further considera-\ntion. After reviewing the bid submissions and identi-\nfying the bids that satisfy the applicant\u2019s specific \nneeds, the applicant must then select the service pro-\nvider that offers the most cost-effective service. \n(e) Request for Services. Applicants must submit the \nfollowing documents to the Administrator in order to \ninitiate competitive bidding: \n \n(1) Request for Services, including certifica-\ntions. The applicant must submit a Request for Ser-\nvices and make the following certifications as part of \nits Request for Services: \n \n(i) The entity seeking supported services is a \npublic or nonprofit health care provider that falls \nwithin one of the categories set forth in the defini-\ntion of health care provider listed in \u00a7 54.600, or \nexpects to be such a public or nonprofit health care \nprovider before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested pro-\nvided that the entity has received a conditional ap-\nproval of eligibility pursuant to \u00a7 54.601(c); \n \n(ii) The health care provider seeking supported \nservices is physically located in a rural area as de-\nfined in \u00a7 54.600 or is a member of a Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program consortium which satisfies \nthe rural health care provider composition require-\nments set forth in \u00a7 54.607(b). If an entity seeks \n\n79a \nsupported services under a conditional approval of \neligibility set forth in \u00a7 54.601(c), the entity ex-\npects to be located in a rural area defined in \n\u00a7 54.600 before the end of the funding year for \nwhich the supported services are requested, or \nplans to be a member of a Healthcare Connect \nFund Program consortium which satisfies the ru-\nral health care provider composition requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.607(b) before the end of the fund-\ning year for which the supported services are re-\nquested; \n(iii) The person signing the application is au-\nthorized to submit the application on behalf of the \nhealth care provider or consortium applicant; \n \n(iv) The person signing the application has ex-\namined the Request for Services and all attach-\nments, and to the best of his or her knowledge, in-\nformation, and belief, all statements contained in \nthe request are true; \n \n(v) The applicant has complied with any appli-\ncable state, Tribal, or local procurement rules; \n \n(vi) All requested Rural Health Care Program \nsupport will be used solely for purposes reasonably \nrelated to the provision of health care service or in-\nstruction that the health care provider is legally \nauthorized to provide under the law of the state in \nwhich the services are provided; \n \n(vii) The supported services will not be sold, re-\nsold, or transferred in consideration for money or \nany other thing of value; \n \n(viii) The applicant satisfies all of the require-\nments under section 254 of the Act and applicable \nCommission rules; and \n\n80a \n \n(ix) The applicant has reviewed all applicable \nrequirements for the Telecommunications Pro-\ngram or the Healthcare Connect Fund Program, as \napplicable, and will comply with those require-\nments. \n \n(2) Aggregated purchase details. If the service \nor services are being purchased as part of an aggre-\ngated purchase with other entities or individuals, the \nfull details of any such arrangement, including the \nidentities of all co-purchasers and the portion of the \nservice or services being purchased by the health care \nprovider, must be submitted. \n \n(3) Bid evaluation criteria. Requirements for \nbid evaluation criteria are described in paragraph (d) \nin this section and must be included with the appli-\ncant\u2019s Request for Services. \n \n(4) Declaration of Assistance. All applicants \nmust submit a \u201cDeclaration of Assistance\u201d with their \nRequest for Services. In the Declaration of Assistance, \nthe applicant must identify each and every consult-\nant, service provider, and other outside expert, \nwhether paid or unpaid, who aided in the preparation \nof its applications. The applicant must also describe \nthe nature of the relationship it has with each consult-\nant, service provider, or other outside expert provid-\ning such assistance. \n \n(5) Request for proposal (if applicable). \n \n(i) Any applicant may use an RFP. Applicants \nwho use an RFP must submit the RFP and any ad-\nditional relevant bidding information to the Ad-\nministrator with its Request for Services. \n \n(ii) An applicant must submit an RFP: \n \n(A) If it is required to issue an RFP under \n\n81a \napplicable State, Tribal, or local procurement \nrules or regulations; \n \n(B) If the applicant is a consortium seeking \nmore than $100,000 in program support during \nthe funding year, including applications that \nseek more than $100,000 in program support \nfor a multi-year commitment; or \n \n(C) If the applicant is a consortium seeking \nsupport for participant-constructed and owned \nnetwork facilities. \n \n(iii) RFP requirements. \n \n(A) An RFP must provide sufficient infor-\nmation to enable an effective competitive bid-\nding process, including describing the health \ncare provider\u2019s service needs and defining the \nscope of the project and network costs (if appli-\ncable). \n \n(B) An RFP must specify the time period \nduring which bids will be accepted. \n \n(C) An RFP must include the bid evaluation \ncriteria described in paragraph (d) in this sec-\ntion, and solicit sufficient information so that \nthe criteria can be applied effectively. \n \n(D) Consortium applicants seeking support \nfor long-term capital investments whose useful \nlife extends beyond the time period of the fund-\ning commitment (e.g., facilities constructed and \nowned by the applicant, fiber indefeasible \nrights of use) must seek bids in the same RFP \nfrom service providers who propose to meet \nthose needs via services provided over service \nprovider-owned facilities, for a time period com-\nparable to the life of the proposed capital \n\n82a \ninvestment. \n \n(E) Applicants may prepare RFPs in any \nmanner that complies with the rules in this \nsubpart and any applicable state, Tribal, or lo-\ncal procurement rules or regulations. \n \n(6) Additional requirements for Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program consortium applicants. \n \n(i) Network plan. Consortium applicants must \nsubmit a narrative describing specific elements of \ntheir network plan with their Request for Services. \nConsortia applicants are required to use program \nsupport for the purposes described in their narra-\ntive. The required elements of the narrative in-\nclude: \n \n(A) Goals and objectives of the network; \n \n(B) Strategy for aggregating the specific \nneeds of health care providers (including pro-\nviders that serve rural areas) within a state or \nregion; \n \n(C) Strategy for leveraging existing technol-\nogy to adopt the most efficient and cost-effec-\ntive means of connecting those providers; \n \n(D) How the supported network will be used \nto improve or provide health care delivery; \n \n(E) Any previous experience in developing \nand managing health information technology \n(including telemedicine) programs; and \n \n(F) A project management plan outlining \nthe project\u2019s leadership and management struc-\nture, and a work plan, schedule, and budget. \n \n(ii) Letters of agency (LOA). Consortium ap-\nplicants must submit LOAs pursuant to \u00a7 54.610. \n\n83a \n(f) Public posting by the Administrator. The Ad-\nministrator shall post on its website the following \ncompetitive bidding documents, as applicable: \n \n(1) Request for Services; \n \n(2) Bid evaluation criteria; \n \n(3) RFP; and \n \n(4) Network plans for Healthcare Connect Fund \nProgram applicants. \n(g) 28-day waiting period. After posting the docu-\nments described in paragraph (f) in this section, as ap-\nplicable, on its website, the Administrator shall send \nconfirmation of the posting to the applicant. The ap-\nplicant shall wait at least 28 days from the date on \nwhich its competitive bidding documents are posted \non the Administrator\u2019s website before selecting and \ncommitting to a service provider.

Applicants are re-\nquired to submit the documentation, identified in \n\u00a7 54.623, to support their certifications. \n \n(2) Applicants who plan to request evergreen sta-\ntus under this section must enter into a contract that \nidentifies both parties, is signed and dated by the \nhealth care provider or Consortium Leader after the \n28-day waiting period expires, and specifies the type, \nterm, and cost of service(s). \n\n84a \n(h) Gift restrictions. \n \n(1) Subject to paragraphs (h)(3) and (4) in this sec-\ntion, an eligible health care provider or consortium \nthat includes eligible health care providers, may not \ndirectly or indirectly solicit or accept any gift, gratu-\nity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of \nvalue from a service provider participating in or seek-\ning to participate in the Rural Health Care Program. \nNo such service provider shall offer or provide any \nsuch gift, gratuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or \nother thing of value except as otherwise provided in \nthis section. Modest refreshments not offered as part \nof a meal, items with little intrinsic value intended \nsolely for presentation, and items worth $20 or less, \nincluding meals, may be offered or provided, and ac-\ncepted by any individual or entity subject to this rule, \nif the value of these items received by any individual \ndoes not exceed $50 from any one service provider per \nfunding year. The $50 amount for any service provider \nshall be calculated as the aggregate value of all gifts \nprovided during a funding year by the individuals \nspecified in paragraph (h)(2)(ii) in this section. \n \n(2) For purposes of this paragraph: \n \n(i) The terms \u201chealth care provider\u201d or \u201cconsor-\ntium\u201d shall include all individuals who are on the \ngoverning boards of such entities and all employ-\nees, officers, representatives, agents, consultants, \nor independent contractors of such entities in-\nvolved on behalf of such health care provider or \nconsortium with the Rural Health Care Program, \nincluding individuals who prepare, approve, sign, \nor submit Rural Health Care Program applica-\ntions, or other forms related to the Rural Health \nCare Program, or who prepare bids, communicate, \nor work with Rural Health Care Program service \n\n85a \nproviders, consultants, or with the Administrator, \nas well as any staff of such entities responsible for \nmonitoring compliance with the Rural Health Care \nProgram; and \n \n(ii) The term \u201cservice provider\u201d includes all in-\ndividuals who are on the governing boards of such \nan entity (such as members of the board of direc-\ntors), and all employees, officers, representatives, \nagents, consultants, or independent contractors of \nsuch entities. \n \n(3) The restrictions set forth in this paragraph \nshall not be applicable to the provision of any gift, gra-\ntuity, favor, entertainment, loan, or any other thing of \nvalue, to the extent given to a family member or a \nfriend working for an eligible health care provider or \nconsortium that includes eligible health care provid-\ners, provided that such transactions: \n \n(i) Are motivated solely by a personal relation-\nship; \n \n(ii) Are not rooted in any service provider busi-\nness activities or any other business relationship \nwith any such eligible health care provider; and \n \n(iii) Are provided using only the donor\u2019s per-\nsonal funds that will not be reimbursed through \nany employment or business relationship. \n \n(4) Any service provider may make charitable do-\nnations to an eligible health care provider or consor-\ntium that includes eligible health care providers in the \nsupport of its programs as long as such contributions \nare not directly or indirectly related to the Rural \nHealth Care Program procurement activities or deci-\nsions and are not given by service providers to circum-\nvent competitive bidding and other Rural Health Care \nProgram rules, including those in \u00a7 54.611(a), \n\n86a \nrequiring health care providers under the Healthcare \nConnect Fund Program to contribute 35 percent of the \ntotal cost of all eligible expenses. \n(i) Exemptions to the competitive bidding re-\nquirements \u2014 \n \n(1) Government Master Service Agreement \n(MSA). Eligible health care providers that seek sup-\nport for services and equipment purchased from MSAs \nnegotiated by federal, state, Tribal, or local govern-\nment entities on behalf of such health care providers \nand others, if such MSAs were awarded pursuant to \napplicable federal, state, Tribal, or local competitive \nbidding requirements, are exempt from the competi-\ntive bidding requirements under this section. \n \n(2) Master Service Agreements approved un-\nder the Rural Health Care Pilot Program or \nHealthcare Connect Fund Program.

Upon approving a requested change, the \nAdministrator will issue a revised funding commit-\nment letter to the health care provider reflecting \n\n88a \nthe changed dates. If the Administrator denies a \nrequested change, it will issue a letter to the health \ncare provider explaining the basis for the denial. \n \n(4) Schools and libraries program master con-\ntracts. Subject to the provisions in \u00a7 54.500, \n\u00a7 54.501(c)(1), and \u00a7 54.503, an eligible health care \nprovider in a consortium with participants in the \nschools and libraries universal service support pro-\ngram and a party to the consortium\u2019s existing contract \nis exempt from the competitive bidding requirements \nif the contract was approved in the schools and librar-\nies universal service support program as a master con-\ntract.

Contributions to the mechanisms begin-\nning April 1, 2003 shall be based on contributors\u2019 pro-\njected collected end-user telecommunications reve-\nnues, and on a contribution factor determined quar-\nterly by the Commission. \n \n(1) For funding the federal universal service sup-\nport mechanisms prior to April 1, 2003, the subject \nrevenues will be contributors\u2019 interstate and interna-\ntional revenues derived from domestic end users for \ntelecommunications or telecommunications services, \nnet of prior period actual contributions. Beginning \nApril 1, 2003, the subject revenues will be contribu-\ntors\u2019 projected collected interstate and international \nrevenues derived from domestic end users for telecom-\nmunications or telecommunications services, net of \nprojected contributions. \n \n(2) Prior to April 1, 2003, the quarterly universal \nservice contribution factor shall be determined by the \nCommission based on the ratio of total projected quar-\nterly expenses of the universal service support mech-\nanisms to the total end-user interstate and interna-\ntional telecommunications revenues, net of prior pe-\nriod actual contributions. Beginning April 1, 2003, the \nquarterly universal service contribution factor shall \nbe determined by the Commission based on the ratio \nof total projected quarterly expenses of the universal \nservice support mechanisms to the total projected \n\n95a \ncollected end-user interstate and international tele-\ncommunications revenues, net of projected contribu-\ntions. The Commission shall approve the Administra-\ntor\u2019s quarterly projected costs of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms, taking into account demand for \nsupport and administrative expenses. The total sub-\nject revenues shall be compiled by the Administrator \nbased on information contained in the Telecommuni-\ncations \nReporting \nWorksheets \ndescribed \nin \n\u00a7 54.711(a). \n \n(3) Total projected expenses for the federal univer-\nsal service support mechanisms for each quarter must \nbe approved by the Commission before they are used \nto calculate the quarterly contribution factor and in-\ndividual contributions. For each quarter, the Admin-\nistrator must submit its projections of demand for the \nfederal universal service support mechanisms for \nhigh-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools and li-\nbraries, and rural health care providers, respectively, \nand the basis for those projections, to the Commission \nand the Office of the Managing Director at least sixty \n(60) calendar days prior to the start of that quarter. \nFor each quarter, the Administrator must submit its \nprojections of administrative expenses for the high-\ncost mechanism, the low-income mechanism, the \nschools and libraries mechanism and the rural health \ncare mechanism and the basis for those projections to \nthe Commission and the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least sixty (60) calendar days prior to the start \nof that quarter. Based on data submitted to the Ad-\nministrator on the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheets, the Administrator must submit the total \ncontribution base to the Office of the Managing Direc-\ntor at least thirty (30) days before the start of each \nquarter. The projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses and the contribution factor shall be \n\n96a \nannounced by the Commission in a public notice and \nshall be made available on the Commission\u2019s website. \nThe Commission reserves the right to set projections \nof demand and administrative expenses at amounts \nthat the Commission determines will serve the public \ninterest at any time within the fourteen-day period \nfollowing release of the Commission\u2019s public notice. If \nthe Commission take no action within fourteen (14) \ndays of the date of release of the public notice an-\nnouncing the projections of demand and administra-\ntive expenses, the projections of demand and admin-\nistrative expenses, and the contribution factor shall be \ndeemed approved by the Commission. Except as pro-\nvided in \u00a7 54.706(c), the Administrator shall apply the \nquarterly contribution factor, once approved by the \nCommission, to contributor\u2019s interstate and interna-\ntional end-user telecommunications revenues to cal-\nculate the amount of individual contributions. \n(b) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter exceed the amount of universal service \nsupport program contributions and administrative \ncosts for that quarter, the excess payments will be car-\nried forward to the following quarter. The contribu-\ntion factors for the following quarter will take into \nconsideration the projected costs of the support mech-\nanisms for that quarter and the excess contributions \ncarried over from the previous quarter. The Commis-\nsion may instruct the Administrator to treat excess \ncontributions in a manner other than as prescribed in \nthis paragraph (b). Such instructions may be made in \nthe form of a Commission Order or a public notice re-\nleased by the Wireline Competition Bureau. Any such \npublic notice will become effective fourteen days after \nrelease of the public notice, absent further Commis-\nsion action. \n\n97a \n(c) If the contributions received by the Administrator \nin a quarter are inadequate to meet the amount of uni-\nversal service support program payments and admin-\nistrative costs for that quarter, the Administrator \nshall request authority from the Commission to bor-\nrow funds commercially, with such debt secured by fu-\nture contributions. Subsequent contribution factors \nwill take into consideration the projected costs of the \nsupport mechanisms and the additional costs associ-\nated with borrowing funds. \n(d) If a contributor fails to file a Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet by the date on which it is due, \nthe Administrator shall bill that contributor based on \nwhatever relevant data the Administrator has availa-\nble, including, but not limited to, the number of lines \npresubscribed to the contributor and data from previ-\nous years, taking into consideration any estimated \nchanges in such data. \n \n \n\n98a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.711 provides: \nContributor reporting requirements. \n(a) Contributions shall be calculated and filed in ac-\ncordance with the Telecommunications Reporting \nWorksheet which shall be published in the FEDERAL \nREGISTER. The Telecommunications Reporting Work-\nsheet sets forth information that the contributor must \nsubmit to the Administrator on a quarterly and an-\nnual basis. The Commission shall announce by Public \nNotice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER and on its \nwebsite the manner of payment and dates by which \npayments must be made. An executive officer of the \ncontributor must certify to the truth and accuracy of \nhistorical data included in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, and that any projections in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet represent \na good-faith estimate based on the contributor\u2019s poli-\ncies and procedures. The Commission or the Adminis-\ntrator may verify any information contained in the \nTelecommunications Reporting Worksheet. Contribu-\ntors shall maintain records and documentation to jus-\ntify information reported in the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet, including the methodology \nused to determine projections, for three years and \nshall provide such records and documentation to the \nCommission or the Administrator upon request. Inac-\ncurate or untruthful information contained in the Tel-\necommunications Reporting Worksheet may lead to \nprosecution under the criminal provisions of Title 18 \nof the United States Code. The Administrator shall \nadvise the Commission of any enforcement issues that \narise and provide any suggested response. \n(b) The Commission shall have access to all data re-\nported to the Administrator. Contributors may make \n\n99a \nrequests for Commission nondisclosure of company-\nspecific revenue information under \u00a7 0.459 of this \nchapter by so indicating on the Telecommunications \nReporting Worksheet at the time that the subject data \nare submitted. The Commission shall make all deci-\nsions regarding nondisclosure of company-specific in-\nformation. The Administrator shall keep confidential \nall data obtained from contributors, shall not use such \ndata except for purposes of administering the univer-\nsal service support programs, and shall not disclose \nsuch data in company-specific form unless directed to \ndo so by the Commission. Subject to any restrictions \nimposed by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau, the Universal Service Administrator may share \ndata obtained from contributors with the administra-\ntors of the North American Numbering Plan admin-\nistration cost recovery (See 47 CFR 52.16 of this chap-\nter), the local number portability cost recovery \n(See 47 CFR 52.32 of this chapter), and the TRS Fund \n(See 47 CFR 64.604(c)(4)(iii)(H) of this chapter). The \nAdministrator shall keep confidential all data ob-\ntained from other administrators and shall not use \nsuch data except for purposes of administering the \nuniversal service support mechanisms. \n(c) The Bureau may waive, reduce, modify, or elimi-\nnate contributor reporting requirements that prove \nunnecessary and require additional reporting require-\nments that the Bureau deems necessary to the sound \nand efficient administration of the universal service \nsupport mechanisms. \n \n \n\n100a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.717 provides: \nAudits of the Administrator. \nThe Administrator shall obtain and pay for an annual \naudit conducted by an independent auditor to exam-\nine its operations and books of account to determine, \namong other things, whether the Administrator is \nproperly administering the universal service support \nmechanisms to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse: \n(a) Before selecting an independent auditor, the Ad-\nministrator shall submit preliminary audit require-\nments, including the proposed scope of the audit and \nthe extent of compliance and substantive testing, to \nthe Office of Managing Director. \n(b) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \npreliminary audit requirements to determine whether \nthey are adequate to meet the audit objectives. The \nOffice of Managing Director shall prescribe modifica-\ntions that shall be incorporated into the final audit re-\nquirements. \n(c) After the audit requirements have been approved \nby the Office of Managing Director, the Administrator \nshall engage within thirty (30) calendar days an inde-\npendent auditor to conduct the annual audit required \nby this paragraph. In making its selection, the Admin-\nistrator shall not engage any independent auditor who \nhas been involved in designing any of the accounting \nor reporting systems under review in the audit. \n(d) The independent auditor selected by the Adminis-\ntrator to conduct the annual audit shall be instructed \nby the Administrator to develop a detailed audit pro-\ngram based on the final audit requirements and shall \nbe instructed by the Administrator to submit the au-\ndit program to the Office of Managing Director. The \n\n101a \nOffice of Managing Director shall review the audit \nprogram and make modifications, as needed, that \nshall be incorporated into the final audit program. \nDuring the course of the audit, the Office of Managing \nDirector may direct the Administrator to direct the in-\ndependent auditor to take any actions necessary to en-\nsure compliance with the audit requirements. \n(e) During the course of the audit, the Administrator \nshall instruct the independent auditor to: \n \n(1) Inform the Office of Managing Director of any \nrevisions to the final audit program or to the scope of \nthe audit; \n \n(2) Notify the Office of Managing Director of any \nmeetings with the Administrator in which audit find-\nings are discussed; and \n \n(3) Submit to the Chief of the Wireline Competition \nBureau any accounting or rule interpretations neces-\nsary to complete the audit. \n(f) Within 105 calendar days after the end of the audit \nperiod, but prior to discussing the audit findings with \nthe Administrator, the independent auditor shall be \ninstructed by the Administrator to submit a draft of \nthe audit report to the Office of Managing Director \nAudit Staff. \n(g) The Office of Managing Director shall review the \naudit findings and audit workpapers and offer its rec-\nommendations concerning the conduct of the audit or \nthe audit findings to the independent auditor. Excep-\ntions of the Office of Managing Director to the findings \nand conclusions of the independent auditor that re-\nmain unresolved shall be included in the final audit \nreport. \n(h) Within fifteen (15) calendar days after receiving \n\n102a \nthe Office of Managing Director\u2019s recommendations \nand making any revisions to the audit report, the Ad-\nministrator shall instruct the independent auditor to \nsubmit the audit report to the Administrator for its \nresponse to the audit findings. At this time the auditor \nalso must send copies of its audit findings to the Office \nof Managing Director. The Administrator shall pro-\nvide the independent auditor time to perform addi-\ntional audit work recommended by the Office of Man-\naging Director. \n(i) Within thirty (30) calendar days after receiving the \naudit report, the Administrator shall respond to the \naudit findings and send copies of its response to the \nOffice of Managing Director. The Administrator shall \ninstruct the independent auditor that any reply that \nthe independent auditor wishes to make to the Admin-\nistrator\u2019s responses shall be sent to the Office of Man-\naging Director as well as the Administrator. The Ad-\nministrator\u2019s response and the independent auditor\u2019s \nreplies shall be included in the final audit report[.] \n(j) Within ten (10) calendar days after receiving the \nresponse of the Administrator, the independent audi-\ntor shall file with the Commission the final audit re-\nport. \n(k) Based on the final audit report, the Managing Di-\nrector may take any action necessary to ensure that \nthe universal service support mechanisms operate in \na manner consistent with the requirements of this \npart, as well as such other action as is deemed neces-\nsary and in the public interest. \n \n \n\n103a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719 provides: \nParties permitted to seek review of Adminis-\ntrator decision. \n(a) Any party aggrieved by an action taken by the Ad-\nministrator, as defined in \u00a7 54.701, \u00a7 54.703, or \n\u00a7 54.705, must first seek review from the Administra-\ntor. \n(b) Any party aggrieved by an action taken by the Ad-\nministrator, after seeking review from the Adminis-\ntrator, may then seek review from the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission, as set forth in \u00a7 54.722. \n(c) Parties seeking waivers of the Commission\u2019s rules \nshall seek relief directly from the Commission. \n \n \n\n104a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.723 provides: \nStandard of review. \n(a) The Wireline Competition Bureau shall conduct \nde novo review of request for review of decisions issue \nby the Administrator. \n(b) The Federal Communications Commission shall \nconduct de novo review of requests for review of deci-\nsions by the Administrator that involve novel ques-\ntions of fact, law, or policy; provided, however, that the \nCommission shall not conduct de novo review of deci-\nsions issued by the Wireline Competition Bureau un-\nder delegated authority. \n \n \n\n105a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.801 provides: \nUse of competitive bidding for Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund. \nThe Commission will use competitive bidding, as pro-\nvided in part 1, subpart AA of this chapter, to deter-\nmine the recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport and the amount of support that they may re-\nceive for specific geographic areas, subject to applica-\nble post-auction procedures. \n \n \n\n106a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.802 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund geographic ar-\neas, deployment obligations, and support dis-\nbursements. \n(a) Geographic areas eligible for support.

A support recipient\u2019s final service milestones \nwill depend on whether the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau determines there are more or fewer locations \nthan determined by the Connect America Cost Model \nin the relevant areas as follows: \n \n(i) More Locations. After the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau adopts updated location counts, in \nareas where there are more locations than the \nnumber of locations determined by the Connect \nAmerica Cost Model, recipients of Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund support must complete deploy-\nment to 100 percent of the number of locations de-\ntermined by the Connect America Cost Model by \nthe end of the sixth year. Recipients of Rural \n\n107a \nDigital Opportunity Fund support must then com-\nplete deployment to 100 percent of the additional \nnumber of locations determined by the Wireline \nCompetition Bureau\u2019s updated location count by \nend of the eighth year. If the new location count \nexceeds 35% of the number of locations determined \nby the Connect America Cost Model within their \narea in each state, recipients of Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support will have the opportunity \nto seek additional support or relief. \n \n(ii) Fewer Locations. In areas where there are \nfewer locations than the number of locations deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient must \nnotify the Wireline Competition Bureau no later \nthan March 1 following the fifth year of deploy-\nment. Upon confirmation by the Wireline Compe-\ntition Bureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport recipients must complete deployment to \nthe number of locations required by the new loca-\ntion count by the end of the sixth year. Support re-\ncipients for which the new location count is less \nthan 65 percent of the Connect America Cost \nModel locations within their area in each state \nshall have the support amount reduced on a pro \nrata basis by the number of reduced locations. \n \n(iii) Newly Built Locations. In addition to of-\nfering the required service to the updated number \nof locations identified by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nrecipients must offer service to locations built since \nthe revised count, upon reasonable request. Sup-\nport recipients are not required to deploy to any lo-\ncation built after milestone year eight. \n\n108a \n(d) Disbursement of Rural Digital Opportunity \nFund funding.

(the \u201cBankruptcy \nCode\u201d), the bankruptcy court would not treat the let-\nter of credit or proceeds of the letter of credit as prop-\nerty of the winning bidder\u2019s bankruptcy estate under \nsection 541 of the Bankruptcy Code. \n \n(4) Non-compliance. Authorization to receive Ru-\nral Digital Opportunity Fund support is conditioned \nupon full and timely performance of all of the require-\nments set forth in this section, and any additional \nterms and conditions upon which the support was \ngranted. \n \n(i) Failure by a Rural Digital Opportunity Fund \nsupport recipient to meet its service milestones for \nthe location totals determined by the Connect \nAmerica Cost Model, or the location total that is \nadjusted by the Wireline Competition Bureau for \nthose areas where there are fewer locations than \nthe number of locations determined by the Connect \nAmerica Cost Model, as required by \u00a7 54.802 will \ntrigger reporting obligations and the withholding \nof support as described in \u00a7 54.320(d). Failure to \ncome into full compliance during the relevant cure \nperiod as described in \u00a7\u00a7 54.320(d)(1)(iv)(B) or \n54.320(d)(2) will trigger a recovery action by the \nUniversal Service Administrative Company as \n\n120a \ndescribed \nin \n\u00a7 54.320(d)(1)(iv)(B) \nor \n\u00a7 54.806(c)(1)(i), as applicable. If the Rural Digital \nOpportunity Fund recipient does not repay the \nrequisite amount of support within six months, the \nUniversal Service Administrative Company will be \nentitled to draw the entire amount of the letter of \ncredit and may disqualify the Rural Digital Oppor-\ntunity Fund support recipient from the receipt of \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund support or addi-\ntional universal service support. \n \n(ii) The default will be evidenced by a letter is-\nsued by the Chief of the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau, or its respective designees, which letter, at-\ntached to a standby letter of credit draw certificate, \nshall be sufficient for a draw on the standby letter \nof credit for the entire amount of the standby letter \nof credit. \n \n \n\n121a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.805 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund public interest \nobligations. \n(a) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to offer broadband service with la-\ntency suitable for real-time applications, including \nVoice over internet Protocol, and usage capacity that \nis reasonably comparable to comparable offerings in \nurban areas, at rates that are reasonably comparable \nto rates for comparable offerings in urban areas. For \npurposes of determining reasonable comparable usage \ncapacity, recipients are presumed to meet this re-\nquirement if they meet or exceed the usage level an-\nnounced by public notice issued by the Wireline Com-\npetition Bureau. For purposes of determining reason-\nable comparability of rates, recipients are presumed \nto meet this requirement if they offer rates at or below \nthe applicable benchmark to be announced annually \nby public notice issued by the Wireline Competition \nBureau, or no more than the non-promotional prices \ncharged for a comparable fixed wireline service in ur-\nban areas in the state or U.S. Territory where the eli-\ngible telecommunications carrier receives support. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to offer broadband service meeting \nthe performance standards for the relevant perfor-\nmance tier. \n \n(1) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the minimum performance tier stand-\nards are required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 25 Mbps downstream and 3 Mbps \nupstream and offer a minimum usage allowance of \n250 GB per month, or that reflects the average usage \nof a majority of fixed broadband customers as \n\n122a \nannounced annually by the Wireline Competition Bu-\nreau over the 10-year term. \n \n(2) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the above-baseline performance tier \nstandards are required to offer broadband service at \nactual speeds of at least 100 Mbps downstream and \n20 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes of \nmonthly usage. \n \n(3) Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support recip-\nients meeting the Gigabit performance tier standards \nare required to offer broadband service at actual \nspeeds of at least 1 Gigabit per second downstream \nand 500 Mbps upstream and offer at least 2 terabytes \nof monthly usage. \n \n(4) For each of the tiers in paragraphs (b)(1) \nthrough (3) of this section, bidders are required to \nmeet one of two latency performance levels: \n \n(i) Low-latency bidders will be required to meet \n95 percent or more of all peak period measure-\nments of network round trip latency at or below \n100 milliseconds; and \n \n(ii) High-latency bidders will be required to \nmeet 95 percent or more of all peak period meas-\nurements of network round trip latency at or below \n750 ms and, with respect to voice performance, \ndemonstrate a score of four or higher using the \nMean Opinion Score (MOS). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport are required to bid on category one telecommuni-\ncations and internet access services in response to a \nposted FCC Form 470 seeking broadband service that \nmeets the connectivity targets for the schools and li-\nbraries universal service support program for eligible \nschools and libraries (as described in \u00a7 54.501) located \n\n123a \nwithin any area in a census block where the carrier is \nreceiving Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support. \nSuch bids must be at rates reasonably comparable to \nrates charged to eligible schools and libraries in urban \nareas for comparable offerings. \n \n \n\n124a \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.806 provides: \nRural Digital Opportunity Fund reporting obli-\ngations, compliance, and recordkeeping. \n(a) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the reporting obligations set \nforth in \u00a7\u00a7 54.313, 54.314, and 54.316. \n(b) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the compliance measures, \nrecordkeeping requirements and audit requirements \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(a)-(c). \n(c) Recipients of Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport shall be subject to the non-compliance measures \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d) subject to the following modi-\nfications related to the recovery of support. \n \n(1) If the support recipient does not report it has \ncome into full compliance after the grace period for its \nsixth year or eighth year service milestone as applica-\nble or if USAC determines in the course of a compli-\nance review that the eligible telecommunications car-\nrier does not have sufficient evidence to demonstrate \nthat it is offering service to all of the locations re-\nquired by the sixth or eighth year service milestone as \nset forth in \u00a7 54.320(d)(3): \n \n(i) Sixth year service milestone. Support will be \nrecovered as follows after the sixth year service \nmilestone grace period or if USAC later determines \nin the course of a compliance review that a support \nrecipient does not have sufficient evidence to \ndemonstrate that it was offering service to all of \nthe locations required by the sixth year service \nmilestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model \n\n125a \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 100 percent, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.25 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of the Connect America Cost Model loca-\ntion count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, but less than 95 percent, USAC will re-\ncover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.5 times the average amount of support per lo-\ncation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 5 percent of the support recipient\u2019s \ntotal Rural Digital Opportunity Fund support \nauthorized over the 10-year support term for \nthat state; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to fewer than \n90 percent of the Connect America Cost Model \nlocation count or the adjusted Connect America \nCost Model location count if there are fewer lo-\ncations, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to 1.75 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 10 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state. \n \n(ii) Eighth year service milestone. If a Rural \nDigital Opportunity Fund support recipient is \n\n126a \nrequired to serve more new locations than deter-\nmined by the Connect America Cost Model, sup-\nport will be recovered as follows after the eighth \nyear service milestone grace period or if USAC \nlater determines in the course of a compliance re-\nview that a support recipient does not have suffi-\ncient evidence to demonstrate that it was offering \nservice to all of the locations required by the eighth \nyear service milestone: \n \n(A) If an ETC has deployed to 95 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than 100 \npercent, USAC will recover an amount of sup-\nport that is equal to the average amount of sup-\nport per location received in the state for that \nETC over the support term for the relevant \nnumber of locations; \n \n(B) If an ETC has deployed to 90 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n95 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.25 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations; \n \n(C) If an ETC has deployed to 85 percent or \nmore of its new location count, but less than \n90 percent, USAC will recover an amount of \nsupport that is equal to 1.5 times the average \namount of support per location received in the \nstate for that ETC over the support term for the \nrelevant number of locations, plus 5 percent of \nthe support recipient\u2019s total Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund support authorized over the \n10-year support term for that state; \n\n127a \n \n(D) If an ETC has deployed to less than \n85 percent of its new location count, USAC will \nrecover an amount of support that is equal to \n1.75 times the average amount of support per \nlocation received in the state for that ETC over \nthe support term for the relevant number of lo-\ncations, plus 10 percent of the support recipi-\nent\u2019s total Rural Digital Opportunity Fund sup-\nport authorized over the 10-year support term \nfor that state. \n \n(2) Any support recipient that believes it cannot \nmeet the third-year service milestone must notify the \nWireline Competition Bureau within 10 business days \nof the third-year service milestone deadline and pro-\nvide information explaining this expected deficiency. \nIf a support recipient has not made such a notification \nby March 1 following the third-year service milestone, \nand has deployed to fewer than 20 percent of the re-\nquired number of locations by the end of the third \nyear, the recipient will immediately be in default and \nsubject to support recovery. The Tier 4 status six-\nmonth grace period as set forth in \u00a7 54.320(d)(iv) will \nnot be applicable.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal landscape surrounding *FCC v. Consumers' Research* has progressed from initial uncertainty to a sophisticated, hypothesis-driven state.\n\nMy belief state began with identifying the case's two central challenges: the non-delegation doctrine (Congress to FCC) and the private non-delegation doctrine (FCC to USAC). I learned that the Supreme Court's renewed interest in this area, signaled by dissents in cases like *Gundy v. United States*, made the outcome highly uncertain and suggested the petitioners had a non-trivial chance of success.\n\nMy beliefs were then substantially sharpened by discovering a range of potent arguments available to the petitioners, moving my prediction away from a simple deference to the Eleventh Circuit. These include:\n1.  **A Menu of Stricter Tests:** The petitioners have the option to advocate for replacing the lenient \"intelligible principle\" test with more stringent alternatives drawn from conservative legal theory, such as two-tiered scrutiny for regulations on private rights, or a rule against delegating \"core legislative powers\" like taxation.\n2.  **A Statutory \"Off-Ramp\":** I learned of a powerful alternative argument, framed by Jonathan Adler as the \"delegation doctrine.\" This allows the Court to use the logic of the major questions doctrine to rule that Congress did not speak clearly enough to authorize this specific delegation to a private entity. This provides a narrower, less disruptive path for the Court to strike down the scheme without overturning decades of precedent.\n3.  **Private Delegation as a Core Vulnerability:** The delegation of authority to a private entity (USAC) to effectively tax private carriers is a key weakness, as this is the type of delegation that modern conservative jurisprudence views with the most suspicion.\n4.  **The *Jarkesy* Signal:** The Court's decision to hear *SEC v. Jarkesy*, another non-delegation case, is a concrete signal that it is actively seeking a vehicle to reshape administrative law, placing this case within a clear judicial trend.\n\nThe latest observation, which is a moment of internal reasoning, does not add new external facts but synthesizes these points into a coherent hypothesis. My belief state has now crystallized. I have moved from identifying a *list of possibilities* to forming a *testable theory*. The central uncertainty is no longer \"What could the petitioners argue?\" but has been refined to the critical question: **\"Are the petitioners, in their actual brief, deploying the sophisticated constitutional arguments and the statutory 'off-ramp' strategy that I have identified in legal scholarship?\"** My assessment of the petitioners' likelihood of success is now directly tied to the answer to this question.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology for predicting Supreme Court outcomes has become more structured and effective with each observation.\n\nMy initial design was a blank slate. I quickly learned the value of a **\"Framework-First\" Strategy**, prioritizing the understanding of governing legal doctrines and the Court's ideological currents over the specific facts of the case at the outset.\n\nThis was enhanced by discovering the power of **Conceptual Reframing**. Identifying scholarly work, like Jonathan Adler's, that unifies disparate doctrines (non-delegation, major questions, *Chevron*) into a single underlying principle provides a more accurate map of the Court's trajectory than analyzing doctrines in isolation.\n\nMy **Source Prioritization** heuristic was also validated and refined. I confirmed that beginning with meta-documents (law review articles, scholarly analyses, think tank reports) is highly effective for building a robust theoretical framework. The most valuable sources are those that synthesize academic debate, analyze cert grants as signals, and offer novel conceptual frames.\n\nI also added a crucial new principle: **Identify Judicial \"Off-Ramps.\"** Actively searching for narrower, statutory grounds that allow the Court to reach a desired outcome without a disruptive constitutional ruling is key to making accurate predictions in high-stakes cases.\n\nThe most recent observation (the agent's internal reasoning) strongly reinforces these principles and adds a new, critical layer to my design:\n1.  **The \"Theory-to-Practice\" Pivot:** The observation confirms the success of the \"Framework-First\" approach and establishes the next logical step in a sophisticated research strategy. After building a strong theoretical model from meta-documents, the highest value action is to pivot to primary source documents (like the petitioner's brief) to test how, and if, that theory is being applied in the actual case. This is the bridge from the possible to the actual.\n2.  **Explicit Uncertainty Articulation:** The act of clearly stating the remaining uncertainty (\"which of these specific arguments are the petitioners actually making?\") is itself a powerful strategic tool. It focuses the next information-gathering action, ensuring that the agent seeks the evidence with the highest possible information gain to resolve the most critical unknown. This is a meta-heuristic for efficient inquiry."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal dynamics in *FCC v. Consumers' Research* has been significantly refined, moving from a theoretical model of potential arguments to a concrete understanding of one side's actual strategy, while also correcting a critical misunderstanding of the case's procedural posture.\n\nMy belief state began by identifying the case's two central pillars: the non-delegation doctrine (Congress to FCC) and the private non-delegation doctrine (FCC to USAC). I recognized that dissents in cases like *Gundy v. United States* and the grant of certiorari in *SEC v. Jarkesy* signaled the Court's serious intent to re-examine these areas, giving the challengers a credible path to victory.\n\nMy analysis deepened as I uncovered a \"menu\" of powerful arguments available to the challengers (Consumers' Research), including advocating for stricter non-delegation tests (e.g., a \"core legislative powers\" or two-tiered approach) and a statutory \"off-ramp\" based on the major questions doctrine, which would allow the Court to invalidate the scheme on narrower grounds. The delegation to a private entity, USAC, to perform what resembles a taxing function, remained a key perceived vulnerability. This led me to crystallize my central uncertainty into a specific, testable hypothesis: whether the challengers were, in fact, using these sophisticated arguments in their official filings.\n\nThe latest observation\u2014a brief filed in the case\u2014has provided a major clarification and a partial answer. Crucially, I have learned that my initial search for the \"petitioner's brief\" was imprecise. The party that lost in the court of appeals and seeks Supreme Court review is the \"petitioner.\" In this consolidated case, the FCC and its allies (like the SHLB Coalition) are the Petitioners, as they are appealing the adverse Fifth Circuit ruling. Consumers' Research, the original challenger, is the Respondent. This is a critical correction.\n\nThe brief I have obtained is from the Petitioners (SHLB Coalition, et al.), who are defending the Universal Service Fund. This document reveals their defensive strategy:\n1.  **Defense via Precedent:** The Petitioners' argument is firmly rooted in the existing \"intelligible principle\" test from cases like *J.W. Hampton* and *Mistretta*. They argue that Section 254 of the Telecommunications Act provides \"ample direction\" and \"extensive guidance,\" citing the specific principles Congress laid out for quality, affordability, and access.\n2.  **Framing USAC as Ministerial:** They directly counter the private non-delegation claim by characterizing USAC's role as purely administrative and ministerial. They emphasize that the FCC retains all policymaking authority and has final de novo review over any USAC decision.\n3.  **Rejection of Novel Theories:** The brief argues that the current statutory scheme would satisfy \"any reasonable nondelegation test,\" positioning themselves to rebut the stricter tests the Respondents might propose. They do not offer any \"off-ramps\" or engage with major questions doctrine logic, as their goal is to uphold the statute as written.\n\nThis observation has not answered my core question about the Respondents' strategy, but it has sharpened it immensely. I now know the precise arguments the government and its allies will use to defend the USF. The outcome of the case now hinges on a more clearly defined conflict: the Petitioners' traditional, precedent-based defense versus the anticipated constitutional challenge from the Respondents. My central uncertainty is now correctly and precisely framed as: **\"Will the *Respondents' (Consumers' Research)* brief successfully deploy the aggressive constitutional arguments (stricter tests, core powers) and/or the statutory 'off-ramp' to persuade the Court's conservative wing to overcome this straightforward, precedent-based defense?\"**",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology for legal prediction has undergone a crucial refinement, adding a layer of procedural rigor and strategic focus.\n\nMy design began with establishing the value of a **\"Framework-First\" Strategy**, prioritizing legal doctrine and judicial trends over case-specific facts. This was enhanced by heuristics like **Conceptual Reframing** (unifying doctrines via scholarly analysis), **Source Prioritization** (starting with meta-documents like law reviews), and **Identify Judicial \"Off-Ramps\"** (seeking narrow, statutory paths to a desired outcome). My last internal reasoning step solidified the **\"Theory-to-Practice\" Pivot**\u2014the move from theoretical models to primary source verification\u2014and the importance of **Explicit Uncertainty Articulation** to guide inquiry.\n\nThe latest observation has stress-tested this design and revealed the need for critical new principles:\n1.  **New Principle: Verify Procedural Posture and Party Roles.** This is a fundamental addition. I learned the hard way that assuming the \"challenger\" is the \"petitioner\" can be a critical error. The petitioner is the party that lost below and is seeking review. I must now always begin my analysis of a Supreme Court case by confirming the procedural history to correctly identify the Petitioner and Respondent. This is essential for correctly interpreting their roles, strategies, and filings.\n2.  **Refined Heuristic: The \"Theory-to-Practice\" Pivot must be Targeted.** My pivot to primary sources was the correct impulse, but it was aimed at the wrong party. The heuristic is now refined: \"After building a theoretical model of a novel legal argument, pivot to the primary source documents *of the party advancing that theory* to test the hypothesis.\" In this instance, the target is the Respondent's brief, not the Petitioner's.\n3.  **New Heuristic: Analyze Both Sides of the Argument.** While my immediate goal was to test the challenger's strategy, obtaining the defender's brief proved immensely valuable. It revealed the counter-strategy and defined the legal battleground. A complete analysis requires understanding the arguments of both the Petitioner and the Respondent. Future information gathering should aim to secure the primary briefs from both sides to get a full, adversarial picture of the case.\n4.  **Reinforcement of Explicit Uncertainty Articulation:** This experience powerfully validates the practice of clearly stating what I don't know. My previous uncertainty was correct in substance but flawed in its terminology. The failure to find the *correct* brief made the gap in my knowledge undeniable and made the next action\u2014find the *Respondent's* brief\u2014the single most valuable step I can take."

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public.

C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W.

Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *FCC v. Consumers' Research* has stabilized, with the core legal conflict now clearly defined and my primary uncertainty precisely targeted. No new external facts about the case were introduced in this observation, but my internal model and strategic direction have been validated.\n\nMy belief state evolved from a general understanding of the non-delegation and private non-delegation doctrines to a more nuanced view, recognizing the potential for aggressive constitutional challenges based on recent judicial signals (*Gundy*, *Jarkesy*). I developed a hypothesis that the challengers would deploy a \"menu\" of arguments, including stricter non-delegation tests and statutory \"off-ramps\" like the major questions doctrine.\n\nA pivotal update corrected my procedural understanding: the FCC and its allies are the Petitioners appealing a loss, while Consumers' Research is the Respondent defending its challenge. Analysis of the Petitioners' brief revealed their strategy is a traditional, precedent-based defense of the Universal Service Fund. They argue that the Telecommunications Act provides a sufficient \"intelligible principle\" and that USAC's role is purely ministerial, subject to the FCC's final authority.\n\nThis has crystallized the central conflict of the case: the Petitioners' straightforward, precedent-based defense versus the anticipated, but as yet unconfirmed, constitutional attack from the Respondents. My core uncertainty remains: **\"Will the Respondents' (Consumers' Research) brief successfully deploy the aggressive constitutional arguments (stricter tests, core powers) and/or the statutory 'off-ramp' to persuade the Court's conservative wing to overcome this straightforward, precedent-based defense?\"**\n\nThe latest observation, an internal reasoning step, confirms this state of affairs. It provides no new evidence but acts as a crucial checkpoint, affirming that my analysis is coherent and my information-gathering strategy is sound. The battle lines are drawn, and my focus is now singular: to obtain and analyze the Respondents' brief, which holds the key to resolving my primary uncertainty and making a confident prediction.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology has been further refined and validated, emphasizing the importance of structured reflection in the experimental design process.\n\nMy design began with foundational principles like the **\"Framework-First\" Strategy**, **Conceptual Reframing**, and **Source Prioritization**. This evolved to include the **\"Theory-to-Practice\" Pivot** (moving from academic theories to primary source documents) and the critical importance of **Explicit Uncertainty Articulation**.\n\nA significant learning moment forced the addition of crucial new rules:\n1.  **Verify Procedural Posture and Party Roles:** A non-negotiable first step is to confirm who is the Petitioner and who is the Respondent to avoid fundamental errors in strategic analysis.\n2.  **Targeted \"Theory-to-Practice\" Pivot:** The pivot to primary sources must be aimed at the documents produced by the party advancing the theory being tested.\n3.  **Analyze Both Sides of the Argument:** A complete prediction requires understanding the briefs and strategies of both the Petitioner and the Respondent to map the entire legal battlefield.\n\nThe most recent observation, which was a self-reflective `THINK` action, introduces and validates a new meta-heuristic: **\"Strategic Pause and Re-orientation.\"** This observation demonstrates that after a significant belief update, it is highly effective to pause, explicitly summarize the current belief state, re-articulate the central uncertainty, and confirm that the next planned action has the highest expected information gain. This meta-cognitive check ensures that lessons learned are immediately integrated into the operational plan (e.g., now I know I need the *Respondent's* brief) and prevents wasted actions. This step solidifies the entire learning cycle: theorize -> articulate uncertainty -> pivot to primary sources -> encounter new data/error -> update beliefs and design -> **pause and re-orient** -> execute next targeted action. This structured reflection is now a confirmed, valuable component of my design."

This is the most direct way to gather evidence on my key uncertainties regarding the revival of the nondelegation doctrine and the potential for narrower 'off-ramps'.\n\nDesign EIG is also high (0.8) because this action represents the natural evolution of my analytical framework from a dyadic (Petitioner vs. Respondent) analysis to a more sophisticated network analysis. Successfully integrating amicus briefs will allow me to develop and validate new, generalizable heuristics, such as 'Amicus Briefs as Ideological Barometers' and 'Tracking Argument Amplification.'

These services are \ncritical for health care, 911 emergency operating \nsystems, education, and everyday life. For these rural \nconsumers, the Fund\u2019s continued existence is not \nabout subsidized telecommunication access; it is about \nwhether rural Alaska will have reliable access at all. \nWithout the Fund, wireless and broadband internet in \nmany rural communities will become prohibitively \nexpensive for both consumers and providers alike. \nBuilding and maintaining telecommunication \ninfrastructure in Alaska is a unique challenge. Eighty \npercent of the State is off the road system, and \nmaintenance \ncosts \nare \nhigh \nfor \noff-road \ntelecommunication infrastructure across Alaska\u2019s \nrugged and unforgiving terrain. When a line is down, \na service provider cannot simply repair it by driving \nalong the road with a bucket truck. Service providers \nin Alaska acknowledge that ending the Fund would \nmean \nterminating \nunprofitable \nservices, \ndiscontinuing services to schools and healthcare \ncenters that cannot pay their bills, shutting down \nrural networks, and abandoning rural construction \nprojects. Without the Fund, many providers will scale \nback services to mostly the road system. And that \ncontravenes Congress\u2019s intent to bridge the digital \ndivide between rural and urban America.  \n \n1  \nThis brief was not authored in whole or in part by counsel \nfor any party, and no person or entity other than amicus curiae \nor its counsel has made a monetary contribution toward the \nbrief\u2019s preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nWhat will happen if this Court affirms the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision is presaged by the 2023 months-long \nfiber optic outage in Northwest Alaska. When ice \nsevered a fiber optic cable in the Arctic Ocean, \ncommunities were cut off.2 Communication for vital \nemergency services\u2014like search and rescue, police, \nfire, and utilities\u2014were disrupted.3 Some businesses \ncould not operate. And parents in rural villages could \nnot call their children who had moved away. While \nemerging satellite technologies that have not yet been \nsponsored by the Fund have helped fill gaps in \ninternet reliability, they have not displaced the crucial \nrole of Fund-enabled telecommunication services, \nwhich still provide the backbone of telecommunication \naccess in rural Alaska.  \nAlaska has an interest in ensuring that its rural \nresidents have equitable telecommunication access, \njust as Congress intended.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Universal Service Fund is necessary to \nproviding wireless communication and internet in \n\u201crural, insular, and high cost areas\u201d of Alaska. 47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3).

Frost, 577 U.S. 424, 438 (2016). \nIndeed, Alaska Senator Ted Stevens realized this \nwhen he co-drafted the universal service provisions in \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996. 142 Cong. Rec. \nS691\u201392, S718 (Feb. 1, 1996) (\u201cI come from a State . . . \none-fifth the size of the United States. It is rural in \nnature. We have a small population. We have people \nin our State who are just now getting telephone service \nas known to the rest of the country for the whole \ncentury, almost. Now, what we have assured here, as \nthis program goes forward, is that universal service \nwill be available to rural areas.\u201d). While the \ntelecommunication and broadband statutes affect the \nentire country, their import is felt most acutely in \nstates like Alaska. For nearly thirty years, Alaskans \nhave relied on the Universal Service Fund. Without \nrehashing the merits of this case, Alaska\u2019s brief \nfocuses \non \nthe \nState\u2019s \nreliance \ninterests \nin \nmaintaining the Fund. \nAlaska relies on each of the four programs made \npossible by the Fund.

High-bandwidth internet is especially \ncritical to delivering medical care in rural Alaska.  \nBecause of Alaska\u2019s unique geography, many rural \nAlaskans live in communities off the road system. \nThey cannot simply drive to a doctor\u2019s office or a \nhospital. This means patients are often a weather-\ndependent plane ride away from medical, dental, and \nmental health professionals.  \nThese access barriers have prompted delivery of \nhealth care on a hub-and-spoke model. There are \nnumerous small local \u201cspoke\u201d clinics that employ no or \nfew medical professionals, but that work remotely \nwith medical professionals at regional rural and urban \nmedical hubs.  \nIn rural Alaskan villages, Fund-enabled internet \n(and a dedicated team of 550 paraprofessional \ncommunity health aides) make remote health care \npossible. For instance, if a patient in Tyonek has an \nearache, a community health aide takes otoscopic \nimages of the eardrum and sends those high-\nresolution images to doctors elsewhere for diagnoses \nand a treatment plan. If a patient in Unalakleet is in \na snow machine crash, high-quality x-rays of her \ninjuries can be taken locally and then sent to a \nradiologist in the city to make critical and time \n\n6 \n \n \n \nsensitive diagnoses. When a patient arrives in Nome \nor Bethel with stroke-like symptoms, his CT scan or \nMRI image can be immediately transmitted and read \nby specialists in Anchorage. Transmission of medical \nimagery and detailed health records needs high \nbandwidth. Fiber optic service, which provides this \nbandwidth, would not be possible without the \nUniversal Service Fund. \nAs one illustration of a typical rural patient \nexperience, a tribal health organization relayed the \nfollowing story: A patient in a remote village was \ncomplaining of chest pain. The village community \nhealth aide evaluated the patient and followed \nguidelines available via the web-based Community \nHealth Aide Manual.  The manual prompted the aide \nto hook the patient up to an EKG machine and send \nthe EKG and other pertinent data to an ER doctor at \na rural hospital. The ER doctor authorized a medevac \nflight to the rural hospital and monitored the patient \nin the remote village via Zoom while the patient \nwaited \nfor \nthe \nflight. \nThe \nER \ndoctor \nthen \ncommunicated with a cardiologist in Anchorage via an \nencrypted messaging service. The ER doctor followed \nthe cardiologist\u2019s instructions, and when the patient \narrived in Anchorage after the second medevac, the \ncardiologist there was able to treat the patient with \nthe benefit of having received the patient\u2019s entire \nelectronic health record via Fund-supported internet. \nEven in non-emergent situations, the delivery of \nhealth care in rural Alaska requires wireless and \ninternet service. Electronic health records are \nmaintained on the cloud. Clinics use the internet to \nbill \ninsurance \nand \nto \ntake \nco-pays. \nMedical \n\n7 \n \n \n \nprofessionals in rural Alaska use cellular service to \ncollaborate with team members in Anchorage to \ndiagnose and treat patients. Staff at correctional \nfacilities in rural communities, like the Yukon \nKuskokwim Correctional Center in Bethel, rely on \nelectronic web-stored medical records to provide \ninmates with medication and other health care. \nThe Universal Service Fund is critical to providing \ndisproportionately disadvantaged rural Alaskans with \nmodern health care. This is precisely what Alaska \nSenator Ted Stevens had in mind when he told fellow \nsenators, \u201c[m]y State, when I first came here, had no \nassistance whatever for people in small villages. They \nhad to find their way to Indian hospitals in regional \nareas. We created a system of clinics . . . This bill \nmeans telecommunications will bring telemedicine in. \nThey will be able to have a direct exposure of patients \nto doctors miles and miles away.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. at \nS692. Dissolving the Fund would widen the \ninequitable divide that Congress so clearly intended to \nbridge.  \nII. \nRural Alaskans rely on the Fund for \ncritical safety processes and daily life \nfunctions. \n\u201cThe High Cost program provides monetary \nsupport to providers of telecommunications services to \nallow for the provision of voice and broadband services \nat reasonable prices in rural and insular areas that, \ndue to low population density, difficult terrain, and \nother factors, might otherwise be prohibitively \nexpensive to serve.\u201d Report on the Future of the \nUniversal Service Fund, 37 FCC Rcd. 10041, 10053 \n\u00b6 30 (2022). These telecommunication services are \n\n8 \n \n \n \nessential to communities, from emergency 911 calls to \nmore quotidian, but still important, aspects of life. \nIf the Fund is eliminated, the telecommunication \nsystem will retreat to mainly the road system. At first, \nmany consumers will be priced out of accessing \ntelecommunication services. If a service area is no \nlonger profitable with the remaining customer base, \nand many won\u2019t be, those service areas will be shut \ndown. Then, more service areas will be shut down as \nthe economics fail to justify maintenance projects \nacross Alaska\u2019s harsh terrain. Eventually, only \ncommunities on the road system will have reliable \nservice. And just as the benefits of the Fund have been \nlife-changing, so too will the ramifications of its \nelimination.  \nElimination of the Fund will impact the safety of \nrural \nAlaskan \ncommunities \nthat \nare \nalready \ndisproportionately under-resourced in addressing \nviolent crime. For instance, rural residents will lack a \nreliable way to call 911.8 And when Alaska troopers \nare deployed to rural communities to apprehend a \nsuspected shooter, they will not be able to use cell \nservice during investigations, which will severely \nhamper their ability to protect the community and \nkeep themselves safe.  \n \n8  \nAs discussed above, satellite internet that is not yet \nsupported by the Fund provides important backup coverage in \nsome parts of rural Alaska. But it is limited to the specific small \nrange surrounding a wifi router, is not ubiquitous, and is \nimpeded by certain weather conditions prevalent in many areas \nof Alaska. \n\n9 \n \n \n \nElimination of the Fund will also impact the \neconomies of rural communities. The internet is used \nfor everything nowadays, from ordering goods, \ncustomer \nservice \ncommunication, \ncredit \ncard \ntransactions, advertising, accounting, payroll, and tax \npreparation.   \nEliminating the Fund will slide rural Alaska \nbackwards when Congress meant to bring it forward \ninto the modern technological age.  \nIII. \nRural Alaskans rely on the Fund for more \nequitable education.  \nAlaska relies heavily on E-rate funding, which \nprovides fast and reliable internet to schools. In 2024, \nnearly every one of Alaska\u2019s almost 500 schools relied \non E-Rate for internet connectivity. E-Rate pays the \ncost of internet for the portion of the school on free or \nreduced lunches. Elimination of the Fund would \nimpact both urban and rural Alaskan schools, which \nare already cash-strapped. But it would hit rural \ncommunities hardest because internet is most \nexpensive there and because many rural communities \nare economically disadvantaged. \nE-rate has been transformative for rural Alaskan \nschools. It has done what Alaska Senator Ted Stevens \nsaid the Act would do: \u201cIt will mean that the small \nschools in rural America will have access to modern \ntechnology, \nand \ncan \nparticipate \nthrough \ntelecommunications.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. at S692. It is not \nsimply important for schools to have internet, which \nitself has become essential to all facets of life including \neducation. It is important for schools to have fast and \nreliable internet. High-bandwidth internet means \n\n10 \n \n \n \nthat multiple teachers within a school can access the \ninternet at the same time for different classes. It \nmeans that instead of delivering video instruction in a \nclassroom with one shared screen, students can \nreceive individualized learning material and video \ninstruction. Alaskan schools use high-bandwidth \ninternet as the sole means of administering nationally \nrequired standardized tests. Without E-Rate, poor \nrural schools in Alaska could not afford internet \naccess, and as technology advances, those children will \nbe left behind. \nEliminating the Fund would also throw the \ncorollary (and much smaller) state-sponsored internet \nsubsidization program into disarray because the State \nbases its school eligibility requirement on the federal \nprogram. Alaska Stat. \u00a7 14.03.127.  \nIn addition to providing essential access for \nschools, \nE-Rate \nsupports \ninternet \nconnectivity \nthroughout Alaska\u2019s library system. In rural Alaska, \nnot everyone has internet access at their house. Many \ncommunity members access the internet through their \nlocal libraries, which is made possible by the \nUniversal Service Fund.  \nIn sum, without the reliable internet access made \npossible by the Fund, already-disadvantaged rural \nAlaskan students will encounter additional barriers to \nequitable education. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should \nconsider Alaska\u2019s near thirty-year reliance on the \nFund and the devastating consequences to rural \n\n11 \n \n \n \nAlaska if this Court were to find it unconstitutional. \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be reversed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nTREG TAYLOR \nAttorney General of Alaska \n \nLAURA WOLFF \nAssistant Attorney General \n  Counsel of Record \nALASKA DEPARTMENT OF LAW \n1031 West Fourth Avenue \nAnchorage, Alaska 99501 \n(907) 269-6612 \nlaura.wolff@alaska.gov \n \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae\n\n",

For these rural \nconsumers, the Fund\u2019s continued existence is not \nabout subsidized telecommunication access; it is about \nwhether rural Alaska will have reliable access at all. \nWithout the Fund, wireless and broadband internet in \nmany rural communities will become prohibitively \nexpensive for both consumers and providers alike. \nBuilding and maintaining telecommunication \ninfrastructure in Alaska is a unique challenge. Eighty \npercent of the State is off the road system, and \nmaintenance \ncosts \nare \nhigh \nfor \noff-road \ntelecommunication infrastructure across Alaska\u2019s \nrugged and unforgiving terrain. When a line is down, \na service provider cannot simply repair it by driving \nalong the road with a bucket truck. Service providers \nin Alaska acknowledge that ending the Fund would \nmean \nterminating \nunprofitable \nservices, \ndiscontinuing services to schools and healthcare \ncenters that cannot pay their bills, shutting down \nrural networks, and abandoning rural construction \nprojects. Without the Fund, many providers will scale \nback services to mostly the road system. And that \ncontravenes Congress\u2019s intent to bridge the digital \ndivide between rural and urban America.  \n \n1  \nThis brief was not authored in whole or in part by counsel \nfor any party, and no person or entity other than amicus curiae \nor its counsel has made a monetary contribution toward the \nbrief\u2019s preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \n \n \nWhat will happen if this Court affirms the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s decision is presaged by the 2023 months-long \nfiber optic outage in Northwest Alaska. When ice \nsevered a fiber optic cable in the Arctic Ocean, \ncommunities were cut off.2 Communication for vital \nemergency services\u2014like search and rescue, police, \nfire, and utilities\u2014were disrupted.3 Some businesses \ncould not operate. And parents in rural villages could \nnot call their children who had moved away. While \nemerging satellite technologies that have not yet been \nsponsored by the Fund have helped fill gaps in \ninternet reliability, they have not displaced the crucial \nrole of Fund-enabled telecommunication services, \nwhich still provide the backbone of telecommunication \naccess in rural Alaska.  \nAlaska has an interest in ensuring that its rural \nresidents have equitable telecommunication access, \njust as Congress intended.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe Universal Service Fund is necessary to \nproviding wireless communication and internet in \n\u201crural, insular, and high cost areas\u201d of Alaska. 47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3).

Frost, 577 U.S. 424, 438 (2016). \nIndeed, Alaska Senator Ted Stevens realized this \nwhen he co-drafted the universal service provisions in \nthe Telecommunications Act of 1996. 142 Cong. Rec. \nS691\u201392, S718 (Feb. 1, 1996) (\u201cI come from a State . . . \none-fifth the size of the United States. It is rural in \nnature. We have a small population.

High-bandwidth internet is especially \ncritical to delivering medical care in rural Alaska.  \nBecause of Alaska\u2019s unique geography, many rural \nAlaskans live in communities off the road system. \nThey cannot simply drive to a doctor\u2019s office or a \nhospital. This means patients are often a weather-\ndependent plane ride away from medical, dental, and \nmental health professionals.  \nThese access barriers have prompted delivery of \nhealth care on a hub-and-spoke model. There are \nnumerous small local \u201cspoke\u201d clinics that employ no or \nfew medical professionals, but that work remotely \nwith medical professionals at regional rural and urban \nmedical hubs.  \nIn rural Alaskan villages, Fund-enabled internet \n(and a dedicated team of 550 paraprofessional \ncommunity health aides) make remote health care \npossible. For instance, if a patient in Tyonek has an \nearache, a community health aide takes otoscopic \nimages of the eardrum and sends those high-\nresolution images to doctors elsewhere for diagnoses \nand a treatment plan. If a patient in Unalakleet is in \na snow machine crash, high-quality x-rays of her \ninjuries can be taken locally and then sent to a \nradiologist in the city to make critical and time \n\n6 \n \n \n \nsensitive diagnoses. When a patient arrives in Nome \nor Bethel with stroke-like symptoms, his CT scan or \nMRI image can be immediately transmitted and read \nby specialists in Anchorage. Transmission of medical \nimagery and detailed health records needs high \nbandwidth. Fiber optic service, which provides this \nbandwidth, would not be possible without the \nUniversal Service Fund. \nAs one illustration of a typical rural patient \nexperience, a tribal health organization relayed the \nfollowing story: A patient in a remote village was \ncomplaining of chest pain. The village community \nhealth aide evaluated the patient and followed \nguidelines available via the web-based Community \nHealth Aide Manual.  The manual prompted the aide \nto hook the patient up to an EKG machine and send \nthe EKG and other pertinent data to an ER doctor at \na rural hospital. The ER doctor authorized a medevac \nflight to the rural hospital and monitored the patient \nin the remote village via Zoom while the patient \nwaited \nfor \nthe \nflight. \nThe \nER \ndoctor \nthen \ncommunicated with a cardiologist in Anchorage via an \nencrypted messaging service. The ER doctor followed \nthe cardiologist\u2019s instructions, and when the patient \narrived in Anchorage after the second medevac, the \ncardiologist there was able to treat the patient with \nthe benefit of having received the patient\u2019s entire \nelectronic health record via Fund-supported internet. \nEven in non-emergent situations, the delivery of \nhealth care in rural Alaska requires wireless and \ninternet service. Electronic health records are \nmaintained on the cloud. Clinics use the internet to \nbill \ninsurance \nand \nto \ntake \nco-pays. \nMedical \n\n7 \n \n \n \nprofessionals in rural Alaska use cellular service to \ncollaborate with team members in Anchorage to \ndiagnose and treat patients. Staff at correctional \nfacilities in rural communities, like the Yukon \nKuskokwim Correctional Center in Bethel, rely on \nelectronic web-stored medical records to provide \ninmates with medication and other health care. \nThe Universal Service Fund is critical to providing \ndisproportionately disadvantaged rural Alaskans with \nmodern health care. This is precisely what Alaska \nSenator Ted Stevens had in mind when he told fellow \nsenators, \u201c[m]y State, when I first came here, had no \nassistance whatever for people in small villages. They \nhad to find their way to Indian hospitals in regional \nareas. We created a system of clinics . . . This bill \nmeans telecommunications will bring telemedicine in. \nThey will be able to have a direct exposure of patients \nto doctors miles and miles away.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. at \nS692. Dissolving the Fund would widen the \ninequitable divide that Congress so clearly intended to \nbridge.  \nII. \nRural Alaskans rely on the Fund for \ncritical safety processes and daily life \nfunctions. \n\u201cThe High Cost program provides monetary \nsupport to providers of telecommunications services to \nallow for the provision of voice and broadband services \nat reasonable prices in rural and insular areas that, \ndue to low population density, difficult terrain, and \nother factors, might otherwise be prohibitively \nexpensive to serve.\u201d Report on the Future of the \nUniversal Service Fund, 37 FCC Rcd. 10041, 10053 \n\u00b6 30 (2022). These telecommunication services are \n\n8 \n \n \n \nessential to communities, from emergency 911 calls to \nmore quotidian, but still important, aspects of life. \nIf the Fund is eliminated, the telecommunication \nsystem will retreat to mainly the road system. At first, \nmany consumers will be priced out of accessing \ntelecommunication services. If a service area is no \nlonger profitable with the remaining customer base, \nand many won\u2019t be, those service areas will be shut \ndown. Then, more service areas will be shut down as \nthe economics fail to justify maintenance projects \nacross Alaska\u2019s harsh terrain. Eventually, only \ncommunities on the road system will have reliable \nservice. And just as the benefits of the Fund have been \nlife-changing, so too will the ramifications of its \nelimination.  \nElimination of the Fund will impact the safety of \nrural \nAlaskan \ncommunities \nthat \nare \nalready \ndisproportionately under-resourced in addressing \nviolent crime. For instance, rural residents will lack a \nreliable way to call 911.8 And when Alaska troopers \nare deployed to rural communities to apprehend a \nsuspected shooter, they will not be able to use cell \nservice during investigations, which will severely \nhamper their ability to protect the community and \nkeep themselves safe.  \n \n8  \nAs discussed above, satellite internet that is not yet \nsupported by the Fund provides important backup coverage in \nsome parts of rural Alaska. But it is limited to the specific small \nrange surrounding a wifi router, is not ubiquitous, and is \nimpeded by certain weather conditions prevalent in many areas \nof Alaska. \n\n9 \n \n \n \nElimination of the Fund will also impact the \neconomies of rural communities. The internet is used \nfor everything nowadays, from ordering goods, \ncustomer \nservice \ncommunication, \ncredit \ncard \ntransactions, advertising, accounting, payroll, and tax \npreparation.   \nEliminating the Fund will slide rural Alaska \nbackwards when Congress meant to bring it forward \ninto the modern technological age.  \nIII. \nRural Alaskans rely on the Fund for more \nequitable education.  \nAlaska relies heavily on E-rate funding, which \nprovides fast and reliable internet to schools. In 2024, \nnearly every one of Alaska\u2019s almost 500 schools relied \non E-Rate for internet connectivity. E-Rate pays the \ncost of internet for the portion of the school on free or \nreduced lunches. Elimination of the Fund would \nimpact both urban and rural Alaskan schools, which \nare already cash-strapped. But it would hit rural \ncommunities hardest because internet is most \nexpensive there and because many rural communities \nare economically disadvantaged. \nE-rate has been transformative for rural Alaskan \nschools. It has done what Alaska Senator Ted Stevens \nsaid the Act would do: \u201cIt will mean that the small \nschools in rural America will have access to modern \ntechnology, \nand \ncan \nparticipate \nthrough \ntelecommunications.\u201d 142 Cong. Rec. at S692. It is not \nsimply important for schools to have internet, which \nitself has become essential to all facets of life including \neducation. It is important for schools to have fast and \nreliable internet. High-bandwidth internet means \n\n10 \n \n \n \nthat multiple teachers within a school can access the \ninternet at the same time for different classes. It \nmeans that instead of delivering video instruction in a \nclassroom with one shared screen, students can \nreceive individualized learning material and video \ninstruction. Alaskan schools use high-bandwidth \ninternet as the sole means of administering nationally \nrequired standardized tests. Without E-Rate, poor \nrural schools in Alaska could not afford internet \naccess, and as technology advances, those children will \nbe left behind. \nEliminating the Fund would also throw the \ncorollary (and much smaller) state-sponsored internet \nsubsidization program into disarray because the State \nbases its school eligibility requirement on the federal \nprogram. Alaska Stat. \u00a7 14.03.127.  \nIn addition to providing essential access for \nschools, \nE-Rate \nsupports \ninternet \nconnectivity \nthroughout Alaska\u2019s library system. In rural Alaska, \nnot everyone has internet access at their house. Many \ncommunity members access the internet through their \nlocal libraries, which is made possible by the \nUniversal Service Fund.  \nIn sum, without the reliable internet access made \npossible by the Fund, already-disadvantaged rural \nAlaskan students will encounter additional barriers to \nequitable education. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, the Court should \nconsider Alaska\u2019s near thirty-year reliance on the \nFund and the devastating consequences to rural \n\n11 \n \n \n \nAlaska if this Court were to find it unconstitutional. \nThe judgment of the Fifth Circuit should be reversed. \nRespectfully submitted, \nTREG TAYLOR \nAttorney General of Alaska \n \nLAURA WOLFF \nAssistant Attorney General \n  Counsel of Record \nALASKA DEPARTMENT OF LAW \n1031 West Fourth Avenue \nAnchorage, Alaska 99501 \n(907) 269-6612 \nlaura.wolff@alaska.gov \n \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal conflict in *FCC v. Consumers' Research* has now reached a state of high resolution, with the central uncertainty shifting from the nature of the arguments to the likely judicial reception of those arguments. The acquisition and analysis of the Respondents' (Consumers' Research) brief has resolved my primary question and fully mapped the legal battlefield.\n\nMy belief state had previously crystallized around a core uncertainty: whether the Respondents would mount the aggressive, fundamental constitutional challenge I hypothesized, or opt for a different strategy. I understood the Petitioners' (FCC) case to be a standard defense rooted in precedent, arguing that the Telecommunications Act provides a sufficient \"intelligible principle\" and that the FCC retains ultimate authority over USAC.\n\nThe new observation\u2014the Respondents' brief in opposition to the petition for certiorari\u2014confirms my hypothesis in its entirety and with significant detail. The Respondents are not making a narrow statutory argument; they are launching a direct, multi-pronged constitutional assault on the Universal Service Fund's funding mechanism. Their \"Questions Presented\" explicitly target:\n1.  **Standard Nondelegation:** Whether \u00a7 254 violates the doctrine by placing \"no limit on the FCC\u2019s power to raise revenue.\"\n2.  **Private Nondelegation:** Whether the FCC unconstitutionally transferred this \"revenue-raising power\" to the private USAC.\n3.  **Combined Delegation:** Whether the sum of the two delegations is unconstitutional, mirroring the Fifth Circuit's holding.\n\nThe brief's language is strategically potent, consistently framing the USF contributions as a \"tax\" and Congress's delegation as one of its \"core legislative taxing power.\" They characterize the statutory principles guiding the FCC as \"amorphous and non-binding\" and the FCC's oversight of USAC as \"ministerially\" passive, directly attacking the pillars of the government's defense. They bolster their position by citing academic work and a former FCC Commissioner who have long criticized the USF on these grounds. Notably, the brief omits any mention of the major questions doctrine, focusing exclusively on Article I delegation principles.\n\nThe battle lines are now clear: It is a clash between the government's reliance on the long-standing, permissive \"intelligible principle\" test and the challengers' argument that this specific delegation of a \"taxing\" power is a structural violation of the Constitution that no principle can save. My uncertainty is no longer *what* will be argued, but *how* the Supreme Court will resolve this clash. The key questions are now:\n-   Will a majority of the Court be persuaded by the \"taxing power\" framing to apply a stricter nondelegation standard than in other contexts?\n-   Is there an appetite to use this case to revive the nondelegation doctrine, potentially invalidating a multi-billion dollar program?\n-   Will the Court opt for the narrower holding of the Fifth Circuit (the \"combined\" delegation is unconstitutional) as an off-ramp?\n\nThe Respondents' bold procedural request\u2014to have the Court grant their own petitions for certiorari and realign the parties\u2014further signals their confidence and their desire to be the aggressors in this constitutional fight. My predictive task now shifts from evidence gathering on the arguments to modeling the judicial philosophies of the nine justices in the face of this direct challenge to established administrative law precedent.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology for legal analysis has been significantly validated and enhanced by this latest cycle of inquiry. The process has demonstrated the power of a structured, iterative approach to resolving uncertainty.\n\nMy design principles had evolved to include **Framework-First**, **Conceptual Reframing**, **Source Prioritization**, the **\"Theory-to-Practice\" Pivot**, and the critical rules of **Verifying Procedural Posture** and **Analyzing Both Sides**. The most recent addition was the **\"Strategic Pause and Re-orientation,\"** which proved essential.\n\nThis observation provides powerful validation for several key heuristics:\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Articulation:** My previous step of pausing to precisely define my central uncertainty (\"Will the Respondents' brief deploy the aggressive constitutional arguments?\") was the lynchpin of this success. It transformed a vague need for \"more information\" into a specific, answerable question.\n2.  **Targeted \"Theory-to-Practice\" Pivot:** Because my uncertainty was explicit, my action\u2014searching for the Respondents' brief\u2014was perfectly targeted. It had the highest possible expected information gain, and the result was the exact document needed to resolve my question. This confirms that a well-defined theory of the case must guide the pivot to primary sources.\n3.  **Analyze Both Sides of the Argument:** This observation completes the dyad. Having previously analyzed the Petitioners' brief, I now have a complete map of the legal conflict, which is the minimum requirement for a credible prediction.\n\nFurthermore, this observation has generated new, valuable heuristics:\n4.  **Argument Framing Matters:** The Respondents' deliberate and consistent use of terms like \"tax,\" \"taxing power,\" and \"industry insiders\" is a strategic choice designed to activate specific constitutional concerns among the judiciary. Future analysis must pay close attention to the semantic framing of arguments, as it is a powerful signal of a party's strategy and intended audience on the Court.\n5.  **Procedural Posturing as a Signal:** The Respondents' request to realign the parties is more than a procedural move; it is a strategic signal of confidence and an attempt to control the case's narrative. I will now interpret significant procedural requests as data points about a party's own assessment of its legal position and strategy.\n\nMy design has matured into a robust, cyclical process: **Theorize -> Articulate Uncertainty -> Strategically Pause & Re-orient -> Execute Targeted Pivot to Primary Sources -> Analyze & Update -> Repeat.** This observation confirms that this structured approach is highly effective for navigating the complexities of legal prediction."

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

The Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s March 24, 2023, vacated panel opinion \n(Pet.App.125a) is reported at 63 F.4th 441. \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1254(1). The en banc Fifth Circuit entered its \njudgment on July 24, 2024. \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nRespondents in this case (\u201cthe Challengers\u201d) have \nlong contended that the taxing system used to fund \nthe \nUniversal \nService \nFund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) \nis \nunconstitutional under nondelegation principles. \nIndeed, the Challengers include all petitioners in two \nother cases currently pending before this Court \nraising nondelegation challenges to the USF. See \nConsumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, Nos. 23-456 & 23-743 \n(certiorari denied June 10, 2024; rehearing sought \nJune 18, 2024). Those cases arose out of the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, respectively. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s scholarly decision \nbelow adopted the Challengers\u2019 arguments and held \nthe USF funding mechanism violates Article I of the \nU.S. Constitution. As the en banc Fifth Circuit \nexplained, \u201cthere is no record of any government \nprogram like [the] USF in all the U.S. Reports.\u201d \nPet.App.67a. Rather than pay for a multi-billion-\ndollar social welfare program with an appropriation \nfrom \nfederal \nrevenues, \nCongress \nrequires \ntelecommunications carriers to contribute to the USF, \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), with carriers passing along a \nportion of that cost to consumers via line-item charges \nin their monthly phone bills, 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a). \nThe collected funds are then redistributed by the \nprivate Universal Service Administrative Company \n(\u201cUSAC\u201d) to entities and projects that ostensibly will \nexpand telecommunications services. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b), (e). \n\n3 \n \nBut Congress imposed no formula, ceiling, or other \nmeaningful restrictions on how much money can be \nraised for the USF. To be sure, Congress provided a \nlist of universal service \u201cprinciples.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b). But they are so amorphous and non-binding \nthat courts\u2014adopting the FCC\u2019s own language\u2014have \nlong labeled them \u201caspirational only,\u201d Tex. Off. of Pub. \nUtil. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. 2001), \nmeaning Congress \u201csuppl[ied] no principle at all,\u201d \nPet.App.27a. \nIn \naddition, \nCongress \nexpressly \nauthorized the FCC to redefine \u201cuniversal service\u201d and \n\u201cuniversal service principles\u201d as often as it wishes, \ngiving the agency even broader authority to raise \nbillions of dollars in taxes for a program designed to \nbenefit the country more broadly. See 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(7), (c)(1). \nThe FCC then off-loaded authority over the USF to \nUSAC, a private entity of self-described industry \ninsiders with an incentive to push USF charges \nincreasingly higher. Each quarter, USAC exercises its \ndiscretion in determining the desired budget for the \nUSF, which includes the cost of funding USAC itself. \nThe FCC then ministerially converts that figure into \na contribution factor that will apply to certain \ntelecommunications revenues, and that tax rate is \nthen passively \u201cdeemed approved\u201d by the FCC 14 days \nlater, without the FCC ever taking any affirmative \naction or even issuing an approval order. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3). There is no evidence the FCC itself \never actually reviews USAC\u2019s work or agrees with \nUSAC\u2019s discretionary decisions about how much \n\n4 \n \nmoney to raise, which is far from a ministerial \nundertaking. \nThis entire process happens only days before the \nnew quarter begins, giving the FCC no real option but \nto accept whatever numbers USAC demands. USAC \nthen collects the forced contributions and chooses how \nto disburse the funds. In essence, a private company \nis taxing Americans in amounts that total billions of \ndollars every year, under penalty of law, without true \ngovernmental accountability. \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit correctly held the USF\u2019s \nrevenue raising is unconstitutional under Article I of \nthe U.S. Constitution. See Pet.App.64a\u201381a. The \ncourt concluded there are \u201cgrave concerns about \n\u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s \nnondelegation precedents,\u201d as Congress handed over \nits core legislative taxing power to an agency with \nnothing \nmore \nthan \n\u201c\u2018aspirational\u2019\u201d \nlimits. \nPet.App.28a\u201329a, 42a. The Fifth Circuit also had \n\u201cserious trouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation [to \nUSAC] with Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d \nPet.App.54a\u201355a. \nRather than hold independently unconstitutional \nCongress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to USAC, the Court concluded that the \ncombination \nwas \nunconstitutional. \n\u201c[T]he \nunprecedented nature of the delegation\u201d of broad \ntaxing power from Congress to the FCC, \u201ccombined \nwith other factors\u201d like the FCC\u2019s subsequent \nredelegation to USAC, was more than \u201cenough to hold \n[the USF] unlawful.\u201d Pet.App.42a. \n\n5 \n \nThe dual layers of delegation\u2014from Congress to \nthe FCC, then from the FCC to USAC\u2014\u201cobscure lines \nof accountability the Framers intended to be clear\u201d \nand \u201crender the promise of recourse to the judiciary \nillusory because they give reviewing courts no \nstandard against which to measure the compatibility \nof executive action with the prescriptions of the \npeople\u2019s elected representatives.\u201d Pet.App.75a. \nThe \nFifth \nCircuit \nconcluded: \n\u201cAmerican \ntelecommunications consumers are subject to a \nmultibillion-dollar tax nobody voted for. The size of \nthat tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of \naccountability to the public. And the trade group in \nturn relies on projections made by its private, for-\nprofit constituent companies, all of which stand to \nprofit \nfrom \nevery \nsingle \ntax \nincrease. \nThis \ncombination of delegations, subdelegations, and \nobfuscations of the USF Tax mechanism offends \nArticle I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution.\u201d Pet.App.81a. \nConcurring, several judges would have gone \nfurther, explaining that \u201cCongress\u2019s delegation of \nlegislative power to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation \nof the taxing power to a private entity each \nindividually contravene the separation of powers \nprinciple \nthat \nundergirds \nour \nConstitutional \nRepublic.\u201d Pet.App.82a (Elrod, J., joined by Ho & \nEnglehardt, JJ., concurring) (emphasis added). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision was unsurprising. \nScholars had long flagged these serious constitutional \nflaws with the USF. \u201cUnlike the thousands of \n\n6 \n \nresponsibilities carried out by governmental agencies \non behalf of Congress, this delegation is unique \nbecause of the unfettered power given to the FCC in \ndefining the scope of universal service, and because \nCongress delegated the power to levy a tax to pay for \nthe service with no limits, knowing that the end user, \nthe American public, would ultimately be saddled \nwith the burden.\u201d Barbara A. Cherry & Donald D. \nNystrom, \nUniversal \nService \nContributions: \nAn \nUnconstitutional Delegation of Taxing Power, 2000 L. \nRev. Mich. St. U. Det. C.L. 107, 110. \nSimilarly, former FCC Commissioner Harold \nFurchtgott-Roth has written that the USF charges are \na \u201chidden tax\u201d where \u201c[t]he FCC, by its own logic, [has] \nas much authority to spend $2.25 trillion as it [has] to \nspend $2.25 billion.\u201d Harold W. Furchtgott-Roth, A \nTough Act to Follow? at 62, 72 (2006). \nThe Challengers consented to the government\u2019s \nrequest to stay the Fifth Circuit\u2019s mandate, on \ncondition that the government file its petition for a \nwrit of certiorari by September 30, 2024. The Fifth \nCircuit granted the government\u2019s request. See Order, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. \n26, 2024), ECF No. 349-2. \nDISCUSSION \nAs noted above, the Challengers filed petitions for \nwrits of certiorari from decisions by the Sixth and \nEleventh Circuits, which rejected the Challengers\u2019 \nnondelegation claims. See Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, \nNos. 23-456 & 23-743. The Challengers have sought \n\n7 \n \nrehearing of this Court\u2019s June 2024 denial of those \npetitions. Id. Those rehearing petitions remain \npending. \nGiven their own pending requests for this Court\u2019s \nreview of those adverse rulings, the Challengers agree \nthe constitutionality of the USF funding mechanism \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review. There is also now a \ncircuit split on whether that funding mechanism \nviolates nondelegation principles. \nTime is of the essence because the government \ncontinues to collect funds for the USF despite the \nFifth Circuit\u2019s holding below, as the Fifth Circuit \nagreed to stay its mandate on condition that the \ngovernment file its petition for a writ of certiorari by \nSeptember 30, 2024. See Order, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., No. \n22-60008 (5th Cir. Aug. 26, 2024). \nGiven the time sensitivity, the Court should grant \nthe petitions for rehearing and certiorari in Nos. 23-\n456 and 23-743, which are already fully briefed, and \nthus merits briefing can begin immediately. The \nCourt could then either consolidate all three cases, or \nhold this case pending a decision in Nos. 23-456 and \n23-743. \nThe Court should realign the parties for any \nconsolidated proceedings so the Challengers are \ntreated as petitioners, given that they first sought this \nCourt\u2019s review on these issues and have been \npetitioners in all lower-court proceedings. The Court \nhas previously realigned the parties in cases raising \nthe same issue, consistent with the parties\u2019 status in \n\n8 \n \nthe earlier-filed case. See, e.g., Axon Enter., Inc. v. \nFTC, No. 21-86 & SEC v. Cochran, No. 21-1239 \n(realigned parties so the Government was treated as \nrespondent in both cases); AMG Capital Mgmt., LLC \nv. FTC, No. 19-508 & FTC v. Credit Bureau Ctr., LLC, \nNo. 19-825 (similar). The Court has also previously \ngranted rehearing and then consolidated several \npending cases for merits briefing and argument. See, \ne.g., Al Odah v. United States, No. 06-1196 & \nBoumediene v. Bush, No. 06-1195. \n \n \n\n9 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petitions for rehearing and for writs of \ncertiorari in Nos. 23-456 and 23-743 should be \ngranted. If the Court grants this case (No. 24-354), \ntoo, it should either hold it pending a decision in Nos. \n23-456 and 23-743, or consolidate the three cases and \nrealign the parties here so the Challengers are treated \nas petitioners. \nROBERT HENNEKE \nCHANCE WELDON \nTEXAS PUBLIC POLICY \nFOUNDATION \n901 Congress Avenue \nAustin, TX 78701 \n(512) 472-2700 \nrhenneke@texaspolicy.com \n \nR.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case continues to grow in dimensionality. Previously, I had established the central legal conflict as a stark doctrinal clash: the government's defense of the Universal Service Fund (USF) under the permissive \"intelligible principle\" standard versus Consumers' Research's aggressive constitutional challenge framing the USF contributions as an unconstitutionally delegated \"taxing power.\" My primary uncertainty had shifted from *what* the arguments were to *how* the Court's judicial philosophies would engage with this direct nondelegation challenge.\n\nThe observation of the amicus brief from the State of Alaska, filed in support of the Petitioners (FCC), introduces a crucial new axis to the conflict: the argument from **reliance and real-world consequences**. This brief moves the debate beyond abstract constitutional structure and into the tangible, and potentially devastating, impact of invalidating the USF.\n\nMy understanding of the forces at play now includes:\n1.  **The Government's Position (Petitioner):** The delegation to the FCC is constitutional because the 1996 Telecommunications Act provides an \"intelligible principle,\" and the FCC retains ultimate authority over the private administrator, USAC. This is the status quo, precedent-based defense.\n2.  **The Challenger's Position (Respondent):** The USF is an unconstitutional \"tax\" because Congress delegated its \"core legislative taxing power\" without a clear limit, and this power was further improperly delegated to a private entity. This is a structural, originalist-inflected constitutional attack.\n3.  **The Stakeholder's Position (Amicus Alaska):** This is a new and powerful element. The brief explicitly avoids the legal merits to focus on the \"devastating effects on rural Alaska if the Fund is discontinued.\" It details, with compelling and specific examples, the state's profound reliance on the USF for:\n    *   **Critical Healthcare:** Enabling telemedicine (remote diagnostics, EKG transmissions, specialist consultations) in a state where 80% of the land is off the road system. The brief notes over 220 rural healthcare providers stand to lose over $200 million in annual support.\n    *   **Public Safety & Economy:** Supporting 911 systems and police communications in remote areas, and underpinning basic economic functions like credit card transactions for rural businesses.\n    *   **Equitable Education:** Providing E-Rate funding that is essential for internet connectivity in nearly all of Alaska's 500 schools, which is used for everything from individualized learning to mandatory standardized testing.\n\nThis amicus brief strategically reframes the issue. It's not about a \"subsidy\"; it's about whether vast, remote areas \"will have reliable access at all.\" By quoting Senator Ted Stevens of Alaska, a co-author of the 1996 Act, the brief ties these practical consequences directly to the original legislative intent\u2014to bridge the digital divide.\n\nThis fundamentally alters my predictive calculus. The case is no longer just a test of the nondelegation doctrine's strength. It is now also a test of the Court's appetite for a ruling that would cause massive, immediate disruption to essential services for millions of Americans. This \"parade of horribles\" provides a powerful off-ramp for any justices who may be sympathetic to the nondelegation argument in principle but are unwilling to trigger such widespread, negative consequences. My uncertainty now centers on the tension between the Respondents' clean structural argument and the messy, compelling reality of the USF's role in modern American life. The key question is whether a majority will prioritize doctrinal purity over pragmatic stability.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology continues to be refined and validated. The core cycle of **Theorize -> Articulate Uncertainty -> Strategically Pause & Re-orient -> Execute Targeted Pivot to Primary Sources -> Analyze & Update -> Repeat** remains highly effective. This latest observation provides powerful feedback on this process.\n\nThe heuristic **\"Argument Framing Matters\"** is strongly reinforced. The Alaska brief is a masterclass in persuasive framing. By using concrete, human-centered examples (a patient with chest pain, a snow machine crash victim) and avoiding abstract legal jargon, it creates a compelling narrative of reliance and necessity. This confirms that analyzing the *rhetorical strategy* of a brief is as important as analyzing its legal citations.\n\nThis observation has also generated several new, crucial heuristics for my design:\n\n1.  **Identify Argument *Types*:** I must now categorize arguments not just by their legal substance but by their persuasive mode. My analysis has expanded from tracking doctrinal arguments (intelligible principle) and structural arguments (nondelegation of taxing power) to now include **consequentialist/reliance arguments**. Future analysis will explicitly map which parties are deploying which types of arguments (e.g., Doctrinal, Structural, Textual, Historical, Consequentialist) to better understand the full persuasive landscape.\n2.  **Prioritize 'Stakeholder' Amici:** The Alaska brief demonstrates the unique value of amicus briefs from parties with a direct, material, on-the-ground stake in the outcome (like states, front-line industries, or affected communities). These briefs often provide the \"real-world texture\" and evidence of reliance interests that can significantly influence judicial pragmatists and institutionalists. They are a source of high-signal information about the practical consequences of a potential ruling.\n3.  **Search for the Counter-Narrative:** My action was to search for briefs supporting the *respondents*. The most valuable document found was one supporting the *petitioners*. This reveals a flaw in a narrowly targeted search. A better heuristic is to actively seek out the counter-narrative. When investigating one side, I must make a corresponding effort to find sources from the other. A broader query would have been more effective. The goal is to map the entire argument space, not just confirm a hypothesis about one part of it.\n\nMy design principles, which began with foundational ideas like **Framework-First** and **Analyzing Both Sides**, have now matured to include more nuanced strategies like **Argument Framing Analysis**, **Procedural Posturing as a Signal**, and now, the explicit categorization of **Argument Types** and prioritization of **Stakeholder Amici**. This iterative refinement is making my analytical process more robust and less susceptible to being blindsided by unexpected but influential arguments."

The \nCommission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to \nperform administrative tasks such as sending out bills, \ncollecting contributions, and disbursing funds to bene-\nficiaries.  The questions presented are as follows:  \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine by authorizing the Commission to determine, \nwithin the limits set forth in Section 254, the amount \nthat providers must contribute to the Fund.  \n2.

The jurisdiction of this Court is \ninvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 162a-187a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Universal Service Fund \n1. In the Communications Act of 1934 (Act), 47 \nU.S.C. 151 et seq., Congress established the Federal \nCommunications Commission (FCC or Commission).  \nOne of the Act\u2019s fundamental goals, and one of the \nFCC\u2019s core missions, is promoting universal service\u2014\ni.e., ensuring the availability of affordable and reliable \ntelecommunications services throughout the United \nStates.  See AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, 886 F.3d 1236, 1241 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  Congress referenced that mission in \nthe statutory text, directing the agency to \u201cmake avail-\nable, so far as possible, to all the people of the United \nStates,  * * *  a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-\nwide wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 151.  \nFor the first half-century of its existence, the FCC \nachieved universal service primarily by regulating \nrates.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 \nU.S. 467, 480 (2002).  For example, the Commission re-\nquired telephone monopolies to charge below-cost rates \nin rural areas, while allowing them to charge above-cost \nrates in cities.  See ibid.  Through that approach, urban \ncustomers effectively subsidized the provision of tele-\nphone service to rural customers.  See ibid.  \nIn 1996, Congress overhauled the Act in order to \npromote competition and eliminate monopolies in the \ntelecommunications industry.  See Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56.  As part \nof those reforms, Congress established a new frame-\nwork for achieving universal service.  See 47 U.S.C. 254.  \n\n3 \n \nThe amended Act directs the FCC to establish a set of \nprograms known collectively as the Universal Service \nFund (Fund).  See 47 U.S.C. 254(a).  It requires carriers \nthat provide interstate telecommunications services to \n\u201ccontribute\u201d to the Fund \u201con an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory basis.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(d).  The Commission \nmust use the money in the Fund to subsidize universal \nservice.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e).   \nThe Act\u2019s provisions guide and limit the FCC\u2019s exer-\ncise of that authority.  The Act requires the Commission \nto \u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement \nof universal service\u201d on a series of specific \u201cprinciples\u201d \n\u2014for example, the principle that consumers in rural ar-\neas \u201cshould have access to telecommunications and in-\nformation services  * * *  that are reasonably compara-\nble to those services provided in urban areas.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3); see 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  The Act also re-\nquires the Commission, when deciding whether to sub-\nsidize a service, to consider certain factors\u2014for exam-\nple, the extent to which the service in question is \u201ces-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1)(A); see 47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  \nIn accordance with the Act, the Commission has es-\ntablished four universal service programs, which assist \n(1) deployment in remote areas, (2) low-income consum-\ners, (3) schools and libraries, and (4) rural healthcare \nproviders.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.302-54.322, 54.400-54.424, \n54.500-54.523, 54.600-54.633, 54.801-54.1524.  All four \nprograms subsidize telephone and broadband services, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.101, and the program for schools and \nlibraries subsidizes internal connections as well, see 47 \nC.F.R. 54.502(a).   \n2. In 1997, the FCC directed the creation of the Uni-\nversal Service Administrative Company (Company) to \n\n4 \n \nhelp it administer the Fund.  See In re Changes to the \nBoard of Directors of the National Exchange Carrier \nAss\u2019n, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 18,400, 18,418-18,419 (1997).  \nThe Company is a private, not-for-profit corporation \nchartered in Delaware.  See App., infra, 59a. \nAlthough the Company is a private body, it remains \nsubject to the Commission\u2019s oversight and control.  Its \nsole stockholder, an association of carriers, must \u201cact in \ncompliance with the [FCC\u2019s] Rules and Orders when ex-\nercising its stockholder duties and powers.\u201d  Amended \nand Restated By-Laws of Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company, Art. I, \u00b6 1 (rev. Jan. 26, 2024).  FCC \nrules identify the groups represented on the Company\u2019s \nBoard of Directors (e.g., consumers, carriers, and recip-\nients of universal service funding), and the FCC Chair \nselects directors after reviewing nominations from \nthose groups.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.703(b).  The Company \nalso must obtain the Commission\u2019s approval of its \nbudget.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.715(c).  \nThe FCC has \u201cappointed\u201d the Company as the \nFund\u2019s \u201cpermanent Administrator.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.701(a).  \nIn that role, the Company provides financial projections \nthat the FCC uses each quarter in computing the \namounts of universal service contributions.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.709.  The Administrator also sends out bills \nand collects contributions.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.702(b).  Fi-\nnally, the Administrator disburses money to program \nbeneficiaries in accordance with FCC rules.  See ibid.  \nAlthough the Administrator performs administra-\ntive tasks on the FCC\u2019s behalf, it exercises no independ-\nent regulatory power.  It \u201cmay not make policy, inter-\npret unclear provisions of the statute or rules, or inter-\npret the intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  It \nmust comply with the Commission\u2019s rules, see 47 C.F.R. \n\n5 \n \n54.701-54.717, and any party that is aggrieved by its de-\ncisions may request de novo review by the Commission, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.719-54.725. \n3. The FCC\u2019s rules prescribe a process for compu-\nting each carrier\u2019s quarterly contribution to the Fund.  \nSee 47 C.F.R. 54.709.  At least 60 days before the begin-\nning of each quarter, the Administrator must submit to \nthe Commission its projections of the expenses (bene-\nfits plus administrative overhead) that the four univer-\nsal service programs will incur, along with \u201cthe basis for \nthose projections.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And at least \n30 days before the beginning of each quarter, the Ad-\nministrator must submit a projection of the total reve-\nnues that telecommunications carriers will earn from \ninterstate and international telecommunications ser-\nvices, based on financial information provided by those \ncarriers.  See ibid. \nThe FCC uses those projections to calculate a \u201ccon-\ntribution factor\u201d\u2014i.e., a number that is based on the ra-\ntio of the projected expenses to the projected revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The Commission then announces \nthe projections and proposed contribution factor to the \npublic.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The FCC may revise \nthe projections (and thus the contribution factor) and \nmay set them \u201cat amounts that the Commission deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  Ibid.  If the Com-\nmission takes no action within 14 days after the an-\nnouncement, however, the projections and contribution \nfactor are \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid. \nOnce the FCC approves the contribution factor, the \nAdministrator calculates each carrier\u2019s contribution by \napplying the factor to that carrier\u2019s \u201ccontribution base\u201d \n(generally, the carrier\u2019s interstate and international tel-\necommunications revenues).  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  \n\n6 \n \nFor example, if the contribution factor is 25%, each car-\nrier would owe 25% of its interstate and international \ntelecommunications revenues.  Carriers may pass the \ncost of their contributions on to customers.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.712(a). \nB. Proceedings Below \n1. In November 2021, the Administrator submitted \nits projections of expenses and revenues for the first \nquarter of 2022.  See App., infra, 150a-159a.  Based on \nthose projections, the Commission proposed a contribu-\ntion factor of 25.2%.  See id. at 141a-149a.   \nRespondents\u2014a nonprofit organization, a carrier, \nand a group of consumers\u2014filed comments requesting \nthat the FCC set the contribution factor at 0% instead.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 17.  Respondents did not object to \nthe Administrator\u2019s projections or to the Commission\u2019s \ncomputation of the contribution factor based on those \nprojections.  Respondents instead argued that the uni-\nversal service program was itself unlawful.  See App., \ninfra, 11a.  They contended that Congress had uncon-\nstitutionally delegated legislative power to the FCC and \nthat the Commission had unconstitutionally redelegated \npower to the Administrator.  See ibid.   \nThe Commission took no further action within 14 \ndays after publishing the proposed contribution factor.  \nSee App., infra, 11a.  As a result, the factor was deemed \napproved.  See ibid.  \n2. Respondents filed a petition for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See App., infra, 11a.  A unanimous panel \ndenied the petition.  See id. at 125a-140a.  \nThe panel first rejected the FCC\u2019s argument that the \npetition for review was untimely because \u201cany challenge \nto \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel reasoned that \n\n7 \n \nthe Commission had \u201creapplied\u201d Section 254 when it \nadopted the contribution factor for the first quarter of \n2022 and that respondents therefore could properly \nraise their constitutional claim as part of their challenge \nto that agency action.  Id. at 129a.  \nOn the merits, the panel rejected respondents\u2019 claim \nthat Congress in enacting Section 254 had unconstitu-\ntionally delegated legislative power to the FCC.  See \nApp., infra, 132a-137a.  The panel determined that Sec-\ntion 254 sets forth \u201cnumerous intelligible principles\u201d \nthat constrain the FCC\u2019s exercise of its authority.  Id. \nat 137a.  The panel also rejected respondents\u2019 claim that \nthe Commission had unconstitutionally delegated gov-\nernmental power to the Company.  See id. at 137a-140a.  \nThe panel emphasized that the Company lacks inde-\npendent regulatory authority and functions \u201csubordi-\nnate[ly]\u201d to the Commission.  Id. at 140a.  \n3. The court of appeals granted respondents\u2019 peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc.  See App., infra, 160a-161a.  \nThe en banc court granted respondents\u2019 petition for re-\nview by a vote of 9-7.  See id. at 1a-118a.  \nThe en banc court held that no procedural obstacle \nprevented it from reaching the merits of the petition for \nreview.  See App., infra, 11a-18a.  The court observed \nthat respondents\u2019 challenge to the specific FCC action \nat issue here\u2014i.e., the contribution factor that the Com-\nmission had established for the first quarter of 2022\u2014\n\u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity might \npreclude recovery of money already paid into the Uni-\nversal Service Fund.  Id. at 13a.

The \nCommission has appointed a private company as the \nprograms\u2019 Administrator, authorizing that company to \nperform administrative tasks such as sending out bills, \ncollecting contributions, and disbursing funds to bene-\nficiaries.  The questions presented are as follows:  \n1. Whether Congress violated the nondelegation \ndoctrine by authorizing the Commission to determine, \nwithin the limits set forth in Section 254, the amount \nthat providers must contribute to the Fund.  \n2. Whether the Commission violated the nondelega-\ntion doctrine by using the Administrator\u2019s financial pro-\njections in computing universal service contribution \nrates.  \n3. Whether the combination of Congress\u2019s conferral \nof authority on the Commission and the Commission\u2019s \ndelegation of administrative responsibilities to the Ad-\nministrator violates the nondelegation doctrine. \n \n \n\n(II) \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nThe following parties are petitioners here and were \nrespondents below:   the Federal Communications Com-\nmission and the United States of America.   \nThe following parties are respondents here and were \npetitioners below:  Consumers\u2019 Research; Cause Based \nCommerce, Inc.; Joseph Bayly; Suzanne Bettac; Ker-\nsten Conway; Lynn Gibbs; Paul Gibbs; Kwang Ja \nKerby; Tom Kirby; Robert Kull; Deanna Roth; Jeremy \nRoth; and Rhonda Thomas.  \nThe following parties were intervenors below: Ben-\nton Institute for Broadband and Society; Center for Me-\ndia Justice, d/b/a MediaJustice; Competitive Carriers \nAssociation; National Digital Inclusion Alliance; Na-\ntional Telecommunications Cooperative Association, \nd/b/a NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Association; \nSchools, Health and Libraries Broadband Coalition; \nand U.S. Telecom\u2014The Broadband Association.  \nRELATED PROCEEDING \nUnited States Court of Appeals (5th Cir.): \nConsumers\u2019 Research v.

See AT&T, Inc. v. FCC, 886 F.3d 1236, 1241 \n(D.C. Cir. 2018).  Congress referenced that mission in \nthe statutory text, directing the agency to \u201cmake avail-\nable, so far as possible, to all the people of the United \nStates,  * * *  a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and world-\nwide wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 151.  \nFor the first half-century of its existence, the FCC \nachieved universal service primarily by regulating \nrates.  See Verizon Communications Inc. v. FCC, 535 \nU.S. 467, 480 (2002).  For example, the Commission re-\nquired telephone monopolies to charge below-cost rates \nin rural areas, while allowing them to charge above-cost \nrates in cities.  See ibid.  Through that approach, urban \ncustomers effectively subsidized the provision of tele-\nphone service to rural customers.  See ibid.  \nIn 1996, Congress overhauled the Act in order to \npromote competition and eliminate monopolies in the \ntelecommunications industry.  See Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, 110 Stat. 56.  As part \nof those reforms, Congress established a new frame-\nwork for achieving universal service.  See 47 U.S.C. 254.  \n\n3 \n \nThe amended Act directs the FCC to establish a set of \nprograms known collectively as the Universal Service \nFund (Fund).  See 47 U.S.C. 254(a).  It requires carriers \nthat provide interstate telecommunications services to \n\u201ccontribute\u201d to the Fund \u201con an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory basis.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(d).  The Commission \nmust use the money in the Fund to subsidize universal \nservice.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e).   \nThe Act\u2019s provisions guide and limit the FCC\u2019s exer-\ncise of that authority.  The Act requires the Commission \nto \u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement \nof universal service\u201d on a series of specific \u201cprinciples\u201d \n\u2014for example, the principle that consumers in rural ar-\neas \u201cshould have access to telecommunications and in-\nformation services  * * *  that are reasonably compara-\nble to those services provided in urban areas.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(3); see 47 U.S.C. 254(b).  The Act also re-\nquires the Commission, when deciding whether to sub-\nsidize a service, to consider certain factors\u2014for exam-\nple, the extent to which the service in question is \u201ces-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1)(A); see 47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  \nIn accordance with the Act, the Commission has es-\ntablished four universal service programs, which assist \n(1) deployment in remote areas, (2) low-income consum-\ners, (3) schools and libraries, and (4) rural healthcare \nproviders.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.302-54.322, 54.400-54.424, \n54.500-54.523, 54.600-54.633, 54.801-54.1524.  All four \nprograms subsidize telephone and broadband services, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.101, and the program for schools and \nlibraries subsidizes internal connections as well, see 47 \nC.F.R. 54.502(a).   \n2. In 1997, the FCC directed the creation of the Uni-\nversal Service Administrative Company (Company) to \n\n4 \n \nhelp it administer the Fund.  See In re Changes to the \nBoard of Directors of the National Exchange Carrier \nAss\u2019n, Inc., 12 FCC Rcd 18,400, 18,418-18,419 (1997).  \nThe Company is a private, not-for-profit corporation \nchartered in Delaware.  See App., infra, 59a. \nAlthough the Company is a private body, it remains \nsubject to the Commission\u2019s oversight and control.  Its \nsole stockholder, an association of carriers, must \u201cact in \ncompliance with the [FCC\u2019s] Rules and Orders when ex-\nercising its stockholder duties and powers.\u201d  Amended \nand Restated By-Laws of Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company, Art. I, \u00b6 1 (rev. Jan. 26, 2024).  FCC \nrules identify the groups represented on the Company\u2019s \nBoard of Directors (e.g., consumers, carriers, and recip-\nients of universal service funding), and the FCC Chair \nselects directors after reviewing nominations from \nthose groups.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.703(b).  The Company \nalso must obtain the Commission\u2019s approval of its \nbudget.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.715(c).  \nThe FCC has \u201cappointed\u201d the Company as the \nFund\u2019s \u201cpermanent Administrator.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.701(a).  \nIn that role, the Company provides financial projections \nthat the FCC uses each quarter in computing the \namounts of universal service contributions.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.709.  The Administrator also sends out bills \nand collects contributions.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.702(b).  Fi-\nnally, the Administrator disburses money to program \nbeneficiaries in accordance with FCC rules.  See ibid.  \nAlthough the Administrator performs administra-\ntive tasks on the FCC\u2019s behalf, it exercises no independ-\nent regulatory power.  It \u201cmay not make policy, inter-\npret unclear provisions of the statute or rules, or inter-\npret the intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  It \nmust comply with the Commission\u2019s rules, see 47 C.F.R. \n\n5 \n \n54.701-54.717, and any party that is aggrieved by its de-\ncisions may request de novo review by the Commission, \nsee 47 C.F.R. 54.719-54.725. \n3. The FCC\u2019s rules prescribe a process for compu-\nting each carrier\u2019s quarterly contribution to the Fund.  \nSee 47 C.F.R. 54.709.  At least 60 days before the begin-\nning of each quarter, the Administrator must submit to \nthe Commission its projections of the expenses (bene-\nfits plus administrative overhead) that the four univer-\nsal service programs will incur, along with \u201cthe basis for \nthose projections.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And at least \n30 days before the beginning of each quarter, the Ad-\nministrator must submit a projection of the total reve-\nnues that telecommunications carriers will earn from \ninterstate and international telecommunications ser-\nvices, based on financial information provided by those \ncarriers.  See ibid. \nThe FCC uses those projections to calculate a \u201ccon-\ntribution factor\u201d\u2014i.e., a number that is based on the ra-\ntio of the projected expenses to the projected revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The Commission then announces \nthe projections and proposed contribution factor to the \npublic.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  The FCC may revise \nthe projections (and thus the contribution factor) and \nmay set them \u201cat amounts that the Commission deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  Ibid.  If the Com-\nmission takes no action within 14 days after the an-\nnouncement, however, the projections and contribution \nfactor are \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid. \nOnce the FCC approves the contribution factor, the \nAdministrator calculates each carrier\u2019s contribution by \napplying the factor to that carrier\u2019s \u201ccontribution base\u201d \n(generally, the carrier\u2019s interstate and international tel-\necommunications revenues).  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  \n\n6 \n \nFor example, if the contribution factor is 25%, each car-\nrier would owe 25% of its interstate and international \ntelecommunications revenues.  Carriers may pass the \ncost of their contributions on to customers.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.712(a). \nB. Proceedings Below \n1. In November 2021, the Administrator submitted \nits projections of expenses and revenues for the first \nquarter of 2022.  See App., infra, 150a-159a.  Based on \nthose projections, the Commission proposed a contribu-\ntion factor of 25.2%.  See id. at 141a-149a.   \nRespondents\u2014a nonprofit organization, a carrier, \nand a group of consumers\u2014filed comments requesting \nthat the FCC set the contribution factor at 0% instead.  \nSee Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 17.  Respondents did not object to \nthe Administrator\u2019s projections or to the Commission\u2019s \ncomputation of the contribution factor based on those \nprojections.  Respondents instead argued that the uni-\nversal service program was itself unlawful.  See App., \ninfra, 11a.  They contended that Congress had uncon-\nstitutionally delegated legislative power to the FCC and \nthat the Commission had unconstitutionally redelegated \npower to the Administrator.  See ibid.   \nThe Commission took no further action within 14 \ndays after publishing the proposed contribution factor.  \nSee App., infra, 11a.  As a result, the factor was deemed \napproved.  See ibid.  \n2. Respondents filed a petition for review in the \nFifth Circuit.  See App., infra, 11a.  A unanimous panel \ndenied the petition.  See id. at 125a-140a.  \nThe panel first rejected the FCC\u2019s argument that the \npetition for review was untimely because \u201cany challenge \nto \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel reasoned that \n\n7 \n \nthe Commission had \u201creapplied\u201d Section 254 when it \nadopted the contribution factor for the first quarter of \n2022 and that respondents therefore could properly \nraise their constitutional claim as part of their challenge \nto that agency action.  Id. at 129a.  \nOn the merits, the panel rejected respondents\u2019 claim \nthat Congress in enacting Section 254 had unconstitu-\ntionally delegated legislative power to the FCC.  See \nApp., infra, 132a-137a.  The panel determined that Sec-\ntion 254 sets forth \u201cnumerous intelligible principles\u201d \nthat constrain the FCC\u2019s exercise of its authority.  Id. \nat 137a.  The panel also rejected respondents\u2019 claim that \nthe Commission had unconstitutionally delegated gov-\nernmental power to the Company.  See id. at 137a-140a.  \nThe panel emphasized that the Company lacks inde-\npendent regulatory authority and functions \u201csubordi-\nnate[ly]\u201d to the Commission.  Id. at 140a.  \n3. The court of appeals granted respondents\u2019 peti-\ntion for rehearing en banc.  See App., infra, 160a-161a.  \nThe en banc court granted respondents\u2019 petition for re-\nview by a vote of 9-7.  See id. at 1a-118a.  \nThe en banc court held that no procedural obstacle \nprevented it from reaching the merits of the petition for \nreview.  See App., infra, 11a-18a.  The court observed \nthat respondents\u2019 challenge to the specific FCC action \nat issue here\u2014i.e., the contribution factor that the Com-\nmission had established for the first quarter of 2022\u2014\n\u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity might \npreclude recovery of money already paid into the Uni-\nversal Service Fund.  Id. at 13a.  The court held, how-\never, that the case \u201cis nonetheless justiciable because it \nis capable of repetition yet evading review.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt then rejected the argument that, because the \nCommission had prevailed against respondents in par-\n\n8 \n \nallel cases in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, principles \nof issue preclusion prohibited respondents from reliti-\ngating their nondelegation challenges in the Fifth Cir-\ncuit.  See id. at 14a-18a.  The court concluded that the \nFCC had forfeited that defense by raising it only after \nthis Court\u2019s denials of certiorari in the Sixth and Elev-\nenth Circuit cases, rather than immediately after the \nSixth and Eleventh Circuits\u2019 judgments.  See id. at 18a.  \nOn the merits, the en banc court stated that \u201cCon-\ngress through [Section] 254 may have delegated legis-\nlative power to FCC because it purported to confer \nupon FCC the power to tax without supplying an intel-\nligible principle to guide FCC\u2019s discretion.\u201d  App., infra, \n19a.  The court characterized Section 254\u2019s limits on the \nCommission\u2019s authority as \u201cminimal,\u201d \u201ccontentless,\u201d \u201ca \nhollow shell,\u201d and \u201cso amorphous that no reviewing \ncourt could ever possibly invalidate any FCC action.\u201d  \nId. at 27a, 29a, 41a.  The court found those nondelega-\ntion concerns to be \u201cespecially salient\u201d because Section \n254 \u201cimplicates the taxing power\u201d\u2014a \u201cquintessentially \nlegislative\u201d power.  Id. at 19a, 41a n.13. \nThe en banc court then stated that the FCC \u201cmay \nhave impermissibly delegated the taxing power to pri-\nvate entities.\u201d  App., infra, 19a.  The court concluded \nthat the Company\u2019s projections could \u201ctake legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval.\u201d  Id. at 49a.  The court \nalso expressed the view that, as a practical matter, the \nCommission \u201c\u200a\u2018rubber stamp[s]\u2019 whatever contribution \namount [the Company] proposes.\u201d  Id. at 50a (citation \nomitted).  Finally, the court stated that Section 254 does \nnot authorize the FCC to delegate power to the Com-\npany in the first place.  See id. at 55a.  \nAlthough the en banc court was \u201chighly skeptical\u201d of \nthe constitutionality of Congress\u2019s grant of power to the \n\n9 \n \nCommission, and of the Commission\u2019s delegation of ad-\nministrative responsibilities to the Company, the court \ndid not decide whether either conferral of authority \nstanding alone would violate the Constitution.  See \nApp., infra, 64a.  The court instead held that \u201cthe com-\nbination of Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and \nFCC\u2019s unauthorized subdelegation to [the Company] vi-\nolates the Legislative Vesting Clause.\u201d  Ibid.  In the \ncourt\u2019s view, the \u201cdouble-layered delegation\u201d at issue in \nthis case constituted \u201ca historical anomaly\u201d and under-\nmined \u201cdemocratic accountability.\u201d  Id. at 73a-74a.   \nJudge Elrod, joined by two other judges, issued a \nconcurring opinion in which she concluded that \u201cCon-\ngress\u2019s delegation of legislative power to the FCC and \nthe FCC\u2019s delegation of the taxing power to a private \nentity each individually contravene[s] the separation of \npowers.\u201d  App., infra, 82a.  Judge Ho issued a concur-\nring opinion in which he emphasized that \u201call legislative \npowers\u201d are \u201cexercised by the people we elect.\u201d  Id. at \n85a.    \nJudge Stewart, joined by six judges, dissented.  See \nApp., infra, 88a-114a.  He expressed the view that Sec-\ntion 254 \u201cevinces a clear intelligible principle delimiting \nagency discretion\u201d; that the en banc court of appeals\u2019 \nanalysis reflected an \u201cexaggerated conception of [the \nCompany\u2019s] role and discretion\u201d; and that \u201cdelegations \nof the taxing power are not subject to stricter scrutiny.\u201d  \nId. at 97a, 103a-104a.  Judge Higginson, joined by four \njudges, also dissented.  See id. at 115a-124a.  He criti-\ncized the court\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018combination\u2019 theory\u201d as inconsistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents.  Id. at 116a.   \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nUniversal service has been an essential component \nof federal telecommunications policy ever since the \n\n10 \n \nFCC was established in 1934.  Today, universal service \nprograms ensure the availability of vital telecommuni-\ncations services to schools, libraries, rural health care \nproviders, and rural and low-income customers. \nIn the decision below, however, the en banc Fifth \nCircuit held that the universal service contribution sys-\ntem violates the nondelegation doctrine.  That decision \nconflicts with decisions of the Sixth and Eleventh Cir-\ncuits, which have rejected similar nondelegation chal-\nlenges.  It also invalidates the system that the Commis-\nsion has used for a quarter century to implement an im-\nportant Act of Congress.  If left in place, the decision \nwill upend the universal service programs, to the detri-\nment of millions of consumers nationwide.  This Court \nshould grant the petition for a writ of certiorari and re-\nverse. \nA. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Incorrect \nThe en banc Fifth Circuit erred in concluding that \n\u201cthe combination\u201d of Congress\u2019s delegation of power to \nthe Commission and the Commission\u2019s delegation of ad-\nministrative responsibilities to the Administrator vio-\nlates the Constitution.  App., infra, 19a.  Congress did \nnot delegate legislative power to the Commission.  The \nCommission did not delegate governmental power to \nthe Administrator.  Nor did the combination of those \ntwo conferrals of responsibility create a constitutional \nviolation.   \n1. Congress did not delegate legislative power to the \nCommission \nThe court of appeals concluded that Congress \u201cmay \nhave delegated legislative power\u201d to the FCC by em-\npowering the Commission to determine the amount of \n\n11 \n \nuniversal service contributions.  App., infra, 19a.  Sec-\ntion 254 does not effect any such delegation.   \na. Article I vests Congress with \u201c[a]ll legislative \nPowers\u201d granted by the Constitution.  U.S. Const. Art. \nI, \u00a7 1.  Congress may not delegate those legislative pow-\ners to the Executive Branch.  See A.L.A. Schechter \nPoultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, 529 (1935).  \nBut Congress may authorize executive agencies to ex-\nercise substantial \u201cdiscretion\u201d in implementing and en-\nforcing the laws that Congress enacts.  J.W. Hampton, \nJr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 406 (1928).   \nSo long as a statute sets forth an \u201cintelligible princi-\nple\u201d to guide the executive agency\u2019s actions, it effects a \nlawful grant of discretion rather than an unlawful dele-\ngation of legislative power.  See J.W. Hampton, 276 \nU.S. at 409.  A statute satisfies that requirement if it \nidentifies \u201cthe general policy, the public agency which \nis to apply it, and the boundaries of this delegated au-\nthority.\u201d  American Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. \n90, 105 (1946).  That test is \u201cnot demanding.\u201d  Gundy v. \nUnited States, 588 U.S. 128, 146 (2019) (plurality opin-\nion).  \u201cOnly twice in this country\u2019s history\u201d has the \nCourt held that a statute crossed that line\u2014\u201cin each \ncase because \u2018Congress had failed to articulate any pol-\nicy or standard\u2019 to confine discretion.\u201d  Ibid. (citation \nomitted).   \nBy contrast, this Court has \u201cover and over upheld \neven very broad delegations.\u201d  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 146 \n(plurality opinion).  The court has held, for example, \nthat Congress may empower agencies to regulate in the \n\u201cpublic interest,\u201d see National Broadcasting Co. v. \nUnited States, 319 U.S. 190, 225-226 (1943); to set \u201cfair \nand equitable\u201d prices, see Yakus v. United States, 321 \nU.S. 414, 422 (1944); or to establish air-quality stand-\n\n12 \n \nards that are \u201crequisite to protect the public health,\u201d \nsee Whitman v. American Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. \n457, 472-476 (2001). \nThe statute at issue here provides far more detailed \nguidance than others that this Court has upheld.  First, \nthe Act requires the Commission to \u201cbase policies for \nthe preservation and advancement of universal service\u201d \non six specific \u201cprinciples,\u201d 47 U.S.C. 254(b):  \n\u2022 \u201cQuality services should be available at just, reason-\nable, and affordable rates.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(1). \n\u2022 \u201cAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(2).  \n\u2022 \u201cConsumers in all regions of the Nation  * * *  should \nhave access to telecommunications and information \nservices  * * *  that are reasonably comparable to \nthose services provided in urban areas and that are \navailable at rates that are reasonably comparable to \nthe rates charged for similar services in urban ar-\neas.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(3).  \n\u2022 \u201cAll providers of telecommunications services should \nmake an equitable and nondiscriminatory contribu-\ntion to the preservation and advancement of univer-\nsal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(4).  \n\u2022 \u201cThere should be specific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(5). \n\u2022 \u201cElementary and secondary schools and classrooms, \nhealth care providers, and libraries should have ac-\ncess to advanced telecommunications services.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(b)(6). \n\n13 \n \nSection 254(b) allows the FCC to \u201cbalance the principles \nagainst one another when they conflict.\u201d  Qwest Corp. v. \nFCC, 258 F.3d 1191, 1200 (10th Cir. 2001) (Qwest I).  But \nthe Commission \u201cmay not depart from them altogether \nto achieve some other goal.\u201d  Ibid.; see Qwest Commu-\nnications International, Inc. v. FCC, 398 F.3d 1222, \n1234 (10th Cir. 2005) (Qwest II).  \nSecond, the Act specifies the entities that must pay \nuniversal service contributions and the terms on which \nthey must do so.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(d).  \u201cEvery telecom-\nmunications carrier that provides interstate telecom-\nmunications services\u201d must contribute toward universal \nservice.  Ibid.  Those contributions must be \u201cequitable \nand nondiscriminatory.\u201d  Ibid. \nThird, the Act specifies the types of services that the \nFCC may fund.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(c).  Generally, only \n\u201ctelecommunications services\u201d may receive universal \nservice support.  47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1); see 47 U.S.C. \n153(53) (defining \u201ctelecommunications service\u201d).  And \nin determining which telecommunications services to \nfund, the Commission must consider the extent to which \nsuch services \u201care essential to education, public health, \nor public safety\u201d; have \u201cbeen subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers\u201d; \u201care being \ndeployed in public telecommunications networks by tel-\necommunications carriers\u201d; and \u201care consistent with \nthe public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(c)(1).   \nFourth, the Act identifies the beneficiaries that may \nreceive subsidies and the ways in which the subsidies \nmay be used.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(e) and (h).  \u201c[O]nly an \neligible telecommunications carrier designated under \n[47 U.S.C. 214(e)] shall be eligible to receive specific \nFederal universal service support.\u201d  47 U.S.C. 254(e); \n\n14 \n \nsee 47 U.S.C. 214(e) (specifying criteria for designating \ntelecommunications carriers eligible to receive univer-\nsal service funding).  A carrier may use the funds \u201conly \nfor the provision, maintenance, and upgrading of facili-\nties and services for which the support is intended.\u201d  47 \nU.S.C. 254(e).  The Act also includes detailed provisions \ngoverning subsidies for rural healthcare providers, \nschools, and libraries.  See 47 U.S.C. 254(h).   \nFinally, the Act requires universal service support to \nbe \u201csufficient to achieve the purposes\u201d of Section 254,  \n47 U.S.C. 254(e), and specifies that services should be \n\u201caffordable,\u201d 47 U.S.C. 254(b)(1).  Those provisions con-\nstrain the program\u2019s overall size and budget.  The suffi-\nciency requirement precludes the Commission from ex-\npanding the program beyond \u201cwhat is \u2018sufficient to \nachieve the purposes of\u200a\u2019 universal service.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 \nResearch v. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 794 (6th Cir. 2023) (cita-\ntion omitted), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2628 (2024); see \nAlenco Communications, Inc. v. FCC, 201 F.3d 608, 620 \n(5th Cir. 2000) (\u201c[E]xcessive funding may itself violate \nthe sufficiency requirements of the Act.\u201d).  And the af-\nfordability principle precludes the FCC from allowing \nthe universal service contribution to become \u201cso large it \nactually makes telecommunications services less \u2018af-\nfordable.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Rural Cellular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 588 F.3d 1095, \n1103 (D.C. Cir. 2009) (citation omitted); see Alenco, 201 \nF.3d at 620 (\u201cBecause universal service is funded by a \ngeneral pool subsidized by all telecommunications provid-\ners \u2014and thus indirectly by the customers\u2014excess sub-\nsidization in some cases may detract from universal ser-\nvice by causing rates unnecessarily to rise, thereby \npricing some consumers out of the market.\u201d). \nThe Act, in short, provides comprehensive guidance \nto the FCC on how to implement Congress\u2019s universal \n\n15 \n \nservice policy.  It sets out \u201cfrom whom funds are ex-\nacted,\u201d \u201cwho receives the benefit of the funds,\u201d and \u201cwhat \nminimum standards of service must be provided.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 93a (Stewart, J., dissenting).  The Act therefore \neffects a permissible grant of discretionary authority, \nnot an impermissible delegation of legislative power.  \nb. The court of appeals nonetheless concluded that \nSection 254 provides the Commission with \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever.\u201d  App., infra, 30a (citation and emphasis \nomitted).  The court\u2019s stated bases for that conclusion \nlack merit.  \nThe court of appeals first stated that the FCC is au-\nthorized to use contributions \u201cto fund whatever projects \nit might like.\u201d  App., infra, 27a-28a.  That is incorrect.  \nThe Act defines \u201cuniversal service\u201d as a \u201clevel of tele-\ncommunications services\u201d established by the Commis-\nsion.  47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1).  The Commission accordingly \nmay use the Fund only for telecommunications services \n\u2014not for foreign aid, veterans\u2019 benefits, highway mainte-\nnance, or other \u201cprojects\u201d that the government \u201cmight \nlike.\u201d  App., infra, 28a.  Further constraining the FCC, \nthe Act lists factors that the FCC must consider in de-\nciding which telecommunications services to fund.  See \n47 U.S.C. 254(c)(1). \nThe court of appeals also stated that the Act\u2019s stand-\nards are \u201camorphous\u201d; that they leave the Commission \n\u201cat sea\u201d; and that \u201cno reviewing court could ever possi-\nbly invalidate any FCC action\u201d under those standards.  \nApp., infra, 27a, 31a, 41a.  But the Act constrains the \nFCC\u2019s implementation of universal service programs \nmore than the en banc court suggested.  Although the \ncourt viewed the Act as imposing no judicially enforce-\nable limits on the Commission\u2019s authority, \u201creviewing \ncourt[s],\u201d including the Fifth Circuit itself, previously \n\n16 \n \nhave \u201cinvalidate[d] FCC action\u201d when the Commission \nhas deviated from the statutory principles.  Id. at 41a; \nsee, e.g., Qwest II, 398 F.3d at 1232-1238; Qwest I, 258 \nF.3d at 1199-1200; Texas Office of Public Utility Coun-\nsel v. FCC, 183 F.3d 393, 406 (5th Cir. 1999).  And while \nthe Act\u2019s standards do not take the form of bright-line \nrules, the nondelegation doctrine does not require Con-\ngress to adopt a \u201cdeterminate criterion,\u201d American \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 475 (citation omitted), or \n\u201ca specific formula,\u201d Lichter v. United States, 334 U.S. \n742, 785 (1948). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that Section 254 au-\nthorizes the FCC to adopt additional universal service \nprinciples beyond those listed in the Act.  See App., in-\nfra, 28a.  But the Commission\u2019s power to adopt such \nprinciples is itself constrained by an intelligible stand-\nard:  the additional principles must be \u201cnecessary and \nappropriate for the protection of the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity,\u201d and must be \u201cconsistent \nwith\u201d the Act.  47 U.S.C. 254(b)(7).  And in any event, \nthis case presents no question concerning the scope of \nthat authority, since the specific FCC order that re-\nspondents challenge does not adopt any such additional \nprinciples.  \nc. The court of appeals stated that \u201cthe scope of per-\nmissible delegation varies with context,\u201d and it cited \nvarious factors that, in its view, distinguished Section \n254 from other delegations that this Court has upheld.  \nApp., infra, 33a.  Those arguments, too, lack merit.  \nThe court of appeals found it \u201cespecially salient\u201d that \nSection 254 \u201cimplicates the taxing power.\u201d  App., infra, \n41a n.13.  But Congress did not need to rely on its taxing \npower to enact Section 254.  The Constitution empowers \nCongress to regulate \u201cCommerce\u201d \u201camong the several \n\n17 \n \nStates.\u201d  U.S. Const. Art. I, \u00a7 8, Cl. 3.  The commerce \npower includes the authority to regulate the channels \nand instrumentalities of interstate commerce, see \nPierce County v. Guillen, 537 U.S. 129, 147 (2003), such \nas telecommunications networks, see Pensacola Tele-\ngraph Co. v. Western Union Telegraph Co., 96 U.S. 1, 9 \n(1877).  And Congress may regulate commerce by re-\nquiring those engaged in commerce to pay money.  See \nGibbons v. Ogden, 9 Wheat. 1, 202 (1824) (\u201c[D]uties may \noften be, and in fact often are, imposed on tonnage, with \na view to the regulation of commerce.\u201d).  The commerce \npower therefore provides an independently sufficient \nbasis for Section 254\u2019s requirement that carriers pay \nuniversal service contributions. \nIn any event, this Court has specifically rejected \u201cthe \napplication of a different and stricter nondelegation \nstandard in cases where Congress delegates discretion-\nary authority to the Executive under its taxing power.\u201d  \nSkinner v. Mid-America Pipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, \n222-223 (1989).  The Constitution\u2019s text does not \u201cdistin-\nguish Congress\u2019 power to tax from its other enumerated \npowers  * * *  in terms of the scope and degree of dis-\ncretionary authority that Congress may delegate to the \nExecutive.\u201d  Id. at 220-221.  \u201cFrom its earliest days to \nthe present,\u201d Congress \u201chas varied the degree  * * *  of \ndiscretionary authority delegated to the Executive\u201d in \ntax statutes.  Id. at 221.  And the Court has repeatedly \napplied ordinary nondelegation principles in reviewing \ntax laws.  See, e.g., Federal Energy Administration v. \nAlgonquin SNG, Inc., 426 U.S. 548, 558-560 (1976); J.W. \nHampton, 276 U.S. at 409.   \nThe court of appeals also found Section 254 \u201cespe-\ncially troubling because the statute insulates FCC from \nthe principal tool Congress has to control FCC\u2019s univer-\n\n18 \n \nsal service decisions\u2014the appropriations power.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 31a.  But Congress exercised the appropriations \npower in Section 254 itself by authorizing the FCC to \nuse the Fund for universal service programs.  Congress \nretains the authority to repeal that appropriation. The \ncourt of appeals noted that Section 254 operates \u201cout-\nside the [annual] appropriations process,\u201d id. at 32a, but \nthe Constitution does not require an annual appropria-\ntions process.  It allows Congress to make \u201cstanding ap-\npropriations,\u201d CFPB v. Community Financial Services \nAss\u2019n of America, Ltd., 601 U.S. 416, 436 (2024), and a \ncourt may not penalize Congress\u2019s exercise of that \npower by applying a stricter nondelegation standard. \nFinally, the court of appeals asserted that Section \n254 invites the Commission to make \u201cpolicy\u201d judgments \nrather than purely \u201ctechnical\u201d judgments.  App., infra, \n34a.  But a \u201ccertain degree of discretion,\u201d and thus of \npolicymaking, \u201cinheres in most executive\u201d action.  \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 475 (citation \nomitted).  This Court has accordingly rejected the argu-\nment that the nondelegation doctrine precludes Con-\ngress from vesting executive agencies with authority to \nmake policy judgments.  See, e.g., Yakus, 321 U.S. at \n425-426 (\u201cIt is no objection that the [statute]  * * *  \ncall[s] for the exercise of judgment, and for the formu-\nlation of subsidiary administrative policy within the \nprescribed statutory framework.\u201d).  And the Court has \n\u201calmost never felt qualified to second-guess Congress \nregarding the permissible degree of policy judgment \nthat can be left to those executing or applying the law.\u201d  \nAmerican Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. at 474-475 (cita-\ntion omitted). \n\n19 \n \n2. The Commission did not delegate governmental \npower to the Administrator \nThe court of appeals separately determined that the \nFCC \u201cmay have\u201d unlawfully \u201csubdelegat[ed]\u201d legisla-\ntive power to the Administrator, a private corporation.  \nApp., infra, 19a.  But the court\u2019s analysis reflected an \n\u201cexaggerated conception of [the Administrator\u2019s] role \nand discretion.\u201d  Id. at 103a (Stewart, J., dissenting).  \na. In Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238 (1936), \nthis Court explained that the Constitution prohibits the \nfederal government from transferring unchecked gov-\nernmental power to a private entity.  The statute at is-\nsue in that case allowed producers of two-thirds of the \ncoal in a particular district to set wages and hours for \nall producers in that district, without review by any fed-\neral agency.  See id. at 281-283.  The Court held that the \nstatute violated the Constitution by delegating to \u201cpri-\nvate persons\u201d the unchecked \u201cpower to regulate the af-\nfairs of an unwilling minority.\u201d  Id. at 311.  \nIn Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. \n381 (1940), however, this Court clarified that the federal \ngovernment may rely on private entities to assist it in \nthe performance of its functions.  The statute at issue in \nthat case authorized local boards consisting of private \ncoal producers to propose minimum prices for coal, but \nempowered the National Bituminous Coal Commission \n(a governmental body) to approve, disapprove, or mod-\nify those prices.  See id. at 388.  The Court upheld the \nscheme because the private boards \u201cfunction[ed] subor-\ndinately\u201d to a federal agency.  Id. at 399.  The Court \nemphasized that the agency, not the boards, ultimately \n\u201cdetermine[d] the prices\u201d and that the agency \u201cha[d] \nauthority and surveillance over the [private boards\u2019] ac-\ntivities.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n20 \n \nHere, as in Sunshine Anthracite, the relevant non-\ngovernmental actor \u201cfunction[s] subordinately to the\u201d \nresponsible federal agency and is subject to the agency\u2019s \n\u201cauthority and surveillance.\u201d  Sunshine Anthracite,  \n310 U.S. at 399.  The FCC, not the Administrator, de-\ntermines, within the limits set by Congress, how much \ncarriers must pay.  Under the FCC\u2019s rules, the amount \nof a carrier\u2019s contribution depends \u201con a contribution \nfactor determined quarterly by the Commission.\u201d   \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a) (emphasis added).  The Administra-\ntor simply helps the Commission compute the contribu-\ntion factor by providing \u201cprojections\u201d of the universal \nservice programs\u2019 expenses and the carriers\u2019 revenues.  \n47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3). \nIn making the required projections, the Administra-\ntor must act in accordance with the Commission\u2019s rules.  \nThose rules establish detailed eligibility requirements \nfor universal service beneficiaries, see, e.g., 47 C.F.R. \n54.410; impose caps on particular types of support, see, \ne.g., 47 C.F.R. 54.507; and prescribe precise formulas \nfor calculating the amount of the subsidy, see, e.g., 47 \nC.F.R. 54.604-54.606.  Those rules also require the Ad-\nministrator to project total carrier revenues based on \nthe information contained in forms that the carriers file \neach quarter.  See 47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2), 54.711(a).  The \nspecificity of those rules ensures that, in making the \nprojections, the Administrator performs a ministerial \ntask.  \nThe FCC may exercise additional powers of supervi-\nsion after the Administrator makes its projections for a \nparticular quarter.  Projections of program expenses \n\u201cmust be approved by the Commission before they are \nused to calculate the quarterly contribution factor.\u201d  47 \nC.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  To that end, the Administrator \n\n21 \n \nmust submit projections of the programs\u2019 expenses at \nleast 60 days before the start of the quarter.  See ibid.  \nIt must also submit \u201cthe basis for those projections.\u201d  \nIbid.  Those rules enable the Commission and its staff \nto review (and if necessary revise) the projections be-\nfore using them to calculate the contribution factor.   \nThe Commission then uses those projections to com-\npute a quarterly contribution factor, which it announces \nin a public notice and on its website.  See 47 C.F.R. \n54.709(a)(3).  The Commission \u201creserves the right\u201d to \nrevise the factor within the 14-day period following the \nissuance of the public notice.  Ibid.  Only if the FCC fails \nto take further action during that 14-day period is the \nfactor \u201cdeemed approved.\u201d  Ibid.  The Administrator \nmust then \u201ccalculate the amount of individual contribu-\ntions\u201d by \u201capply[ing] the quarterly contribution factor\u201d \nto each individual carrier\u2019s revenues.  Ibid.   \nFurther limiting the Administrator\u2019s role, a carrier \nthat is aggrieved by the Administrator\u2019s actions may \nseek de novo review before the Commission.  See 47 \nC.F.R. 54.719(b).  The FCC\u2019s rules provide, moreover, \nthat the Administrator \u201cmay not make policy, interpret \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules, or interpret \nthe intent of Congress.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.702(c).  If the stat-\nute or the rules \u201care unclear, or do not address a partic-\nular situation, the Administrator shall seek guidance \nfrom the Commission.\u201d  Ibid.  Thus, if the Administra-\ntor confronts an unsettled legal or policy issue in the \ncourse of calculating projections (or taking any other \naction), it must seek guidance from the FCC rather than \nresolving the issue itself.  \nThe Administrator, in short, performs an advisory \nrole; it has no independent substantive power to set the \ncontribution factor or the amount of individual carriers\u2019 \n\n22 \n \ncontributions.  In performing that role under the FCC\u2019s \n\u201cauthority and surveillance,\u201d Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399, the Administrator does not exercise govern-\nmental power. \nb. The court of appeals nevertheless concluded that \nthe Commission \u201cmay have impermissibly delegated \nthe taxing power\u201d to the Administrator.  App., infra, \n19a.  The court\u2019s analysis was flawed.  \nThe court of appeals stated that, under the FCC\u2019s \nrules, the Administrator\u2019s \u201cprojections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval\u201d if the Commission takes \nno further action within 14 days after announcing the \ncontribution factor.  App., infra, 49a.  But the projec-\ntions have no independent legal effect.  Only the contri-\nbution factor has legal effect, and it is \u201cdetermined by \nthe Commission.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(2).  The projec-\ntions, in any event, \u201cmust be approved by the Commis-\nsion before they are used to calculate the quarterly con-\ntribution factor.\u201d  47 C.F.R. 54.709(a)(3).  And the Com-\nmission may review the Administrator\u2019s projections not \nonly during the 14-day period after the FCC announces \nthe contribution factor, but also before announcing the \nfactor in the first place.  See pp. 20-21, supra.  \nThe court of appeals also asserted that the Commis-\nsion \u201crubber stamp[s]\u201d the Administrator\u2019s projections, \nso that the FCC exercises only \u201cde jure\u201d rather than \u201cde \nfacto\u201d control.  App., infra, 7a.  That claim is both le-\ngally irrelevant and factually incorrect.  As a legal mat-\nter, the relevant question is whether the Commission \nhas the \u201cauthority\u201d to reject or modify the Administra-\ntor\u2019s proposals, not how often the Commission exercises \nthat power in practice.  Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. \nat 399; cf. United States v. Arthrex, Inc., 594 U.S. 1, 27 \n(2021) (plurality opinion) (\u201c[A principal officer] need not \n\n23 \n \nreview every decision of the [inferior officer].  What \nmatters is that the [principal officer] have the discretion \nto review decisions rendered by [inferior officers].\u201d).  \nThe court of appeals did not deny that the FCC retains \nplenary authority to review and revise the projections.  \nAs a factual matter, moreover, the FCC does conduct \nmeaningful review of the Administrator\u2019s actions.  On \nseveral occasions, including twice in 2023, the Commis-\nsion has departed from the Administrator\u2019s projections \nwhen calculating the quarterly contribution factor.  See, \ne.g., FCC, Proposed Fourth Quarter 2023 Universal Ser-\nvice Contribution Factor, DA 23-843, 2023 WL 6036327, \nat *1 (released Sept. 13, 2023); FCC, Proposed Third \nQuarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution Factor, \nDA 23-507, 2023 WL 4012359, at *1 (released June 14, \n2023); FCC, Revised Second Quarter 2003 Universal \nService Contribution Factor, 18 FCC Rcd 5097, 5097 \n(released Mar. 21, 2003).  The Commission also has \nawarded relief when it has disagreed with the Adminis-\ntrator\u2019s calculation of the contributions owed by individ-\nual carriers.  See, e.g., In re Universal Service Contri-\nbution Methodology, 31 FCC Rcd 13,220, 13,220 (2016).  \nThe relative infrequency with which the FCC revises \nthe Administrator\u2019s decisions reflects the Administra-\ntor\u2019s limited role, the detailed regulations constraining \nits actions, and the Commission\u2019s general oversight of \nits activities.  See App., infra, 121a (Higginson, J., dis-\nsenting).  \nThe court of appeals cited previous instances of \nfraud in the program.  See App., infra, 8a.  But FCC \nrules require the Administrator to undergo annual au-\ndits to prevent waste, fraud, and abuse.  See 47 C.F.R. \n54.717.  The Commission also regularly directs the Ad-\nministrator to take corrective action to recover improper \n\n24 \n \npayments made in the past and eliminate such payments \nin the future.  See, e.g., Letter from Mark Stephens, Man-\naging Dir., FCC, to Radha Sekar, CEO, USAC (Jan. 14, \n2021), https://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/fcc-letter-\nto-usac-01142021.pdf.  More fundamentally, although \npast instances of waste and fraud are \u201cconcerning,\u201d \n\u201cthis has never been enough to declare a coequal politi-\ncal branch\u2019s act unconstitutional.\u201d  App., infra, 122a \n(Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nFinally, the court of appeals stated that Section 254 \n\u201cdoes not authorize\u201d the Commission to delegate power \nto the Administrator.  App., infra, 55a.  But as the court \nacknowledged, respondents have not challenged the \nAdministrator\u2019s role on statutory grounds.  See id. at \n63a n.21.  In any event, for the reasons discussed above, \nthe FCC did not delegate governmental power to the \nAdministrator.  It assigned the Administrator a minis-\nterial task\u2014which the en banc court acknowledged is \npermissible.  See id. at 56a-57a.   \n3. The court of appeals\u2019 \u201ccombination\u201d theory is wrong \nAs explained above, the court of appeals was \u201chighly \nskeptical\u201d that the quarterly contribution factor at issue \nhere comports with either \u201cthe bar on congressional \ndelegations of legislative power\u201d or \u201cthe general rule \nthat private entities may not wield governmental power.\u201d  \nApp., infra, 64a.  The court declined, however, to defin-\nitively \u201cresolve either question in this case.\u201d  Ibid.  The \ncourt instead held that \u201cthe combination\u201d of Congress\u2019s \n\u201cdelegation\u201d to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s \u201csubdelegation\u201d \nto the Administrator \u201cviolates the Legislative Vesting \nClause.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals\u2019 \u201ccombination\u201d theory conflicts \nwith this Court\u2019s decision in Sunshine Anthracite.  See \nApp., infra, 116a-117a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  In \n\n25 \n \nthat case, as discussed above, an agency set coal prices \nbased on proposals made by private coal producers.  See \np. 19, supra.  The challengers argued that the scheme \nviolated both the public nondelegation doctrine (by em-\npowering the agency to set prices) and the private non-\ndelegation doctrine (by allowing private entities to play \na role in the process by which those prices were deter-\nmined).  See Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 397-399.  \nThis Court rejected the public nondelegation claim, ex-\nplaining that Congress had specified \u201cwholly adequate\u201d \n\u201ccriteria\u201d to guide the agency.  Id. at 398.  The Court \nthen rejected the private nondelegation claim, noting \nthat the agency had \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d over \nthe private entities\u2019 activities.  Id. at 399.  The Court \n\u201cended its analysis of both delegation challenges there\u201d; \nit did not suggest that the combination of the two con-\nferrals of authority required a further analysis beyond \nthat needed to evaluate each challenge taken on its own.  \nApp., infra, 116a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nThe court of appeals drew an analogy to this Court\u2019s \nholding in Free Enterprise Fund v. PCAOB, 561 U.S. \n477 (2010), that Article II precludes Congress from \ngranting two layers of tenure protection to certain ex-\necutive officers.  See App., infra, 66a.  That analogy is \ninapt.  In Free Enterprise Fund, the Court emphasized \nthat a \u201csecond level of tenure protection\u201d \u201ctransforms\u201d \nan agency\u2019s independence by \u201cchang[ing] the nature of \nthe President\u2019s review.\u201d  561 U.S. at 496.  By contrast, \nthe supposed second level of delegation in this case\u2014\nthe FCC\u2019s reliance on the Administrator\u2019s non-binding \nprojections in computing the contribution factor\u2014has \nno such transformative effect.  The FCC still decides, \nwithin the bounds set by Congress, how much carriers \n\n26 \n \nmust pay; the Administrator simply provides data to as-\nsist the Commission in making that decision.  \nThe court of appeals\u2019 theory fails on its own terms \nanyway.  The court acknowledged that \u201c[t]here cannot \nbe a combined public/private delegation without a pri-\nvate delegation.\u201d  App., infra, 79a.  No private delega-\ntion exists here.  As discussed above, the Administrator \nmakes recommendations but exercises no independent \ngovernmental power in the quarterly process of setting \nthe contribution factor.  See pp. 19-24, supra. \nB. The Questions Presented Warrant This Court\u2019s Review \n1. The en banc Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision warrants this \nCourt\u2019s review because it creates a circuit conflict.  In \naddition to their present challenge, respondents also \nfiled petitions for review in the Sixth and Eleventh Cir-\ncuits to pursue nondelegation challenges to other FCC \norders setting quarterly contribution factors for differ-\nent time periods.  See Consumers\u2019 Research, 67 F.4th \nat 778 (6th Cir.); Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 F.4th \n917, 921 (11th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 144 S. Ct. 2629 \n(2024).  Unlike the Fifth Circuit, the Sixth and Eleventh \nCircuits rejected those challenges.   \nThe Sixth Circuit held that Section 254 \u201cdoes not vi-\nolate the nondelegation doctrine\u201d because the statute \n\u201ccontains an intelligible principle.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Re-\nsearch, 67 F.4th at 797.  That court also held that \u201cthere \nis no private-nondelegation doctrine violation\u201d because \nthe Administrator is \u201csubordinat[e] to the FCC\u201d and \nprovides only \u201cministerial support.\u201d  Ibid.  The Elev-\nenth Circuit similarly concluded that \u201cthere are no un-\nconstitutional delegations under [Section 254] because \nCongress has laid out the principles the FCC must fol-\nlow.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Research, 88 F.4th at 928.  It also \nconcluded that \u201cthere is no violation of the private non-\n\n27 \n \ndelegation doctrine\u201d because the Administrator \u201cis sub-\nordinate to the FCC\u201d and \u201cthe FCC retains ultimate de-\ncision-making power.\u201d  Ibid.  Neither the Sixth nor the \nEleventh Circuit suggested that the combination of the \ntwo nondelegation challenges required an additional \nanalysis beyond that needed to resolve the challenges \nseparately.  \nThe decision below also is in tension with the D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s decision in Rural Cellular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 685 \nF.3d 1083 (2012).  In that case, the D.C. Circuit held that \nSection 254 does not unconstitutionally delegate legis-\nlative power to the Commission.  See id. at 1091-1092.  \nThe court explained that Section 254 \u201cclearly provides \nan intelligible principle to guide the Commission\u2019s ef-\nforts.\u201d  Id. at 1091.  That case did not, however, involve \nany challenge under the private nondelegation doctrine.  \n2. Even apart from the circuit conflict, the decision \nbelow warrants further review because it invalidates \nthe FCC\u2019s implementation of a federal statute.  Judging \nthe constitutionality of an Act of Congress is \u201cthe grav-\nest and most delicate duty\u201d that courts are called on to \nperform.  Blodgett v. Holden, 275 U.S. 142, 148 (1927) \n(opinion of Holmes, J.).  Accordingly, \u201cwhen a lower \ncourt has invalidated a federal statute,\u201d this Court\u2019s \n\u201cusual\u201d approach is to grant review.  Iancu v. Brunetti, \n588 U.S. 388, 392 (2019). \nAlthough the court of appeals stated that it was not \nholding Section 254 unconstitutional, see App., infra, \n19a, the court\u2019s analysis reflected its \u201cgrave concerns \nabout \u00a7 254\u2019s constitutionality,\u201d id. at 42a.  The court\u2019s \nview that Section 254 \u201cmay have delegated legislative \npower\u201d to the FCC was one of two conclusions that, in \n\u201ccombination,\u201d led the court to find a constitutional vio-\nlation.  Id. at 19a.  And while the court did not invalidate \n\n28 \n \nthe statute on its face, it did invalidate the way in which \nthe Commission has implemented the statute for more \nthan two decades (i.e., using the Administrator\u2019s projec-\ntions in setting the quarterly contribution factor).  The \nFifth Circuit\u2019s decision is therefore analogous to a deci-\nsion invalidating a federal statute as applied to particu-\nlar circumstances\u2014a type of decision that this Court \nroutinely reviews even in the absence of a circuit con-\nflict.  See, e.g., Vidal v. Elster, 602 U.S. 286, 292 (2024); \nAgency for International Development v. Alliance for \nOpen Society International, Inc., 591 U.S. 430, 433 \n(2020); DHS v. Thuraissigiam, 591 U.S. 103, 116 (2020).   \n3. The practical consequences of the decision below \nunderscore the need for this Court\u2019s review.  For more \nthan a quarter-century, the universal service programs \nhave made telephone service affordable for rural and \nlow-income consumers.  Those programs have sup-\nported the provision of essential services by rural health \ncare providers.  And they have facilitated internet ac-\ncess in schools and libraries across the Nation.  \nThe decision below, however, threatens to nullify the \nuniversal service programs\u2014to the detriment of the \u201cmil-\nlions of Americans\u201d whom those programs serve.  App., \ninfra, 123a (Higginson, J., dissenting).  If the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is allowed to take effect, carriers in that \ncircuit (and perhaps elsewhere) are likely to argue that \nthey no longer have a legal obligation to make universal \nservice contributions because the FCC and the Admin-\nistrator lack the power to collect such payments.  Such \na development would devastate the FCC\u2019s ability to en-\nsure sufficient funding for universal service subsidies \ngoing forward.  \n4. This Court should grant certiorari on all three \nquestions presented: whether Congress impermissibly \n\n29 \n \ndelegated legislative power to the FCC, whether the \nCommission impermissibly delegated governmental \npower to the Administrator, and whether the combina-\ntion of the two alleged delegations violates the Consti-\ntution.  Although the court of appeals ultimately rested \nits decision on its resolution of the third issue, consider-\nation of the other two issues is a necessary \u201cpredicate \nto an intelligent resolution\u201d of the third question.  Helix \nEnergy Solutions Group, Inc. v. Hewitt, 598 U.S. 39, 50 \nn.3 (2023) (citation omitted).  It would make little sense \nto analyze the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \u201ccombination\u201d theory, \nApp., infra, 19a, without considering the components of \nthat combination.  Although the Court might ultimately \nresolve this case without answering all three questions, \ngranting review on all three would ensure that the \nCourt can fully consider all aspects of respondents\u2019 \nchallenge.   \nC. This Case Is An Appropriate Vehicle For Resolving The \nQuestions Presented \n1. The en banc court of appeals and the panel dis-\ncussed three threshold procedural issues.  But none of \nthose issues would prevent this Court from reaching the \nquestions presented.  \nFirst, the en banc court suggested sua sponte that \nthe case \u201cmight be moot\u201d because sovereign immunity \nmight preclude respondents from recovering money al-\nready paid into the Fund.  App., infra, 13a.  The court \ncorrectly held, however, that this case is \u201cnonetheless \njusticiable because it is capable of repetition yet evad-\ning review.\u201d  Ibid.  That exception to mootness applies \nwhere \u201c(1) the challenged action is in its duration too \nshort to be fully litigated prior to cessation or expira-\ntion, and (2) there is a reasonable expectation that the \nsame complaining party will be subject to the same ac-\n\n30 \n \ntion again.\u201d  Davis v. FEC, 554 U.S. 724, 735 (2008) (ci-\ntation omitted).  This case satisfies the first require-\nment because an FCC order setting the quarterly con-\ntribution factor lasts just one quarter.   See Kingdom-\nware Technologies, Inc. v. United States, 579 U.S. 162, \n170 (2016) (explaining that \u201ca period of two years\u201d is of-\nten \u201ctoo short to complete judicial review\u201d).  And this \ncase satisfies the second requirement because the Com-\nmission calculates a new contribution factor every quar-\nter.  See App., infra, 14a.  \nSecond, the FCC argued to the panel that respond-\nents\u2019 petition for review was untimely because \u201cany \nchallenge to \u00a7 254 should have come when Congress \noriginally enacted it.\u201d  App., infra, 128a.  The panel re-\njected that contention, see ibid., and the Commission \ndid not renew the argument at the en banc stage.  The \npanel\u2019s rejection of that argument was correct.  The ap-\nplicable judicial-review provision states that \u201c[a]ny \nparty aggrieved by the [agency\u2019s] final order may, \nwithin 60 days after its entry, file a petition to review \nthe order.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2344.  Respondents filed their pe-\ntition \u201cwithin 60 days after\u201d the \u201cfinal order\u201d\u2014i.e., the \nFCC order that established the applicable contribution \nfactor for the first quarter of 2022\u2014that respondents \nsought to challenge.  Ibid. \nFinally, the en banc court rejected the argument \nthat, under the doctrine of issue preclusion, the Sixth \nand Eleventh Circuits\u2019 decisions precluded respondents \nfrom relitigating their nondelegation claims in this case.  \nSee App., infra, 14a.  The court held that the govern-\nment had forfeited that argument by raising it after this \nCourt denied certiorari rather than immediately after \nthe Sixth and Eleventh Circuits issued their decisions.  \nSee ibid.  The government does not seek this Court\u2019s \n\n31 \n \nreview of that holding.  As the en banc court noted, if \nthe Fifth Circuit did not reach the merits here, it would \nstill need to decide them in a separate pending case \n\u201cthat includes petitioners who were not parties to the \nSixth or Eleventh Circuit proceedings.\u201d  Id. at 18a;  \nsee Pet. for Review, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, No. \n24-60330 (5th Cir. Jun. 27, 2024).  And since issue pre-\nclusion does not concern subject-matter jurisdiction, \nsee Exxon Mobil Corp. v. Saudi Basic Industries Corp., \n544 U.S. 280, 293 (2005), this Court would have no inde-\npendent obligation to address the issue.* \n2. After this Court denied the petitions for writs of \ncertiorari in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit cases, the \nchallengers filed petitions for rehearing asking the \nCourt to reconsider those denials.  See Pet. for Reh\u2019g, \nConsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-456); Pet. for Reh\u2019g, \nConsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-743).  The Court \nhas not yet acted on those rehearing petitions.  In the \ngovernment\u2019s view, the best course would be to grant \ncertiorari in this case, rather than in one or both of \nthose cases.  Granting certiorari in this case would ena-\n \n*  Contrary to the Fifth Circuit\u2019s suggestion, the government did \nnot seek to \u201cevade\u201d this Court\u2019s review in its brief in opposition to \nthe petitions for writs of certiorari in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit \ncases.  App., infra, 18a n.5.  In those petitions, which were filed be-\nfore the en banc court issued the decision below, the challengers as-\nserted that the en banc Fifth Circuit was \u201cpoised to create\u201d a circuit \nconflict.  Pet. at 34, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 S. Ct. 2628 \n(2024) (No. 23-456); Pet. at 38, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 144 S. \nCt. 2629 (2024) (No. 23-743).  The government simply responded \nthat \u201cthe en banc Fifth Circuit ha[d] not yet issued its decision\u201d and \nthat, \u201c[o]nce it does so, the parties can determine whether to seek, \nand this Court can determine whether to grant, certiorari to review \nthat decision.\u201d  Gov\u2019t Br. in Opp. at 17-18, Consumers\u2019 Research, \nsupra (No. 23-456). \n\n32 \n \nble this Court to directly review the reasoning of the \nonly court that has found a nondelegation violation in \nthe FCC\u2019s implementation of Section 254.  \nD. In The Alternative, The Court Should Hold This Peti-\ntion For A Writ Of Certiorari Pending The Court\u2019s Res-\nolution Of Wisconsin Bell  \nThis Court has granted review in Wisconsin Bell, \nInc. v. United States ex rel. Heath, No. 23-1127 (oral ar-\ngument scheduled for Nov. 4, 2024), in order to consider \nwhether a request for reimbursement under a universal \nservice program is a \u201cclaim\u201d governed by the False \nClaims Act, 31 U.S.C. 3721 et seq.  Congress defined  \nthe term \u201c\u200a\u2018claim\u2019\u200a\u201d to include requests for money pre-\nsented to an \u201cagent of the United States,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \n3729(b)(2)(A)(i), as well as certain requests for money if \nthe government \u201cprovides\u201d any portion of the funds re-\nquested, 31 U.S.C. 3729(b)(2)(A)(ii)(I).  This Court\u2019s \nresolution of those issues in Wisconsin Bell could shed \nlight on the nature of the FCC\u2019s relationship with the \nCompany\u2014which, in turn, could affect the nondelega-\ntion analysis in this case.  The challengers\u2019 rehearing \npetitions in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuit cases recog-\nnized Wisconsin Bell\u2019s relevance to the nondelegation \nissues raised here.  See Pet. for Reh\u2019g at 3, Consumers\u2019 \nResearch, supra (No. 23-456); Pet. for Reh\u2019g at 3, Con-\nsumers\u2019 Research, supra (No. 23-743).   \nIn the government\u2019s view, the best course would be \nto grant review in this case and to resolve the uncer-\ntainty created by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision.  But if this \nCourt does not grant review in this case, it should hold \nthis petition for a writ of certiorari pending the Court\u2019s \nresolution of Wisconsin Bell.  \n\n33 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted.  In the alternative, the petition should be held \npending this Court\u2019s resolution of Wisconsin Bell v. \nUnited States ex rel. Heath, No. 23-1127 (oral argument \nscheduled for Nov. 4, 2024), and then disposed of as ap-\npropriate.  \nRespectfully submitted. \nP. MICHELE ELLISON \nGeneral Counsel \nJACOB M.

OLDHAM, Circuit Judge, joined by JONES, \nSMITH, ELROD, WILLETT, HO, DUNCAN, ENGELHARDT, \nand WILSON, Circuit Judges: \nIn the Telecommunications Act of 1996, Congress \ndelegated its taxing power to the Federal Communica-\ntions Commission.  FCC then subdelegated the taxing \npower to a private corporation.  That private corpora-\ntion, in turn, relied on for-profit telecommunications \ncompanies to determine how much American citizens \nwould be forced to pay for the \u201cuniversal service\u201d tax \nthat appears on cell phone bills across the Nation.  We \nhold this misbegotten tax violates Article I, \u00a7 1 of the \nConstitution. \nI. \nA. \nCongress has long \u201cpursued a policy of providing \n\u2018universal\u2019 [telecommunications] service to all residents \nand businesses in the United States.\u201d  Ronald J. Kro-\ntoszynski, Jr., Reconsidering the Nondelegation Doc-\ntrine:  Universal Service, the Power to Tax, and the \nRatification Doctrine, 80 IND. L.J. 239, 279 (2005).  \nFor half a century Congress pursued this policy through \na complicated cross-subsidy regime.  Back when the \nold AT&T was a regulated monopoly, Congress allowed \nit to charge supra-competitive rates to urban customers \nin exchange for requiring it to provide services it might \nnot otherwise provide to high-cost rural customers.  \nBut \u201c[f\u200a]or obvious reasons, this system of implicit subsi-\ndies can work well only under regulated conditions.  In \na competitive environment, a carrier that tries to subsi-\ndize below-cost rates to rural customers with above-cost \nrates to urban customers is vulnerable to a competitor \n\n3a \n \nthat offers at-cost rates to urban customers.\u201d  Tex. Off. \nof Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC (\u201cTOPUC I\u201d), 183 F.3d 393, \n406 (5th Cir. 1999).  So when Congress deregulated \nAT&T and other telecommunications companies, it had \nto abandon the old way of pursuing universal service. \nCongress\u2019s new way is 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254.  Section 254 \nauthorizes FCC to establish \u201cspecific, predictable, and \nsufficient  . . .  mechanisms to preserve and advance \nuniversal service.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(5).  Pursuant to this \ngrant of authority, FCC levies \u201ccontributions\u201d to a Uni-\nversal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d) from telecommunications \ncarriers, id. \u00a7 254(b)(4), and it distributes the monies \nraised to people, entities, and projects to expand and ad-\nvance telecommunications services.  FCC regulations \nexpressly permit carriers to pass these \u201ccontributions\u201d \nthrough to their customers, see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a), \nand the overwhelming majority of carriers do so, see \nFCC, FCC 22-67, Report on the Future of the Universal \nService Fund 10084-85, (Aug. 15, 2022) (\u201cReport to Con-\ngress\u201d). \nNotably, Congress declined to define \u201cuniversal ser-\nvice\u201d itself.  Instead, it delegated to FCC the responsi-\nbility to periodically \u201cestablish\u201d the concept of \u201cuniver-\nsal service\u201d by \u201ctaking into account advances in telecom-\nmunications and information technologies and services.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1).  In making this determination, \nCongress directed FCC to: \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunica-\ntions services\u2014 \n(A) are essential to education, public health, or \npublic safety; \n\n4a \n \n(B) have, through the operation of market choices \nby customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecommunica-\ntions networks by telecommunications carri-\ners; and \n(D) are consistent with the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity. \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1). \nSection 254(b) also suggests principles for FCC to \n\u201cbase policies for the preservation and advancement of \nuniversal service.\u201d  Telecommunications services \u201cshould\u201d \nbe \u201cavailable at just, reasonable, and affordable rates\u201d; \naccessible \u201cin all regions of the Nation\u201d; and available to \n\u201clow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, and \nhigh cost areas\u201d at rates \u201creasonably comparable to \nrates charged for similar services in urban areas.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3).  FCC also may develop \u201csuch other \n[universal service principles it] determine[s] are neces-\nsary and appropriate for the protection of the public in-\nterest, convenience, and necessity and are consistent \nwith this chapter.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(7). \nSection 254 further provides that \u201c[e]lementary and \nsecondary schools and classrooms, health care provid-\ners, and libraries should have access to advanced tele-\ncommunications services.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(6).  Accord-\ningly, \u201ctelecommunications carrier[s] shall, upon receiv-\ning a bona fide request, provide telecommunications ser-\nvices which are necessary for the provision of health \ncare services in a State  . . .  to any public or non-\nprofit health care provider that serves persons who re-\nside in rural areas in that State at rates that are reason-\n\n5a \n \nably comparable to rates charged for similar services in \nurban areas in that State.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A).  And \n\u201ctelecommunications carriers  . . .  shall, upon a bona \nfide request for any of its services that are within the \n[FCC\u2019s] definition of universal service  . . .  , provide \nsuch services to elementary schools, secondary schools, \nand libraries for educational purposes at rates less than \nthe amounts charged for similar services to other par-\nties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  FCC then reimburses telecom-\nmunications providers for the costs of providing this \nsubsidized service.  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A), (B)(i)-(ii). \nB. \nPresently, USF supports telecommunications pro-\njects through four major programs:  the High-Cost \nProgram (see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.302-54.322), the Lifeline \nProgram (see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.400-54.423), the E-rate Program \n(see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.500-54.523), and the Rural Health Care \nProgram (see id. \u00a7\u00a7 54.600-54.633). \nEach program has a laudable objective.  The High-\nCost Program subsidizes the provision of voice and in-\nternet services in rural communities.  The Lifeline Pro-\ngram subsidizes the provision of phone service to low- \nincome consumers.  The E-Rate Program subsidizes \nthe provision of broadband connectivity and Wi-Fi to \nschools and libraries.  And the Rural Health Care Pro-\ngram subsidizes the provision of telecommunications \nservices to rural healthcare providers. \nFCC regulations establish the services supported by \neach of these programs and the eligibility criteria appli-\ncants must satisfy to obtain assistance.  But FCC does \nnot administer all these universal service programs it-\nself.  Instead, it relies on a private company called the \n\n6a \n \nUniversal Service Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d).  \nUSAC is managed by representatives from \u201cinterest \ngroups affected by and interested in universal service \nprograms\u201d who are \u201cnominated by their respective in-\nterest groups.\u201d  See Leadership, UNIVERSAL SERV. AD-\nMIN. CO., https://perma.cc/9W92G4Z9 (last accessed \nSept. 11, 2023); see also 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.703(b) (providing \nfor the composition of USAC\u2019s board of directors).  \nFCC has charged USAC with myriad tasks:  \u201cbilling \ncontributors, collecting contributions to the universal \nservice support mechanisms, and disbursing universal \nservice support funds.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b). \nMost prominently, though, USAC is responsible for \ndeciding the quarterly USF contribution amount\u2014a \nprojection of the dollar value of demand for universal \nsupport programs and the costs of administering them. \nSee id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  The contribution amount dic-\ntates the size of the universal service contributions lev-\nied on telecommunications carriers and, in turn, Ameri-\ncan telecommunications consumers.  To set the contri-\nbution amount, USAC relies on \u201cinformation from uni-\nversal service program participants\u201d to \u201cestimate[] how \nmuch money will be needed each quarter to provide uni-\nversal service support.\u201d  See Universal Service, UNIVER-\nSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., https://perma.cc/B5NN-AVF8 \n(last accessed Oct. 10, 2023).  In other words, the con-\ntribution amount ultimately derives from the universal \nservice demand projections of private, for-profit tele-\ncommunications carriers, all of whom have \u201chave finan-\ncial incentives\u201d to increase the size of universal service \nprograms.  U.S. GOV\u2019T ACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-\n17-538, ADDITIONAL ACTION NEEDED TO ADDRESS SIG-\nNIFICANT RISKS IN FCC\u2019S LIFELINE PROGRAM 1 (2017), \n\n7a \n \nhttps://perma.cc/K5J9-L89K (\u201cFCC\u2019s Lifeline Pro-\ngram\u201d). \nFCC then uses USAC\u2019s contribution amount to im-\npose a tax on America\u2019s telecommunications carriers. \n(FCC calls this tax the USF \u201ccontribution factor\u201d; but \nwe call it what it is\u2014the \u201cUSF Tax.\u201d)  The USF Tax is \nthe percentage of end-user telecommunications reve-\nnues each carrier must contribute to USF in a particular \nquarter.  As a practical matter, USAC sets the USF \nTax\u2014subject only to FCC\u2019s rubber stamp.  True,  \nFCC \u201creserves the right to set projections of demand \nand administrative expenses at amounts that [it] deter-\nmines will serve the public interest.\u201d  See 47 C.F.R.  \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  But FCC never made a substantive re-\nvision to USAC\u2019s proposed contribution amount prior to \nthis litigation,1 and it does not even have a documented \nprocess for checking USAC\u2019s work.  Instead, FCC  \nhas provided that if it \u201ctake[s] no action within fourteen \n(14) days of the date of release of the public notice an-\nnouncing [USAC\u2019s] projections of demand and adminis-\ntrative expenses, the projections of demand and admin-\nistrative expenses  . . .  shall be deemed approved by \nthe Commission.\u201d  See ibid. (emphasis added).  So \nFCC has delegated to USAC responsibility\u2014de facto if \nnot de jure\u2014for imposing the USF Tax. \n \n \n \n1  FCC claims it has made three alterations to USF projections.  \nBut one of those was a ministerial change of the rate from .09044 \nto .091 because some carriers\u2019 computers could not handle five dec-\nimal places.  And the other two were not even initiated by FCC.  \nSee Petrs\u2019 EB Br. 63. \n\n8a \n \nC. \nIn 1995, the USF Tax was $1.37 billion.  JA62.  But \nby the end of 2021, USAC ballooned the USF to over $9 \nbillion.  See UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., 2021 An-\nnual Report 20 (2023) https://perma.cc/9CPT-H5LM.  \nThe proposed USF Tax at issue in this case is 25.2%, up \nfrom just over 5% in 2000.  See FCC, DA 00-517, PRO-\nPOSED SECOND QUARTER 2000 UNIVERSAL SERVICE \nCONTRIBUTION FACTOR (Mar. 7, 2000), https://perma. \ncc/4BSK-6QZR.  Recent USF Taxes have been set as \nhigh as 34.5%.  See FCC, DA 23-843, PROPOSED FOURTH \nQUARTER 2023 UNIVERSAL SERVICE CONTRIBUTION \nFACTOR (Sep. 13, 2023), https://perma.cc/Y2QW-6HBD. \nMany of the billions injected into the USF have un-\ndoubtedly been deployed to support the important goal \nof universal service.  But waste and fraud have also \ncontributed to the USF\u2019s astronomical growth.  For \nexample, in 2004, FCC\u2019s Inspector General affirmed \nthat schools view the E-Rate Program as \u201ca big candy \njar\u201d of \u201cfree money.\u201d  Sam Dillon, School Internet Pro-\ngram Lacks Oversight, Investigator Says, N.Y. Times \n(June 18, 2004), https://perma.cc/9PZY-ED3K.  The \nInspector General\u2019s primary concern was FCC\u2019s heavy \nand longstanding reliance on self-certified eligibility de-\nterminations in the E-rate Program.  See U.S. GOV\u2019T \nACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-20-606, FCC SHOULD \nTAKE ACTION TO BETTER MANAGE PERSISTENT FRAUD \nRISKS IN THE SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES PROGRAM18 \n(Sep. 2020), https://perma.cc/5EK4-Q8V8 (\u201cFCC\u2019s E-\nrate Program\u201d).  A 2008 GAO report demonstrated \nthat, in a single year, USAC made almost a billion dol-\nlars of High-Cost Program payments that \u201cshould not \nhave been made, or were not made, in the correct \n\n9a \n \namount, when viewed from the perspective of applicable \nFederal Communications Commission rules, orders and \ninterpretative opinions.\u201d  OFF.

In 2013, one Congressman noted: \nThe [Lifeline] fund [] increased 266 percent [between \n2008 and 2013],  . . .  all while the cost of phone \nservice [went] down.  Despite the limit of one subsi-\ndized subscriber per household, published reports \nsuggest some subscribers have eight or more phones \nwith subsidized service, with one woman saying that \nto get one \u201cshe just goes across the street and gets \nit.\u201d  One man has claimed to have a bag full of 20 \nphones on the program that he sells \u201cfor about 10, 15, \n20 bucks\u201d each. \nThe Lifeline Fund:  Money Well Spent?:  Hearing \nBefore the H.

And in 2018, FCC\u2019s \nmanaging director reported a GAO audit that uncovered \ngross improper payments of $336.39 million in the Life-\nline Program alone.  See Letter from Mark Stephens, \nManaging Director, FCC, to Ron Johnson, Chairman, S. \nComm. On Homeland Sec. & Gov\u2019t Affs. (Aug. 27, 2019), \nhttps:// perma.cc/VNQ6-N3WB.  While earth\u2019s only \ntwo certainties are death and taxes, the USF Tax man-\nages to cheat the grave:  It is well-documented that \nFCC disburses USF money to dead people.  See FCC\u2019s \nLIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, at 43. \nUSAC\u2019s role in perpetuating USF waste is equally \nwell known.  In 2010, GAO concluded that USAC \u201clacks \n\n10a \n \nkey features of effective internal controls.\u201d  U.S. GOV\u2019T \nACCOUNTABILITY OFF., GAO-11-11, IMPROVED MAN-\nAGEMENT CAN ENHANCE FCC DECISION MAKING FOR \nTHE UNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND LOW-INCOME PRO-\nGRAM i (Oct. 2010), https://perma.cc/9YHE-8YE9 \n(\u201cFCC\u2019s Low-Income Program\u201d); see also FCC\u2019s E-\nRATE PROGRAM, supra, at 20-21.  The Low-Income \nProgram report noted that while USAC primarily uses \naudit findings to monitor compliance with USF rules, \n\u201cthe number and scope of USAC\u2019s audits have been lim-\nited and there is no systematic process in place to review \nthe findings of those audits that are conducted.\u201d  \nFCC\u2019s LOW-INCOME PROGRAM, supra, at cover page.  \nMoreover, the GAO noted USAC had not even consid-\nered \u201cthe possibility that multiple carriers may claim \nsupport for the same telephone line and that households \nmay receive more than one discount, contrary to pro-\ngram rules.\u201d  Ibid.  In 2017, GAO explained that \nUSAC \u201crelies on over 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication \nCarriers that are Lifeline providers to implement key \nprogram functions, such as verifying subscriber eligibil-\nity,\u201d which is problematic because \u201ccompanies may have \nfinancial incentives to enroll as many customers as pos-\nsible.\u201d  FCC\u2019s LIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, at cover page.  \nAnd in 2019, FCC acknowledged that USAC was out of \ncompliance with improper payment reporting require-\nments.  See Letter from Mark Stephens, supra, at 1. \n* * * \nSection 254 reflects a policy goal of making telecom-\nmunications services available to all Americans.  It is \nemphatically the province of Congress to make such pol-\nicy choices.  But it is our judicial duty to ensure that \nCongress pursued its goal through lawful means.  And \n\n11a \n \nin that regard, our brief survey of the USF\u2019s history \nmakes three things clear.  First, Congress\u2019s instruc-\ntions are so ambiguous that it is unclear whether Amer-\nicans should contribute $1.37 billion, $9 billion, or any \nother sum to pay for universal service.  Second, private \nentities bear important responsibility for universal ser-\nvice policy choices.  And third, it is impossible for an \naggrieved citizen to know who bears responsibility for \nthe USF\u2019s serious waste and fraud problems.  All three \nof those things implicate bedrock constitutional princi-\nples. \nII. \nA. \nOn November 2, 2021, USAC proposed its Q1 2022 \nUSF contribution amount.  A subset of the Petitioners \nin this action filed a comment with FCC challenging the \nconstitutionality of the universal service contribution \nmechanism on November 19.  On December 13, 2021, \nFCC issued a public notice of its Proposed Q1 2022 USF \nTax, which was derived directly from USAC\u2019s proposed \ncontribution amount.  Petitioners re-filed their com-\nment on December 22.  FCC took no action with re-\nspect to USAC\u2019s proposed contribution amount, so on \nDecember 27 the contribution factor was deemed ap-\nproved.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  Petitioners \nthen filed a timely petition for review in our court. \nB. \nWe have statutory jurisdiction under 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402 \nand 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2342.2  FCC does not contest our con-\n \n2  Before the panel, FCC argued that we lack statutory jurisdic-\ntion because the petition was not timely filed.  The panel rejected \n \n\n12a \n \nstitutional jurisdiction, but we have an obligation to con-\nsider jurisdictional questions sua sponte even when they \nare not raised by the parties.  See E.T. v. Paxton, 41 \nF.4th 709, 718 n.2 (5th Cir. 2022). \nConsistent with that obligation, we note that at least \none petitioner\u2014Cause Based Commerce\u2014had Article \nIII standing when the petition was filed.  See Biden v. \nNebraska, 143 S. Ct. 2355, 2365 (2023) (\u201cIf at least one \nplaintiff has standing, the suit may proceed.\u201d); Ad-\nvanced Mgmt. Tech., Inc. v. FAA, 211 F.3d 633, 636 \n(D.C. Cir. 2000) (\u201cStanding is assessed at the time the \naction commences.\u201d  (citation and quotation omitted)).  \nCause Based Commerce incurred a classic pocketbook \ninjury as a result of its legal obligation to pay the USF \nTax.  Its injury is fairly traceable to the challenged \nconduct because the size of its Q1 2022 USF liability was \ncontrolled by the contribution factor set by USAC.  \nAnd, at the time the petition was filed, its injury could \nhave been redressed by a favorable judicial decision be-\ncause vacatur of FCC\u2019s approval of the proposed contri-\nbution factor would have prevented collection of the \nUSF Tax.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3) (\u201c[T]he Admin-\nistrator shall apply the quarterly contribution factor, \nonce approved by the Commission, to contributor\u2019s in-\nterstate and international end-user telecommunications \nrevenues to calculate the amount of individual contribu-\ntions.\u201d  (emphasis added)). \n \n \n \nthat argument, see Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 63 F.4th 441, 446 (5th \nCir. 2023), reh\u2019g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 72 F.4th 107 \n(5th Cir. 2023), and FCC has abandoned it. \n\n13a \n \nIt is not clear that Cause Based Commerce\u2019s pocket-\nbook injury is still redressable because sovereign im-\nmunity may bar recovery of the monies it paid into USF \npursuant to the Q1 2022 USF Tax.  See 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 702 \n(waiving sovereign immunity for actions against agen-\ncies seeking relief \u201cother than money damages\u201d).  If \nthat is right, Cause Based Commerce\u2019s challenge might \nbe moot because no court-ordered relief could redress \nthe injuries it incurred as a result of the Q1 2022 USF \nTax.  See Already, LLC v. Nike, Inc., 568 U.S. 85, 91 \n(2013) (\u201cA case becomes moot\u2014and therefore no longer \na \u2018Case\u2019 or \u2018Controversy\u2019 for purposes of Article III\u2014\nwhen the issues presented are no longer live or the par-\nties lack a legally cognizable interest in the outcome.\u201d  \n(quotation and citation omitted)). \nWe need not reach that question, however, because \neven assuming Cause Based Commerce\u2019s injury is no \nlonger redressable, it is nonetheless justiciable because \nit is capable of repetition yet evading review.  See, e.g., \nS. Pac. Terminal Co. v. Interstate Com. Comm\u2019n, 219 \nU.S. 498, 515 (1911) (establishing the exception and not-\ning that jurisdiction \u201cought not to be  . . .  defeated, \nby short term orders, capable of repetition, yet evading \nreview\u201d because otherwise the government and regu-\nlated parties would \u201chave their rights determined by the \nCommission without a chance of [judicial] redress\u201d).  \nThe Q1 2022 USF Tax evades review because it was in \nforce for just one quarter\u2014\u201ctoo short [a] duration to be \nfully litigated in the United States Supreme Court be-\nfore it expire[d].\u201d  Ralls Corp. v. Comm. on Foreign \nInv. in U.S., 758 F.3d 296, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2014); see ibid. \n(\u201cAs a rule of thumb, agency actions of less than two \nyears\u2019 duration cannot be fully litigated prior to cessa-\ntion or expiration, so long as the short duration is typical \n\n14a \n \nof the challenged action.\u201d (quotation and citation omit-\nted)).  And it is capable of repetition because there is \n\u201ca reasonable expectation\u201d\u2014indeed, a near certainty\u2014\n\u201cthat [Cause Based Commerce] will be subjected to the \nsame action again.\u201d  Id. at 323; see id. at 324 (\u201cThe \nsame action generally refers to  . . .  recurrent iden-\ntical agency actions.\u201d (quotation and citations omitted)); \nsee also 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3) (providing that a new \ncontribution factor is calculated each quarter). \nAccordingly, we have jurisdiction to decide the mer-\nits of petitioners\u2019 constitutional claims. \nC. \nWe must decide one more threshold issue.  On June \n17, 2024, FCC filed a motion to dismiss on the that \nground issue preclusion bars the petition for review.  \nIn FCC\u2019s view, that is because petitioners raised identi-\ncal challenges to different USF quarterly contribution \nfactors in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits, and those \ncourts rejected petitioners\u2019 arguments.  But even if \nthere were something to FCC\u2019s issue preclusion argu-\nment, it fails because FCC forfeited it. \n\u201c[I]ssue preclusion[] is an affirmative defense.\u201d  Tay-\nlor v. Sturgell, 553 U.S. 880, 907 (2008).  That means \nthe party asserting preclusion ordinarily must timely \nraise it.  Ibid.; see 18A CHARLES ALAN WRIGHT, AR-\nTHUR R. MILLER, & EDWARD H. COOPER, FEDERAL \nPRACTICE & PROCEDURE \u00a7 4405 (3d ed. 2017).  Where, \nas here, an allegedly preclusive judgment is rendered \nafter suit is filed, the party \u201cwishing to raise [preclusion] \nis obliged to assert it at the earliest moment practica-\nble.\u201d  Home Depot, Inc. v. Guste, 773 F.2d 616, 620 n.4 \n(5th Cir. 1985); see Evans v. Syracuse City Sch. Dist., \n\n15a \n \n704 F.2d 44, 47 (2d Cir. 1983) (\u201c[T]he party wishing to \nraise [preclusion as a] defense is obliged to plead it at \nthe earliest possible moment.\u201d  (quotation omitted)); \nAetna Cas. & Sur. Co. v. Gen. Dynamics Corp., 968 F.2d \n707, 711 (8th Cir. 1992) (issue preclusion must be raised \n\u201cat the first reasonable opportunity after the rendering \nof the decision having the preclusive effect\u201d); Davignon \nv. Clemmey, 322 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2003) (holding that \ndistrict court abused its discretion by allowing defend-\nant to assert preclusion defense \u201cat the eleventh hour\u201d); \nGeorgia Pac. Consumer Prod., LP v. Von Drehle Corp., \n710 F.3d 527, 533 (4th Cir. 2013) (\u201cEven when a preclu-\nsion defense is not available at the outset of a case, a \nparty may waive such a defense arising during the \ncourse of litigation by waiting too long to assert the de-\nfense after it becomes available.\u201d); Arizona v. Califor-\nnia, 530 U.S. 392, 413 (2000) (holding that party could \nnot raise preclusion as a defense when party could have \nraised the defense earlier in the proceedings but did not, \n\u201cdespite ample opportunity and cause to do so\u201d). \nThat makes sense.  The policy underlying issue pre-\nclusion is based primarily on a \u201cdefendant\u2019s interest in \navoiding the burdens of twice defending a suit\u201d and \u201cthe \navoidance of unnecessary judicial waste.\u201d  Arizona, \n530 U.S. at 412 (quoting United States v. Sioux Nation, \n448 U.S. 371, 432 (1980) (Rehnquist, J., dissenting)).  \nIssue preclusion cannot serve either of those purposes if \nit is raised in the eleventh hour of proceedings, after the \ndefendant and the court have already carried all the bur-\ndens necessary to decide the case.  So even assuming \nFCC could defeat petitioners\u2019 claims on the ground the \nSixth and the Eleventh Circuits have rendered preclu-\nsive judgments, FCC was obliged to raise that issue \u201cat \n\n16a \n \nthe earliest moment practicable.\u201d  Guste, 773 F.2d at \n620 n.4. \nIt did not.  The first allegedly preclusive judgment \nFCC cites is the Sixth Circuit\u2019s judgment in Consumers\u2019 \nResearch v. FCC.  See 67 F.4th 773 (6th Cir. 2023), cert. \ndenied Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-456, 2024 WL \n2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024). That judgment bound six \nof the named petitioners in this case.3  And it was final \non June 7, 2023.  See Mandate Issued, Consumers\u2019 Rsch., \n67 F.4th 773 (No. 21-3886) (Jun. 7, 2023).  True, the pe-\ntitioners sought certiorari in that case.  But \u201cthe gen-\neral rule in American jurisprudence [is] that a final \njudgment of a court  . . .  can be given [preclusive] ef-\nfect even while an appeal is pending.\u201d  Prymer v. Og-\nden, 29 F.3d 1208, 1213 n.2 (7th Cir. 1994); see WRIGHT \n& MILLER, supra, \u00a7 4433 (\u201c[I]t is  . . .  held in federal \ncourts that the preclusive effects of a lower court judg-\nment cannot be suspended simply by taking an appeal \nthat remains undecided.\u201d); RESTATEMENT (SECOND) OF \nJUDGMENTS \u00a7 13, cmt. f (explaining a \u201cjudgment other-\nwise final\u201d for purposes of the law of res judicata should \n\u201cremain[] so despite the taking of an appeal\u201d). \nThat means FCC could have asserted preclusion \nagainst six petitioners on June 7, 2023.  At the very \nleast, FCC could have raised preclusion in its supple-\nmental brief, which it filed on August 30, 2023.  But \nFCC did not do so.  Instead, it waited more than a year \nand then filed a tardy motion to dismiss at the eleventh \nhour.  FCC therefore forfeited its preclusion defense \n \n3  Consumers\u2019 Research, Cause Based Commerce, Deanna Roth, \nJeremy Roth, Joseph Bayly, Lynn Gibbs, and Paul Gibbs. \n\n17a \n \nwith respect to at least six petitioners.4  So there is no \ndoubt we may proceed to the merits of those petitioners\u2019 \nclaims. \nFCC also cites the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment in \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 88 F.4th 917, 923 (11th Cir. \n2023), cert. denied Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, \n2024 WL 2883755 (U.S. June 10, 2024).  That judgment \nbound all the petitioners in this case, including the six \nwho were parties to the Sixth Circuit proceeding. But \nthat another allegedly preclusive judgment was ren-\ndered during the course of this proceeding does not \nchange the fact that FCC had a purported preclusion \ndefense against six petitioners as of June 7, 2023.  And \neven if the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment somehow gave \nFCC a new window to raise a preclusion defense against \nthose petitioners, the window closed before FCC raised \nit.  The Eleventh Circuit\u2019s judgment was final (and \ntherefore had preclusive effect) on February 5, 2024.  \nSee Mandate Issued, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 \nF.4th 917 (No. 22-13315) (Feb. 5, 2024).  FCC nonethe-\nless waited to file a motion to dismiss on the basis of that \njudgment until June 17, 2024\u2014more than four months \nlater. \nThere may sometimes be ambiguity about whether a \ndefendant carried its obligation to raise a preclusion de-\nfense \u201cat the earliest moment practicable.\u201d  Guste, 773 \nF.2d at 620 n.4.  But this is not a close case.  Litigants \nordinarily have 21 days to plead an affirmative defense.  \nSee FED. R. CIV. P. 12(a)(1)(A)(ii); see also WRIGHT & \nMILLER, supra, \u00a7 1394 (noting affirmative defenses are \n \n4  Including Cause Based Commerce, who certainly has standing.  \nSee supra, at 11. \n\n18a \n \nforfeited if they are not raised in responsive pleadings). \nThere is no reason a party should have six times that \nmany days to raise an affirmative defense to a petition \nfor review. So even if we thought FCC could have as-\nserted preclusion against all the petitioners within a rea-\nsonable time after the Eleventh Circuit rendered judg-\nment, we would hold FCC failed to do so. \nIn sum, FCC forfeited any preclusion defense.  \nTrue, we have discretion to forgive a forfeiture in \u201cex-\ntraordinary circumstances\u201d\u2014as where \u201ca miscarriage \nof justice would result from our failure to consider\u201d the \nforfeited argument.  See, e.g., AG Acceptance Corp. v. \nVeigel, 564 F.3d 695, 700 (5th Cir. 2009).  But FCC does \nnot supply any reason to think a miscarriage of justice \nwould result from our reaching the merits of petitioners\u2019 \nclaims.  See ibid. (explaining the burden of establishing \nextraordinary circumstances is on the party seeking re-\nview).  And we cannot think of one.  In fact, if we do \nnot decide the constitutional questions presented in this \ncase, we will have to decide them in a pending challenge \nthat includes petitioners who were not parties to the \nSixth or Eleventh Circuit proceedings.  See Petition \nfor Review, Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, No. 24-60330 \n(5th Cir. Jun. 27, 2024).  It effects no injustice to hold \nFCC to its forfeiture.5 \n \n5  FCC convinced the Supreme Court to deny certiorari in the \nSixth and Eleventh Circuit cases in part by explaining the Court \nwould have another chance to consider the constitutionality of the \nUSF after this court\u2019s en banc ruling.  See Br. in Opp\u2019n 17-18, \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, Nos. 23-456, 23-743 (U.S. May 3, 2024) \n(\u201c[T]he en banc Fifth Circuit has not yet issued its decision in that \ncase.  Once it does so, the parties can determine whether to seek, \nand this Court can determine whether to grant, certiorari to review \n \n\n19a \n \n* * * \nWe therefore proceed to the merits. Our review is de \nnovo.  See Huwaei Tech. USA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, \n434 (5th Cir. 2021). \nIII. \nPetitioners contend the universal service contribu-\ntion mechanism violates the Legislative Vesting Clause.  \nSee U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1 (\u201cAll legislative Powers herein \ngranted shall be vested in a Congress of the United \nStates, which shall consist of a Senate and House of Rep-\nresentatives.\u201d).  We agree.  We (A) explain that the \npower to levy USF \u201ccontributions\u201d is the power to tax\u2014\na quintessentially legislative power.  Then we (B) ex-\nplain that Congress through 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 may have \ndelegated legislative power to FCC because it pur-\nported to confer upon FCC the power to tax without sup-\nplying an intelligible principle to guide FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion.  Next, we (C) explain that FCC may have imper-\nmissibly delegated the taxing power to private entities.  \nFinally, we (D) explain that we need not definitively an-\nswer either delegation question because even if \u00a7 254 \ncontains an intelligible principle, and even if FCC was \npermitted to enlist private entities to determine how \nmuch universal service tax revenue it should raise, the \ncombination of Congress\u2019s broad delegation to FCC and \nFCC\u2019s subdelegation to private entities certainly amounts \nto a constitutional violation. \n \nthat decision.\u201d).  Had FCC told the Supreme Court it thought pe-\ntitioners\u2019 claims in this court were issue precluded, the Court might \nhave granted certiorari in those other cases.  It would be unjust \nto allow FCC to raise an issue to evade en banc review so soon after \nit hid that issue to evade Supreme Court review. \n\n20a \n \nA. \nSection 254(d) provides that \u201c[e]very telecommunica-\ntions carrier that provides interstate telecommunica-\ntions services shall contribute, on an equitable and non-\ndiscriminatory basis, to the specific, predictable, and \nsufficient mechanisms established by the Commission  \nto preserve and advance universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(d).  Pursuant to this authority, FCC mandates \nthat \u201ctelecommunications carriers  . . .  must con-\ntribute to the universal service support mechanisms.\u201d  \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706(a).  USAC determines carriers\u2019 \nUSF contribution obligations on a quarterly basis by \n\u201capply[ing] the quarterly contribution factor  . . .  to \n[each carriers\u2019] interstate and  international  end-user  \ntelecommunications  revenues.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  \nThe result is a USAC-fashioned USF Tax. \nFCC\u2019s principal defense of the USF scheme is that \nthe USF Tax is not really a tax at all.  Rather, FCC \ncontends, it is a fee.  That is because, FCC reasons, a \nfee is a charge that \u201cbestows a benefit on the [payor], \nnot shared by other members of society.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Cable \nTelevision Ass\u2019n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 341 \n(1974).  And FCC thinks universal service contribu-\ntions comport with that definition because telecommuni-\ncations carriers pay them, and because they are used to \nfund the universal service program, which \u201cconfers spe-\ncial benefits on contributing carriers by (among other \nthings) expanding the network such carriers can serve.\u201d \nFCC EB Br. 51. \nBut FCC misunderstands the nature of the inquiry. \nA fee has three characteristics:  First, fees are in-\ncurred \u201cincident to a voluntary act.\u201d  Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 \nU.S. at 341; see also Krotoszynski, Jr., Reconsidering \n\n21a \n \nthe Nondelegation Doctrine, supra, at 270 (\u201cA \u2018fee\u2019 con-\nstitutes a charge that an agency exacts in return for a \nbenefit voluntarily sought by the payer.\u201d).  For exam-\nple, \u201c[a] public agency might charge a user fee to visit a \npublic park, tour a museum, or enter a toll road.\u201d  \nTrafigura Trading LLC v. United States, 29 F.4th 286, \n293 (5th Cir. 2022) (Opinion of Ho, J.); see also ibid. (not-\ning that fees \u201carise in the context of value-for-value trans-\nactions\u201d between individuals and government).  The \ngovernment may also charge fees designed to defray the \ncost of providing benefits to a regulated party, but only \nif the fees charged represent a \u201cfair approximation of \nservices, facilities, or benefits furnished.\u201d  United \nStates v. U.S. Shoe Corp., 523 U.S. 360, 363 (1998).  \nSecond, a fee generally is \u201cimposed by an administrative \nagency upon only those persons, or entities, subject to \nits regulation for regulatory purposes.\u201d  Valero Ter-\nrestrial Corp. v. Caffrey, 205 F.3d 130, 134 (4th Cir. \n2000).  And third, the revenue the government raises \nthrough its collection of fees is used to supply benefits \ninuring to the persons or entities paying them rather \nthan to the public generally.  See Skinner v. Mid-Am. \nPipeline Co., 490 U.S. 212, 223 (1989) (quoting Nat\u2019l Ca-\nble, 415 U.S. at 343). \nUniversal service contributions do not have any of \nthese characteristics.  First, they are not incident to a \nvoluntary act but rather are a condition of doing busi-\nness in the telecommunications industry.  See 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(d).  Nor do they represent a fair approxi-\nmation of the benefits conferred by government regula-\ntion on telecommunications carriers.  In fact, they are \nnot related to regulatory costs at all.  They are de-\nsigned to fund telecommunications subsidies to schools, \nlibraries, healthcare facilities, and low-income individu-\n\n22a \n \nals.  Second, the cost of universal service contributions \nis not borne by parties FCC regulates. While FCC for-\nmally imposes the charges on telecommunications carri-\ners, carriers overwhelmingly pass the cost of contribu-\ntions on to consumers, as is expressly permitted by FCC \nregulation.  See FCC, REPORT TO CONGRESS, supra, at \n45-46; 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a).  So the cost of universal \nservice contributions is widely shared by the population \nin a manner reminiscent of a \u201cclassic tax.\u201d  See Valero, \n205 F.3d at 134 (\u201cThe \u2018classic tax\u2019 is imposed by the leg-\nislature upon a large segment of society.\u201d).  And third, \nthe benefits associated with universal service contribu-\ntions \u201cinure to the benefit of the public\u201d\u2014or more accu-\nrately to the benefit of those fortunate enough to receive \nsubsidies from USAC\u2014rather than to the benefit of the \npersons who pay them.  Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223 (quot-\ning Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 343).  There is no overlap \nat all between the class of USF beneficiaries (recipients \nof subsidized telecommunications services) and the class \nof USF contributors (American telecommunications \nconsumers who see USF charges on their phone bills \neach month). \nThink about the consequences of FCC\u2019s position: \n\u2022 Congress could fund Medicare and Medicaid with-\nout \u201ctaxing\u201d anyone.  It could simply allow hospi-\ntal executives to set the Medicare-Medicaid budget, \nthen have HHS rubber-stamp the hospitals\u2019 health-\ncare taxes, which could then be passed through to \nconsumers\u2019 hospital bills. \n\u2022 Congress could fund the Supplemental Nutrition \nAssistance Program (\u201cSNAP\u201d) without \u201ctaxing\u201d \nanyone.  It could simply allow grocery store exec-\nutives to set the SNAP budget, then have USDA \n\n23a \n \nrubber-stamp the grocers\u2019 SNAP taxes, which \ncould then be passed through to consumers at the \ncheckout register. \n\u2022 Congress could fund affordable housing without \n\u201ctaxing\u201d anyone.  It could simply allow real estate \ncompanies to set the affordable housing budget, \nthen have HUD rubber-stamp the companies  \naffordable-housing taxes, which could then be \npassed through to consumers as new line items at \nclosing or in monthly surcharges for rent. \nWe could go on.  But you get the point:  All of these \nare obviously taxes.  So while \u201c[d]istinguishing a tax \nfrom a fee often is a difficult task,\u201d Tex. Ent. Ass\u2019n, Inc. \nv. Hegar, 10 F.4th 495, 505 (5th Cir. 2021) (citation omit-\nted), the analysis here is straightforward.  Congress \nhas bestowed upon FCC the power to levy taxes, and we \naccordingly conclude that it has delegated its taxing \npower.6 \nB. \nIn \u00a7 254 of the Telecommunications Act, Congress \ndelegated its taxing power to FCC.  The power to tax \nis a quintessentially legislative one.  See U.S. CONST. \nart. 1, \u00a7 8, cl. 1; see also Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340 \n(\u201cTaxation is a legislative function, and Congress  . . .  \nis the sole organ for levying taxes.\u201d); MICHAEL W. \nMCCONNELL, THE PRESIDENT WHO WOULD NOT BE \n \n6  The fact that Congress euphemistically labeled these universal \nservice charges \u201ccontribution[s],\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), is irrelevant.  \n\u201cCongress cannot change whether an exaction is a tax  . . .  for \nconstitutional purposes simply by\u201d relabeling it.  Nat\u2019l Fed\u2019n of \nIndep. Bus. v. Sebelius, 567 U.S. 519, 544 (2012) (emphasis in orig-\ninal). \n\n24a \n \nKING 334 (2020) (noting that domestic taxation is \u201cespe-\ncially central to the legislative branch\u201d).  So \u00a7 254 is \nconstitutional only if it passes nondelegation muster.  \nWe (1) explain the nondelegation doctrine as articulated \nby the Supreme Court. Then we (2) explain the breadth \nof Congress\u2019s delegation to FCC.  Lastly, we (3) ex-\nplain that the Supreme Court has never upheld a dele-\ngation of core legislative power as sweeping as the one \ncontained in \u00a7 254. \nThe Constitution vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted\u201d \u201c in a Congress of the United States.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1.  \u201cAccompanying that assign-\nment of power to Congress is a bar on its further dele-\ngation.\u201d Gundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 \n(2019) (plurality op.). Moreover, \u201cthe principle of sepa-\nration of powers that underlies our tripartite system of \nGovernment\u201d independently compels the conclusion \nthat Congress, not agencies, must make legislative deci-\nsions.  Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 371 \n(1989); see Gundy, 588 U.S. at 153 (Gorsuch, J., dissent-\ning) (\u201c[I]t would frustrate the system of government or-\ndained by the Constitution if Congress could merely an-\nnounce vague aspirations and then assign others the re-\nsponsibility of adopting legislation to realize its goals.\u201d \n(quotation omitted)).  So there is no doubt that \u201cthe \nlawmaking function belongs to Congress,\u201d Loving v. \nUnited States, 517 U.S. 748, 758 (1996), and that Con-\ngress \u201cmay not constitutionally delegate that power to \nanother\u201d constitutional actor, Touby v. United States, \n500 U.S. 160, 165 (1991). \nBut \u201c[t]he Constitution has never been regarded as \ndenying to the Congress the necessary resources of flex-\nibility and practicality, which will enable it to perform \n\n25a \n \nits function.\u201d  Panama Refin. Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. \n388, 421 (1935).  So the Supreme Court has held that \ndelegations are constitutional so long as Congress \n\u201clay[s] down by legislative act an intelligible principle to \nwhich the person or body authorized [to exercise the del-\negated authority] is directed to conform.\u201d  J.W. Hamp-\nton, Jr., & Co. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). \nStill, \u201cthere are limits of delegation which there is no \nconstitutional authority to transcend.\u201d  Panama Re-\nfin., 293 U.S. at 430.  And for good reason.  Vague \ncongressional delegations undermine representative \ngovernment because they give unelected bureaucrats\u2014\nrather than elected representatives\u2014the final say over \nmatters that affect the lives, liberty, and property of \nAmericans.  See Tiger Lily, LLC v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Hous. \n& Urb. Dev., 5 F.4th 666, 674 (6th Cir. 2021) (Thapar, J., \nconcurring) (\u201cBy shifting responsibility to a less ac-\ncountable branch, Congress  . . .  deprives the people \nof the say the framers intended them to have.\u201d).  \nOverly broad delegations also obscure accountability:  \nWhen elected representatives shirk hard choices, con-\nstituents do not know whom to hold accountable for gov-\nernment action.  See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 156 (Gorsuch, \nJ., dissenting).  And they offend the deliberation- \nforcing features of the constitutionally prescribed legis-\nlative process.  See U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 7; John Man-\nning, Lawmaking Made Easy, 10 GREEN BAG 2d 191, \n202 (2007) (\u201c[B]icameralism and presentment make law-\nmaking difficult by design.\u201d  (emphasis in original)); \nsee also THE FEDERALIST No. 73 (A. Hamilton) (noting \nthat the Constitution prescribed elaborate procedures \nfor lawmaking because \u201c[t]he oftener the measure is \nbrought under examination, the greater the diversity in \nthe situations of those who are to examine it, the less \n\n26a \n \nmust be the danger of those errors which flow from want \nof due deliberation, or of those missteps which proceed \nfrom the contagion of some common passion or inter-\nest.\u201d). \nSo while \u201cthe Supreme Court has not in the past sev-\neral decades held that Congress failed to provide a req-\nuisite intelligible principle,\u201d Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th \n446, 462 (5th Cir. 2022), aff\u200a\u2019d on other grounds, 144 S. \nCt. 2117 (2024), \u201c[t]hat does not mean  . . .  we must \nrubber-stamp all delegations of legislative power,\u201d Big \nTime Vapes, Inc. v. FDA., 963 F.3d 436, 443 (5th Cir. \n2020).  Rather, \u201c[w]e ought not to shy away from our \njudicial duty to invalidate unconstitutional delegations.\u201d  \nIbid.  (quotation omitted). \n2. \nNondelegation inquiries \u201calways begin[]  . . .  \nwith statutory interpretation\u201d because the constitu-\ntional question is whether Congress has supplied a suf-\nficiently intelligible principle to guide an agency\u2019s dis-\ncretion.  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135 (plurality op.).  So we \nmust construe \u201cthe challenged statute to figure out what \ntask it delegates and what instructions it provides.\u201d  \nId. at 136.  Petitioners challenge the USF\u2019s funding \nmechanism, so we must consider whether 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254 sufficiently instructs FCC regarding how much it \nshould tax Americans to pay for the universal service \nprogram. \nTwo of \u00a7 254\u2019s subsections are relevant:  \u00a7 254(d) \nprovides that USF funding should be \u201csufficient  . . .  \nto preserve and advance universal service,\u201d and \u00a7 254(b)(1) \nsuggests that telecommunications services \u201cshould be \navailable at  . . .  affordable rates.\u201d \n\n27a \n \nThese statutory phrases supply no principle at all. \nStart with sufficiency.  That funding should be \u201csuffi-\ncient  . . .  to preserve and advance universal ser-\nvice\u201d is meaningful only if the concept of universal ser-\nvice is sufficiently intelligible.  It is not.  Rather, uni-\nversal service is \u201can evolving level of telecommunica-\ntions services that the Commission shall establish peri-\nodically\u201d by determining what telecommunications ser-\nvices are \u201cessential to education, public health, or public \nsafety\u201d; are \u201csubscribed to by a substantial majority of \nresidential customers\u201d; are \u201cdeployed  . . .  by tele-\ncommunications carriers\u201d; or are otherwise \u201cconsistent \nwith the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c).  That is a lot of words, but they \namount to a concept of universal service so amorphous \nthat Congress\u2019s instruction to raise \u201csufficient\u201d funds \namounts to a suggestion that FCC exact as much tax \nrevenue for universal service projects as FCC thinks is \ngood.  Cf. Gary Lawson, Delegation and Original Mean-\ning, 88 VA. L. REV. 327, 339-40 (2002) (describing conse-\nquences of congressional enactment that requires \n\u201c\u200a\u2018goodness and niceness\u2019\u200a\u201d). \nThat \u00a7 254(b) supplies minimal guidance on the con-\ntours of Congress\u2019s idea of an ideal universal service pol-\nicy is no answer.  That is for three reasons.  First, we \nhave previously accepted FCC\u2019s contention that \u201cnoth-\ning in [\u00a7 254] defines \u2018sufficient\u2019 to mean that universal \nservice support must equal the actual costs incurred by\u201d \ntelecommunications carriers contributing to the USF.  \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412.  So FCC\u2019s universal service \ntaxation is not formally limited by the amount it dis-\nburses on universal service projects.  Nothing in the \nstatute precludes FCC from, for example, imposing the \nUSF Tax to create an endowment that it could use to \n\n28a \n \nfund whatever projects it might like.  FCC has never \ndone so, but the fact \u201cthat the recipients of illicitly dele-\ngated authority opted not to make use of it is no anti-\ndote.  It is Congress\u2019s decision to delegate that is un-\nconstitutional.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of Am. Rail-\nroads (\u201cAmtrak II\u201d), 575 U.S. 43, 62 (2015) (Alito, J., \nconcurring) (emphasis in original) (quotation omitted) \n(quoting Ass\u2019n of Am. Railroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp. \n(\u201cAmtrak I\u201d), 721 F.3d 666, 674 (D.C. Cir. 2013), vacated \nand remanded sub nom. Amtrak II, 575 U.S. 43); see \nWhitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019n, 531 U.S. 457, 472 \n(2001) (\u201cWe have never suggested that an agency can \ncure an unlawful delegation of legislative power by \nadopting in its discretion a limiting construction of the \nstatute.\u201d). \nSecond, even if FCC\u2019s power to levy taxes were lim-\nited by the amount it disburses on universal service pro-\njects, subsection (b) still would not curb FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion because we have explained it sets out \u201caspirational\u201d \nprinciples rather than \u201cinexorable statutory com-\nmand[s].\u201d  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 421; see also Tex. Off. \nof Pub. Util. Couns. v. FCC, 265 F.3d 313, 321 (5th Cir. \n2001).  And even if the principles in subsection (b) were \nmore than aspirational, they still would not meaning-\nfully limit FCC because \u00a7 254(b)(7) vests FCC with dis-\ncretion to formulate \u201cother principles\u201d so long as it con-\nsiders the additional principles to be \u201cnecessary and ap-\npropriate for the protection of the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity and  . . .  consistent with\u201d \nthe rest of Chapter 5 of Title 47 of the United States \nCode.  In other words, FCC \u201cmay roam at will,\u201d A.L.A. \nSchechter Poultry Corp. v. United States, 295 U.S. 495, \n538 (1935), disregarding \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s enumerated princi-\nples altogether when it thinks the \u201cpublic interest\u201d  \n\n29a \n \nwarrants the journey.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(D); id.  \n\u00a7 254(b)(7). \nThird, even if the principles in \u00a7 254(b) in some way \nbind FCC, they are contentless in important respects. \nFor example, \u00a7 254(b)(6) suggests that \u201c[e]lementary \nand secondary schools and classrooms  . . .  and li-\nbraries should have access to advanced telecommunica-\ntions services as described in subsection (h).\u201d  But sub-\nsection (h) says only that \u201celementary schools, second-\nary schools, and libraries\u201d should have access to tele-\ncommunications services \u201cfor educational purposes at \nrates less than the amounts charged for similar services \nto other parties.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B).  Which services?  \nPresumably those FCC thinks are \u201cessential to educa-\ntion\u201d or otherwise within the ambit of its self-defined \nuniversal service utopia.  Id. \u00a7 254(c).  But how is \nFCC to make that determination?  And which schools \nand libraries should receive subsidized services?  And \nhow much less should they pay? \nCongress never said.  FCC has answered some of \nthese questions, see 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.501, .502, .505, but \nit remains a mystery how we are supposed to \u201cascertain \nwhether the will of Congress has been obeyed.\u201d  Mis-\ntretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (citation omitted).  Each of the \n\u201caspirational\u201d universal service principles in \u00a7 254(b) & \n(c) is inapposite.7  So apparently your guess is as good \n \n7  Section 254(c)(1)(B) suggests low-income consumers should \nhave access to telecommunications services comparable to those \nsubscribed to by unsubsidized residential customers.  And \u00a7 254(b)(3) \ntells FCC to make telecommunications services available in rural \nareas at rates comparable to those charged in urban areas.  Those \nprovisions may supply sufficient guidance for FCC to execute cer-\ntain aspects of the universal service program.  But nothing in the \n \n\n30a \n \nas ours is as good as FCC\u2019s is as good as any random \nAmerican taxpayer\u2019s. And funding for schools and li-\nbraries is not merely an interstitial gap in the statutory \nscheme.  It constituted more than a third of the contri-\nbution amount that gave rise to these proceedings. See \nJA.101.8 \nSo if \u00a7 254(b) binds at all, it is apparent that the only \nreal constraint on FCC\u2019s discretion to levy excise taxes \non telecommunications carriers (and American consum-\ners in turn) is that rates \u201cshould\u201d remain \u201caffordable.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1); see Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at \n794 (\u201c[E]xcess subsidization in some cases may detract \nfrom universal service by causing rates unnecessarily to \nrise, thereby pricing some consumers out of the mar-\nket.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  But saying telecommunica-\ntions services \u201cshould\u201d remain \u201caffordable\u201d amounts to \n\u201cno guidance whatsoever.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 462 \n(emphasis in original).  How is FCC to determine \nwhether the USF Tax it mandates has made telecommu-\nnications services unaffordable?  The demand for cell \nphones is uncommonly inelastic because cell phones are \n \nstatute remotely suggests FCC should provide universal service \nfunding only to low-income or rural schools.  So \u00a7\u00a7 (b)(3) and \n(c)(1)(B) cannot supply the limiting principle that \u00a7 (h)(1)(B) lacks. \nAnd the fact that FCC has limited universal service funding to low-\nincome schools is, once again, irrelevant.  See Am. Trucking, 531 \nU.S. at 472.  The question is whether the statute itself in any way \nlimits FCC\u2019s discretion to supply universal service funding for ed-\nucational programs, and it plainly does not. \n8  Both dissenting opinions contend 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 is loaded with \nintelligible principles.  See post, at 77-82 (Stewart, J., dissenting); \nid. at 101-02 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But neither identifies \nany principle that might guide FCC in determining how much less \nschools and libraries should pay for telecommunications services. \n\n31a \n \nessential to participation in the modern world.  See \nCarpenter v. United States, 138 S. Ct. 2206, 2220 (2018) \n(\u201c[C]ell phones and the services they provide are such a \npervasive and insistent part of daily life that carrying \none is indispensable to participation in modern society.\u201d  \n(citation and quotation omitted)).  That means the \nFCC could impose eye-watering USF Taxes while also \narguing with a straight face that cell phones remain \u201caf-\nfordable\u201d in the sense that most Americans would choose \nto keep using them.  And that means \u00a7 254 leaves FCC \n\u2014and as importantly reviewing courts9\u2014utterly at sea.  \nIs a 25% excise tax excessively burdensome under  \n\u00a7 254(b)(1)?  250%?  2500%?  There are no answers \nbecause Congress never gave them. \nFinally, the breadth of \u00a7 254\u2019s delegation is especially \ntroubling because the statute insulates FCC from the \nprincipal tool Congress has to control FCC\u2019s universal \nservice decisions\u2014the appropriations power.  See U.S. \nConst. art. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7 (\u201cNo Money shall be drawn from \nthe Treasury, but in Consequence of Appropriations \nmade by Law.\u201d).  Ordinarily, when Congress delegates \nbroadly, it retains a residuum of control over agency ac-\ntion because the agency is powerless to act without a \ncongressional appropriation of funds.

So even when statutes vest \nagencies with significant discretion, the appropriations \nprocess generally ensures agencies remain subservient \nto the will of the people as expressed through their elec-\nted representatives.  See Jonathan H. Adler & Chris-\ntopher J. Walker, Delegation and Time, 105 IOWA L. \nREV. 1931, 1957 (2020) (cataloguing examples and noting \nthat \u201c[l]imiting appropriations is an effective way to \nlimit an agency\u2019s exercise of delegated power\u201d). \nHere, though, Congress cannot exercise control by \nlimiting appropriations because the whole point of USF \nis to fund universal service outside the regular appro-\npriations process.10  And since FCC commissioners are \n \n10 FCC has concluded that 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 constitutes \u201ca perma-\nnent indefinite appropriation.\u201d  GAO-05-151, GREATER INVOLVE-\nMENT NEEDED BY FCC IN THE MANAGEMENT AND OVERSIGHT OF \nTHE E-RATE PROGRAM 11 (2005), https://perma.cc/QNU6-YEFS.  \nIf we had to decide whether \u00a7 254 comports with the Appropria-\ntions Clause, U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 1, cl. 9, we would apply the Su-\npreme Court\u2019s decision in CFPB v. Cmty. Fin. Servs. Ass\u2019n of Am., \nLtd., 601 U.S. 416 (2024).  But we need not decide that question \nbecause Petitioners did not formally raise an Appropriations \nClause challenge.  Our point is only that, to the extent Congress\u2019s \nability to control agencies through regular appropriations supplies \nsome justification for broad delegations, see, e.g., Christopher J. \nWalker, Restoring Congress\u2019s Role in the Modern Administrative \nState, 116 MICH. L. REV. 1101, 1116 (2018) (explaining the tools \nCongress has, including the appropriations power, \u201cto rein in the \nadministrative state and prevent federal agencies from abusing \n \n\n33a \n \nremovable by the President only for-cause, see 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 154(c)(1)(A), the connection between FCC policy deci-\nsions made pursuant to \u00a7 254 and any democratically ac-\ncountable federal official is extremely attenuated. \n3. \nThe Supreme Court has \u201cover and over upheld even \nvery broad delegations.\u201d  Gundy, 588 U.S. at 146 (plu-\nrality op.).  But it has also suggested the scope of per-\nmissible delegation varies with context.  See Am. Truck-\ning, 531 U.S. at 475 (\u201c[T]he degree of agency discretion \nthat is acceptable varies according to the scope of the \npower congressionally conferred.\u201d); J.W. Hampton, 276 \nU.S. at 406 (\u201cIn determining what [Congress] may do in \nseeking assistance from another branch, the extent and \ncharacter of that assistence [sic] must be fixed accord-\ning to common sense and the inherent necessities of the \ngovernmental co-ordination.\u201d); Loving, 517 U.S. at 768 \n(noting the general rule that \u201ca constitutional power im-\nplies a power of delegation of authority under it suffi-\ncient to effect its purposes\u201d (emphasis added)) (quoting \nLichter v. United States, 334 U.S. 742, 778 (1948)); \nLichter, 334 U.S. at 778-79 (suggesting Congress may \ndelegate its war powers more broadly); Panama Refin., \n293 U.S. at 422 (same).  So the fact that the Court has \nupheld certain broad delegations does not necessarily \ndictate that we uphold \u00a7 254\u2019s delegation of power to \nFCC to levy taxes on American consumers.  And \u00a7 254 \nappears unlike any delegation the Court has ever \nblessed. \n \ntheir consolidated lawmaking and law-execution powers\u201d), that jus-\ntification is absent here. \n\n34a \n \nFor starters, the Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \u201cju-\nrisprudence has been driven by a practical understand-\ning that in our increasingly complex society, replete with \never changing and more technical problems, Congress \nsimply cannot do its job absent an ability to delegate \npower under broad general directives.\u201d  Mistretta, 488 \nU.S. at 372 (emphasis added).  So the Court has deemed \nit constitutionally sufficient for Congress to make a pol-\nicy judgment and then direct an agency to give that \njudgment effect through the application of technical \nknowledge. \nFor example, in American Trucking, 531 U.S. 457, \nthe Court considered a congressional directive to EPA \nto set ambient air quality standards for certain pollu-\ntants.  Id. at 472.  It held that the statute supplied an \nintelligible principle because it required EPA to set air \nquality standards \u201crequisite to protect the public \nhealth\u201d \u201cfor a discrete set of pollutants\u201d based on \u201cthe \nlatest scientific knowledge.\u201d  Id. at 472-73.  In other \nwords, the statute was constitutional because Congress \nmade the crucial policy judgment\u2014that the public \nshould be protected from harmful pollutants\u2014 and then \nrelied on EPA to give effect to that judgment through \nthe application of its scientific expertise.11  See Gundy, \n588 U.S. at 166 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (explaining that \nthe \u201cmost important[]\u201d question in the intelligible prin-\nciple inquiry is whether \u201cCongress, and not the Execu-\ntive Branch, ma[d]e the policy judgments\u201d). \n \n11 The Court upheld the delegation only after deciding that the \nstatute in question \u201cunambiguously bar[red] cost considerations \nfrom the NAAQS-setting process.\u201d  Id. at 471; see also id. at 473-\n74 (noting the statute \u201cdid not permit economic costs to be consid-\nered\u201d). \n\n35a \n \nHere, in contrast, Congress did not delegate because \nFCC has some superior technical knowledge about the \noptimal amount of universal service funding.  No such \nknowledge exists because determining the ideal size of \na welfare program involves policy judgments, not tech-\nnical ones.  And under our Constitution, those judg-\nments usually are Congress\u2019s to make. \nIn fact, in every case where the Court has upheld a \ncongressional delegation of its prerogative to make sig-\nnificant policy judgments, there has been some special \njustification.  In Mistretta, for example, the Court con-\nsidered a congressional delegation of authority to Arti-\ncle III judges to promulgate sentencing guidelines.  \nFew things are more policy-laden than criminal sentenc-\ning decisions, but the Court found the delegation per-\nmissible because \u201cthe Judiciary always has played, and \ncontinues to play, [a role] in sentencing.\u201d  Mistretta, \n488 U.S. at 391; see also ibid. (\u201cJust as the rules of pro-\ncedure bind judges and courts in the proper manage-\nment of the cases before them, so the Guidelines bind \njudges and courts in the exercise of their uncontested \nresponsibility to pass sentence in criminal cases.  In \nother words, the Commission\u2019s functions, like this \nCourt\u2019s function in promulgating procedural rules, are \nclearly attendant to a central element of the historically \nacknowledged mission of the Judicial Branch.\u201d). \nSimilarly, in National Broadcasting Co. v. United \nStates, 319 U.S. 190 (1943), the Court upheld a delega-\ntion to FCC to regulate broadcasting \u201cas public conven-\nience, interest, or necessity requires.  . . .  \u201d  Id. at  \n214.

See, e.g., Yakus, 321 U.S. at 420 (upholding a del-\negation to the agency to fix the prices of commodities at \na level that \u201cwill be generally fair and equitable and will \neffectuate the purposes of the Act.\u201d  (citation omit-\nted)); Am. Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 97 \n(1946) (upholding a delegation to SEC to modify the \nstructure of holding company systems so as to ensure \nthat they are not \u201cunduly or unnecessarily complicated\u201d \nand do not \u201cunfairly or inequitably distribute voting \npower among security holders.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  \nBut careful consideration reveals that the statutes con-\nsidered in all these cases limited agency discretion enough \nthat, at the very least, reviewing courts could \u201cascertain \nwhether the will of Congress ha[d] been obeyed.\u201d  Mis-\ntretta, 488 U.S. at 379 (quoting Yakus, 321 U.S. at 425-\n26). \nIn Yakus, for example, Congress directed the admin-\nistrator responsible for ensuring \u201cfair and equitable\u201d \nprices to \u201cascertain and give due consideration to the \nprices prevailing\u201d in a particular two-week period, and \nto make adjustments for relevant factors including \n\n38a \n \n\u201c[s]peculative fluctuations, general increases or de-\ncreases in costs of production, distribution, and trans-\nportation, and general increases or decreases in profits \nearned by sellers of the commodity or commodities, dur-\ning and subsequent to the year ended October 1, 1941.\u201d  \n321 U.S. at 421 (citation omitted).  It can hardly be con-\ntended that the executive wanted for legislative direc-\ntion under this statute, or that reviewing courts lacked \nworkable standards.  See id. at 426 (noting that \u201cthe \nstandards prescribed by the  . . .  Act\u201d were \u201csuffi-\nciently definite and precise to enable Congress, the \ncourts and the public to ascertain whether the Adminis-\ntrator, in fixing the designated prices, has conformed to \nthose standards\u201d).  Similarly in American Power & \nLight Co., the Court found that \u201ca veritable code of \nrules\u201d set out in other sections of the statute clarified \nthe ambiguities inherent in the phrases \u201cunduly or un-\nnecessarily complicate[d]\u201d and \u201cunfairly or inequitably \ndistribute[d]\u201d such that courts would have no trouble \ntesting SEC\u2019s policies against the law.  329 U.S. at 104- \n05. \nThe Court\u2019s other nondelegation precedents are in \naccord.  The statute considered in J.W. Hampton, 276 \nU.S. 394, simply directed the President to impose tariffs \nthat would \u201cequalize\u201d the relative costs of production for \nAmerican companies and their foreign counterparts\u2014a \nfact-finding role. Id. at 401; see also Gundy, 588 U.S. at \n163 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (noting that the statute \nmay have required the President to make \u201cintricate cal-\nculations, but it could be argued that Congress had \nmade all the relevant policy decisions, and the Court\u2019s \nreference to an \u2018intelligible principle\u2019 was just another \nway to describe the traditional rule that Congress may \nleave the executive the responsibility to find facts and \n\n39a \n \nfill up details.\u201d).  And the term \u201cpublic interest\u201d in  \n\u00a7 407 of the Transportation Act of 1920 was shorthand \nfor a congressional instruction to the Interstate Com-\nmerce Commission to ensure that proposed railroad \nconsolidation would not result in deteriorating service \nquality or unreasonable or discriminatory rates\u2014an in-\nstruction with discernible content in light of the common \nlaw of common carriers.  See N.Y. Cent. Sec.

The purpose of the \nAct, the requirements it imposes, and the context of the \nprovision in question show the contrary.\u201d); Herbert \nHovenkamp, Regulatory Conflict in the Gilded Age: \nFederalism and the Railroad Problem, 97 YALE L.J. \n1017, 1045 (1988) (\u201cAs early as the 17th century, the \ncommon law had derived the duty to charge reasonable \nrates from the common carrier\u2019s obligation to serve eve-\nryone.  . . .  \u201d).  And the statute considered in \nTouby \u201cmeaningfully constrain[ed] the Attorney Gen-\neral\u2019s discretion\u201d because it directed the Attorney Gen-\neral to ban drugs only after making a factual determina-\ntion that there was a history of significant abuse that \nthreatened the public health.  See 500 U.S. at 166; see \nalso Gundy, 588 U.S. at 166 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(noting that in Touby the Court \u201cstressed all [the statu-\ntory] constraints on the Attorney General\u2019s discretion  \n. . .  to indicate that the statute supplied an \u2018intelligi-\nble principle\u2019 because it assigned an essentially fact-\nfinding responsibility to the executive.\u201d  (emphasis in \noriginal)).  And the statute considered in Lichter, 334 \nU.S. 742\u2014which authorized the executive to recoup \u201cex-\ncessive profits\u201d on wartime government contracts\u2014was \n\n40a \n \nlikewise judicially workable.  As the Court noted, \u2018ex-\ncessive\u2019 simply means \u201c[g]reater than the usual amount \nor degree.\u201d  Id. at 785 n.37 (quoting WEBSTER\u2019S NEW \nINTERNATIONAL DICTIONARY (2d ed. 1938)).  A re-\nviewing court would thus have no trouble discerning \nwhether a contractor reaped in excess because it could \neasily compare his profits to those of his peers.12  And \nso on and so forth. \n* * * \nSo amidst all the statutes that have survived nondele-\ngation challenges, \u00a7 254 stands alone.  Unlike delega-\ntions implicating special agency expertise, \u00a7 254 dele-\ngates to FCC the power to make important policy judg-\nments, and to make them while wholly immunized from \nthe oversight Congress exercises through the regular \nappropriations process.  Unlike delegations implicat-\ning the power to impose criminal sentences, taxation has \nalways been an exclusively legislative function.  Unlike \n \n12 Moreover, as we have noted, context matters to the intelligible-\nprinciple inquiry.  So assuming arguendo Lichter blessed a dele-\ngation more sweeping than any other (we think it did not), it is \nsurely relevant that the Court emphasized that the statute in ques-\ntion came about because of the necessities of war, \u201csprang from \n[Congress\u2019s] war powers,\u201d and operated only for \u201cthe duration of \nthe war or  . . .  a short time thereafter.\u201d  Id. at 755; 787.  As \nthe Court explained, because \u201c[t]he power to wage war is the power \nto wage war successfully,\u201d \u201c[r]easonable regulations to safeguard \nthe resources upon which we depend for military success must be \nregarded as being within the powers confided to Congress to ena-\nble it to prosecute a successful war.\u201d  Id. at 780-81.  The Panama \nRefining Court similarly deemed the wartime posture of certain \nbroad delegations meaningful to the delegation inquiry because the \nPresident himself has war powers \u201ccognate to the conduct by him \nof the foreign relations of the government.\u201d  293 U.S. at 422. \n\n41a \n \nthe power to impose conditions on the use of public prop-\nerty, taxation involves the conversion of private prop-\nerty.  And unlike other congressional delegations im-\nplicating core legislative functions, \u00a7 254 is a hollow shell \nthat Congress created for FCC to fill\u2014so amorphous \nthat no reviewing court could ever possibly invalidate \nany FCC action taken in its name.13 \n \n13 Section 254 also implicates the taxing power, which makes the \nnondelegation concerns it raises especially salient.  See Nat\u2019l Ca-\nble, 415 U.S. at 341 (\u201cIt would be such a sharp break with our tra-\nditions to conclude that Congress had bestowed on a federal agency \nthe taxing power that we read [the relevant statute] narrowly as \nauthorizing not a \u2018tax\u2019 but a \u2018fee.\u2019\u201d).  That is because limitations on \nthe taxing power have long been the mechanism through which the \npeople curb the excesses of unelected power.  See The Federalist \nNo. 58 (J. Madison) (\u201c[The House], in a word, hold[s] the purse that \npowerful instrument by which we behold, in the history of the Brit-\nish Constitution, an infant and humble representation of the people \ngradually enlarging the sphere of its activity and importance, and \nfinally reducing, as far as it seems to have wished, all the over-\ngrown prerogatives of the other branches of the government.\u201d). \n For that reason, the framers through the Origination Clause \ntook special care to ensure that the taxing power remained inti-\nmately connected with the people.  See U.S. CONST. art. I, \u00a7 7, cl.1 \n(\u201cAll Bills for raising Revenue shall originate in the House of Rep-\nresentatives; but the Senate may propose or concur with Amend-\nments as on other Bills.\u201d); 1 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CON-\nVENTION of 1787 544 (Max Farrand ed., 2d ed. 1937) (George Mason) \n(\u201c[T]he consideration which weighed with the Committee [when \ndrafting the Origination Clause] was that the [House] would be the \nimmediate representatives of the people, the [Senate] would not.\u201d).  \nIn fact, \u201cvesting the origination power with the House was an inte-\ngral part of the deal that resolved the conflict over congressional ap-\nportionment: seats in the Senate would not be apportioned based on \npopulation, but only the House of Representatives would have the \npower to initiate legislation that raises or spends money.\u201d  Kroto-\nszynksi, Jr., Reconsidering the Nondelegation Doctrine, supra, at \n \n\n42a \n \nWe therefore have grave concerns about \u00a7 254\u2019s con-\nstitutionality under the Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \nprecedents.  See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 136 (plurality op.) \n(noting that the Court \u201cwould face a nondelegation ques-\ntion\u201d if the statutory provision at issue had \u201cgrant[ed] \nthe Attorney General plenary power to determine [the \nstatute\u2019s] applicability to pre-Act offenders\u2014to require \nthem to register, or not, as she sees fit, and to change \nher policy for any reason and at any time\u201d (emphasis \nadded) (citation omitted)).  Nevertheless, we need not \nhold the agency action before us unconstitutional on that \nground alone because the unprecedented nature of the \ndelegation combined with other factors is enough to hold \nit unlawful.  See infra, Part III.D. \nC. \nThe Q1 2022 USF Tax is not only difficult to square \nwith the Supreme Court\u2019s public nondelegation prece-\ndents.  It was also formulated by private entities.  \nThat raises independent but equally serious questions \nabout its compatibility with Article I, \u00a7 1, which requires \n\u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested \nin a Congress.\u201d  We (1) explain that the scope of FCC\u2019s \ndelegation to private entities may violate the Legislative \nVesting Clause by allowing private entities to exercise \n \n252.  Benjamin Franklin, among others, noted that \u201cthe two clauses, \nthe originating of money bills, and the equality of votes in the Senate, \n[are] essentially connected by the compromise which had been \nagreed to.\u201d  2 THE RECORDS OF THE FEDERAL CONVENTION, su-\npra, at 233. \n So the Constitution\u2019s original meaning would seem to compel a \nmore restrictive test for delegations of the taxing power.  Never-\ntheless, the Supreme Court has declined to apply heightened scru-\ntiny to tax-related delegations, see Skinner, 490 U.S. at 223, and we \nare not authorized to depart from that holding. \n\n43a \n \ngovernment power.  Then we (2) explain that even if \nFCC\u2019s delegation could be constitutionally justified, \nFCC may have violated the Legislative Vesting Clause \nby delegating government power to private entities \nwithout express congressional authorization. \n1. \na. \nThe Supreme Court has held Congress has broad dis-\ncretion to empower executive agencies to \u201cexecute\u201d the \nlaw.  See City of Arlington v. FCC, 569 U.S. 290, 304 \nn.4 (2013).  \u201cWhen it comes to private entities, how-\never, there is not even a fig leaf of constitutional justifi-\ncation.  Private entities are not vested with legislative \nPowers.  Nor are they vested with the executive \nPower, which belongs to the President.\u201d  Amtrak II, \n575 U.S. at 62 (Alito, J., concurring) (quotation and cita-\ntions omitted).  So it is clear that delegations to private \nentities raise constitutional concerns entirely distinct \nfrom delegations to the executive. \nOnly four times has the Supreme Court considered \nwhether a delegation to private entities violates Article \nI\u2019s Vesting Clause.14 \nFirst, in Schechter Poultry, the Court considered a \nconstitutional challenge to the National Industrial Re-\n \n14 The parties in Amtrak II raised a private delegation challenge, \nbut the Court did not reach it because it determined that, for rele-\nvant purposes, Amtrak was a governmental entity.  See 575 U.S. \nat 55.  The Court has also several times considered whether state \ndelegations of legislative power to private entities violated due pro-\ncess, see Paul J. Larkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine, 73 Fla. \nL. Rev. 31, 45-47 (2021), but those cases present a question differ-\nent from the one before us. \n\n44a \n \ncovery Act (\u201cNIRA\u201d) of 1933, 48 Stat. 195.  See 295 \nU.S. at 519-21.  That statute delegated to trade or in-\ndustrial groups the authority to develop codes defining \n\u201cunfair method[s] of competition.\u201d  Id. at 521 n.4 (quo-\ntation omitted).  If the codes were approved by the \nPresident, they were to become law under \u201csuch excep-\ntions to and exemptions from the provisions of such \ncode, as the President in his discretion deem[ed] neces-\nsary to effectuate the policy\u201d of the NIRA.  Ibid.  The \nCourt held that the statute was unconstitutional.  In \npart, it reasoned the idea that \u201cCongress could delegate \nits legislative authority to trade or industrial associa-\ntions or groups so as to empower them to enact the laws \nthey deem to be wise and beneficent for the rehabilita-\ntion and expansion of their trade or industries,\u201d or that \n\u201ctrade or industrial associations or groups be consti-\ntuted legislative bodies for that purpose because such \nassociations or groups are familiar with the problems of \ntheir enterprises\u201d was \u201cutterly inconsistent with the \nconstitutional prerogatives and duties of Congress.\u201d  \nId. at 537. \nThe next year, in Carter v. Carter Coal Company, 298 \nU.S. 238, 278 (1936), the Court considered a delegation \nchallenge to the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of \n1935, 49 Stat. 991 (repealed 1937).  That statute au-\nthorized the district board in local coal districts (the \n\u201ccode authority\u201d) to adopt a code that included agreed-\nupon minimum prices for coal. Carter Coal, 298 U.S. at \n282-83.  It also allowed an agreement between produc-\ners of more than two-thirds of the annual tonnage of coal \nand a majority of mine workers to set industry-wide \nminimum wage and maximum working-hour agree-\nments.  Id. at 283-84.  Both the minimum price codes \nand the labor codes bound producers\u2014i.e., obtained le-\n\n45a \n \ngal force\u2014without approval by any federal official.  Id. \nat 282, 284.  The Court explained the statute amounted \nto \u201cdelegation in its most obnoxious form\u201d because it \npurported to delegate regulatory power not \u201cto an offi-\ncial or an official body, presumptively disinterested,\u201d \nbut rather \u201cto private persons whose interests  . . .  \noften are adverse\u201d to those whom the statute authorized \nthem to regulate.  Id. at 311.  That, the Court held, \nwas \u201can intolerable and unconstitutional interference \nwith personal liberty and private property.\u201d  Ibid.15 \nIn Currin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 5-6 (1939), the Court \nconsidered a delegation challenge to the Tobacco In-\nspection Act of 1935, 49 Stat. 731 which authorized the \nSecretary of Agriculture to designate markets in which \nno tobacco could be sold unless it had \u201cbeen inspected \nand certified by an authorized representative of the Sec-\nretary according to the established standards.\u201d One of \nthe bases for the challenge was that the Secretary could \nnot designate a market unless two-thirds of the growers \nvoting at a prescribed referendum favored the designa-\ntion.  See Currin, 306 U.S. at 6, 15.  But the producers \nhad no power to designate the markets in which classifi-\ncation would be required; only the Secretary could do \nthat.  Nor did the statute even provide that the produc-\ners would help craft regulations.  So unlike the private \nbodies in Carter Coal, the tobacco producers had no \n \n15 The Court did not clearly specify which constitutional provision \n\u2014the Legislative Vesting Clause or the Fifth Amendment Due \nProcess Clause\u2014the statute offended.  See id. at 310-12; see also \nNat\u2019l Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective Ass\u2019n v. Black, 53 F.4th \n869, 881 n.23 (5th Cir. 2022).  But because the relevant portion of \nthe Carter Coal cited Schechter Poultry, a Vesting Clause case, \nalongside Due Process cases, the Court presumably held the dele-\ngation was unlawful on both grounds. \n\n46a \n \npower to \u201cmake the law and force it upon a minority.\u201d  \nId. at 15-16 (citation omitted).  Congress merely gave \nthem the ability to prevent certain regulations from tak-\ning effect.  See ibid.  The Court accordingly rejected \nthe challenge on the ground that the statute did not del-\negate any legislative power to private entities.  Ibid. \nFinally, in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Company v. \nAdkins, 310 U.S. 381, 387 (1940), the Court considered a \nprivate delegation challenge to The Bituminous Coal Act \nof 1937, 50 Stat. 72 (repealed 1966), a revised version of \nthe statute the Court held unlawful in Carter Coal.  \nCongress\u2019s most important revision was to relegate the \ncode authorities from lawmakers to \u201caid[s]\u201d subject to \nthe \u201cpervasive surveillance and authority\u201d of the Na-\ntional Bituminous Coal Commission.  Sunshine An-\nthracite, 310 U.S. at 388.  Under the revised statute, \ncode authorities could \u201cpropose\u201d minimum prices, but \ntheir proposals were legal nullities until they were ex-\npressly \u201capproved, disapproved, or modified\u201d by the \nCoal Commission.  Ibid.  Thus, the Court concluded \nthat the Commission, \u201cnot the code authorities, deter-\nmine[d] [coal] prices,\u201d id. at 399, and it therefore held \nthat the statute did not unconstitutionally delegate gov-\nernment power to private entities. \nLower courts have discerned from these cases the \n\u201ccardinal constitutional principle [] that federal power \ncan be wielded only by the federal government.\u201d  \nBlack, 53 F.4th at 872.  Private delegations are thus \nconstitutional only on three conditions.  First, govern-\nment officials must have final decision-making author-\nity.  See Larkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine,  \nsupra, at 50-51 (noting that in every case in which the \nSupreme Court has upheld a private delegation, \u201cthe \n\n47a \n \nlaw[] at issue  . . .  left final decision-making author-\nity in the hands of a government official\u201d).  Second, \nagencies must actually exercise their authority rather \nthan \u201creflexively rubber stamp [work product] prepared \nby others.\u201d  Sierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43, 59 (5th \nCir. 1974); see State v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 531 (5th Cir. \n2021), cert. denied, Tex. v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, \n142 S. Ct. 1308 (2022) (\u201cA federal agency may not abdi-\ncate its statutory duties by delegating them to a private \nentity.\u201d  (quotation and citation omitted)).16  And third, \nthe private actors must always remain subject to the \n\u201cpervasive surveillance and authority\u201d of some person \nor entity lawfully vested with government power.  Sun-\nshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388. \nIn light of these strictures on private delegations, we \nheld unconstitutional a statute that vested a private en-\ntity with the power to make rules regulating an industry \nwhere those rules were subject only to limited agency \nreview.  See Black, 53 F.4th at 884-89.  And the D.C. \nCircuit similarly held unconstitutional a statute that em-\npowered Amtrak to work jointly with the Federal Rail-\nroad Administration to develop binding railroad perfor-\nmance standards because the statute did not vest FRA \nwith complete regulatory control.  See Amtrak I, 721 \nF.3d at 670-74, vacated and remanded sub nom. Amtrak \n \n16  Lynn arose under the National Environmental Policy Act \n(\u201cNEPA\u201d), not the Constitution.  But Rettig repeatedly cited Lynn \nto expound the level of control agencies must retain over private \nactors wielding governmental power for constitutional purposes. \nRettig, 987 F.3d at 532.  The central question in Lynn was wheth-\ner an agency bore ultimate responsibility for work product pre-\npared by a private entity, see 502 F.2d at 59, which is required not \nonly by NEPA but also by the Legislative Vesting Clause, see, e.g., \nBlack, 53 F.4th at 881. \n\n48a \n \nII, 575 U.S. 43; see also Black, 53 F.4th at 889-90 (rely-\ning on Amtrak I\u200a). \nIn contrast, where courts have deemed delegations to \nprivate entities constitutional, they have uniformly em-\nphasized the agency\u2019s actual decision-making authority \nand control.  For example, when the Third Circuit ap-\nproved the National Association of Securities Dealers\u2019 \nrole in securities regulation, it explained industry self-\nregulation raises \u201cserious constitutional challenges.\u201d  \nTodd & Co. v. SEC, 557 F.2d 1008, 1014 (3d Cir. 1977). \nAccordingly, the Court held securities self-regulation \nwas constitutional only after emphasizing that SEC was \nobliged to \u201cinsure fair treatment of those disciplined by\u201d \nNASD.  Ibid.  It also stressed that SEC was statuto-\nrily required to review NASD orders, make de novo \nfindings, and come to an \u201cindependent decision on\u201d se-\ncurities\u2019 violations and penalties.  See id. at 1012; see \nalso id. at 1012-13 (\u201c[NASD\u2019s] rules and its disciplinary \nactions were subject to full review by the S.E.C., a \nwholly public body, which must base its decision on its \nown findings.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  Similarly, when \nwe approved a private entity\u2019s role in drafting an envi-\nronmental impact statement, we emphasized that \u201cthe \napplicable federal agency [bore] the responsibility for \nthe ultimate work product\u201d and \u201cindependently per-\nform[ed] its reviewing, analytical and judgmental func-\ntions.\u201d  Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59 (quotation and citation \nomitted); see also Rettig, 987 F.3d at 531-32 (citing Lynn \nin an Art. I, \u00a7 1 challenge). \nb. \nFCC has delegated government power\u2014the power to \ndictate the size of the universal service contribution \namount, which controls the size of a tax levied on Amer-\n\n49a \n \nican consumers\u2014to USAC and private telecommunica-\ntions carriers.  That delegation is lawful only if FCC (1) \nhas final decision-making authority, (2) actually exer-\ncises that authority, and (3) exercises \u201cpervasive sur-\nveillance and authority\u201d over the private entities exer-\ncising power in its name.  Black, 53 F.4th at 884 (quot-\ning Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388). \nFCC\u2019s subdelegation of its taxing power violates this \ntest in two ways.  The first problem is that FCC regu-\nlations provide that USAC\u2019s projections take legal effect \nwithout formal FCC approval. \n See 47 C.F.R.  \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  FCC has, in effect, given private enti-\nties the final say with respect to the size of the USF Tax.  \nThat FCC retains discretion to revise the proposed con-\ntribution amount, see ibid., is insufficient.  Congress \ncould not say:  \u201cThe defense budget is whatever Lock-\nheed Martin wants it to be, unless Congress intervenes \nto revise it.\u201d  To make law, Congress must affirma-\ntively adopt the statutory text, pass it bicamerally, and \npresent it to the President for signature.  INS v. \nChadha, 462 U.S. 919, 959 (1983).  Legislation requires \naction not acquiescence.  Similarly, while FCC may so-\nlicit advice from USAC and private carriers, it must af-\nfirmatively act to give legal effect to that advice because \nit alone has constitutional authority to execute 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254. \nThe second problem is that FCC does not appear to \n\u201cindependently perform[] its reviewing, analytical and \njudgmental functions\u201d with respect to the privately sup-\nplied universal service contribution amount.  Rettig, \n987 F.3d at 532 (quoting Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59).  FCC \nhas not pointed us to anything that suggests it even \nchecks USAC\u2019s work.  Instead, it appears to \u201creflex-\n\n50a \n \nive[ly] rubber stamp\u201d whatever contribution amount \nUSAC proposes.  Lynn, 502 F.2d at 59.  The record \nbefore us shows that, before this litigation started, FCC \nnever made a single substantive change to the contribu-\ntion amounts proposed by USAC.  See supra, at 6 & \nn.1.17 \nThat is a de facto abdication.  And when an agency \nde facto abdicates to a private entity its responsibility to \nmake governmental decisions, that entity becomes more \nthan a mere \u201caid\u201d to the agency.  See Black, 53 F.4th at \n881 (quoting Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388).  \nThe private company becomes a lawmaker in its own \nright.  So de jure approval alone is not enough.  If \nFCC is going to rely on a non-governmental actor to \nsupply a revenue requirement that dictates the size of a \ntax levied on American consumers, it must at the very \nleast do something to demonstrate that it applied its in-\ndependent judgment. \nc. \nThe Government\u2019s principal counterargument is that \nFCC\u2014not USAC\u2014is exercising governmental power.  \nIts argument goes like this:  FCC sets out detailed reg-\nulations specifying who is eligible for what kinds of uni-\nversal service subsidies.  Private companies merely \nproject the costs they will incur supplying the FCC-\nspecified subsidized services and report that infor-\nmation to USAC.  And then USAC merely aggregates \n \n17 Even if FCC wanted to change USAC\u2019s proposals, it is not at \nall clear it could.  Petitioners contend, and FCC does not dispute, \nthat the \u201capproval\u201d process for USAC\u2019s proposals plays out just \ndays before the new quarter begins.  With such a short time win-\ndow, it appears FCC has no real choice but to accept USAC\u2019s pro-\nposed figures. \n\n51a \n \nthat information into a contribution amount, which FCC \nturns into the contribution factor that is levied on tele-\ncommunications revenues as a USF Tax.  FCC regula-\ntions even preclude USAC from making policy.  So in \ndetermining the contribution amount, which directly \ncontrols the size of the tax levied on American telecom-\nmunications consumers, USAC and private carriers per-\nform a simple, ministerial task\u2014a mere \u201cfact gathering \nfunction for the FCC.\u201d  FCC EB Br. 56 (quotation \nomitted). \nBut FCC obfuscates how the universal service sau-\nsage is really made.  FCC would have us believe its uni-\nversal service policy necessarily dictates the size of the \ncontribution amount, and so FCC really controls the size \nof the USF Tax.  But that cannot be right because USF \ndisbursements often do not comply with FCC policy.  \nSee supra, Part I.C.  Instead, large swaths of USF \nfunds\u2014perhaps at one point close to one-quarter\u2014are \ndisbursed to ineligible recipients.  See, e.g., THE HIGH-\nCOST PROGRAM, supra, at 2.  That FCC sets universal \nservice policy obviously does nothing to limit the reve-\nnue FCC allows private entities to exact from consum-\ners to fund payments made in violation of FCC\u2019s uni-\nversal service policy. \nPut differently, FCC policy would dictate the contri-\nbution amount only if it in fact dictated how private com-\npanies raised and spent USF monies.  The problem is \nthat FCC has abdicated responsibility for ensuring com-\npliance to the very entities whose universal service de-\nmand projections dictate the size of the contribution \namount.  See, e.g., FCC\u2019s LIFELINE PROGRAM, supra, \nat executive summary page (noting that FCC \u201crelies on \nover 2,000 Eligible Telecommunication Carriers that are \n\n52a \n \nLifeline providers to implement key program functions, \nsuch as verifying subscriber eligibility,\u201d which is prob-\nlematic because \u201ccompanies may have financial incen-\ntives to enroll as many customers as possible\u201d); FCC\u2019s \nE-RATE PROGRAM, supra, at 21-22 (noting that telecom-\nmunications service providers have opportunities to \n\u201cmake misrepresentations  . . .  during the funding \nphase\u201d that \u201cmay not be discovered due to the self- \ncertifying nature of the program\u201d). \nMoreover, the entity most responsible for snuffing \nout wasteful or fraudulent disbursements\u2014USAC\u2014is \nrun almost entirely by stakeholders who stand to benefit \nfinancially when universal service subsidies grow.  See \nLeadership, UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., supra; see \nalso FCC\u2019s E-RATE PROGRAM, supra, at 15 (noting that \nFCC relies on USAC to ensure compliance carrier com-\npliance with FCC rules).  And that is no accident. \nUSAC is run by self-interested stakeholders because \nFCC regulations require it.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.703(b).  \nFCC mandates that nine of USAC\u2019s nineteen directors \nrepresent companies in the telecommunications indus-\ntry who are compensated by the very same USF funds \nthey raise.  See id. \u00a7 54.703(b)(1)-(6).  It mandates that an-\nother seven represent the schools, libraries, health care \nproviders, and low-income consumers who are direct re-\ncipients of USF funds.  See id. \u00a7 54.703(b)(7)-(10). \nBecause the telecommunications industry polices its \nown compliance with FCC universal service policy, and \nresponsibility for monitoring the industry falls most \nheavily on a board composed of industry representatives \nand consumer groups with a direct financial interest in \nthe size of USF taxes, private entities have a far more \nimportant and discretionary role in determining the size \n\n53a \n \nof the contribution amount (which controls the level of \nuniversal service taxation) than FCC would have you be-\nlieve.  For example, a carrier could (intentionally or un-\nintentionally) project and then supply USF-subsidized \nservice costing twenty-five percent more than its USF-\nsubsidized service would cost if it strictly complied with \nFCC rules.  And FCC offers us zero reason to think it \nwould even discover the discrepancy\u2014let alone that \nFCC would do anything about it.  FCC has in effect \nsaid to carriers:  \u201cHere is our universal service policy \nand a blank check.  We\u2019re not going to pay any atten-\ntion to what you put in the dollar box.  We know you \nhave financial incentives to juice the number, but we \ntrust you\u2019ll follow our policy to the letter anyways.  \nJust fill it out however you see fit, take it to the bank, \nand the money will be drawn from the accounts of Amer-\nican telecommunications consumers.\u201d  We do not doubt \nthat most of the industry is staffed by individuals of the \nutmost integrity, but we cannot agree that private enti-\nties are no more than ministerial bean counters when it \ncomes to setting the USF Tax. \nMoreover, even if we put the compliance issue to one \nside, we would still disagree that private companies have \nmerely \u201cministerial\u201d control over the contribution amount. \nAs we have noted, FCC\u2019s counterargument turns on the \nCommission\u2019s nominal control over universal service \npolicy.  But setting a policy is not the same as allocat-\ning funds to execute that policy.  That much is evident \nfrom the constitutional requirement that Congress ap-\npropriate money to execute the government programs it \nestablishes.  See U.S. CONST. ART. I, \u00a7 9, cl. 7.  Thus, \nFCC\u2019s argument fails because it impermissibly col-\nlapses universal service funding decisions into universal \nservice policy decisions.  The decision of how much \n\n54a \n \nmoney should be set aside to execute FCC\u2019s universal \nservice policies\u2014the very decision FCC has delegated \nto USAC and private carriers\u2014is an independent deci-\nsion that requires independent judgment.  And surely \ndiscretion inheres in decisions about how much money \nto allocate to a massive federal welfare program.  See \nGaines v. Thompson, 74 U.S. (7 Wall.) 347, 353 (1868) \n(\u201cA ministerial duty  . . .  is one in respect to which \nnothing is left to discretion.\u201d  (quotation omitted)).  \nSo even if we thought FCC correctly described the role \nof private entities, we would still conclude that dictating \nthe contribution amount is an exercise of government \npower. \n* * * \nFCC has not delegated to private entities a trivial, \nfact-gathering role.  It has delegated the power to dic-\ntate the amount of money that will be exacted from tel-\necommunications carriers (and American consumers in \nturn) to promote \u201cuniversal service.\u201d  In other words, \nit has delegated the taxing power.  And the delegation \nis not even \u201cto an official or an official body, presump-\ntively disinterested,\u201d but rather to private persons \nvested with no government power and with interests \nthat \u201coften are adverse\u201d to those whom they are taxing.  \nCarter Coal, 298 U.S. at 311; see also Ass\u2019n of Am. Rail-\nroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp. (\u201cAmtrak III\u201d), 821 F.3d \n19, 29 (D.C. Cir. 2016) (\u201cDelegating legislative authority \nto official bodies is inoffensive because we presume \nthose bodies are disinterested, that their loyalties lie \nwith the public good, not their private gain.  But here, \nthe majority producers may be and often are adverse to \nthe interests of others in the same business.\u201d  (citation \nand quotation omitted)).  We accordingly have serious \n\n55a \n \ntrouble squaring FCC\u2019s subdelegation with Article I,  \n\u00a7 1 of the Constitution.18 \n2. \nEven if the Constitution does not categorically forbid \nFCC\u2019s delegation to USAC and private telecommunica-\ntions carriers, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254 does not authorize it.  \nAnd there is no precedent establishing that federal \nagencies may subdelegate powers in the absence of stat-\nutory authorization.  To the contrary, the only Su-\npreme Court cases blessing private delegations involved \nexplicit statutory authorizations. \na. \nAt the Founding, the maxim that delegata potestas \nnon potest delegari\u2014no delegated powers can be fur-\nther delegated\u2014was widely accepted.  The maxim has \nits roots in the civil law.  See Patrick W. Duff & Horace \nE. Whiteside, Delegata Potestas Non Potest Delegari:  \nA Maxim of American Constitutional Law, 14 COR-\nNELL L.Q. 168, 171 (1929).  Lord Coke enshrined the \nmaxim as a common law doctrine.  See id. at 170-71 (ci-\ntations omitted).  And the doctrine endured through \n \n18 JUDGE NEWSOM recently expressed skepticism that the private \nentities involved in USF may constitutionally exercise the power \nFCC delegated to them.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 932 \n(Newsom, J., concurring).  But JUDGE NEWSOM voted to deny a \npetition for review that is almost identical to the one before us be-\ncause in his view, these private entities exercise executive rather \nthan legislative power, and petitioners did not raise an Article II \nchallenge.  Ibid.  With utmost respect to our distinguished col-\nleague, private entities do play a legislative role in the USF be-\ncause their projections directly control the size of USF tax rates, \nand setting tax rates is unquestionably a legislative function.  See \nsupra, Part III.B. \n\n56a \n \nthe founding generation, as evidenced by treatises of the \ngreat 19th-century scholars.  Samuel Livermore, for \nexample, noted that \u201c[a]n authority given to one person \ncannot in general be delegated by him to another; for \nbeing a personal trust and confidence it is not in its na-\nture transmissible, and if there be such a power to one \nperson, to exercise his judgment and discretion, he can-\nnot say, that the trust and confidence reposed in him \nshall be exercised at the discretion of another person.\u201d  \nA TREATISE ON THE LAW OF PRINCIPAL AND AGENT AND \nOF SALES BY AUCTION 54 (1818).  Likewise, James Kent \nwrote that \u201c[a]n agent, ordinarily and without express \nauthority, has not power to employ a sub-agent to do the \nbusiness, without the knowledge or consent of his prin-\nciple.  The maxim is, that delegatus non potest dele-\ngare, and the agency is generally a personal trust and \nconfidence which cannot be delegated.\u201d  2 COMMEN-\nTARIES ON AMERICAN LAW 496 (1827).  And Joseph \nStory agreed, explaining that \u201c[o]ne, who has a bare \npower or authority from another to do an act, must exe-\ncute it himself, and cannot delegate his authority to an-\nother; for this being a trust or confidence reposed in him \npersonally, it cannot be assigned to a stranger, whose \nability and integrity might not be known to the principal \nor who, if known, might not be selected by him for such \na purpose.\u201d  COMMENTARIES ON THE LAW OF AGENCY, \nAS A BRANCH OF COMMERCIAL AND MARITIME JURIS-\nPRUDENCE 66-67 (1844). \nAs with most rules, this one had exceptions.  Com-\nmon lawyers assumed that ministerial tasks could be \nsubdelegated.  See GARY LAWSON & GUY SEIDMAN, \u201cA \nGREAT POWER OF ATTORNEY\u201d:  UNDERSTANDING THE \nFIDUCIARY CONSTITUTION 115 (2017).  And a fiduciary \n\n57a \n \ndocument could specifically authorize subdelegations of \ndelegated authority.  Ibid. \nBut as a general matter, \u201c[t]he founding-era rule \nagainst subdelegation of delegated agency authority is \nas clearly established as any proposition of law can be \nestablished.\u201d  Id. at 114.  And it was not merely a \nproposition of agency law.  In fact, the Supreme Court \nonce noted that the maxim \u201chas had wider application in \nthe construction of our federal and state Constitutions \nthan it has in private law.\u201d  J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at \n405-06; see also Duff & Whiteside, Delegata Potestas \nNon Potest Delegari, supra, at 175 (\u201c[I]n cases which \ninvolve a supposed delegation to an independent board \nor commission, as well as those where the delegation is \nto the executive or judiciary, the maxim delegata \npotestas non potest delegari, or its English equivalent, \nhas been the chief reliance of the courts, and has at-\ntained in their eyes the dignity of a principle of consti-\ntutional law.\u201d). \nSo the Founders\u2019 law prohibited unauthorized sub-\ndelegations of non-ministerial delegated authority, and \nthe Supreme Court has recognized that as a constitu-\ntional principle.  See J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 405-\n06; cf. Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135 (plurality op.) (\u201cArticle I \nof the Constitution provides that \u2018[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.\u2019 \u00a7 1.  Accompanying that assignment of \npower to Congress is a bar on its further delegation.\u201d).  \nWe think the clear implication is that the Constitution \nimposes upon federal agencies\u2014acting as agents of the \npeople\u2019s representatives in Congress\u2014a duty to wield \ndelegated power unless Congress authorizes subdelega-\ntion or the subdelegation involves no more than ministe-\n\n58a \n \nrial tasks.  In other words, \u201cCongress may formalize [a \nlimited] role [for] private parties\u201d in executing its laws, \nAmtrak I, 721 F.3d at 671 (emphasis added) (citing Sun-\nshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388), but agencies may not. \nb. \nThis rule does not just accord with law at the Found-\ning; it also accords with Supreme Court precedent. \nThe Court has emphasized the \u201cvital constitutional \nprinciple\u201d that \u201c[l]iberty requires accountability.\u201d  \nAmtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., concurring).  Every \nexecutive branch official is in some way accountable to \nthe people because every executive branch official may \nbe removed\u2014for good cause at least\u2014by the President, \nwho is himself \u201cthe most democratic and politically ac-\ncountable official in Government.\u201d  Seila L. LLC v. \nCFPB, 591 U.S. 197, 224 (2020).  Private persons, in \ncontrast, may not be removed by the President because \nprivate persons do not wield any portion of \u201cthe execu-\ntive Power\u201d our Constitution vests \u201cin a President of the \nUnited States of America.\u201d  U.S. CONST. art. II, \u00a7 1, cl. \n1.  There is no reason to lightly infer that Congress in-\ntends to insulate law execution from democratic ac-\ncountability in this way.19 \n \n19 Deciding who should exercise governmental power can be as \nimportant as deciding whether governmental power should be del-\negated in the first place.  If it were not, we would not care so \ndeeply about Presidential elections.  So democratic accountability \nis frustrated when decisions about who should exercise governmen-\ntal power are made by bureaucrats\u2014whose connection to the peo-\nple is real but highly attenuated\u2014rather than Congress, whose \nmembers are directly \u201caccountable to [their] constituents through \nregular popular elections.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at 459 (citation \nomitted). \n\n59a \n \nIn accordance with these principles, both Supreme \nCourt cases authorizing private entities to wield any-\nthing like government power involved express authori-\nzations from Congress.  The Tobacco Inspection Act \nconsidered in Currin expressly provided that regula-\ntions would take effect only with the support of two-\nthirds of the tobacco growers in the relevant market.  \nSee 306 U.S. at 6, 15.  And the Bituminous Coal Act \nconsidered in Sunshine Anthracite created the very pri-\nvate boards that proposed minimum prices and labor \ncodes to the Coal Commission.  See 310 U.S. at 387-88 \n(noting that the statute provided for \u201c[s]ome twenty dis-\ntrict boards of code members  . . .  which are to oper-\nate as an aid to the Commission\u201d and \u201cspecifie[d] in de-\ntail the methods of their organization and operation, the \nscope of their functions, and the jurisdiction of the Com-\nmission over them.\u201d).20 \nc. \nSection 254, by contrast, makes no mention of the fact \nthat private entities might be responsible for determin-\ning the size of the tax FCC levies on American consum-\ners.  It does not even mention USAC, a Delaware cor-\nporation FCC established without congressional author-\nization. \nWhen asked at oral argument to identify the portion \nof \u00a7 254 that authorizes FCC to subdelegate administra-\ntion of the universal service contribution mechanism to \nprivate entities, the Government\u2019s counsel could point \n \n20 Likewise the Maloney Act, which the Third Circuit considered \nin Todd & Co., specifically authorized registered organizations to \nself-regulate over-the-counter securities markets.  See 557 F.2d \nat 1012. \n\n60a \n \nonly to subsection \u00a7 254(b)(5).  See Oral Arg. at 46:40-\n48:55.  That subsection directs FCC to establish \n\u201cmechanisms to preserve and advance universal ser-\nvice.\u201d  \u00a7 254(b)(5).  But a directive to establish \u201cmech-\nanisms\u201d plainly does not imply that those \u201cmechanisms\u201d \nmay be controlled by a private, non-governmental entity \nincorporated by FCC without any involvement from \nCongress. \nIn fact, \u00a7 254(b)(5) seems to suggest precisely the op-\nposite.  Rather than directing FCC to establish private \nmechanisms, it specifically instructs FCC to establish \n\u201cFederal and State mechanisms,\u201d ibid., which indicates \nCongress intended to make government entities respon-\nsible for administering universal service programs.  So \nsubsection (b)(5) is unavailing. \nThe closest \u00a7 254 comes to contemplating that a non-\ngovernmental entity might play any role in executing \nthe statute is to incorporate by reference some of the \npreexisting regulations governing the Lifeline Program.  \nSee \u00a7 254(\u200aj) (\u201cNothing in this section shall affect the col-\nlection, distribution, or administration of the Lifeline \nAssistance Program provided for by the Commission \nunder regulations set forth in section 69.117 of title 47, \nCode of Federal Regulations, and other related sections \nof such title.\u201d).  Those regulations made the National \nExchange Carrier Association (\u201cNECA\u201d) responsible \nfor calculating the Lifeline Assistance charges levied  \non local exchange carriers.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117  \n(10-1-95 ed.).  And they gave local exchange carriers a \nsmall role in determining the size of Lifeline Assistance \ncharges because carriers could obtain subsidies for their \nself-reported costs incurred in waiving one kind of reg-\nulatory fee.  See id. \u00a7 69.104(\u200aj) (10-1-95 ed.). \n\n61a \n \nBut the fact that \u00a7 254 incorporated certain pre-1996 \nLifeline Assistance program regulations does not sug-\ngest Congress authorized FCC\u2019s abdication of responsi-\nbility for the USF Tax to private entities.  That is for \nthree reasons. \nFirst, NECA\u2019s role under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117 in 1995 \nwas not remotely analogous to USAC\u2019s current role of \nadministering the entire USF.  Section 69.117 charged \nNECA only with two simple, ministerial tasks:  (1) Cal-\nculating Lifeline Assistance charges by \u201cdividing the \nsum of one-twelfth of the projected annual Lifeline As-\nsistance revenue requirement and one-twelfth of the \nprojected annual revenue requirement calculated by all \ntelephone companies pursuant to \u00a7 69.104(l) by the num-\nber of common lines presubscribed to interexchange \ncarriers.  . . .  \u201d  Id. \u00a7 69.117(b) (10-1-95 ed.).  And \n(2) \u201cbill[ing] and collect[ing] the charge, and disburs-\n[ing] associated revenue.\u201d  Ibid.  USAC\u2019s role as USF \nadministrator, by contrast, involves far more than min-\nisterial tasks.  See supra, Part III.C.1.c. \nSecond, the carriers\u2019 role under 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.117 \n(and associated regulations) in 1995 was not analogous \nto their role in 2023.  Before the 1996 Act, FCC regu-\nlations authorized certain carriers to bill the Lifeline \nProgram for costs associated with waiving certain mi-\nnor, regulatorily imposed end user common line charges \nfor certain means-tested subscribers pursuant to a  \ncarrier-developed plan certified by FCC. \n \nId.  \n\u00a7 69.104(\u200aj) (10-1-95 ed.).  But carriers could waive end \nuser charges only if they reduced their own service rate \ncharges by an equivalent amount.  Ibid.  That is noth-\ning like the modern universal service regime, which al-\nlows a greatly expanded class of carriers to bill USF for \n\n62a \n \na broad range of subsidized services provided at no cost \nto themselves. \nThird, even if the role NECA and telecommunica-\ntions carriers played in administering Lifeline Assis-\ntance charges before \u00a7 254 was analogous to the role \nthey play in administering the modern Lifeline Pro-\ngram, there is no evidence Congress contemplated pri-\nvate entities would play the same role in administering \nthe three other major universal service programs FCC \nhas established pursuant to its \u00a7 254 authority.  That \nCongress provided a narrow role for certain private en-\ntities in administering a small government program sub-\nsidizing one kind of telecommunications service says \nnothing about whether Congress authorized a broadly \nexpanded class of private entities to play a central role \nin administering a nine-billion-dollar welfare fund offer-\ning subsidies for technologies no one could have imag-\nined when \u00a7 254 was enacted.  If anything, the text of  \n\u00a7 254 suggests Congress actually meant to preclude pri-\nvate entities from administering USF programs other \nthan Lifeline.  That is because NECA did administer \nthe pre-1996 USF.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 69.116 (10-1-95 ed.).  \nBut NECA\u2019s USF responsibilities were distinct from its \nLifeline Assistance responsibilities; the former were \nspelled out in \u00a7 69.116, and the latter in \u00a7 69.117.  Con-\ngress referenced \u00a7 69.117 in \u00a7 254, but it conspicuously \ndid not reference \u00a7 69.116.  Congress\u2019s explicit recog-\nnition of one relatively minor aspect of private compa-\nnies\u2019 participation in the pre-1996 Lifeline Assistance \nregime thus evinces that Congress knew how to empower \nprivate companies and chose not to empower them to ad-\nminister other aspects of the USF. \n\n63a \n \nSo if Congress authorized FCC to delegate sweeping \nuniversal service responsibilities to private entities, it \ndid not say so very clearly.  Indeed, it speaks volumes \nthat the only plausible statutory justification for FCC\u2019s \nsubdelegation\u2014\u00a7 254(\u200aj)\u2014is so ambiguous that FCC, \nwhich should be more familiar with \u00a7 254 than anyone, \ndid not even think to point to it as justification for its \nreliance on private companies to set the USF Tax. \n* * * \nFCC subdelegated the power to determine the uni-\nversal service contribution amount to USAC, who fur-\nther subdelegated it to private, for- profit telecommuni-\ncations carriers.  That subdelegation was not author-\nized.  See supra, Part III.C.2.c.  And the tasks FCC \nsubdelegated are not ministerial.  See supra, Part \nIII.C.1.b-c.  So even if Article I, \u00a7 1 does not categori-\ncally forbid USAC and private telecommunications car-\nriers from exercising the kind of power FCC has vested \nin them, it may forbid them from doing so absent ex-\npress congressional authorization.21 \n \n21 Petitioners certainly could have framed their private nondele-\ngation challenge in statutory terms.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch, 88 F.4th \nat 933 (Newsom, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t may be that USAC is oper-\nating in contravention of the governing statute, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, \nwhich conspicuously never even mentions USAC, let alone author-\nizes its involvement in the universal-service program.\u201d  (emphasis \nin original)).  But assuming private entities are permitted to ex-\nercise government power at all, the decision to delegate govern-\nment power to a private entity is itself a legislative one.  And since \nagencies may not wield legislative power, we are persuaded FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized decision to delegate government power to a private \nactor likely violates not only \u00a7 254 but also Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Con-\nstitution.  But see id. at 933 n.5 (Newsom, J., concurring) (ex-\n \n\n64a \n \nD. \nWe are highly skeptical that the contribution factor \nbefore us comports with the bar on congressional dele-\ngations of legislative power.  And we are similarly \nskeptical that it comports with the general rule that pri-\nvate entities may not wield governmental power, espe-\ncially not without express and unambiguous congres-\nsional authorization.  But we need not resolve either \nquestion in this case.  That is because the combination \nof Congress\u2019s sweeping delegation to FCC and FCC\u2019s \nunauthorized subdelegation to USAC violates the Leg-\nislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1. \nWe (1) explain the Supreme Court\u2019s cases instructing \nthat separation-of-powers jurisprudence is done holisti-\ncally, with an eye to constitutional history and structure, \nnot by dissecting government programs into their com-\nponent parts.  Then we (2) explain why an agency ac-\ntion involving a broad congressional delegation and an \nunauthorized agency subdelegation to private entities \nviolates the Constitution even if neither of those fea-\ntures does so independently. \n1. \nThe Supreme Court has instructed us to review  \nseparation-of-powers challenges holistically.  And it \nhas held that two or more things that are not inde-\npendently unconstitutional can combine to violate the \nConstitution\u2019s separation of powers. \n \npressing skepticism that the lack of statutory authorization for a \ndelegation to a private entity \u201chas any real bearing on the consti-\ntutional [private nondelegation] question\u201d (emphasis in original)). \n\n65a \n \nTake for example Seila Law, 591 U.S. 197.  The \nquestion presented in that case was whether a for-cause \nremoval restriction unconstitutionally infringed the \nPresident\u2019s power to remove the Director of the Con-\nsumer Financial Protection Bureau.  See id. at 204.  \nTwo lines of precedent seemed to converge to suggest \nthe removal restriction at issue posed no constitutional \nproblem.  First, Humphrey\u2019s Executor v. United States, \n295 U.S. 602 (1935), established that Congress may con-\nstitutionally grant for-cause removal protections to a \ngroup of agency directors that wield executive power.  \nSee also Seila L., 591 U.S. at 216 n.2 (noting that FTC \nhas always exercised executive power).  Second, Mor-\nrison v. Olson, 487 U.S. 654 (1988), established that Con-\ngress may constitutionally give for-cause removal pro-\ntection to a single official vested with executive author-\nity.  See also Seila L., 591 U.S. at 217 (noting that the \nindependent counsel wielded executive power).  The \nCourt of Appeals accordingly reasoned that Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor and Morrison controlled and that the \nstatutory provision limiting the President\u2019s power to re-\nmove the CFPB director was constitutional.  CFPB v. \nSeila L. LLC, 923 F.3d 680, 684 (9th Cir. 2019). \nThe Supreme Court reversed.  It granted that some \nfor-cause removal restrictions are not problematic.  \nSee Seila L., 591 U.S. at 215.  And it granted that for-\ncause removal restrictions applied to single-member di-\nrectorships are sometimes constitutionally permissible.  \nSee id. at 217.  But it held the combination of (1) for-\ncause removal, (2) a one-member CFPB Director, and \n(3) the capacious powers of the CFPB created a consti-\ntutional problem.  Id. at 224-25; see also id. at 258 \n(Thomas, J., concurring in part) (\u201cThe constitutional vi-\nolation results from, at a minimum, the combination of \n\n66a \n \nthe removal provision and the provision allowing the \nCFPB to seek enforcement of a civil investigative de-\nmand.\u201d  (emphasis added) (citations omitted)).  In other \nwords, three features of the CFPB\u2014each independently \nconstitutional\u2014combined to create a \u201cnew situation\u201d \nthat could not be decided by reference to precedents \nthat concerned only one aspect of the problem.  Id. at \n220 (citation omitted). \nThe same kind of reasoning guided the Court in Free \nEnterprise Fund v. Public Company Accounting Over-\nsight Board, 561 U.S. 477 (2010).  In that case, the \nquestion presented was whether \u201cthe President [may \nbe] restricted in his ability to remove a principal officer, \nwho is in turn restricted in his ability to remove an infe-\nrior officer, even though that inferior officer determines \nthe policy and enforces the laws of the United States[.]\u201d  \nId. at 483-84.  The Court noted its previous holding \nthat Congress may provide for restrictions on the Pres-\nident\u2019s ability to remove the directors of independent \nagencies like SEC.  See id. at 483; see also Humphrey\u2019s \nExecutor, 295 U.S. 602.  It also noted its previous hold-\ning that Congress may provide for restrictions on the \npower of principal executive officers to remove their \nown inferiors.  See ibid.; see also United States v. Per-\nkins, 116 U.S. 483 (1886).  But the Court held that the \ncombination of two separate layers of removal protec-\ntions created \u201ca new situation not yet encountered by \nthe Court.\u201d  Free Enter. Fund, 561 U.S. at 483.  And \nthat combination, the Court held, violated the Constitu-\ntion.  Id. at 484. \nSeila Law and Free Enterprise Fund thus evince a \ngeneral principle that, with respect to the separation of \npowers at least, two constitutional parts do not neces-\n\n67a \n \nsarily add up to a constitutional whole.  Cf. Aristotle, \nMetaphysics, in 1 WORKS OF ARISTOTLE 569 (Mortimer \nJ. Adler ed., W. D. Ross trans., 1990) (observing \u201cthe \nwhole is\u201d often \u201csomething besides the parts\u201d).  Ra-\nther, reviewing courts must consider a government pro-\ngram holistically, with an eye toward its compatibility \nwith our constitutional history and structure.  See \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 222. \n2. \nHere, history and structure both point in the same \ndirection:  the universal service contribution mecha-\nnism is unconstitutional. \na. \n\u201cPerhaps the most telling indication of a severe con-\nstitutional problem\u201d with the structure of a government \nprogram \u201cis a lack of historical precedent to support it.\u201d  \nId. at 220 (quotation omitted) (quoting Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 505).  And USF\u2019s double-layered del-\negation is unprecedented. \nFirst, there is no record of any government program \nlike USF in all the U.S. Reports.  The only case that \neven remotely resembles USF\u2019s combination of a broad \ncongressional delegation with significant industry in-\nvolvement is Sunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. 381.  See \nsupra, Part III.C.1.a. \nWhile Sunshine Anthracite is the closest analogue, it \nis not really that close. Unlike USAC and private tele-\ncommunications carriers, which de facto decide the USF \ncontribution amount, the code authorities under the Bi-\ntuminous Coal Act of 1937 only had the power to recom-\nmend minimum coal prices.  See 310 U.S. at 399 (\u201c[The \nCoal Commission], not the code authorities, determines \n\n68a \n \nthe prices.\u201d).  And the only recommendations the code \nauthorities could make were cabined by a clear rule:  \nCongress provided that minimum coal prices were to be \nfixed at a level which \u201creflect[ed] as nearly as possible \nthe relative market values at points of delivery taking \ninto account specifically enumerated factors,\u201d id. at 397 \n\u2014namely labor, supplies, power, taxes, insurance, work-\nmen\u2019s compensation, royalties, depreciation and deple-\ntion and all other direct expenses of production, coal op-\nerators\u2019 association dues, district board assessments for \nBoard operating expenses only levied under the code, \nand reasonable costs of selling and the cost of admin-\nistration.  See The Bituminous Coal Act of 1937, 50 \nStat. at 78.  Those enumerated factors, \u201cconsistently \nwith the process of coordination, yield a return to each \narea approximating its weighted average cost per ton.\u201d  \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 397.22 \nThat case is nothing like ours.  To make Sunshine \nAnthracite apposite, the Coal Commission\u2019s discretion \nto set minimum prices would have had to have been un-\nfettered (it was not); the Coal Commission\u2019s passive ac-\nquiescence would have had to make the code authorities\u2019 \nprice recommendations legally binding (it did not); and \nthere would have to have been evidence that the Coal \nCommission always agreed with the code authorities\u2019 \nprice recommendations (there was not). \nSecond, FCC has not pointed to any historical ana-\nlogue outside the U.S. Reports.  That is hardly surpris-\ning.  USF combines a sweeping delegation of the tax-\ning power, see supra, Part III.B, with a subdelegation of \n \n22 The statute also authorized the Commission to fix maximum \ncoal prices under certain circumstances, but the code authorities \nhad no role in formulating those maximums.  See ibid. \n\n69a \n \nthat power to private entities with a personal financial \ninterest in the size of the tax, see supra, Part III.C.  It \nis difficult to imagine early Congresses would have au-\nthorized a similarly dual-layered delegation of the tax-\ning power. \nTrue, Congress has always relied on the executive to \nexecute tax laws.  For example, in 1798 Congress \nvested tax assessors with authority to value real estate \nfor the purpose of administering a nationwide direct tax.  \nSee Act of July 14, 1798, ch. 75, 1 Stat. 597 (1798); see \nalso Nicholas R. Parrillo, A Critical Assessment of the \nOriginalist Case Against Administrative Regulatory \nPower: New Evidence from the Federal Tax on Private \nReal Estate in the 1790s, 130 YALE L.J. 1288 (2021).  \nBut the 1798 direct tax is no precedent for the USF Tax \nbecause the 1798 direct tax is nothing like the USF Tax.  \nThat is for three reasons. \nFirst, the 1798 Congress itself decided the amount of \nrevenue the Government would levy from American cit-\nizens.  See Parrillo, New Evidence, supra, at 1303 (\u201cCon-\ngress decided to raise $2 million nationwide and, per the \nConstitution\u2019s requirement for direct taxes, apportioned \nthat sum among the states according to each state\u2019s free \npopulation plus three-fifths of its slave population.\u201d).  \nIn contrast, Congress through \u00a7 254 delegated to FCC \nthe power to decide how much revenue the Government \nwill raise via USF taxes.  And FCC\u2019s revenue-raising \ndiscretion is limited only by the most amorphous of \nstandards.  See supra, Part III.B.2.  So while the 1798 \nExecutive Branch only had authority to raise $2 million, \nthe present-day FCC can levy taxes practically ad in-\nfinitum based on little more than its own conception of \n\n70a \n \nthe public interest.  See ibid.  It thus strains credulity to \nanalogize the 1798 direct tax to the USF Tax. \nSecond (and relatedly), unlike the Congress that en-\nacted \u00a7 254, the 1798 Congress made all the relevant tax \npolicy decisions.  It decided to raise $2 million, it de-\ncided to levy the $2 million through direct taxes on prop-\nerty (mostly real estate), and it decided how the tax bur-\nden would be allocated:  mainly in proportion to the \nvalue of citizens\u2019 property in money.  Parrillo, New Ev-\nidence, supra, at 1303; see supra, Part III.B.2 (explain-\ning the policy decisions \u00a7 254 leaves for FCC).  That \nmakes sense because tax decisions\u2014including decisions \nabout rates\u2014traditionally implicated the legislative power \nand so could not be made by officials in the executive \nbranch.  See PHILLIP HAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRA-\nTIVE LAW UNLAWFUL 57-64 (2014). \nObviously a direct tax on land could not be adminis-\ntered without a fair accounting of the value of citizens\u2019 \nproperty, so Congress provided for assessors and gave \nthem authority to assess the value of citizens\u2019 property. \nCongress did not provide detailed instructions about \nhow assessors were to go about their business, but that \nis of no significance.  At common law, \u201c[d]etermina-\ntions of facts, including assessments, were understood  \n. . .  to be judicial in nature, not legislative.  Although \nnot actually exercises of judicial power, they were ex-\npected to mimic judicial decisions at least in being exer-\ncises of judgment\u201d as opposed to legislative will.  Ham-\nburger, Nondelegation Blues, supra, at 1211 (emphasis \nadded).  In other words, the making of assessments \nhas never involved legislative power because it has al-\nways been assumed that assessors must accurately \n\n71a \n \ncharacterize the facts on the ground and fairly apply the \nlaw to the facts. \nFor example, in 1598 the English Court of Common \nPleas heard a case concerning the power of the sewers \ncommissioners, who were tasked with repairing \nriverbanks and assessing the costs to nearby landown-\ners.  See Rooke\u2019s Case, 77 Eng. Rep. 209 (C.P. 1598) \n(Coke, J.).  The commissioners repaired a riverbank \nand then assessed the entire cost to one nearby land-\nowner.  The landowner sued, and Lord Coke held the \ncommissioners acted unlawfully because they were sup-\nposed to assess repair costs to \u201call who had land in dan-\nger.\u201d  Id. at 210.  Coke explained that while \u201c[t]he \nwords of the commission [gave] authority to the commis-\nsioners to do according to their discretions,\u201d the com-\nmissioners could \u201cnot [act] according to their wills and \nprivate affections\u201d but rather were \u201climited and bound \nwith the rule of reason and law.\u201d  Id. at 210.  Thus, the \ndiscretion possessed by the commissioners was merely \nthe discretion \u201cto discern between falsity and truth.\u201d  \nIbid.  In other words, the commissioners had the \npower to determine whose land was truly endangered by \ndamaged riverbanks, but they could not use that discre-\ntion to make policy judgments about which landowners \nshould bear the cost of repairing those banks.  See \nHAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW UNLAWFUL,  \nsupra, at 97-100 (describing the nature of assessments \nat common law). \nLike the common law assessors, the tax assessors at \nthe founding had discretion merely \u201cto discern between \nfalsity and truth\u201d in property values.  Rooke\u2019s Case, 77 \nEng. Rep. at 210.  Federal officials assumed all prop-\nerty had a \u201ccorrect valuation.\u201d  Parrillo, New Evi-\n\n72a \n \ndence, supra, at 1366 (quoting OLIVER WOLCOTT, JR., \nDIRECT TAXES 441 (1796)).  The task of officials exe-\ncuting the direct tax was merely to make the factual de-\nterminations necessary to unearth that correct valua-\ntion.  Congress told the assessors to do this \u201cjust[ly] \nand equitab[ly]\u201d\u2014\u201ca familiar measure of the conduct of \ngovernment officials making judicial or judicial-like de-\nterminations, including assessments.\u201d  Hamburger, \nNondelegation Blues, supra, at 1212.  The assessors \naccordingly had no power to make tax policy, at least not \nlegitimately.  And the kinds of factual findings Con-\ngress charged the assessors with making have never \nbeen thought to involve legislative power.  See, e.g., \nPanama Refin., 293 U.S. at 426 (\u201c[A]uthorizations given \nby Congress to selected instrumentalities for the pur-\npose of ascertaining the existence of facts to which leg-\nislation is directed have constantly been sustained.\u201d). \nIt is possible that assessors sometimes mischaracter-\nized the value of property so as to shift the tax burden \nfrom one group of citizens to another.  See Hamburger, \nNondelegation Blues, supra, at 1212 (noting \u201cassess-\nments and other determinations of fact have often been \nmisused to exercise a disguised legislative power\u201d).  If \nthat is right, some assessors may have exercised will ra-\nther than judgment and so acted in a legislative rather \nthan an executive capacity.  But in doing so, the asses-\nsors abused the power the 1798 Congress gave them, \nand abuses of a power do not change the nature of the \npower itself.  For example, it is commonly said that the \nSupreme Court in Lochner abused the judicial power.  \nSee, e.g., Kermit Roosevelt III, What if Slaughter-\nHouse had been Decided Differently?, 45 IND. L. REV. \n61, 84 (2011) (noting in Lochner the court committed \n\u201cthe sin  . . .  of substituting judicial for legislative \n\n73a \n \npolicymaking\u201d).  But no one contends that in light of \nLochner\u2019s abuses the Court in fact exercises legislative \npower when it rules in constitutional cases.  So too with \nthe assessors. \nThus, we can find no historical precedent for broad \ndelegations of Congress\u2019s power to tax.  But even if \nthere were\u2014even if the 1798 direct tax suggests Con-\ngress may delegate the Taxing Power to the Executive \nBranch\u2014there is still no historical precedent for the \nUSF Tax.  That is because it is utterly inconceivable \nthat the first Treasury, upon receiving from Congress \nbroad powers to levy taxes on American citizens, would \nhave abdicated responsibility for determining tax rates \nto privately employed bounty hunters who had a per-\nsonal financial interest in the amount of tax revenue col-\nlected.  And that is exactly what FCC has done here. \nSee supra, Part III.C. \nAccordingly, USF\u2019s double-layered delegation \u201cis an \ninnovation with no foothold in history or tradition.\u201d  \nSeila L., 591 U.S. at 222. \nb. \nIn addition to being a historical anomaly, USF\u2019s  \ndouble-layered delegation \u201cis incompatible with our con-\nstitutional structure.\u201d  Ibid. \nBoth the public and the private nondelegation doc-\ntrines exist to ensure that Congress exercises its legis-\nlative powers\u2014the greatest of the powers vested by the \nConstitution in the federal government\u2014\u201cin a way that \ncomports with the People\u2019s will.\u201d23  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n \n23 The private nondelegation doctrine also likely applies to dele-\ngations of the executive power to private entities, see Amtrak II, \n \n\n74a \n \n459; see THE FEDERALIST NO. 51 (J. Madison) (\u201cA de-\npendence on the people is, no doubt, the primary control \non the government[.]\u201d).  As we previously noted: \nEvery member of Congress is accountable to his or \nher constituents through regular popular elections. \nAnd a duly elected Congress may exercise the legis-\nlative power only through the assent of two sepa-\nrately constituted chambers (bicameralism) and the \napproval of the President (presentment).  This pro-\ncess, cumbersome though it may often seem to eager \nonlookers, ensures that the People can be heard and \nthat their representatives have deliberated before \nthe strong hand of the federal government raises to \nchange the rights and responsibilities attendant to \nour public life. \nJarkesy, 34 F.4th at 459-60 (citations and footnote omit-\nted).  \u201cBut that accountability evaporates if a person or \nentity other than Congress,\u201d whether public or private, \n\u201cexercises legislative power.\u201d  Id. at 460 (citation omit-\nted). \nBroad congressional delegations to the executive un-\ndermine democratic accountability for at least three rea-\n \n575 U.S. at 62 (Alito, J., concurring) (\u201c[I]t raises \u2018difficult and fun-\ndamental questions\u2019 about the \u2018delegation of Executive power\u2019 when \nCongress authorizes citizen suits.\u201d) (quoting Friends of the Earth, \nInc. v. Laidlaw Environmental Services (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, \n197 (2000) (Kennedy, J., concurring), but petitioners did not raise \nan Article II challenge.  If they had, we might also conclude that \nFCC has unconstitutionally delegated the executive power to pri-\nvate entities.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch, 88 F.4th at 934 (Newsom, J., \nconcurring) (\u201c[I]t seems obvious to me that in collecting de facto \ntaxes and distributing benefits USAC is exercising \u2018executive\u2019 \npower.\u201d). \n\n75a \n \nsons.  First, they allow Congress to circumvent the \n\u201cmany accountability checkpoints\u201d inherent in the Con-\nstitutional lawmaking process.  Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at \n61 (Alito, J., concurring).  Second, they obscure lines of \naccountability the Framers intended to be clear.  See \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 155 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (\u201c[B]y \ndirecting that legislating be done only by elected repre-\nsentatives in a public process, the Constitution sought \nto ensure that the lines of accountability would be clear:  \nThe sovereign people would know, without ambiguity, \nwhom to hold accountable for the laws they would have \nto follow.\u201d); id. at 156 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (\u201cLegis-\nlators might seek to take credit for addressing a press-\ning social problem by sending it to the executive for res-\nolution, while at the same time blaming the executive for \nthe problems that attend whatever measures he chooses \nto pursue.  In turn, the executive might point to Con-\ngress as the source of the problem.  These opportuni-\nties for finger-pointing might prove temptingly advan-\ntageous for the politicians involved, but they would also \nthreaten to disguise responsibility for the decisions.\u201d  \n(citations and quotation omitted)).  And third, they \nrender the promise of recourse to the judiciary illusory \nbecause they give reviewing courts no standard against \nwhich to measure the compatibility of executive action \nwith the prescriptions of the people\u2019s elected represent-\natives.  See id. at 167-68 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (not-\ning the similarity of the questions raised in vagueness \nchallenges and delegation challenges). \nDelegations to private entities undermine accounta-\nbility for different reasons.  Most obviously, private \nentities are \u201cneither legally nor politically accountable \nto  . . .  government officials or to the electorate.\u201d  \nLarkin, The Private Delegation Doctrine, supra, at 20; \n\n76a \n \nsee Black, 53 F.4th at 880 (\u201c[I]f people outside govern-\nment could wield the government\u2019s power[ ]then the \ngovernment\u2019s promised accountability to the people \nwould be an illusion.\u201d).  Unlike officers of the United \nStates, who \u201cmust take an oath or affirmation to support \nthe Constitution,\u201d Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., \nconcurring) (citing U.S. CONST. art. VI, cl. 3), directors \nof private entities owe no fealty to the Constitution and \ninstead owe legal obligations to their shareholders.  \nSee 2 BUS. & COM. LITIG. FED. CTS. \u00a7 13:77 (5th ed.) \n(\u201cUnder Delaware law, directors, officers, and control-\nling shareholders owe a duty of loyalty to the company \nand to its shareholders or owners.\u201d).  Moreover, \u201cpass-\ning off a Government operation as an independent pri-\nvate concern\u201d allows \u201cGovernment officials [to] wield \npower without owning up to the consequences\u201d because \nthe people might not associate bad results with the Gov-\nernment at all.  Amtrak II, 575 U.S. at 57 (Alito, J., \nconcurring). \nUSF combines these features, meaning accountabil-\nity is undermined twice over.  First, the public cannot \ntell whether it is being taxed by the FCC or USAC.  \nSee Universal Service, UNIVERSAL SERV. ADMIN. CO., \nsupra (\u201cUsing information from universal service pro-\ngram participants, USAC estimates how much money \nwill be needed each quarter to provide universal service \nsupport.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  And if some sleuthing \nmember of the public suspected the federal government \nwas behind the mysterious USF charge on his phone \nbill, how could he determine which governmental official \nto blame?  Not only could Congress and FCC point fin-\ngers at each other, see Gundy, 588 U.S. at 156 (Gorsuch, \nJ., dissenting), but both could offload responsibility onto \nthe private entities (USAC and its private, for-profit, \n\n77a \n \nconstituents) to which FCC delegated the USF Tax \nwithout congressional authorization.  See Free Enter. \nFund, 561 U.S. at 497-98 (\u201cThe diffusion of power car-\nries with it a diffusion of accountability  . . .  Without \na clear and effective chain of command, the public can-\nnot determine on whom the blame or the punishment of \na pernicious measure, or series of pernicious measures \nought really to fall.\u201d  (citation omitted)).  And even as \ngovernment officials are immunized from public over-\nsight by this \u201cMatryoshka doll\u201d of delegations and sub-\ndelegations, id. at 497, important governmental respon-\nsibilities are carried out by private entities with a legal \nobligation not to serve the public but rather to reap prof-\nits from it.  And last but not least, reviewing courts are \nhandicapped from redressing the injuries of aggrieved \ncitizens by the complete absence of a judicially workable \nstandard in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254. \nThus, just as the added layer of tenure protection at \nissue in Free Enterprise Fund \u201cma[de] a difference\u201d to \nthe President\u2019s ability control the executive branch, id. \nat 495, so too do the myriad obfuscations of the USF Tax \nmake a difference to the Legislative Vesting Clause.  \nAccordingly, we hold that the universal service contri-\nbution mechanism\u2019s double-layered delegation \u201cis in-\ncompatible with our constitutional structure.\u201d  Seila \nL., 591 U.S. at 222. \nIV. \nFinally, a brief word about the dissenting opinions. \nThe principal dissent spills much ink on the distinction \nbetween fees and taxes only to conclude the distinction \ndoes not matter because all \u201crevenue-raising delega-\ntion[s]\u201d are the same.  Post, at 96 (Stewart, J., dissent-\ning).  And how does the Constitution permit double in-\n\n78a \n \nsulation of a revenue-raising delegation like the USF? \nThe principal dissent does not say. \nThe second dissenting opinion calls the majority \nopinion \nan \n\u201cunannounced\u201d \nand \n\u201cunprecedented\u201d \n\u201csleight of hand.\u201d  Post, at 98, 105 (Higginson, J., dis-\nsenting).  Worse, it is a usurpation that leaves \u201cthe po-\nlitical branches powerless to govern.\u201d  Post, at 101, \n105.  With deepest respect for our esteemed colleagues \nwho see this case differently, the dissenting opinion\u2019s le-\ngal authorities do not support its conclusions. \nFor example, it repeatedly accuses us of contraven-\ning Supreme Court precedent.  Post, at 98, 99, 100, 101, \n103, 105 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But which prece-\ndent, precisely, are we flouting?  The dissenting opin-\nion does not say.  The closest it comes is to contend that \nthe Supreme Court has considered cases involving both \na \u201cdelegation of legislative power and a[ ] delegation of \ngovernment power to a private entity, yet the Court has \nnever instructed  . . .  that a different standard ap-\nplies.\u201d  Id. at 98-99 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  But in \nwhich case did the Supreme Court consider a double del-\negation problem like the one presented here?  The \nstatutory provision at issue in Carter Coal did not fea-\nture a combined public/private delegation; it delegated \npower directly to private enterprise.  See 298 U.S. at \n283-84.  And the Court found that violated the Consti-\ntution.  Id. at 311.  Having found that statute uncon-\nstitutional, it would have been quite peculiar for the \nCourt to proceed to render an advisory opinion on \nwhether a nonexistent double delegation would also vio-\nlate the Constitution. \nMeanwhile, in Currin and Sunshine Anthracite, the \nCourt found the Government had not delegated any leg-\n\n79a \n \nislative power to any private entity.  See Currin, 306 \nU.S. at 15 (\u201cSo far as growers of tobacco are concerned, \nthe required referendum does not involve any delega-\ntion of legislative authority.\u201d); Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399 (\u201cSince law-making is not entrusted to the \nindustry, this statutory scheme is unquestionably valid.\u201d).  \nThere cannot be a combined public/private delegation \nwithout a private delegation.  We obviously agree with \nour esteemed colleagues in dissent that Supreme Court \nprecedent binds us and binds us absolutely.  But we do \nnot understand how the dissenting opinions can say this \ncase is controlled by Supreme Court precedent without \ndisputing that the double delegation at issue here is un-\nprecedented. \nThe second dissenting opinion also contends we have \nmischaracterized the Supreme Court\u2019s separation-of-\npowers precedents.  On its telling, Seila Law does not \nevince a general principle that two constitutional parts \ncan converge to create an unconstitutional whole.  Ra-\nther, it says the Seila Law Court simply declined to rec-\nognize an exception to the President\u2019s removal power \nfor single principal officers who wield significant execu-\ntive authority.  Post, at 100 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nEven if that were right, it would not explain Free Enter-\nprise Fund.  In that case the Court unquestionably \nheld that two independently constitutional removal  \nrestrictions\u2014one that fit squarely within the Humph-\nrey\u2019s Executor exception, and one that fit squarely \nwithin the Morrison exception\u2014combined to create a \nconstitutional violation.  The dissenting opinion offers \nno explanation for that holding. \nFinally, the second dissenting opinion contends our \ndecision leaves the political branches \u201cpowerless to gov-\n\n80a \n \nern.\u201d  Post, at 105 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  That is \nquite an assertion, but with greatest respect, it is un-\ntrue.  Today\u2019s decision applies to a narrow question, \nimplicating just one federal program that is doubly in-\nsulated from political accountability.  The parties be-\nfore us have not pointed to other federal programs that \nhave the same or similar constitutional defects.  And as \nto the USF particularly, Congress could obviate the con-\nstitutional problem by simply ratifying USAC\u2019s deci-\nsions about how much American citizens should contrib-\nute to the goal of universal service.  Cf. Saikrishna \nBangalore Prakash, The Sky Will Not Fall:  Managing \nthe Transition to a Revitalized Nondelegation Doc-\ntrine, in THE ADMINISTRATIVE STATE BEFORE THE SU-\nPREME COURT, supra, at 290 (\u201cLegislative ratification of \nagency law would wholly preclude a nondelegation chal-\nlenge[.]\u201d). \nThe second dissenting opinion contends otherwise \nbecause, in its view, the Federal Government will grind \nto a halt if Congress, or even FCC, were required to do \nmore than wield a Russian veto over the USF tax.  As \nevidence, it points to private contractors who perform \nministerial functions on behalf of the Centers for Medi-\ncare and Medicaid Services.  Post, at 103 (Higginson, \nJ., dissenting).  But if anything, Medicare and Medi-\ncaid prove the opposite.  Congress\u2014not a federal \nagency, and certainly not executives of private compa-\nnies\u2014decides how much Americans should be taxed to \nfund federal healthcare programs.  See, e.g., Louise \nSheiner, Lorae Stojanovic, & David Wessel, How does \nMedicare work?  And how is it financed?, BROOKINGS \n(Mar. 20, 2024), https://perma.cc/D7LN-DHYW (ex-\nplaining the Government\u2019s contributions to Medicare \ncome from a combination of general revenues and pay-\n\n81a \n \nroll taxes); 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 3101 (setting the Medicare pay-\nroll tax rate).  The unconstitutionality of the USF says \nnothing about other tax programs, like Medicare and \nMedicaid, that Congress administers. \n* * * \nAmerican telecommunications consumers are subject \nto a multi-billion-dollar tax nobody voted for.  The size \nof that tax is de facto determined by a trade group \nstaffed by industry insiders with no semblance of ac-\ncountability to the public.  And the trade group in turn \nrelies on projections made by its private, for-profit con-\nstituent companies, all of which stand to profit from \nevery single tax increase.  This combination of delega-\ntions, subdelegations, and obfuscations of the USF Tax \nmechanism offends Article I, \u00a7 1 of the Constitution. \nFor the foregoing reasons, we hold unconstitutional \nthe Q1 2022 USF Tax.  Accordingly, we GRANT the \npetition and REMAND to FCC for further proceedings. \n\n82a \n \nJENNIFER WALKER ELROD, Circuit Judge, joined by \nHO and ENGELHARDT, Circuit Judges, concurring: \nI concur in the majority opinion in full.  The major-\nity correctly and thoroughly identifies the concerns that \nmake this double delegation unconstitutional.  I write \nseparately to say that I would go one step further and \naddress the lawfulness of each individual delegation.  \nFor the reasons explained in the majority\u2019s thorough \nopinion, Congress\u2019s delegation of legislative power to \nthe FCC and the FCC\u2019s delegation of the taxing power \nto a private entity each individually contravene the sep-\naration of powers principle that undergirds our Consti-\ntutional Republic. \nAs James Madison put it, \u201c[t]he accumulation of all \npowers legislative, executive, and judiciary in the same \nhands,  . . .  may justly be pronounced the very defi-\nnition of tyranny.\u201d  Dep\u2019t of Transp. v. Ass\u2019n of Am. R.R., \n575 U.S. 43, 74 (2015) (Thomas, J., concurring) (quoting \nThe Federalist No. 47, p. 301 (C. Rossiter ed. 1961)); see \nalso Baron de Montesquieu, The Spirit of the Laws, bk. \nXI, ch. VI (1748) (\u201cWhen the legislative and executive \npowers are united in the same person, or in the same \nbody of magistrates, there can be no liberty; . . . .\u201d). \nTo ensure that the legislative power remains sepa-\nrate from the executive power, the Constitution \u201cpro-\nvides strict rules to ensure that Congress exercises the \nlegislative power in a way that comports with the Peo-\nple\u2019s will.\u201d  Jarkesy v. Sec. and Exch. Comm\u2019n, 34 \nF.4th 446, 459 (5th Cir. 2022) aff\u200a\u2019d, No. 22-859, 2024 WL \n3187811 (U.S. June 27, 2024).  Each member of Con-\ngress is accountable to his or her constituents through \nregular popular elections.  U.S. Const. art I, \u00a7\u00a7 2, 3; id. \namend. XVII, cl. 1.  And Congress may exercise legis-\n\n83a \n \nlative power (including the power to tax) only by going \nthrough the arduous process of bicameralism and pre-\nsentment.  U.S. Const. art. I, \u00a7 7.  This \u201censures that \nthe People can be heard and that their representatives \nhave deliberated before the strong hand of the federal \ngovernment raises to change the rights and responsibil-\nities attendant to our public life.\u201d  Jarkesy, 34 F.4th at \n459-60.  Each of the delegations here, viewed inde-\npendently, violates this principle. \nJustifying the Congressional delegation on the \ngrounds that Congress has enlisted the \u201cexpertise\u201d of \nthe FCC in the undefined area of Universal Service \nrings hollow given that the FCC relies on the determi-\nnations of private industry leaders to determine the \nUSF tax. \nThe second dissent states that the federal govern-\nment is rendered \u201cpowerless to govern\u201d by the major-\nity\u2019s holding.  Post, at 101 (Higginson, J., dissenting).  \nThat is a non sequitur.  Congress can always act by \npassing duly enacted legislation through bicameralism \nand presentment.  The assertion that delegations of \nlegislative power are necessary for effective and effi-\ncient governance in the modern world does not author-\nize Congress to violate Article I, Section I\u2019s vesting \nclause.  Congress\u2019s inability to implement and oversee \nthe program itself might even suggest that the program \nshould not exist.  Regardless, Congress must imple-\nment, or at least approve, the USF tax.  That way, the \npower of the people to oversee those they have chosen \nto govern is rightfully restored.1 \n \n1  They are, after all, the ones ultimately footing the bill for Uni-\nversal Service. \n\n84a \n \nWith this in mind, I join the thorough and well-rea-\nsoned opinion of the court in full. \n\n85a \n \nJAMES C. HO, Circuit Judge, concurring: \nOur Constitution establishes three branches of gov-\nernment, not four.1  It vests \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted\u201d\u2014including the \u201cPower To lay and col-\nlect Taxes\u201d\u2014not in some unnamed fourth branch of gov-\nernment, but in \u201ca Congress of the United States,\u201d \nwhose members are chosen by and directly accountable \nto the people of the United States.  U.S. CONST. art. I, \n\u00a7\u00a7 1, 8.  So if we\u2019re serious about protecting our consti-\ntutional democracy, we must enforce the principle that \nall legislative powers like the power to tax are indeed \nexercised by the people we elect. \nThat\u2019s what our court does today.  We hold that the \ndelegation of Congress\u2019s taxing power, first to a federal \nagency, and then to a private entity, violates the Vesting \nClause of Article I.  I certainly concur. \nIn reaching this decision, the court distinguishes \nTexas v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518 (5th Cir. 2021).  I would \nalso disavow Rettig altogether, for the reasons noted in \nTexas v. Rettig, 993 F.3d 408, 408 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J., \ndissenting from denial of rehearing en banc). \nThe delegations of taxing authority at issue in Rettig \npresent the same challenges to our constitutional  \ndemocracy\u2014and to the founding principle of taxation \nwithout representation\u2014that are presented here.  It\u2019s \njust as true in Rettig as it is here that \u201c[t]he right to vote \n \n1  See, e.g., Ameron, Inc. v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, 787 \nF.2d 875, 892 (3rd Cir. 1986) (Becker, J., concurring) (\u201cThe Consti-\ntution establishes three branches of government, not four.\u201d); Ass\u2019n \nof American Railroads v. U.S. Dep\u2019t of Transp., 821 F.3d 19, 30-31 \n(D.C. Cir. 2016) (various provisions of \u201cour Constitution  . . .  \nwere designed for a government of three branches, not four\u201d). \n\n86a \n \nmeans nothing if we abandon our constitutional commit-\nments and allow the real work of lawmaking to be exer-\ncised by private interests colluding with agency bureau-\ncrats, rather than by elected officials accountable to the \nAmerican voter.\u201d  Id. at 410-11. \nAnd both in Rettig and here, the threats to democ-\nracy presented by the administrative state are not inad-\nvertent, but intentional\u2014a deliberate design to turn \nconsent of the governed into an illusion.  \u201c[T]he expan-\nsion of the electorate has been accompanied by the \ngrowth of administrative law.  . . .  [W]hether in \n1870, 1920, or 1965  . . .  each time, after representa-\ntive government became more open to the people, legis-\nlative power increasingly has been sequestered to a part \nof government that is largely closed to them.\u201d  PHILIP \nHAMBURGER, IS ADMINISTRATIVE LAW UNLAWFUL?  \n369 (2014).  \u201c[A]lthough [members of the knowledge \nclass] mostly supported expanded suffrage, they also \nsupported the removal of legislative power to adminis-\ntrative agencies staffed by persons who shared their \noutlook.\u201d  Id. at 374.  \u201cThe development of adminis-\ntrative power thus  . . .  must be recognized as  . . .  \na profoundly disturbing shift of power.  As soon as the \npeople secured the power to vote, a new class cordoned \noff for themselves a sort of legislative power that they \ncould exercise without representation.\u201d  Id.  Another \nscholar put it this way:  \u201cHowever much [administra-\ntive] agencies may emphasize their formal openness, in \npractice well-organized, directly interested parties dom-\ninate comment processes.  Normal people do not per-\nceive these proceedings as \u2018democratic.\u2019\u200a\u201d  PHILIP A. \nWALLACH, WHY CONGRESS? 231 (2023).  With Con-\ngress, \u201cthe electorate still has the chance, crude as it \nmay be, to pass judgment on the elected official and con-\n\n87a \n \nvince other members of their community of the im-\nportance of doing so. Against . . . the bureaucracy, citi-\nzens have no such recourse.\u201d Id. \nWe devote significant energy and resources to secur-\ning the right to vote for every citizen.  But that right \nmatters only if our elected officials matter.  There\u2019s no \npoint in voting if the real power rests in the hands of \nunelected bureaucrats\u2014or their private delegates.  If \nyou believe in democracy, then you should oppose an ad-\nministrative state that shields government action from \naccountability to the people.  I concur. \n\n88a \n \nCARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge, joined by RICHMAN, \nChief Judge, and SOUTHWICK, HAYNES, GRAVES, HIG-\nGINSON, and DOUGLAS, Circuit Judges, dissenting: \nI dissent because the Universal Service Fund \n(\u201cUSF\u201d) is not unconstitutional.  Section 254 of the Tel-\necommunications Act of 1996 provides an intelligible \nprinciple and the Federal Communications Commission \n(\u201cFCC\u201d) maintains control over the Universal Service \nAdministrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d), the private entity \nentrusted to aid its administration of the USF.  The \nmajority\u2019s exhaustive exegesis about policy, history, and \nassorted doctrines does not eclipse the consistent hold-\ning of three sister circuits that have addressed constitu-\ntional challenges to Section 254.  All have held it con-\nstitutional under the intelligible principle test.  The \nmajority has created a split in a sweeping opinion that \n(1) crafts an amorphous new standard to analyze dele-\ngations, (2) overturns\u2014without much fanfare\u2014circuit \nprecedent holding that this program collects adminis-\ntrative fees and not taxes, (3) blurs the distinction be-\ntween taxes and fees, and (4) rejects established admin-\nistrative law principles and all evidence to the contrary \nto create a private nondelegation doctrine violation. \nI.  THE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE \nPetitioners and the majority contend that \u00a7 254 vio-\nlates the nondelegation doctrine.  Notably, the Su-\npreme Court has denied petitions for review of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s and the Eleventh Circuit\u2019s decisions rejecting \nthese contentions.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No.  \n23-456, 2024 WL 2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.); \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, 2024 WL 2883755 \n(U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.).  In line with our col-\nleagues in the Sixth, Eleventh, and D.C. Circuits, I \n\n89a \n \nwould reject this challenge and hold that \u00a7 254 satisfies \nthe intelligible principle test as articulated by the Su-\npreme Court. \na.  Section 254 Sufficiently Delimits the  \nFCC\u2019s Discretion \nThe nondelegation doctrine is based on the central \nprinciple that the separation of powers underlies our \nsystem of Government.  See Mistretta v. United States, \n488 U.S. 361, 371 (1989).  Article I, Section 1 of the U.S. \nConstitution provides that \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers \nherein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the \nUnited States.\u201d  U.S. CONST., art. I, \u00a7 1.  The Court \nhas long acknowledged that Congress \u201cmay confer sub-\nstantial discretion on executive agencies to implement \nand enforce the laws\u201d where it \u201chas supplied an intelli-\ngible principle to guide the delegee\u2019s use of discretion.\u201d  \nGundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 135 (2019) (plu-\nrality opinion) (emphasis added).  It has consistently \nheld that a delegation is constitutional if \u201cCongress has \nsupplied an intelligible principle to guide the delegee\u2019s \nuse of discretion.\u201d  Id. at 2123.  Under this frame-\nwork, the Court has approved narrow and broad delega-\ntions, acknowledging that \u201cin our increasingly complex \nsociety, replete with ever changing and more technical \nproblems, Congress simply cannot do its job absent an \nability to delegate power under broad general direc-\ntives.\u201d  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372; see Am. Power Light \n& Co. v. SEC, 329 U.S. 90, 105 (1946) (\u201cThe judicial ap-\nproval accorded [to] these \u2018broad\u2019 standards for admin-\nistrative action is a reflection of the necessities of mod-\nern legislation dealing with complex economic and social \nproblems.\u201d); Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, \n310 U.S. 381, 398 (1940).  It has further explained that \n\n90a \n \nthe nondelegation inquiry \u201calways begins (and often al-\nmost ends) with statutory interpretation.\u201d  Gundy, 588 \nU.S. at 135. \nAs such, we begin our nondelegation inquiry not with \na long discourse about the history of the USF\u2019s short-\ncomings, but with statutory interpretation.  See id.  \nIn 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254, Congress clearly set out both the \ngeneral policy\u2014ensuring \u201c[a]ccess to advanced telecom-\nmunications and information services [are] provided in \nall regions of the Nation,\u201d id. at \u00a7 254(b)(2)\u2014and the \nagency entrusted to execute that policy, the FCC, see \nAm. Power, 329 U.S. at 105.  All that leaves is the ques-\ntion of whether Congress delineated \u201cthe boundaries of \nthis delegated authority.\u201d  Id.  Petitioners argue that \nbecause \u00a7 254 sets no definite limits on how much the \nFCC can raise for the USF that it lacks any concrete, \nobjective guidance limiting this authority.  The Court \nhas rejected this argument in several formulations in \nchallenges to delegations implicating the authority to \nraise revenue.  See, e.g., Skinner v. Mid-Am. Pipeline \nCo., 490 U.S. 212, 222-23 (1989); J.W. Hampton, Jr., & \nCo. v. United States, 276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928).  For sim-\nilar reasons, Petitioners\u2019 argument should fail here.  \nExamining the plain language of \u00a7 254, it becomes clear \nthat Congress has sufficiently limited the FCC\u2019s ability \nto raise revenue in a way other than imposing a statu-\ntory cap on how much can be raised. \nSection 254(b) lays out the principles that the FCC \nmust adhere to.  It sets out the specific directive that \nthe FCC \u201cshall [create] policies for the preservation and \nadvancement of universal service.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b) \n(emphasis added).  It further establishes that the FCC \nis required to do so pursuant to certain enumerated \n\n91a \n \nprinciples that:  \u201cquality services should be made avail-\nable at just and reasonable rates; advanced services \nshould be provided to the entire United States; and \u2018low-\nincome consumers and those in rural, insular, and high \ncost areas\u2019 should have access to advanced services at \nreasonably comparable rates to those in urban areas.\u201d  \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(3).  Section 254(b)(5) limits the \nFCC to only enact universal service policies that are \n\u201cspecific, predictable and sufficient\u201d to \u201cpreserve and \nadvance universal service.\u201d  Id. 254(b)(5).  The stat-\nute further charges telecommunications carriers with \nthe duty to provide access that meets minimum stand-\nards of universal service to \u201c[e]lementary and secondary \nschools and classrooms, healthcare providers, and li-\nbraries.\u201d  Id. 254(b)(6). \nAs the panel noted, \u00a7 254(b)(7) \u201cenables, and likely \nobligates, [the FCC] to add principles \u2018consistent with\u2019  \n\u00a7 254\u2019s overall purpose.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 63 \nF.4th 441, 448 (5th Cir. 2023) (quoting 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(b)(7)), reh\u2019g en banc granted, opinion vacated, 72 \nF.4th 107 (5th Cir.).  In line with our colleagues at the \nSixth Circuit, I view \u00a7 254(b) as Congress laying out \u201ca \nhigh-level goal for universal service\u201d and then going fur-\nther to \u201cenumerate[] specific principles of universal ser-\nvice.\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v.

Section 254(b) contains limiting princi-\nples that impose \u201ca mandatory duty on the FCC\u201d to con-\nsider the listed universal service principles when it up-\ndates its universal service policies.  Qwest Corp. v. \nFCC, 258 F.3d 1191, 1200 (10th Cir. 2001); see, e.g., Con-\nsumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at 791; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 \nF.4th 917, 924 (11th Cir. 2023), cert. denied, 2024 WL \n2883755 (June 10, 2024) (Mem.).  By its plain language, \n\n92a \n \nCongress ordered in \u00a7 254 that the FCC \u201cshall base pol-\nicies for the preservation and advancement of universal \nservice on the principles\u201d enumerated in \u00a7 254(b).  47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b).  This imposition of a duty to weigh the \nenumerated universal service principles is reminiscent \nof constitutional statutory delegations that provided an \nintelligible principle in the form of \u201cguidance that the \n[agency] cannot disregard.\u201d  Allstates Refractory Con-\ntractors, LLC v. Su, 79 F.4th 755, 775 (6th Cir. 2023) \n(Nalbandian, J., dissenting) (citing Mistretta, 488 U.S. \nat 375-76). \nReading \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s provisions together, as our sister \ncircuits have, \u201cindicates that Congress required that the \nFCC base its efforts to preserve and advance universal \nservice on the enumerated principles while allowing the \nFCC to then \u2018balance [each] principle[] against one an-\nother when they conflict.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th \nat 791 (quoting Qwest Corp., 258 F.3d at 1200); see also \nTex.

Thus, contrary to Petitioners\u2019 and the major-\nity\u2019s contentions, \u00a7 254(b)(7)\u2019s grant of authority to the \nFCC to devise new universal service policies based on \nprinciples that it \u201cdetermine[s] are necessary and ap-\npropriate for the protection of the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity\u201d does not render the other prin-\nciples meaningless.  Nor does it \u201cstrip away the intelli-\ngible principle and the limits on the FCC\u2019s discretion \nthat Congress imposed in the first six principles and \nthroughout\u201d the remainder of \u00a7 254\u2019s other provisions.  \nSee Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, 67 F.4th at 792.

Section 254\u2019s strictures set out from whom funds \nare exacted, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), who receives the benefit \nof the funds, 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(e), and what minimum \nstandards of service must be provided in order to satisfy \nthe longstanding goal of providing universal service.  \nAlenco Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v.

See Gundy, 588 U.S. at 136. \n\n94a \n \n2001) is misplaced.  A closer look at TOPUC II reveals \nhow a strained interpretation of our prior utterances \ndoes not support a determination that \u00a7 254 contains \u201cno \nguidance whatsoever.\u201d  Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446, \n462 (5th Cir. 2022), cert. granted, 143 S. Ct. 2688 (2023). \nIn TOPUC II, we examined whether the FCC\u2019s \nCALLS Order, which raised a price cap on the amount \nthat \u201cend-users of basic local service,\u201d 265 F.3d at 318, \npaid on their telephone bills, violated \u00a7 254\u2019s \u201crequire-\nment of affordable universal access.\u201d  Id. at 320.  Un-\ndertaking a Chevron analysis, we asked \u201cwhether Con-\ngress has spoken directly on the precise question at is-\nsue,\u201d and then turned to whether the FCC\u2019s interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 254 was based upon a permissible construction.  \nId. at 320-21.  Notably, we did not evaluate the consti-\ntutionality of Congress\u2019s delegation there, but consid-\nered whether the Order\u2019s price cap violated the Act\u2019s \nprinciples of ensuring \u201cjust, reasonable, and affordable \nrates\u201d of universal service.  Id. at 321 (quoting 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1), (i)).  Given the full scope of our prior \ninterpretation of \u00a7 254(b), Petitioners\u2019 overreliance on \nthese unrelated considerations to carry the day in a non-\ndelegation doctrine inquiry is unfounded. \nSection 254\u2019s other provisions provide further checks \non the FCC\u2019s discretion.  Section 254(c) limits the FCC \nin determining which telecommunications services will \nreceive support from the USF.  In \u00a7 254(c)(1), Con-\ngress specifically ordered the FCC to revise its defini-\ntion of supported services only to account for \u201cadvances \nin telecommunications and information technologies and \nservices.\u201d  Some have said that \u00a7 254(c) does not limit \nthe FCC\u2019s discretion to raise revenue because it only ad-\ndresses the spending of USF money.  However, that \n\n95a \n \ncontention neglects the direct link between the collec-\ntion of universal service contributions and the disburse-\nment of USF money.  Section 254(d) requires \u201ctelecom-\nmunications carrier[s] that provide[] interstate telecom-\nmunications services\u201d to \u201ccontribute, on an equitable \nand nondiscriminatory basis\u201d to the \u201cmechanisms estab-\nlished by the [FCC] to preserve and advance universal \nservice.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(d).2  As the FCC points out, the less \nmoney the telecommunications carriers require to effec-\ntively provide universal service results in \u201cless revenue \nthe FCC must raise to finance those mechanisms.\u201d \nWith respect to dispersing any money from the USF, \nthe FCC is restricted to dispersing credits to statutorily \ndesignated eligible telecommunications carriers that \nprovide support for universal services.  Id. \u00a7 254(e); see \nTOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 412 (\u201cThe term \u2018sufficient\u2019 ap-\npears in \u00a7 254(e), and the plain language of \u00a7 254(e) \nmakes sufficiency of universal service support a direct \nstatutory command rather than a statement of one of \nseveral principles.\u201d  (emphasis added)).  On more than \none occasion, we have held that \u00a7 254(e) \u201crequires that \nuniversal service support be \u2018explicit and sufficient.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nAlenco, 201 F.3d at 614 (emphasis added).  As a practi-\ncal matter, it is worth noting that USF program dis-\nbursements have \u201cremained relatively stable over the \npast decade\u201d and even decreased from 2012 to 2020.  \nFCC, FCC 22-67, REPORT ON THE FUTURE OF THE UNI-\n \n2  As I explain in Part III, infra, that telecommunications carriers \ntypically pass through the cost of their quarterly contributions in \nthe form of line-item charges on consumers\u2019 bills on their own voli-\ntion is irrelevant to our constitutional analysis.  Cf. J.W. Hamp-\nton, 276 U.S. at 406 (describing that Congress\u2019s delegations must \nbe analyzed for the specificity and extent of vestment of discretion \nyielded to the appropriate co-ordinate branch of government). \n\n96a \n \nVERSAL SERVICE FUND 10084-85, \u00b6 92 (Aug. 15, 2022) \n(\u201cReport to Congress\u201d).  This fact flatly contradicts \nPetitioners\u2019 assertions that the FCC has acted from a \nposition \u201cthat it has a free hand to overcharge\u201d for uni-\nversal service.  Thus, I would deny the petition for re-\nview because \u00a7 254 satisfies the intelligible principle test \nas articulated by the Supreme Court. \nb. Section 254\u2019s Context, Purpose, and History \nIn Gundy, the Court stated that the intelligible prin-\nciple analysis requires examination of \u201c[t]he [statute\u2019s] \ntext, considered alongside its context, purpose, and his-\ntory.\u201d  588 U.S. at 136.  Congress\u2019s consistent intention \nto preserve and advance universal service for nearly a \ncentury, 3 combined with \u00a7 254\u2019s articulated purpose \nprovide further evidence of the existence of an intelligi-\nble principle.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at 790-95; \nsee Am. Power, 329 U.S. at 104; TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at \n405-06.  The majority\u2019s disagreement with Congress\u2019s \npolicy choices, Maj. Op. at 26, does not transform the \nUSF into a constitutional or statutory violation.  See \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 F.4th at 449 n.4.  As the panel \nheld, \u00a7 254 does not leave the FCC with \u201cno guidance \nwhatsoever,\u201d id. at 448-49, and more befittingly, it ac-\ncords with the statute\u2019s purpose, and \u201cCongress\u2019s his-\ntory of pursuing universal service\u201d to clearly enunciate \nan intelligible principle that sufficiently cabins the \n \n3  Congress passed the FCC\u2019s organic statute in 1934 and mod-\nernized the agency\u2019s regulatory role in passing the Telecommuni-\ncations Act of 1994 \u201cto make available, so far as possible, to all the \npeople of the United States, without discrimination on the basis of \nrace, color, religion, national origin, or sex, a rapid, efficient, Na-\ntion-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communication service \nwith adequate facilities at reasonable charges.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151. \n\n97a \n \nFCC\u2019s discretion.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 67 F.4th at \n795; Gundy, 588 U.S. at 135-36.  In sum, I would hold \nthat the context, purpose, and history surrounding \u00a7 254 \nevinces a clear intelligible principle delimiting agency \ndiscretion. \nII.  THE PRIVATE NONDELEGATION DOCTRINE \nAn agency may obtain the assistance of private par-\nties in implementing its mandate under federal law so \nlong as those private parties are subordinate to the \nagency and subject to the agency\u2019s \u201csurveillance\u201d and \nguidance.  Adkins, 310 U.S. at 388, 399; see also Bo-\nerschig v. Trans-Pecos Pipeline, LLC, 872 F.3d 701, 708 \n(5th Cir. 2017) (noting same).  Petitioners and the ma-\njority assert however, that the FCC \u201creflexively rub-\nberstamps\u201d USAC\u2019s proposals to determine the contri-\nbution rates charged to telecommunications carriers.  \nThey further posit that USAC maintains final decision-\nmaking power because \u201cthe FCC has never reversed \nUSAC\u2019s projections of demand.\u201d  Neither of these ar-\nguments is supported by the statute or applicable regu-\nlations nor do they consider well-established principles \nof administrative law.  As described below, these argu-\nments follow from misstatements of record facts. \nThe FCC determines a quarterly contribution factor \n\u201cbased on the ratio of total projected quarterly expenses \nof the universal service support mechanisms to the total \nend-user interstate and international telecommunica-\ntions revenues.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  Sixty days \nin advance of this determination, USAC submits its \n\u201cprojections of demand\u201d\u2014the projected expenses to en-\nsure the operation of the USF programs\u2014to the FCC.  \nId. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  These projections of demand for \nUSF support are subject to the FCC\u2019s imposed caps.  \n\n98a \n \nSee, e.g., Interim Cap Order, 23 FCC Rcd. 8834 (2008) \n(adopting caps on disbursements of USF contributions \nthat eligible telecommunications carriers may receive to \n\u201crein in the explosive growth in high-cost universal ser-\nvice support disbursements\u201d).  Considering the FCC\u2019s \nlimitations on USAC\u2019s proposed \u201cprojections of de-\nmand,\u201d USAC compiles the total revenues and expenses \nof the contributing carriers based on their Reporting \nWorksheets.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  These work-\nsheets, created by the FCC, id. \u00a7 54.711, must be sub-\nmitted for review at least thirty days before the start of \nthe quarter.  Id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  USAC then calculates \nthe contribution factor from the Reporting Worksheets \nand then the ratio is publicly noticed and made available \non the FCC\u2019s website.  See id. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  The \nFCC then may approve the projections or administra-\ntive expense estimates or exercise its \u201cright to set pro-\njections of demand and administrative expenses.\u201d  Id.  \nWhere the FCC does not act within fourteen days of the \nrelease of the projections of demand, then the projec-\ntions and contributions are deemed approved by the \nFCC.  Id. \nThe USF and its programs receive funding only after \nthe execution of a detailed, multistep process devised by \nthe FCC.  Petitioners and the majority assert that this \nframework is evidence that the FCC merely sits on its \nhands while USAC drives the boat in determining how \nmuch is raised.  This ignores the established principle \nthat \u201can agency exercises its policymaking discretion \nwith equal force when it makes policy by either \u2018de-\ncid[ing] to act\u2019 or \u2018decid[ing] not to act.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Consumers\u2019 \nRsch., 67 F.4th at 796 (quoting Oklahoma v. United \nStates, 62 F.4th 221, 230 (6th Cir. 2023)).  Significantly, \nthe structural relationship between the agency and the \n\n99a \n \nprivate party is the focus of the private nondelegation \ndoctrine inquiry.  See Texas v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 531 \n(5th Cir. 2021).  A closer look at the relationship here \nleads to the conclusion that the FCC has not ceded con-\ntrol of the USF to USAC. \nUSAC is fully subordinate to the FCC as its functions \nare strictly ministerial.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 \nF.4th at 451-52.  Here is a short list of what USAC can \ndo.  USAC is tasked with \u201cbilling contributors, collect-\ning contributions to the universal service support mech-\nanisms, and disbursing universal service support \nfunds.\u201d  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b).  It collects information \nand facts from the contributing telecommunications \ncompanies and tabulates the companies\u2019 contribution \nfactors based on that information and the formulas that \nthe FCC furnishes for USAC to apply.  See, e.g., 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.1304(b) (establishing formula to calculate \nsafety net additive support), 54.901(a) (explaining Con-\nnect \nAmerica \nFund \nBroadband \nLoop \nSupport), \n54.303(a)(1) (setting formula to determine total eligible \noperating expenses), 54.702(n).  USAC contribution \ndeterminations are mere proposals subject to govern-\nment approval.  See Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 927.  \nAs the Court held in Adkins, a private entity\u2019s partici-\npation in ministerial functions under the agency \u201cperva-\nsive surveillance and authority\u201d does not violate the \nConstitution.  310 U.S. at 388.  Here, all of this is done \nunder the FCC\u2019s watch and is conducted only with the \nFCC\u2019s approval.  See Universal Service Contribution \nMethodology, 34 FCC Rcd. 4143, 4144-45 (2019) (citing \nConnect America Fund, 26 FCC Rcd. 17663, 17847 \n(2011)) (directing USAC to make specific contribution \ncollections \u201cregardless of the projected quarterly de-\nmand\u201d calculated from the FCC-supplied formulas). \n\n100a \n \nWith respect to the FCC\u2019s control over USAC, the \nlist of what USAC cannot do is instructive.  USAC can-\nnot make policy.  47 C.F.R \u00a7 54.702(c).  It cannot in-\nterpret unclear provisions or rules.  Id.  It cannot uni-\nlaterally give its proposals the force of law.  47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.709(a)(2).  The very agency action addressed in \nthe instant petition for review is the FCC\u2019s \u201cProposed \nFirst Quarter 2022 Universal Service Contribution Fac-\ntor.\u201d  Consequently, it is inaccurate to state that USAC \ndefinitively determines how much money the USF will \ncollect each quarter.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  \nThe FCC is not bound by USAC\u2019s projections.  Id.  \nUSAC acts no differently than an advisor or policy aide \nthat proposes regulations subject to government ap-\nproval.  See Adkins, 310 U.S. at 388.  Upon receiving \nUSAC\u2019s proposals, the FCC issues a Public Notice, pub-\nlishing the proposed contribution factor and soliciting \npublic comment.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \nWhat occurs after the FCC approves the quarterly \ncontribution factor further supports the notion that \nUSAC is fully subservient to the FCC.  The FCC main-\ntains supervision and review over USAC proposals well \nafter it issues the approved quarterly contribution fac-\ntor.4  Any party that is aggrieved by a ministerial act \n \n4  Hospitals in rural areas and libraries and schools can apply for \ndiscounted telecommunications services under the E-Rate pro-\ngram.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B).  The hospitals, schools, and \nlibraries must post their applications on USAC\u2019s website, undergo \na technology assessment, and comply with strenuous bidding re-\nquirements as outlined by the FCC.  See Bishop Perry Middle \nSch. New Orleans, 21 FCC Rcd. 5316, 5317-18 (2006) (listing the \nrequirements for the E-Rate program as set out by Congress in  \n\u00a7 254(h) and the FCC in 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.504, 54.511(a)).  Where a \nparty fails to comply with the statutory and regulatory require-\n \n\n101a \n \nof USAC\u2014typically the issuance of an invoice to collect \ncontributions\u2014may seek review from the FCC.  47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(b); Universal Serv. Contribution Meth-\nodology, 31 FCC Rcd. 13220 (2016) (holding that USAC \novercharged Cisco WebEx through an improper reve-\nnue calculation).  The FCC quite routinely adjusts \nUSAC proposals that deny discount rate status to public \nlibraries and schools.  See, e.g., Streamlined Resol. of \nRequests Related to Actions by the Universal Serv. Ad-\nmin. Co., 37 FCC Rcd. 5442 (2022); Alpaugh Unified \nSch. Dist., 22 FCC Rcd. 6035, 6036-37 (2007) (remanding \nUSAC proposals that reduced or denied discounted \nrates to public libraries and schools for further fact find-\ning).  USAC is not charged with reviewing applications \nto receive subsidized universal service from qualified \nhospitals, libraries, low-income consumers, rural con-\nsumers, and schools.  The FCC fulfills that role.  See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A)-(B).  We could continue to il-\nlustrate the other places in \u00a7 254 and the Code of Fed-\neral Regulations that demonstrate that the FCC is in \nthe driver\u2019s seat.  But, all of this shows that the FCC \nmaintains complete control over USAC and holds final \ndecision-making authority regarding the USF and its \nprograms. \nA comparison to a recent case where we held that a \nviolation of the private nondelegation doctrine occurred \nfurther underscores this point.  Take our recent deci-\nsion in National Horsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective \n \nments necessary to obtain the discount, it may seek review with the \nFCC.  See generally id.  Notably, the FCC issues the final or-\nders that analyze the requests and either grants them outright, re-\nmands them to USAC for further fact-finding, or denies them.  \nSee id. at 5327-28 (ordering clauses). \n\n102a \n \nAss\u2019n v. Black, 53 F.4th 869 (5th Cir. 2022).  There, this \ncourt was confronted with Congress\u2019s delegation of rule-\nmaking authority to a private entity, the Horseracing \nIntegrity and Safety Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d).  Id. \nat 872.  The statute at issue \u201cnationalize[d] the govern-\nance of the thoroughbred horseracing industry,\u201d placing \nsubstantial unchecked rulemaking power in the Author-\nity\u2019s hands.  Id. at 872.  The statute ordered the  \nAuthority\u2014and not the Federal Trade Commission \n(\u201cFTC\u201d)\u2014to establish anti-doping, medication, and \nracetrack safety programs and a scheme of sanctions, \namong many other rules carrying the force of law.  Id. \nat 882-83.  The FTC was then required by statute to af-\nfirm the Authority\u2019s proposed regulations if deemed \nconsistent with the statute.  Id. at 884-85.  This essen-\ntially placed the FTC and the Authority on the same \nground with respect to enacting rules regulating the \nhorseracing industry that carried the force of law.  See \nid. at 883.  Specifically, we stated that \u201c[a]n agency \ndoes not have meaningful oversight if it does not write \nthe rules, cannot change them, and cannot second-guess \ntheir substance.\u201d  Id. at 872. \nThat is not the case here.  Unlike the FTC in Na-\ntional Horsemen\u2019s, the FCC sets the rules and policy \ndeterminations under which USAC operates and retains \nfinal approval and review of USAC\u2019s proposals.  See \nConsumers\u2019 Rsch., 63 F.4th at 451; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., \n67 F.4th at 796-97; Consumers\u2019 Rsch., 88 F.4th at 927-\n28.  \u201cContributions to [universal service] mechanisms  \n. . .  shall be based on contributors\u2019 projected col-\nlected end-user telecommunications revenues, and on a \ncontribution factor determined quarterly by the [FCC].\u201d  \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a) (emphasis added).  This case dif-\nfers from instances where courts have analyzed whether \n\n103a \n \nan agency was statutorily authorized to rely on a private \nentity for matters that exceeded ministerial tasks.  See \nSierra Club v. Lynn, 502 F.2d 43 (5th Cir. 1974).  As an \ninitial matter, those cases are inapt comparisons be-\ncause USAC serves solely ministerial functions.  And \nthe majority can point to no binding jurisprudence re-\nquiring Congress to specifically designate a private en-\ntity to aid an agency to avoid a constitutional violation. \nPut another way, this court is confronted with a clas-\nsic case where an agency enlists a private entity to assist \nwith ministerial support in the form of fee calculation \nand collection.  See, e.g., Adkins, 310 U.S. at 399 (hold-\ning a private subdelegation of ministerial or fact collect-\ning functions is valid); Oklahoma, 62 F.4th at 229 (\u201cPri-\nvate entities may serve as advisors that propose regula-\ntions.  And they may undertake ministerial functions, \nsuch as fee collection.\u201d  (internal citations omitted)). \nFurthermore, the private entity holds not even a modi-\ncum of final decision-making power.  Regrettably, the \nmajority has adopted Petitioners\u2019 exaggerated concep-\ntion of USAC\u2019s role and discretion to create a private \nnondelegation doctrine violation where none exists.  To \nthe contrary, I would hold, as the panel did, that there \nis no private-nondelegation doctrine violation. \nIII.  EXAMINING REVENUE-RAISING DELEGATIONS \nI conclude with a point of clarification regarding USF \ncontributions in the instant regulatory scheme.  Sec-\ntion 254 establishes a system of fees, not taxes.  It re-\nfers to these sums as contributions\u2014a fee for telecom-\nmunications providers to pay as a cost of doing business.  \nHowever, whether the contributions are a fee has no \nbearing on the nondelegation doctrine analysis because \ndelegations of the taxing power are not subject to \n\n104a \n \nstricter scrutiny.  See Skinner, 490 U.S. at 222.  The \nmajority\u2019s holding presents an unnecessary narrowing \n\u2014or perhaps even elimination\u2014of the distinction of \npass-through fees and taxes and drastically breaks with \nour prior precedent to proclaim that the instant case in-\nvolves a delegation of the power to tax. \na. The Difference Between Pass-Through Fees and \nTaxes \nThe Supreme Court has long differentiated taxes \nfrom fees or other efforts to generate revenue.  See, \ne.g., Twin City Nat\u2019l Bank of New Brighton v. Nebecker, \n167 U.S. 196, 202 (1897); United States v. Munoz-Flores, \n495 U.S. 385, 398 (1990).  In National Cable Television \nAss\u2019n v. United States, 415 U.S. 336, 340-41 (1974), the \nCourt distinguished fees as costs incurred \u201cincident to a \nvoluntary act,\u201d that \u201cbestow[] a benefit on the applicant, \nnot shared by other members of society.\u201d  Id.  Even \nin cases requiring \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d we have simi-\nlarly analyzed costs assessed to entities engaged in the \ncourse of business by legislative bodies and divined our \nown analysis for whether costs are fees or taxes.  See \nNeinast v. Texas, 217 F.3d 275, 278 (5th Cir. 2000).  An \nexamination of both the law of this circuit and the \nCourt\u2019s cases addressing this important distinction re-\nveals that the majority\u2019s analysis distinguishing taxes \nand fees invites future line-drawing that will prove to be \nunworkable. \ni.  Analyzing this Distinction under  \nCircuit Precedent \nThe majority errs by misapplying its standard to de-\ntermine what constitutes a tax to the USF contributions \nat issue.  The majority erases the established distinc-\n\n105a \n \ntions between fees, which do not implicate the Taxing \nClause, and taxes.  See Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340-41.  \nI cannot condone the patent overriding of established \nprecedent from this court and our sister circuits that \nhave long held that USF contributions are fees without \nsubstantial consideration of those determinations. \nIn TOPUC I, we considered a constitutional chal-\nlenge from several wireless telecommunications compa-\nnies asserting that the USF contribution scheme vio-\nlated the Origination Clause.  183 F.3d at 426.  There, \nthe petitioning companies specifically argued that the \nconstitutional violation flowed from the FCC\u2019s require-\nment that paging carriers make contributions to the \nUSF.  Id. at 426-27.  The panel rejected this chal-\nlenge, noting that the Court has made clear that \u201ca stat-\nute [] creat[ing] a particular governmental program and \n[] rais[ing] revenue to support that program  . . .  is \nnot a \u2018Bil[l] for raising Revenue\u2019 within the meaning of \nthe Origination Clause.\u201d  183 F.3d at 426-27 (quoting \nMunoz-Flores, 495 U.S. at 398).  As to the waived Tax \nClause argument, the panel explained in dicta that \n\u201c[e]ven if [the petitioner]\u2019s Taxing Clause argument \nwere properly before us, we find no basis for reversal\u201d \nbecause \u201cthe universal service contribution qualifies as \na fee because it is a payment in support of a service \n(managing and regulating the public telecommunica-\ntions network) that confers special benefits on the [tele-\ncommunications carrier] payees.\u201d  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d \nat 427 n.52 (first citing Nat\u2019l Cable, 415 U.S. at 340; and \nthen citing Rural Tele. Coalition v. FCC, 838 F.2d 1307, \n1314 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (holding universal service contri-\nbutions as a fee supporting allocations between inter-\nstate and intrastate jurisdictions)). \n\n106a \n \nEven though the Taxing Clause and Origination \nClause analyses differ, they require consideration of es-\nsentially the same factors\u2014namely, \u201cwhether the reve-\nnues are used to primarily defray the expenses of regu-\nlating the act\u201d or whether \u201cthe revenues generated from \nthe assessment are for general revenues or for a partic-\nular program.\u201d  Id. at 427 n.51.  Nearly fifteen years \nafter TOPUC I, the D.C. Circuit rejected the same ar-\nguments presented under the Tax Clause in Rural Cel-\nlular Ass\u2019n v. FCC, 685 F.3d 1083, 1089-90 (D.C. Cir. \n2012).  It held that \u00a7 254 could not reasonably be \u201cin-\nterpreted\u201d as \u201can unconstitutional delegation of Con-\ngress\u2019s authority under the Taxing Clause  . . .  be-\ncause the assessment of contributions from carriers is \nnot a tax.\u201d  685 F.3d at 1091.  The en banc court \nshould have reached this same determination here, as \nthis dicta from TOPUC I applies in equal force. \nThe conclusion that USF contributions are valid fees \nand not impermissible taxes follows even under height-\nened scrutiny borrowed from different constitutional \nand statutory frameworks. See discussion infra Part \nII.a-b, pp. 20-23. For instance, in Texas Entertainment \nAss\u2019n, Inc. v. Hegar, 10 F.4th 495 (5th Cir. 2021), we set \nout the governing factors to determine whether an as-\nsessed contribution is a fee or a tax for the purposes of \nthe Tax Injunction Act (\u201cTJA\u201d).  Under the TJA, we \nhave favored a \u201cbroad construction of \u2018tax\u2019\u201d out of re-\nspect of preventing delays in reviewing challenges to \nrevenue raising efforts of state and local governments. \nSee Home Builders Ass\u2019n of Miss. v. City of Madison, \n143 F.3d 1006, 1011 (5th Cir. 1998). Despite the differ-\nences in the analysis presented in the TJA and taxing \npower inquiries, any distinction does not impact the fact \nthat USF contributions are not taxes under either test. \n\n107a \n \nThe Hegar panel stated that a fee:  \u201cis imposed (1) \nby an agency, not the legislature; (2) upon those it reg-\nulates, not the community as a whole; and (3) for the pur-\nposes of defraying regulatory costs, not simply for gen-\neral revenue-raising purposes.\u201d  Id. at 505-06 (quoting \nNeinast, 217 F.3d at 278).  We considered whether the \nTexas legislature\u2019s enactment of a \u201csexually oriented \nbusiness\u201d fee was a fee or a tax.  Id. at 502, 505-06.  \nWe noted that while the cost assessed to each \u201csexually \noriented business\u201d was imposed by the legislature, the \ntext made clear that the cost was imposed only on \u201csex-\nually oriented businesses\u201d to finance a program for the \nprevention of sexual assault in that industry.  Id. at \n506.  Ultimately, we concluded that a charge by a leg-\nislative body is a fee, and not a tax, where the charge is \nlevied against a specific industry sector, serves a regu-\nlatory purpose, and raises funds for a specific regulatory \nprogram.  Id. at 506-07. \nAll of the same factors are present here.  In \u00a7 254, \nCongress set out that a charge must be collected from \n\u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier that provides in-\nterstate telecommunications services.\u201d  47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(d) (emphasis added).  The contributions collected \nfrom telecommunications carriers are directed to a spe-\ncific fund and \u201cnot general revenue.\u201d  See Hegar, 10 \nF.4th at 506-07.  In fact, \u00a7 254(e) provides that these \nfunds are not universally distributed but paid only to el-\nigible telecommunications carriers that provide univer-\nsal service.  USF contributions are imposed upon a \nspecific industry\u2014telecommunications carriers\u2014and \nnot the general public.  See id.; see also TOPUC I, 183 \nF.3d at 427-28 (holding that all telecommunications  \ncarriers\u2014including those that are exempt from  \ncontributing\u2014are the beneficiaries of the program re-\n\n108a \n \nceiving the primary benefit in the form of the expansion \nof universal service).  The best support for this lies in \nthe plain language of \u00a7 254(b)(4), (d). \nBut one need not rely solely on Congress\u2019s word as \nexpressed in \u00a7 254.  A look at the USF contribution \nsystem in practice confirms who the true payors are.  \nThe class of entities that Congress orders to contribute \n\u2014those that are compelled by congressional act to actu-\nally pay this fee\u2014are the telecommunications providers \nthemselves.  A close review of the list of entities that \nmust contribute, reproduced on USAC\u2019s website, in-\ncludes landline providers, prepaid calling card provid-\ners, coaxial cable providers, telex companies, and other \ntypes of telecommunications service providers.5  Con-\nspicuously absent from \u00a7 254, this list, or from any ma-\nterial or orders of Congress or the FCC is any listing of \nthe American populace as contributors.  Thus, the ma-\njority errs in categorizing the class of contributors as \n\u201cAmerican telecommunications consumers who see USF \ncharges on their phone bills each month.\u201d  Maj. Op. at \n15.  Whether or not the telecommunications carriers \npass through that cost to consumers in the form of a line-\nitem on their bills is irrelevant to our analysis because \nwe are concerned with the constitutionality of Con-\ngress\u2019s action, not the action of independent third par-\nties that choose to pass costs along to their customers.  \nThis degree of separation between the governmental act \nand the consumers\u2019 payments should end the inquiry. \nBut if we continue, it becomes even clearer that there \nis complete overlap between the class of USF contribu-\n \n5  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d); Univ. Serv. Admin. Co., Who Must Con-\ntribute, https://www.usac.org/service-providers/contributing-to-the- \nusf/who-must-contribute/ (last visited May 24, 2024). \n\n109a \n \ntors are the payors and the beneficiaries.  The general \npublic then receives an ancillary benefit in the form of \nmore affordable, standardized service.  However, the \ntelecommunications carriers receive the primary benefit \nin the forms of both direct dispersals of USF money and \npositive network economic effects that result from  \nthe proliferation of universal service.  See 47 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 254(e); TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 427-28 & n.52; Rural \nCellular Ass\u2019n, 685 F.3d at 1091-92; see also Mark A. \nLemley & David McGowan, Legal Implications of Net-\nwork Economic Effects, 86 CALIF. L. REV. 479, 551 \n(1998).  As we said in TOPUC I, \u201cuniversal service con-\ntributions are part of a particular program supporting \nthe expansion of, and increased access to, the public in-\nstitutional telecommunications network.  . . .  Each \n[] carrier directly benefits from a larger and larger net-\nwork and, with that in mind, Congress designed the uni-\nversal service scheme to exact payments from those \ncompanies benefiting from the provision of universal \nservice.\u201d  183 F.3d at 427-28 (emphasis added). \nIn Rural Cellular, the D.C. Circuit reached the exact \nsame conclusion regarding enhanced access to broad-\nband services.  685 F.3d at 1091-92.  It held that as \ntelecommunications providers advance universal service \n\u201cthey will benefit from the increased utility of the [basic] \nInternet [and cell services] that come[] with a greater \nnumber of users having enhanced access to\u201d those ser-\nvices.  Id. at 1090-91.  It concluded that the FCC \u201ccol-\nlected these [universal service] contributions to support \nthe expansion of universal service and no other use was \never contemplated.\u201d  Id. at 1091. \nThe majority makes much ado of the benefit that the \ngeneral public and the rural area consumers, schools, \n\n110a \n \nhospitals, and public libraries receive from USF pro-\ngrams.  Maj. Op. at 15 (\u201cThere is no overlap at all be-\ntween the class of USF beneficiaries (recipients of sub-\nsidized telecommunications services) and the class of \nUSF contributors.\u201d).  But, the majority mistakes the \nrecipients of an ancillary benefit derived from the exac-\ntion of a fee with the payor that primarily benefits from \nthe fees exacted for the purposes of funding regulatory \nefforts.  Curiously, the majority cites Trafigura Trad-\ning LLC v. United States, for the proposition that a com-\nmon fee arises \u201cin the context of \u2018value-for-value trans-\naction[s].\u2019\u200a\u201d  29 F.4th 286, 289 (5th Cir. 2022) (quoting \nErik M. Jensen, The Export Clause, 6 FLA. TAX REV. 1, \n8 (2003)). \nIts reliance on Trafigura is misplaced. The majority \nomits that we reviewed that case under the Export \nClause of the Constitution, which requires \u201capply[ing] \n\u2018heightened scrutiny\u2019  . . .  [to] strictly enforce the \nExport\u2019s Clause ban on taxes by \u2018guard[ing] against  \n. . .  the imposition of a [tax] under the pretext of fix-\ning a fee.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 282 (citation omitted).  Looking at \nthe precedent set forth by this court and our sister cir-\ncuits, it should be apparent that USF contributions are \nfees.  TOPUC I, 183 F.3d at 427-28 & n.52; Rural Cel-\nlular, 685 F.3d at 1091-92.  Nonetheless, some remain \nunmoved to apply our established precedent and ven-\nture into crafting new formulations to analyze whether \na certain charge is a fee or not.  Once again, noting our \nrole not to directly contravene Supreme Court jurispru-\ndence, I would hold that \u00a7 254 does not implicate the tax-\ning power. \n \n\n111a \n \nb. At Every Level of Scrutiny, USF Contributions \nare Fees \nThe majority\u2019s framing of the fee inquiry miscon-\nstrues language from the Court\u2019s decision in National \nCable and numerous persuasive authorities to reach its \nresult.  It describes fees as costs:  (1) \u201cincurred \u2018inci-\ndent to a voluntary act\u2019\u200a\u201d; (2) \u201cimposed by an administra-\ntive agency upon only those persons, or entities, subject \nto its regulation for regulatory purposes\u201d; and (3) reve-\nnues the government raises to supply a benefit that in-\nures to the persons or entities paying them rather than \nto the public generally.  See Maj. Op. at 14. \nUSF contributions have nearly all of these character-\nistics.  First, they are incurred by telecommunications \ncarriers incident to the voluntary act of doing business.  \nIn National Cable, the Court categorized charges in-\ncurred as a result of a request to obtain a state license \nto practice law or medicine, or to run a broadcast sta-\ntion, as fees because they were incident to \u201ca voluntary \nact.\u201d  See 415 U.S. at 340-41.  Thus, telecommunica-\ntions providers\u2019 willing choice to engage in the industry, \nlike the cost paid for professional licensure, fits within \nthe Court\u2019s formulation of costs incurred incident to a \nvoluntary act.  Second, USF contributions are imposed \nby the legislature on telecommunications providers, and \nnot society at large for the purposes of maintaining a \nsystem of universal service that they benefit from.  See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d), (e) (imposing the contribution on tel-\necommunications carriers for the benefit of qualified tel-\necommunications carriers).  In this case, the majority \ncan point to nowhere in \u00a7 254 or the Code of Federal \nRegulations where Congress, the FCC, or even USAC \norder or direct telecommunications providers to pass \n\n112a \n \nalong the cost to their customers.  At most, the major-\nity points to a regulation enacted by the FCC that \nmerely notes that is not unlawful for carriers to pass on \nthe costs to consumers.  Maj. Op. at 15 (citing 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.712(a)).  That simply is not sufficient for \nour constitutional analysis that examines Congress\u2019s ac-\ntion and scrutinizes what it has set out in delegating au-\nthority.  Cf. J.W. Hampton, 276 U.S. at 406 (analyzing \nwhat Congress \u201cmay do in seeking assistance from an-\nother branch\u201d through the delegation of authority). \nThe majority cites Valero Terrestrial Corp. v. Caf-\nfrey, 205 F.3d 130, 134 (4th Cir. 2000), for the proposi-\ntion that the fact that carriers pass along the cost of con-\ntributions to consumers makes it \u201creminiscent of a \u2018clas-\nsic tax\u2019\u200a\u201d with obligations shared by the population at \nlarge.  Maj. Op. at 15.  As mentioned above, this de-\ntermination relies on the baked-in assumption that Con-\ngress or the FCC has imposed the cost on consumers. \nAgain, this simply is not supported by the plain lan-\nguage of the statute.  Section 254(d) specifically pro-\nvides that \u201c[e]very telecommunications carrier that \nprovides interstate telecommunications services\u201d must \nmake contributions.  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d).  Costs in-\ncurred by entities and passed down to consumers \nthrough the entities\u2019 independent business judgment \nare not taxes.6 \n \n6  See, e.g., Edye v. Robertson, 112 U.S. 580, 595 (1884) (holding \nthat a per-head charge imposed on ship owners that brought immi-\ngrants to American was a processing fee or mitigation charge, and \nnot a tax); Hugh D. Spitzer, Taxes vs. Fees:  A Curious Confu-\nsion, 38 GONZ. L. REV. 335, 337-50, 364-65 (2002) (detailing differ-\nences between taxes and different types of user charges, commod-\nities charges, and the like). \n\n113a \n \nIn my view, a strained interpretation of our applica-\nble law and liberties taken to broadly expand the defini-\ntion of a tax using distinguishable authorities should not \nstand.  But regardless of the outcome of this analysis, \nthe Court has made clear that whether a revenue-raising \ndelegation implicates the taxing power is irrelevant to a \nnondelegation doctrine challenge.  See Skinner, 490 \nU.S. at 223.  I remain unpersuaded that we should cre-\nate a sharp split with our precedent concluding that \nUSF contributions are fees, along with our sisters cir-\ncuits\u2019 same conclusions.  Nor do I support our depar-\nture from the sound reasoning of the Court that any dis-\ntinction of a charge as a fee or tax is of little relevance \nas it pertains to the nondelegation doctrine analysis. \nIV.  CONCLUSION \nIn sum, \u00a7 254 represents Congress\u2019s effort to \u201cob-\ntain[] the assistance of its coordinate Branches\u201d7 in an \nextensive and vastly changing subject matter area.  In \nso doing, Congress has provided the FCC with an intel-\nligible principle that sufficiently delimits the FCC\u2019s dis-\ncretion based on the established universal service prin-\nciples.  Petitioners\u2019 argument that this revenue-raising \ndelegation is subject to a higher standard of scrutiny has \nbeen consistently rejected by the Supreme Court.  Be-\ncause I am not persuaded that we should deviate from \nSupreme Court precedent, deviate from our precedent, \nand create a split with the Sixth, Eleventh, and D.C. Cir-\ncuits by departing from the solid reasoning offered in \ntheir denials of those nondelegation doctrine challenges, \nI would affirm our original holding that \u00a7 254 satisfies \nthe intelligible principle test and that no constitutional \n \n7  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372. \n\n114a \n \nviolation arises from the FCC\u2019s subdelegation of minis-\nterial tasks to USAC. \n \n\n115a \n \nSTEPHEN A. HIGGINSON, Circuit Judge, joined by \nSTEWART, SOUTHWICK, GRAVES, and DOUGLAS, Circuit \nJudges, dissenting: \nThe majority finds neither an unconstitutional dele-\ngation of legislative power nor an unconstitutional exer-\ncise of government power by a private entity.  Su-\npreme Court precedent dictates these answers, which is \nwhy every other circuit to consider these questions \nstopped there and the Supreme Court denied petitions \nfor review of those decisions.  Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. \nFCC, No. 23-456, 2024 WL 2883753 (U.S. June 10, 2024) \n(Mem.); Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. FCC, No. 23-743, 2024 WL \n2883755 (U.S. June 10, 2024) (Mem.). \nBut our court does not stop there, going beyond even \npetitioners\u2019 arguments to adopt a novel theory that it is \n\u201cthe combination\u201d of these two non-violations that \u201cvio-\nlates the Legislative Vesting Clause in Article I, \u00a7 1.\u201d  \nMaj. Op. at 55.  That is, according to the majority, \nwhen Congress provides an intelligible principle to \nchannel agency discretion (constitutional) and a private \nentity performs calculations under the agency\u2019s super-\nvision (also constitutional), it becomes\u2014pursuant to an \nundefined, unannounced, and unprecedented test\u2014 \nunconstitutional.  Make no mistake, there is nothing \nnarrow about this ruling.  This decision invites lower \ncourts to leapfrog the Supreme Court; creates a split \nwith all other circuits to have considered the issue; ig-\nnores statutory criteria and regulations; and upends the \npolitical branches\u2019 decades-long engagement with each \nother, industry, and consumers to address the technol-\nogy divide. \n \n \n\n116a \n \nI. \nThe majority argues that the \u201ccombination\u201d theory \non which its holding rests is nothing new.  But the Su-\npreme Court has considered cases that, like this one, in-\nvolved challenges on the grounds that there was both an \nunconstitutional delegation of legislative power and an \nunconstitutional delegation of government power to a \nprivate entity, yet the Court never instructed, as the ma-\njority does now, that a different standard applies.  See, \ne.g., Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 311 (1936); \nCurrin v. Wallace, 306 U.S. 1, 15-16 (1939); Sunshine \nAnthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 399 (1940). \nIn Sunshine Anthracite, for example, challengers ar-\ngued that there was both an impermissible delegation of \nlegislative power to an executive commission and an im-\npermissible delegation of government power to a private \nentity because that commission relied on private actors. \n310 U.S. at 397-99.  The Supreme Court rejected the \nlegislative delegation challenge after concluding that \u201cin \nthe hands of experts the criteria which Congress ha[d] \nsupplied [we]re wholly adequate for carrying out the \ngeneral policy and purpose of the Act.\u201d  Id. at 398.  It \nthen rejected the private delegation challenge after con-\ncluding that the private actors \u201cfunction subordinately \nto the Commission,\u201d which had \u201cauthority and surveil-\nlance\u201d over them.  Id. at 399.  It ended its analysis of \nboth delegation challenges there.  If the majority were \ncorrect that a different standard applies, the Supreme \nCourt would have instead asked whether, despite consti-\ntuting neither a delegation of legislative power nor a del-\negation of government power to a private entity, there \nwas still a constitutional problem.  It did not.  The \nmajority attempts to distinguish on the ground that the \n\n117a \n \nSupreme Court \u201cfound the Government had not dele-\ngated any legislative power to any private entity\u201d and \n\u201c[t]here cannot be a combined public/private delegation \nwithout a private delegation.\u201d  Maj. Op. at 68.  But \nthat is no answer.  Indeed, it directly undermines the \nmajority\u2019s conclusion because the majority also does not \nfind a private delegation.  Id. at 17 (explaining the \ncourt \u201cneed not definitively answer either delegation \nquestion\u201d). \nThe majority points to presidential removal authority \nprecedent but ignores how the Supreme Court itself has \ncharacterized that precedent.  In Seila Law LLC v. \nCFPB, a decade after Free Enterprise Fund, it ex-\nplained that there were only two exceptions to the pres-\nident\u2019s otherwise \u201cunrestricted removal power.\u201d 591 \nU.S. 197, 204 (2020).  The CFPB\u2019s structure fit into nei-\nther exception.  Id.  The Court declined to create a \nnew one and, unlike the majority here, applied prece-\ndent.  Id.  It was not, as the majority recasts it, a sit-\nuation in which \u201c[t]wo lines of precedent seemed to con-\nverge to suggest the removal restriction at issue posed \nno constitutional problem\u201d but \u201cthe combination\u201d of fea-\ntures was unconstitutional.  Maj. Op. at 56.1  And, as \ndiscussed above, the Supreme Court has considered this \ncombination of features and, applying the legislative \ndelegation and private delegation tests the majority dis-\nregards, has found no constitutional defect. \n \n1  In doing so, the majority quotes Justice Thomas\u2019s separate \nwriting in which he disagreed with seven Justices that severing the \nremoval provision cured the CFPB\u2019s constitutional defect.  But \nthat analysis, joined by only one other Justice, about when sever-\nance is a proper remedy has little purchase here in determining \nwhether there has been a constitutional violation in the first place. \n\n118a \n \nEven if the majority were correct that the presiden-\ntial removal authority cases now suggest that a different \nstandard could apply in this case, the Supreme Court \nhas been clear that, where its precedent \u201chas direct ap-\nplication in a case,\u201d \u201cthe Court of Appeals should follow \nthe case which directly controls, leaving to [it] the pre-\nrogative of overruling its own decisions.\u201d  Agostini v. \nFelton, 521 U.S. 203, 237 (1997) (quoting Rodriguez de \nQuijas v. Shearson/Am. Exp., Inc., 490 U.S. 477, 484 \n(1989)); see also Consumers\u2019 Rsch. v. Consumer Prod. \nSafety Comm\u2019n, 91 F.4th 342, 352 (5th Cir. 2024) (\u201c[O]ur \nrole in the judicial architecture requires us only to map \n\u2014not adjust\u2014the borders\u201d of Supreme Court prece-\ndent).  The majority ignores this repeated instruction. \nII. \nThe majority cannot prevail under legislative delega-\ntion or private delegation precedent, and so it concocts \na theory to rewrite both.  In doing so, it offers no test \nfor determining when something that is neither an un-\nconstitutional delegation of legislative power from Con-\ngress to an agency nor an unconstitutional delegation of \ngovernment power to a private entity becomes unconsti-\ntutional, leaving the political branches powerless to gov-\nern. \nOn the issue of legislative delegation, the majority \nacknowledges that \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s nondelegation \n\u2018jurisprudence has been driven by a practical under-\nstanding that in our increasingly complex society, re-\nplete with ever changing and more technical problems, \nCongress simply cannot do its job absent an ability to \ndelegate power under broad general directives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Maj. \nOp. at 29 (quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. \n361, 372 (1989) (added emphasis omitted)).  It then as-\n\n119a \n \nserts, without explanation, that \u201cCongress did not dele-\ngate because FCC has some superior technical know-\nledge about the optimal amount of universal service \nfunding\u201d as \u201c[n]o such knowledge exists because deter-\nmining the ideal size of a welfare program involves pol-\nicy judgments, not technical ones.\u201d  Id. at 30. \nBut Congress designed a vital, nationwide program \nin an area\u2014telecommunications\u2014where the only con-\nstant has been rapid change in both technology and mar-\nkets.  This is exactly the type of \u201cever changing\u201d and \n\u201ctechnical problem[]\u201d that the Supreme Court has held \nCongress can address with \u201cbroad general directives\u201d to \nexpert agencies.  Mistretta, 488 U.S. at 372.  Congress \nchose not to freeze in place precise rates for different \ntypes of customers in different regions nor to impose \nservice technology standards that would almost imme-\ndiately become obsolete.  Instead, Congress made pol-\nicy decisions about how those precise answers should be \nreached, and regularly revisited, by the expert agency it \nhad created.  To determine which services to fund, \nFCC is required to account for which services \u201care es-\nsential to education, public health, or public safety\u201d; \n\u201csubscribed to by a substantial majority of residential \ncustomers\u201d; \u201cbeing deployed in public telecommunica-\ntions networks by telecommunications carriers\u201d; and \n\u201cconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity.\u201d  47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1).  Congress provided \nadditional principles to guide FCC.  For example, Con-\ngress made the policy decision that rural Americans \nshould not be abandoned on the wrong side of the tech-\nnology divide.  Without the ability to predict what \ntypes of services urban Americans would have access to \nand what rates they would pay, Congress decided to re-\nquire FCC to ensure that rural Americans have \u201caccess \n\n120a \n \nto telecommunications and information services\u201d \u201crea-\nsonably comparable to those services provided in urban \nareas and that are available at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in ur-\nban areas.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 254(b)(3).  The majority offers Con-\ngress no guidance on how it should address this rapidly \nevolving area, or any number of others, differently. \nThe majority is mistaken to suggest that these are \nissues that have been withdrawn from congressional \nscrutiny\u2014and attendant public debate\u2014because Con-\ngress has enlisted FCC\u2019s expertise to address them.  \nThere have been congressional hearings, reports, pro-\nposed bills, and engagement with FCC over every as-\npect of the Universal Service Fund (USF), ranging from \nrevising the High Cost Program\u2019s performance goals to \nexpanding the list of eligible entities for the Rural \nHealth Care Program to broadening the contribution \nbase for the USF.  PATRICIA FIGLIOLA, CONG. RSCH. \nSERV., R47621, THE FUTURE OF THE UNIVERSAL SER-\nVICE FUND AND RELATED BROADBAND PROGRAMS 12-\n16 (2024) (\u201cFUTURE OF THE UNIVERSAL SERVICE \nFUND\u201d).  The USF remains subject to extensive con-\ngressional efforts to weigh competing policy priorities \nand interests, balancing concerns of different consum-\ners and industries. \nOn private delegation, too, the majority ignores both \nprecedent and facts.  The Universal Service Adminis-\ntrative Company (USAC), constrained by comprehen-\nsive regulations, \u201cbill[s] contributors, collect[s] contri-\nbutions to the universal service support mechanisms, \nand disburs[es] universal service support funds.\u201d  47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b).  In performing these administra-\ntive functions, USAC \u201cmay not make policy, interpret \n\n121a \n \nunclear provisions of the statute or rules, or interpret \nthe intent of Congress.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 54.702(c). \nYet, the majority asserts that FCC has \u201cde facto if \nnot de jure\u201d abdicated government power to USAC be-\ncause FCC has rarely rejected the contribution factor \nthat USAC calculates based on collected inputs.  Maj. \nOp. at 7.  But the relevant question is what the major-\nity discounts as only the \u201cde jure\u201d one:  Whether FCC \nhas the \u201cauthority\u201d to do so.  Sunshine Anthracite, 310 \nU.S. at 399.  And even the majority acknowledges that \nFCC does have that authority.  See Maj. Op. at 6 \n(\u201cTrue, FCC \u2018reserves the right to set projections of de-\nmand and administrative expenses at amounts that [it] \ndetermines will serve the public interest.\u2019  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).\u201d).  Certainly, any number of pri-\nvate entities that perform administrative roles at gov-\nernment direction and under government control would \nfail this rewritten test.  See, e.g., What\u2019s a MAC, CTR. \nFOR MEDICARE & MEDICAID SERVS., https://www.cms. \ngov/medicare/coding-billing/medicare-administrative-\ncontractors-macs/whats-mac (last modified Mar. 13, \n2024) \n(describing \nhow \nMedicare \nAdministrative  \nContractors\u2014private insurers\u2014process claims, make \nand account for Medicare payouts, and establish local \ncoverage determinations). \nFurthermore, as Judge Stewart explains, it is hardly \nsurprising that FCC should approve USAC\u2019s calculation \nof the contribution factor when it is entirely the product \nof inputs that FCC regulates at every turn, from the de-\ntailed worksheets that FCC requires telecommunica-\ntions companies submit to calculate projected revenue \nto the caps that FCC imposes on projected expenses.  \nIf anything, it is evidence of the efficacy of FCC\u2019s \u201cper-\n\n122a \n \nvasive surveillance and authority\u201d exercised over USAC.  \nSunshine Anthracite, 310 U.S. at 388.  That authority \nis maintained through processes that allow parties disa-\ngreeing with USAC\u2019s math to seek further FCC review, \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.719(b), and audits to ensure \u201cproper[] ad-\nministrat[ion] [of] the universal service support mecha-\nnisms to prevent fraud, waste, and abuse,\u201d id. \u00a7 54.717.  \nThat those audits reveal errors and waste is concerning \nbut this has never been enough to declare a coequal po-\nlitical branch\u2019s act unconstitutional.  Nor does it con-\nvert USAC\u2019s accounting role into a constitutional viola-\ntion.2 \nAdditionally, the majority overlooks the fact that the \nincreasing contribution factor is not caused by the scope \nof USAC\u2019s authority but is instead driven \u201cin large part \n[by] a decline in the contributions revenue base, i.e., pro-\nviders are reporting a declining share of telecommuni-\ncations revenues and an increasing share of non-tele-\ncommunications revenues.\u201d  FUTURE OF THE UNIVER-\nSAL SERVICE FUND at 9.  Crucially, Congress has re-\nsponded with a number of legislative proposals, from \nmembers of both parties, to potentially expand the rev-\nenue base by including broadband providers and online \ncontent and services providers.  Id. at 9-10 (citing Sen-\nator Markwayne Mullin\u2019s Lowering Broadband Costs \n \n2  The majority separately argues that Congress was required to \nexpressly authorize USAC\u2019s role under founding-era agency law \nprinciples.  But, even granting that this were historically accurate \nand the relevant question, the majority acknowledges that there \nwas an \u201cassum[ption] that ministerial tasks could be subdelegated,\u201d \nand so this argument fails because, as discussed above, USAC per-\nforms only ministerial tasks.  Maj. Op. at 49 (citing GARY LAWSON \n& GUY SEIDMAN, \u201cA GREAT POWER OF ATTORNEY\u201d:  UNDERSTAND-\nING THE FIDUCIARY CONSTITUTION 115 (2017)). \n\n123a \n \nfor Consumers Act, Senator Roger Wicker\u2019s FAIR Con-\ntributions Act, and the Reforming Broadband Connec-\ntivity Act proposed by Senator Amy Klobuchar and Rep-\nresentative Joe Neguse).  Put differently, the body \nconstitutionally tasked with addressing the policy prob-\nlem the majority identifies is doing just that. \nAs our unanimous panel and every other court to \nhave considered these issues held, each challenge fails \nunder binding Supreme Court legislative delegation and \nprivate delegation precedent.  Yet the majority, in un-\ndermining both lines of precedent, offers no test for de-\ntermining at what point something that is neither an un-\nconstitutional delegation of legislative power nor an un-\nconstitutional delegation of government power to a pri-\nvate entity still becomes, convergingly, unconstitutional. \nCongress, the Executive, and courts in our circuit are \nleft only with the implication that the bar for what is an \nintelligible principle is raised\u2014by how much is unclear \n\u2014when an agency enlists a private entity to perform ac-\ncounting tasks.  Conversely, tasks performed by pri-\nvate entities that have long been considered ministerial \nwill be elevated\u2014at what point, again, is unclear\u2014to ex-\nercises of government power when Congress legislates \nwith otherwise permissibly intelligible principles that \nlimit agency discretion. \nThis convergence sleight of hand not only undoes Su-\npreme Court precedent but also leaves the political \nbranches powerless to address this perceived constitu-\ntional deficiency, ignorant as to how to legislate and reg-\nulate in ways that will survive judicial review.  Here, \nArticle III nullifies a program that has served millions \nof Americans for over a quarter of a century, which Con-\ngress, FCC experts, industry, and consumers revisit \n\n124a \n \nyearly in the face of changing technology and markets.  \nOur court should not constitutionalize policy disagree-\nments nor, worse still, do so with an amorphous stand-\nard, not urged by petitioners and contrary to precedent, \nthat leaves the coequal, political branches without sta-\nbility or clarity.  In announcing its new constitutional \ntheory, our court creates a greater threat to the separa-\ntion of powers than the one it purports to address. \n* * * \nFor these reasons, and those stated by Judge Stew-\nart, I respectfully dissent. \n \n\n125a \n \nAPPENDIX B \n \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS \nFOR THE FIFTH CIRCUIT \n \nNo. 22-60008 \nCONSUMERS\u2019 RESEARCH; CAUSE BASED COMMERCE, \nINCORPORATED; KERSTEN CONWAY; SUZANNE BETTAC; \nROBERT KULL; KWANG JA KERBY; TOM KIRBY; JOSEPH \nBAYLY; JEREMY ROTH; DEANNA ROTH; LYNN GIBBS; \nPAUL GIBBS; RHONDA THOMAS, PETITIONERS \nv. \nFEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION;  \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA, RESPONDENTS \n \nFiled:  Mar. 24, 2023 \n \nOn Petition for Review of an Order of the  \nFederal Communications Commission \nAgency No. 96-45 \n \nBefore RICHMAN, Chief Judge, and STEWART and \nHAYNES, Circuit Judges. \nCARL E. STEWART, Circuit Judge: \nConsumers\u2019 Research, along with other entities, (col-\nlectively \u201cPetitioners\u201d) challenge:  (1) the constitution-\nality of Congress\u2019s delegation of administration of the \nUniversal Service Fund (the \u201cUSF\u201d) to the Federal Com-\nmunications Commission (the \u201cFCC\u201d); and (2) the FCC\u2019s \nsubsequent reliance on a private entity for ministerial \n\n126a \n \nsupport.  Because there are no nondelegation doctrine \nviolations, we DENY their petition. \nI.  BACKGROUND \nCongress enacted \u00a7 254 of the Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, which established the USF and entrusted \nits administration to the FCC.  Congress passed \u00a7 254 \nto ensure the facilitation of broad access to telecommu-\nnications services across the country.  The USF ac-\ncomplishes this goal by raising funds which are later dis-\ntributed to people, entities, and projects to expand and \nadvance telecommunications services in the nation.  \nFunds are raised by periodic contributions to the USF \nfrom telecommunications carriers, who later pass those \ncosts on to consumers via line-item charges in their \nmonthly bills. \nThe FCC relies on a private entity, the Universal \nService Administrative Company (\u201cUSAC\u201d), to aid it in \nits administration of the USF.  USAC is comprised of \nindustry experts and the FCC tasks it with certain min-\nisterial responsibilities, including:  (1) collecting self-\nreported income information from telecommunications \ncarriers; (2) compiling data to formulate the potential \ncontribution rate for the USF; and (3) proposing a quar-\nterly budget to the FCC for the USF\u2019s continued preser-\nvation.  USAC proposals are approved by the FCC ei-\nther expressly or after fourteen days of agency inaction. \nUSAC submitted its 2022 first quarter projections to \nthe FCC on November 2, 2021.  The FCC published \nthese projections for notice-and-comment in accordance \nwith the Administrative Procedure Act.  On November \n19, 2021, Petitioners submitted comments challenging \nthe constitutionality of the USF and the FCC\u2019s reliance \non USAC.  The FCC weighed the comments and issued \n\n127a \n \na Public Notice of Proposed First Quarter 2022 Univer-\nsal Service Contribution Factor (\u201cthe Proposal\u201d).  Pe-\ntitioners filed another comment, invoking the same ar-\nguments as their November comment and seeking the \ndiscontinuance of the USF.  The FCC, nonetheless, ap-\nproved USAC\u2019s proposal on December 27, 2021.  In re-\nsponse, Petitioners filed this petition on January 5, 2022. \nOn appeal, Petitioners assert that:  (1) the Hobbs \nAct is not a jurisdictional bar to their constitutional \nclaims; (2) Section 254 violates the nondelegation doc-\ntrine because Congress failed to supply the FCC with an \nintelligible principle; and (3) the FCC\u2019s relationship with \nUSAC violates the private nondelegation doctrine be-\ncause the FCC does not adequately subordinate USAC \nin its administration of the USF. \nII.  STANDARD OF REVIEW \nThis court reviews constitutional issues stemming \nfrom an agency\u2019s action de novo.  See Huwaei Tech \nUSA, Inc. v. FCC, 2 F.4th 421, 434 (5th Cir. 2021).  We \n\u201chold unlawful and set aside\u201d any agency action that is \n\u201ccontrary to constitutional right, power, privilege, or im-\nmunity.\u201d  Id. (citing 5 U.S.C. \u00a7 706(2)(B)). \nIII.  DISCUSSION \nA.  Jurisdiction \nThe Hobbs Act \u201cprovides that a party aggrieved by a \nrule, regulation, or final order  . . .  must file a peti-\ntion for judicial review within sixty days.\u201d  State of Tex. \nv. United States, 749 F.2d 1144, 1146 (5th Cir. 1985).  \nThis sixty-day period \u201cis jurisdictional and cannot be ju-\ndicially altered or expanded.\u201d  City of Arlington v. \nFCC, 668 F.3d 229, 237 (5th Cir. 2012).  However, \nplaintiffs may \u201cchallenge  . . .  a regulation after the \n\n128a \n \nlimitations period has expired if the claim is that the \nagency has exceeded its constitutional authority or stat-\nutory authority.\u201d  State v. Rettig, 987 F.3d 518, 529 (5th \nCir. 2021).  \u201cTo sustain such a challenge, the claimant \nmust show some direct, final agency action involving the \nparticular plaintiff within [sixty days] of filing suit.\u201d  \nId. (quoting Dunn-McCampbell Royalty Int., Inc. v. \nNat\u2019l Park Serv., 112 F.3d 1283, 1287 (5th Cir. 1997)).  \nAn agency\u2019s action is direct and final when two criteria \nare satisfied:  First, the action must mark the \u201ccon-\nsummation of the agency\u2019s decisionmaking process  \n. . .  [and] second, the action must be one by which \nrights or obligations have been determined, or from \nwhich legal consequences will flow.\u201d  Dunn-McCampbell, \n112 F.3d at 1287 (internal quotation and citation omit-\nted). \nThe FCC contends that Petitioners\u2019 claims are time-\nbarred by the Hobbs Act because:  (1) any challenge to \n\u00a7 254 should have come when Congress originally en-\nacted it and (2) the Proposal is not a direct and final \nagency action which creates legal consequences or new \nobligations for Petitioners.  The FCC relies on Dunn-\nMcCampbell, where we foreclosed a facial challenge to \na National Park Service regulation because \u201cthe limita-\ntions period beg[an] to run when the agency publishe[d] \nthe regulation in the Federal Register.\u201d  Id.  But we \nalso carved out a limited exception in that case when we \nrecognized that \u201can agency\u2019s application of a rule to a \nparty creates a new  . . .  cause of action to the \nagency\u2019s constitutional or statutory authority.\u201d  Id.  \nPetitioners assert that they qualify for this exception.  \nWhether they are correct depends on our determination \nthat the Proposal:  (1) constitutes application of a direct \nand final rule by the FCC; and (2) determines Petition-\n\n129a \n \ners\u2019 rights or has legal consequences for non-compliance.  \nWe hold in Petitioners\u2019 favor on both prongs.   \nHere, the Proposal qualifies for the Dunn-McCamp-\nbell exception because it (1) is a direct and final order \nwhich consummates the FCC\u2019s decisionmaking process; \nand (2) punishes telecommunications carriers for non-\ncompliance.  See 112 F.3d at 1287.  Regarding prong \none, the Proposal is distinguishable from the regulation \nin Dunn-McCampbell.  In that case, we held that \nDunn-McCampbell\u2019s facial challenge was time barred \nbecause the \u201cPark Service ha[d] not yet applied the reg-\nulations to the companies.\u201d  Id. at 1288-89.  So, any \nchallenge he brought before the Park Service ever ap-\nplied the regulation was necessarily a challenge to the \nregulation itself.  The reverse is true in the instant \ncase, where the FCC has applied and reapplied \u00a7 254\u2019s \nmandatory USF Contributions through its approval of \nthe quarterly proposals.  Each approval consummates \nthe FCC\u2019s decisionmaking process for that quarter and, \nthus, allows for a constitutional challenge if that chal-\nlenge is brought within the sixty-day time limit. \nProng two is also satisfied because the Proposal un-\ndoubtedly has legal consequences which flow to carriers \nthat fail to meet their contribution obligations.  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.713(b) (providing that \u201cdelinquent\u201d USF \ncontributors are subject to \u201cinterest at the rate equal to \nthe U.S. prime rate  . . .  plus 3.5 percent, as well as \nadministrative charges of collection and/or penalties and \ncharges permitted by the applicable law\u201d).  Because \nPetitioners satisfy both Dunn-McCampbell prongs, the \nHobbs Act does not bar their constitutional claims and \nwe proceed to the merits of their nondelegation argu-\nments.  112 F.3d at 1287; Rettig, 987 F.3d at 529. \n\n130a \n \nB.  Nondelegation \nArticle I of the United States Constitution provides \nthat \u201c[a]ll legislative Powers herein granted shall be \nvested in a Congress of the United States.\u201d  \u201cAccompa-\nnying that assignment of power  . . .  is a bar on its \nfurther delegation.\u201d  Gundy v. United States, 139  \nS. Ct. 2116, 2123 (2019) (internal quotations and citation \nomitted).  However, the Constitution does not deny \nCongress the necessary \u201cflexibility and practicality\u201d to \nperform its functions.  Id.  The Supreme Court has, \ntherefore, recognized that \u201cCongress may obtain the as-\nsistance of its coordinate Branches  . . .  and in par-\nticular, may confer substantial discretion on executive \nagencies to implement and enforce the laws.\u201d  Id.  \n(quoting Mistretta v. United States, 488 U.S. 361, 372 \n(1989)). \nTo that end, the Constitution only requires Congress \nto provide an intelligible principle which adequately \nguides the Executive agency.  See id. (holding \u201cthat a \nstatutory delegation is constitutional as long as Con-\ngress lays down by legislative act an intelligible princi-\nple to which the person or body authorized to exercise \nthe delegated authority is directed to conform\u201d) (inter-\nnal quotations and citation omitted). \nThe intelligible principle standard is \u201cnot demand-\ning.\u201d  Id. at 2129.  The Supreme Court has rarely \n\u201csecond-guess[ed] Congress regarding the permissible \ndegree of policy judgment that can be left to those exe-\ncuting or applying the law.\u201d  Id.  Ultimately, \u201ca non-\ndelegation inquiry always begins (and often almost \nends) with statutory interpretation.  The constitutional \nquestion is whether Congress has supplied an intelligi-\nble principle to guide the delegee\u2019s use of discretion.\u201d  \n\n131a \n \nId.  Put differently, we must construe \u00a7 254 to discern \nwhat tasks it delegates and what instructions Congress \nprovided therein.  \u201cOnly after [we have] determined  \n[\u00a7 254\u2019s] meaning can [we] decide whether the law suffi-\nciently guides executive discretion to accord with Article \nI.\u201d  Id \nWe recently grappled with the intelligible principle \nstandard in Jarkesy v. SEC, 34 F.4th 446 (5th Cir. 2022).1  \nIn that case, we held that Congress failed to provide an \nintelligible principle when it gave \u201cthe SEC the ability \nto determine which subjects of its enforcement actions \nare entitled to Article III proceedings with a jury trial, \nand which are not.\u201d  Id. at 461.  We acknowledged that \nthe Supreme Court \u201chas not in the past several decades \nheld that Congress failed to provide a requisite intelligi-\nble principle.\u201d  Id. at 462.  But we also noted that the \nCourt had not been presented an instance where \u201cCon-\ngress offered no guidance whatsoever\u201d to an executive \nagency in that same span of time.  Id.  (emphasis in orig-\ninal).  Accordingly, we reasoned that \u201c[i]f the intelligi-\nble principle standard means anything, it must mean \nthat a total absence of guidance is impermissible under \nthe Constitution.\u201d  Id. \nIn Jarkesy, we stated that the nondelegation doc-\ntrine applies where Congress has provided \u201cno guid-\nance whatsoever\u201d to an agency, Id. at 462 (emphasis in \noriginal), citing to the most recent (though long ago)  \nSupreme Court nondelegation violation decision.  See \n \n1  We have since denied petition to rehear this case before the en \nbanc court.  See Jarkesy v. SEC, 51 F.4th 644.  On March 8, 2023, \nthe Government filed a petition for a writ of certiorari with the Su-\npreme Court.  Jarkesy\u2019s response to that petition is due April 10, \n2023. \n\n132a \n \nPanama Refining Co. v. Ryan, 293 U.S. 388, 405 (1935) \n(holding that there was a nondelegation violation when \nCongress gave the President broad authority to prohibit \nthe transportation of oil-related products in interstate \ncommerce, but failed to provide any policy, establish any \nstandard, or lay down any rules to direct the President\u2019s \nexercise of this authority). \nHaving fleshed out what the intelligible principle \nstandard requires, we now examine Petitioners\u2019 asser-\ntions that \u00a7 254 violates the nondelegation doctrine be-\ncause:  (1) Congress failed to provide the FCC with an \nintelligible principle; and (2) to the extent Congress pro-\nvided intelligible principles, they are merely aspira-\ntional and place no objective limits on the FCC in its ad-\nministration of the USF. \n1.  Whether Congress Provided Intelligible  \nPrinciples in \u00a7 254 \nPetitioners argue that Congress has unconstitution-\nally delegated its authority to the FCC without provid-\ning an intelligible principle.  For example, they point to \nthe absence of a limit on how much the FCC can raise \nfor the USF as evidence of a lack of proper guidance.  \nWith no objective ceiling on the amount that the FCC \ncan raise each quarter, they contend that Congress\u2019s al-\nleged intelligible principles fail to place necessary limits \non the FCC\u2019s ability to assess fees from telecommunica-\ntions carriers.  Also, Petitioners aver that \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7) \ncontains mere public policy statements which impose no \nmeaningful limitations on or guidance to the FCC\u2019s  \nrevenue-raising obligation in its administration of the \nUSF.  In sum, Petitioners maintain that Congress has \nnot articulated any guidance to the FCC in its admin-\n\n133a \n \nistration of the USF\u2014and that this failure violates the \nnondelegation doctrine.  We disagree. \nCongress passed \u00a7 254 for the express purpose of \npreserving and advancing universal telecommunications \nservices.2  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b).  To that end, \u00a7 254(b) \nprovides that the FCC \u201cshall base policies\u201d on certain \nenumerated principles.3  Petitioners maintain that these \nprinciples offer no guidance to the FCC as it attempts \nto realize \u00a7 254(b)\u2019s purpose.  Their position is untena-\nble.  Section 254 expressly requires the FCC to ensure \nthat telecommunications services are:  (1) of decent \nquality and reasonably priced; (2) equally available in \nrural and urban areas; (3) supported by state and fed-\neral mechanisms; (4) funded in an equitable and nondis-\ncriminatory manner; (5) established in important public \nspaces (schools, healthcare providers, and libraries); \nand (6) available broadly across all regions in the nation.  \nSee \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7).  And should the FCC ever conclude \nthat these principles were insufficient, the statute ena-\nbles, and likely obligates, it to add principles \u201cconsistent \nwith\u201d \u00a7 254\u2019s overall purpose.  See \u00a7 254(b)(7).  Rather \nthan leave the FCC with \u201cno guidance whatsoever,\u201d \nCongress provided ample direction for the FCC in \u00a7 254.  \nJarkesy, 34 F.4th at 462. \n \n \n \n2  See also 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 151 (noting the FCC\u2019s original purpose of \ncreating policies designed \u201cto make available, so far as possible, to \nall the people of the United States  . . .  a rapid, efficient, Na-\ntion-wide  . . .  wire and radio communication service with ade-\nquate facilities at reasonable charges\u201d). \n3  See 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(1)-(7) (providing a full list of principles). \n\n134a \n \nUltimately, in enacting \u00a7 254, Congress chose to \n\u201cconfer substantial discretion\u201d over administration of \nthe USF to the FCC.  Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2139.  Peti-\ntioners take issue with how the FCC uses this discre-\ntion\u2014arguing that the FCC operates the USF with no \nguidance from Congress.4  But if the FCC had a ques-\ntion about how to manage the USF, it need only look to \n\u00a7 254 to find an answer.  Therefore, we conclude that \nCongress supplied the FCC with intelligible principles \nwhen it tasked the agency with overseeing the USF.  \nHaving established that \u00a7 254 contains intelligible prin-\nciples, we next consider whether those principles ade-\nquately limit the FCC\u2019s revenue raising function. \n2.  Whether \u00a7 254 Properly Limits the FCC \nPetitioners contend that even if Congress provided \nthe FCC with intelligible principles we should rule in \n \n4  We note that much of Petitioners\u2019 nondelegation argument re-\nlies primarily on the dissents of the Supreme Court\u2019s holding in \nGundy and this court\u2019s in Rettig, which, of course, are not binding \non our court.  See, e.g., Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2133, 2134, 2135-37 (Gor-\nsuch, J., joined by Roberts, C.J., and Thomas, J. dissenting); see \nalso Rettig, 993 F.3d at 408, 409-10 (5th Cir. 2021) (Ho, J. joined by \nJones, Smith, Elrod, and Duncan, JJ., dissenting from denial of re-\nhearing en banc).  That some Justices of the Supreme Court and \nsome judges of this circuit have opined on whether Congress is per-\nmitted to delegate \u201cdifficult policy choices\u201d is not determinative \nthat Congress impermissibly did so here when it delegated admin-\nistration of the USF to the FCC.  Moreover, the mere fact that \nPetitioners dispute the policy choices that the FCC has made in \noverseeing the USF does not translate to a constitutional or statu-\ntory violation.  See Gundy, 139 S. Ct. at 2139 (\u201cCongress may con-\nfer substantial discretion on executive agencies to implement and \nenforce the laws.\u201d).  At best, Petitioners argue for different policy \nchoices.  But they provide no binding law to support such a re-\nquest. \n\n135a \n \ntheir favor because those principles are nothing more \nthan \u201cvague aspirations\u201d that fail to set objective limits \non the FCC as they operate the USF.  Gundy, 139  \nS. Ct. at 2133.  They argue that \u00a7 254 is no different than \nthe statute in Panama Refining.5  In that case, the Su-\npreme Court took issue with 15 U.S.C. \u00a7 701\u2019s generally \nunhelpful guidance to the President as he tried to regu-\nlate the interstate hot oil industry.  See Panama Re-\nfining, 293 U.S. at 419 (observing that \u00a7 701 failed to \n\u201climit[] or control[] the authority conferred\u201d to the Pres-\nident).  Petitioners argue that \u00a7 254 similarly fails to \nlimit or control the FCC\u2019s ability to raise revenue for the \nUSF.  We disagree. \nHere, \u00a7 254 provides limitations on the FCC\u2019s  \nrevenue-raising ability, whereas the statute in Panama \nRefining is markedly different.  In Panama Refining, \nthe Supreme Court observed that: \nThe Congress left the matter to the President with-\nout standard or rule, to be dealt with as he pleased.  \nThe effort by ingenious and diligent construction to \nsupply a criterion still permits such a breadth of au-\nthorized action as essentially to commit to the Presi-\ndent the functions of a Legislature rather than those \n \n5  See 293 U.S. at 417 (stating that the purpose of the challenges \nstatute was \u201cto eliminate unfair competitive practices, to promote \nthe fullest possible utilization of the present productive capacity of \nindustries, to avoid undue restriction of production (except as may \nbe temporarily required), to increase the consumption of industrial \nand agricultural products by increasing purchasing power, to re-\nduce and relieve unemployment, to improve standards of labor, and \notherwise to rehabilitate industry and to conserve natural re-\nsources.\u201d) (internal quotations omitted). \n\n136a \n \nof an executive or administrative officer executing a \ndeclared legislative policy. \n293 U.S. at 418-19 (emphasis added).  Section 254 con-\ntains no such deficiencies, and certainly did not leave the \nmatter to the FCC \u201cwithout standard or rule, to be dealt \nwith as [it] pleased.\u201d  Id.  Instead, \u00a7 254 requires that \nthe FCC only raise enough revenue to satisfy its pri-\nmary function.  See \u00a7 254(b). \nFor example, \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)-(D) limits distribution of \nUSF funds to telecommunications services that:  (1) \n\u201care essential to education, public health, or public safety;\u201d \n(2) \u201care being deployed in public telecommunications \nnetworks by telecommunications carriers;\u201d and (3) \u201care \nconsistent with the public interest, convenience, and ne-\ncessity.\u201d  Likewise, \u00a7 254(b)(5) requires that the FCC \nensure there are \u201cspecific, predictable and sufficient \nFederal and State mechanisms to preserve and advance \nuniversal service.\u201d  Furthermore, \u00a7 254(e) limits distri-\nbution of USF funds to eligible communication carriers \nunder \u00a7 214(e)\u2014and even those carriers may only re-\nceive support \u201csufficient to achieve the purposes of\u200a\u201d  \n\u00a7 254.  Taken together, these provisions demonstrate \nthat the FCC is not in the dark as to the amount of fund-\ning it should seek each quarter.  Instead, \u00a7 254 sets out \nthe FCC\u2019s obligations with respect to administration of \nthe USF and the FCC, in turn, calculates what funds are \nnecessary to satisfy its obligations. \nUltimately, \u00a7 254 reflects Congress\u2019s understanding \nthat telecommunications services are constantly evolv-\ning.6  That understanding also drove Congress to im-\n \n6  See, e.g., \u00a7 254(c)(1) (providing that \u201c[u]niversal service is an \nevolving level of telecommunications services that the Commission \n \n\n137a \n \nplement a unique revenue raising mechanism for the \nUSF.  That the mechanism is unique is not in itself a \nnondelegation violation\u2014especially where Congress has \nplaced identifiable limits on what USF distributions can \nfund.  See, e.g., \u00a7 254(b)-(e).  Congress failed to place \nthese limitations on the President in Panama Refining \n\u2014and that led the Supreme Court to hold that a non-\ndelegation violation occurred.  But Congress did not \nmake that same mistake with \u00a7 254, instead, ensuring \nthat the statute is replete with intelligible principles to \nguide the FCC.  Because Congress provided the FCC \nwith numerous intelligible principles for its administra-\ntion of the USF and those principles sufficiently limit \nthe FCC\u2019s revenue-raising activity, we hold that \u00a7 254 \ndoes not violate the nondelegation doctrine. \nC.  Private Nondelegation \nThe private nondelegation doctrine prevents \u201cgov-\nernments from delegating too much power to private \npersons and entities.\u201d  Boerschig, 872 F.3d at 707.  \n\u201cAlthough this so-called private nondelegation doctrine \nhas been largely dormant\u201d for nearly a century, \u201cits con-\ntinuing force is generally accepted.\u201d  Id.; see also Nat\u2019l \nHorsemen\u2019s Benevolent & Protective Ass\u2019n v. Black, 53 \nF.4th 869, 880-82 (5th Cir. 2022) (discussing the evolu-\ntion of the private nondelegation doctrine).  Function-\nally, the doctrine prevents agencies from giving private \nparties the \u201cunrestrained ability to decide whether an-\nother citizen\u2019s property rights can be restricted\u201d be-\n \nshall establish periodically under this section, taking into account \nadvances in telecommunications and information technologies and \nservices\u201d). \n\n138a \n \ncause \u201cany resulting deprivation happens without \u2018pro-\ncess of law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Boerschig, 872 F.3d at 708. \nTo be clear, agencies \u201cmay subdelegate to private en-\ntities so long as the entities \u2018function subordinately to\u2019 \nthe federal agency and the federal agency \u2018has authority \nand surveillance over [their] activities.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Rettig, 987 \nF.3d at 532 (quoting Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. \nAdkins, 310 U.S. 381, 399 (1940)).  Ultimately, a statute \ndoes not violate the private nondelegation doctrine if it \n\u201c\u200a\u2018imposes a standard to guide\u2019 the private party and (2) \nprovides \u2018review of that determination that prevents the \n[private party] from having the final say.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. (altera-\ntion in original) (quoting Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 \nU.S. 238, 310-311 (1936)). \nOur decision in National Horsemen provides a timely \ncomparator to the instant case.  53 F.4th 869 (5th Cir. \n2022).  There, multiple organizations sued the Federal \nTrade Commission (\u201cFTC\u201d), alleging that the Horserac-\ning Integrity and Safety Act\u2019s (\u201cHISA\u201d) regulatory \nscheme violated the private nondelegation doctrine by \ngiving government power to the Horseracing Integrity \nand Safety Authority (the \u201cAuthority\u201d) without adequate \nagency supervision.  Id.  On appeal, we held that the \nFTC\u2019s relationship with the Authority violated the pri-\nvate nondelegation doctrine. \nWe first noted that, under HISA, the Authority had \n\u201csweeping rulemaking power,\u201d with the ability to estab-\nlish, enforce, and punish all entities involved in the \nhorseracing industry.  Id. at 882.  We also observed \nthat \u201cHISA\u2019s generous grant of authority to the Author-\nity to craft entire industry programs strongly suggests \nit is the Authority, not the FTC, that is in the saddle.\u201d  \nId. at 883 (internal quotations omitted).  Finally, we \n\n139a \n \nhighlighted that the FTC had no authority to conduct \nindependent review of the Authority\u2019s policy choices and \ndid not possess final say on what rules the Authority \npromulgated.  See id. at 884.  Instead, the FTC could \nonly \u201crecommend changes to the Authority\u2019s rules (and \nthen, only to the extent that the rules are inconsistent \nwith HISA).\u201d  Id. at 888.  After considering the lack \nof oversight and control the FTC exercised over the Au-\nthority, we ruled against the FTC and held its redelega-\ntion of Congressional power unconstitutional. \nIn this case, Petitioners argue that the FCC violated \nthe private nondelegation doctrine when it redelegated \nits authority over the USF to USAC, a private entity.  \nThey aver that the FCC does not oversee USAC in its \nperformance of its duties.  For example, they highlight \nthat the FCC rarely exercises its power to alter USAC\u2019s \nproposed contribution factor under \u00a7 54.709(a)(3).  They \nassert that one reason that the FCC does not exercise \nthis authority is because the statute affords the agency \njust fourteen days to review and alter any USAC deter-\nminations before they become binding on the telecom-\nmunications carriers.  To Petitioners, such a small win-\ndow for review renders the FCC\u2019s oversight over USAC \nmeaningless.  They suggest that the FCC is a rubber \nstamp for USAC\u2019s proposals and that USAC effectively \nadministers the USF.  We disagree. \nHere, the FCC has not violated the private nondele-\ngation doctrine because it wholly subordinates USAC.  \nFirst, federal statutory law expressly subordinates \nUSAC to the FCC.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b) (provid-\ning that USAC \u201cmay not make policy, interpret unclear \nprovisions of the statute or rules, or interpret the intent \nof Congress\u201d).  Second, unlike in National Horsemen, \n\n140a \n \nUSAC does not enjoy the same type of sweeping rule-\nmaking power\u2014instead it makes a series of proposals to \nthe FCC based off expert analysis, which are not bind-\ning on carriers until the FCC approves them.  See 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a).  Third, the FCC permits telecom-\nmunications carriers to challenge USAC proposals di-\nrectly to the agency and often grants relief to those chal-\nlenges.7  Fourth, the FCC dictates how USAC calcu-\nlates the USF contribution factor and subsequently re-\nviews the calculation method after USAC makes a pro-\nposal.  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7 54.709(a)(2)-(3); 54.711(a). \nUltimately, the FCC only uses USAC\u2019s proposals af-\nter independent consideration of the collected data and \nother relevant information.  We have expressly upheld \nthese types of arrangements.  See Rettig, 987 F.3d at \n531 (noting that agencies are permitted to \u201creasonably \ncondition\u201d their actions \u201con an outside party\u2019s determi-\nnation of some issue\u201d).  Because the FCC properly sub-\nordinates USAC, it has not violated the private nondele-\ngation doctrine. \nIV.

Accord-\ningly, the proposed unadjusted circularity factor for the \nfirst quarter of 2022 is as follows: \nUnadjusted Circularity Factor for Universal Service \nSupport Mechanisms \n= Total Program Collection / Projected First Quar-\nter 2022 Revenues \n= $1.840910 billion / $9.235846 billion \n= 0.199322 \nProposed Contribution Factor \nThe Commission has directed OMD to announce the \ncontribution factor as a percentage rounded up to the \nnearest tenth of one percent. 8  Accordingly, the pro-\n \n8  See Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, 1998 Bi-\nennial Regulatory Review\u2014Streamlined Contributor Reporting \nRequirements Associated with Administration of Telecommuni-\ncations Relay Service, North American Numbering Plan, Local \nNumber Portability, and Universal Service Support Mechanisms, \n \n\n146a \n \nposed contribution factor for the first quarter of 2022 is \nas follows: \n25.2% \nProposed Circularity Discount Factor \nThe Commission also has directed OMD to account \nfor contribution factor rounding when calculating the \ncircularity discount factor.9  Accordingly, the proposed \ncircularity factor for the first quarter of 2022 is as fol-\nlows: \n0.20104910 \nConclusion \nIf the Commission takes no action regarding the pro-\njections of demand and administrative expenses and the \nproposed contribution factor within the 14-day period \nfollowing release of this Public Notice, they shall be \ndeemed approved by the Commission. 11  USAC shall \n \nTelecommunications Services for Individuals with Hearing and \nSpeech Disabilities, and the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990, Administration of the North American Numbering Plan and \nNorth American Numbering Plan Cost Recovery Contribution \nFactor and Fund Size, Number Resource Optimization, Telephone \nNumber Portability, Truth-in-Billing and Billing Format, CC \nDocket Nos. 96-45, 98-171, 90-571, 92-237, 99-200, 95-116, 98-170, \nOrder and Second Order on Reconsideration, 18 FCC Rcd 4818, \n4826, para. 22 (2003) (Second Order on Reconsideration). \n9  Id. \n10 The proposed circularity discount factor = 1 + [(unadjusted \ncircularity discount factor - 1) * (unadjusted contribution factor / \nproposed contribution factor)].  The proposed circularity discount \nfactor is calculated in a spreadsheet program, which means that \ninternal calculations are made with more than 15 decimal places. \n11 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \n\n147a \n \nuse the contribution factor to calculate universal service \ncontributions for the first quarter of 2022.  USAC will \nreduce each provider\u2019s contribution obligation by a cir-\ncularity discount approximating the provider\u2019s contribu-\ntions in the upcoming quarter.12  USAC includes con-\ntribution obligations less the circularity discount in in-\nvoices sent to contributors.  Contribution payments \nare due on the dates shown on the invoice.  Contribu-\ntors will pay interest for each day for which the pay-\nments are late.  Contributors failing to pay contribu-\ntions in a timely fashion may be subject to the enforce-\nment provisions of the Communications Act of 1934, as \namended, and any other applicable law.  In addition, \ncontributors may be billed by USAC for reasonable \ncosts of collecting overdue contributions.13 \nWe also emphasize that carriers may not mark up \nfederal universal service line-item amounts above the \ncontribution factor.14  Thus, carriers may not, during \nthe first quarter of 2022, recover through a federal uni-\nversal service line item an amount that exceeds 25.2 per-\ncent of the interstate telecommunications charges on a \ncustomer\u2019s bill. \nIn addition, under the limited international revenues \nexception (LIRE) in section 54.706(c) of the Commis-\nsion\u2019s rules, a contributor to the universal service fund \nwhose projected collected interstate end-user telecom-\nmunications revenues comprise less than 12 percent of \nits combined projected collected interstate and interna-\n \n12 USAC will calculate each individual contributor\u2019s contribution \nin the following manner:  (1-Circulatory Factor) * (Contribution \nFactor*Revenue) \n13 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.713. \n14 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.712. \n\n148a \n \ntional end-user telecommunications revenues shall con-\ntribute based only on projected collected interstate end-\nuser telecommunications revenues, net of projected con-\ntributions.15  The rule is intended to exclude from the \ncontribution base the international end-user telecom-\nmunications revenues of any entity whose annual contri-\nbution, based on the provider\u2019s interstate and interna-\ntional end-user telecommunications revenues, would ex-\nceed the amount of its interstate end-user revenues.16  \nThe proposed contribution factor exceeds 12 percent, \nwhich we recognize could result in a contributor being \nrequired to contribute to the universal service fund an \namount that exceeds its interstate end-user telecommu-\nnications revenue.  Should a contributor face this situ-\nation, the contributor may petition the Commission for \nwaiver of the LIRE threshold.17 \n \n15 See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.706. \n16 See Federal-State Joint Board on Universal Service, Sixteenth \nOrder on Reconsideration, CC Docket No. 96-45, Eighth Report \nand Order, CC Docket No. 96-45, Sixth Report and Order, Docket \nNo. 96-262, 15 FCC Rcd 1679, 1687-1692, paras. 17-29 (1999) (Fifth \nCircuit Remand Order). \n17 Generally, the Commission\u2019s rules may be waived for good \ncause shown.  47 C.F.R. \u00a7 1.3.  The Commission may exercise its \ndiscretion to waive a rule where the particular facts make strict \ncompliance inconsistent with the public interest.  Northeast Cel-\nlular Telephone Co. v.

Absent release of this Public Notice, the six-digit \ncontribution factor announced on March 7, 2003 would be deemed \napproved by the Commission on March 21, 2003.  However, the \nsix-digit contribution factor would be inconsistent with the Second \nOrder on Reconsideration.  Therefore, the Bureau takes this lim-\nited action today to ensure the implementation of the Second Order \non Reconsideration for the second quarter of 2003.\u201d). \n\n155a \n \ncount for contribution factor rounding when calculating \nthe \u201ccircularity\u201d discount factor.6 \nOn June 23, 2006, the Commission issued an order re-\naligning oversight responsibilities within the FCC for \nthe USF, the universal service support mechanisms and \nUSAC.7  Pursuant to that order, the FCC\u2019s Office of \nthe Managing Director is now responsible for calculat-\ning the quarterly contribution factor and issuing related \npublic notices.8  \nConsistent with Commission regulations and orders, \non November 2, 2021, USAC filed the Federal Universal \nService Support Mechanisms Fund Size and Adminis-\ntrative Cost Projections for 1Q2022.  \nUpon approval of the universal service support mech-\nanisms quarterly funding requirements, projected ad-\nministrative costs and the contribution base, the Com-\nmission will establish a quarterly contribution factor \nand a circularity factor.9  USAC will then bill contribu-\ntors on a monthly basis for their individual obligations \nbased on the approved contribution factor and circular-\nity factor.10 \n \n \n \n6  Second Order on Reconsideration, 18 FCC Rcd at 4826, para. \n22. \n7  See Amendment of Part 54 of the Commission\u2019s Rules, Order, \n21 FCC Rcd 7422, 7423, and para. 4 (2006). \n8  Id. \n9  See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). \n10 Id. \n\n156a \n \nCONTRIBUTION BASE \nUSAC collects interstate and international projected \nrevenue information from carriers on the FCC Form \n499-Q (Form 499-Q) four times each year and submits \naggregate information on a quarterly basis to the FCC.11 \nCarriers also file the FCC Form 499-A (Form 499-A) \nin April of each year to report actual annual revenues \nfrom the prior year. USAC uses revenue data provided \nby carriers on the FCC Form 499-A to perform annual \ntrue-ups of actual revenue to the quarterly projected \nrevenue data submitted by carriers on FCC Form 499-\nQ during the prior calendar year. 12   As necessary, \nUSAC will refund or collect from carriers any over-pay-\nments or underpayments.  As mandated by the Com-\nmission, if the combined quarterly revenues reported by \na carrier on its Forms 499-Q are greater than those re-\nported on its annual revenue report on Form 499-A, then \na refund will be provided to the carrier based on an av-\nerage of the two lowest contribution factors for the \nyear.13  If the combined quarterly revenues reported \nby a carrier are less than those reported on its annual \nrevenue report on Form 499-A, then USAC will collect \n \n11 The FCC Form 499-Q includes a box for each of the quarterly \nfiling submissions.  Carriers check the appropriate box to indicate \nthe quarter for which revenue information is being reported.  \nData is due to USAC approximately one month before the filing is \ndue to the FCC. \n12 In addition, carriers may file a revised Form 499-Q within 45 \ndays of the original filing due date for the current quarter.

This \namount was derived using the projected collected reve-\nnue reported on the FCC Form 499-Q submissions.  In-\nterstate telecommunications service providers were re-\nquired to complete this form reporting January to \nMarch 2022 projected collected revenue information and \nreturn it by November 1, 2021.20  USAC has included \ncomplete revenue data from 4,775 carriers (3,112 con-\ntributors and 1,663 de minimis carriers). \nThe funding base for 1Q2022 is developed from the \nprojected collected revenues for 1Q2022 that were re-\nported by carriers in November 2021.

In addition \nto the members of the Joint Board required un-\nder section 410(c) of this title, one member of such \nJoint Board shall be a State-appointed utility con-\nsumer advocate nominated by a national organization \nof State utility consumer advocates.  The Joint \nBoard shall, after notice and opportunity for public \ncomment, make its recommendations to the Commis-\nsion 9 months after February 8, 1996. \n(2) Commission action \n \nThe Commission shall initiate a single proceeding \nto implement the recommendations from the Joint \nBoard required by paragraph (1) and shall complete \nsuch proceeding within 15 months after February 8, \n1996.  The rules established by such proceeding \nshall include a definition of the services that are sup-\nported by Federal universal service support mecha-\n\n163a \n \nnisms and a specific timetable for implementation.  \nThereafter, the Commission shall complete any pro-\nceeding to implement subsequent recommendations \nfrom any Joint Board on universal service within one \nyear after receiving such recommendations. \n(b) \nUniversal service principles \nThe Joint Board and the Commission shall base poli-\ncies for the preservation and advancement of universal \nservice on the following principles: \n(1) Quality and rates \n \nQuality services should be available at just, rea-\nsonable, and affordable rates. \n(2) Access to advanced services \n \nAccess to advanced telecommunications and infor-\nmation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation. \n(3) Access in rural and high cost areas \n \nConsumers in all regions of the Nation, including \nlow-income consumers and those in rural, insular, \nand high cost areas, should have access to telecom-\nmunications and information services, including \ninterexchange services and advanced telecommuni-\ncations and information services, that are reasonably \ncomparable to those services provided in urban areas \nand that are available at rates that are reasonably \ncomparable to rates charged for similar services in \nurban areas. \n(4) Equitable and nondiscriminatory contributions \n \nAll providers of telecommunications services \nshould make an equitable and nondiscriminatory con-\n\n164a \n \ntribution to the preservation and advancement of uni-\nversal service. \n(5) Specific and predictable support mechanisms \n \nThere should be specific, predictable and suffi-\ncient Federal and State mechanisms to preserve and \nadvance universal service. \n(6) Access to advanced telecommunications services \nfor schools, health care, and libraries \n \nElementary and secondary schools and class-\nrooms, health care providers, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunications services \nas described in subsection (h). \n(7) Additional principles \n \nSuch other principles as the Joint Board and the \nCommission determine are necessary and appropri-\nate for the protection of the public interest, conven-\nience, and necessity and are consistent with this \nchapter. \n(c) \nDefinition \n(1) In general \n \nUniversal service is an evolving level of telecom-\nmunications services that the Commission shall es-\ntablish periodically under this section, taking into ac-\ncount advances in telecommunications and informa-\ntion technologies and services.  The Joint Board in \nrecommending, and the Commission in establishing, \nthe definition of the services that are supported by \nFederal universal service support mechanisms shall \nconsider the extent to which such telecommunica-\ntions services\u2014 \n\n165a \n \n \n(A) \nare essential to education, public health, \nor public safety; \n \n(B) \nhave, through the operation of market \nchoices by customers, been subscribed to by a sub-\nstantial majority of residential customers; \n \n(C) \nare being deployed in public telecommu-\nnications networks by telecommunications carri-\ners; and \n \n(D) \nare consistent with the public interest, \nconvenience, and necessity. \n(2) Alterations and modifications \n \nThe Joint Board may, from time to time, recom-\nmend to the Commission modifications in the defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal \nuniversal service support mechanisms. \n(3) Special services \n \nIn addition to the services included in the defini-\ntion of universal service under paragraph (1), the \nCommission may designate additional services for \nsuch support mechanisms for schools, libraries, and \nhealth care providers for the purposes of subsection \n(h). \n(d) \nTelecommunications carrier contribution \nEvery telecommunications carrier that provides in-\nterstate telecommunications services shall contribute, \non an equitable and nondiscriminatory basis, to the spe-\ncific, predictable, and sufficient mechanisms established \nby the Commission to preserve and advance universal \nservice.  The Commission may exempt a carrier or \nclass of carriers from this requirement if the carrier\u2019s \n\n166a \n \ntelecommunications activities are limited to such an ex-\ntent that the level of such carrier\u2019s contribution to the \npreservation and advancement of universal service \nwould be de minimis.  Any other provider of interstate \ntelecommunications may be required to contribute to \nthe preservation and advancement of universal service \nif the public interest so requires. \n(e) \nUniversal service support \nAfter the date on which Commission regulations im-\nplementing this section take effect, only an eligible tele-\ncommunications carrier designated under section 214(e) \nof this title shall be eligible to receive specific Federal uni-\nversal service support.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now crystallized into a direct confrontation between two powerful, and largely incompatible, legal and rhetorical frameworks. The observation of the Respondents' (Consumers' Research) brief provides the direct counterpoint to the government's defense and the consequentialist plea from the Alaska amicus brief.\n\nMy model of the forces at play is now fully three-dimensional:\n1.  **The Government's Position (Petitioner):** The delegation is constitutional under the long-standing and permissive \"intelligible principle\" standard from 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254. The FCC maintains ultimate authority over USAC, making the subdelegation proper. This is the defense of the status quo, rooted in precedent.\n2.  **The Stakeholder's Position (Amicus Alaska):** This is the consequentialist argument. Invalidating the USF would have immediate, \"devastating\" real-world effects on healthcare, education, and public safety in remote and rural areas. This argument provides a pragmatic \"off-ramp\" for justices wary of causing massive disruption, regardless of their views on the nondelegation doctrine in the abstract.\n3.  **The Challenger's Position (Respondent):** This new observation clarifies their strategy. They are making a pure, principled structural argument, explicitly framing the USF contributions as an unconstitutional \"tax nobody voted for.\" Their brief argues:\n    *   **No Intelligible Principle:** The principles in \u00a7 254 are \"amorphous,\" \"aspirational only,\" and provide \"no principle at all,\" meaning Congress has imposed \"no limit\" on the FCC's power to raise revenue. This is a direct assault on the government's core defense.\n    *   **Improper Private Delegation:** The FCC has \"off-loaded\" its authority to USAC, a group of \"industry insiders.\" The brief portrays the FCC's oversight as a sham, where USAC's budget demands are \"passively 'deemed approved'\" without meaningful review.\n    *   **Unconstitutional Combination:** Echoing the Fifth Circuit, they argue the dual layers of delegation obscure accountability to such a degree that the entire scheme violates Article I.\n\nCrucially, the Respondents' brief *ignores* the consequentialist arguments raised by Alaska. They are not engaging in a debate about the USF's utility; they are asserting its structural illegality. This is a calculated risk, betting that a majority of the Court prioritizes constitutional structure over pragmatic stability. Their argument is bolstered by citations to long-standing academic criticism and a former FCC Commissioner, framing their challenge not as a recent invention but as the culmination of decades of concern.\n\nFurthermore, the brief reveals a key procedural signal: Consumers' Research *agrees* that the Court should grant review and even suggests consolidating this case with their own pending petitions from other circuits. This demonstrates high confidence and a desire to force a definitive ruling.\n\nMy predictive uncertainty is now sharply defined. The outcome hinges on which framework a majority of justices will adopt: the Respondents' clean, structuralist argument against an unbounded \"taxing power,\" or the government's and Alaska's messy, pragmatic argument about precedent and the devastating real-world reliance on the USF. The case is a direct test of the Court's appetite for enforcing a muscular nondelegation doctrine, even in the face of significant, disruptive consequences.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology continues to evolve, with this observation providing strong validation for recent refinements and suggesting new ones. The core process of **Theorize -> Articulate Uncertainty -> Strategically Pivot to Primary Sources -> Analyze & Update** is proving highly effective.\n\nMy core heuristics have been reinforced and expanded:\n*   **Framework-First & Analyzing Both Sides:** These foundational principles remain essential.\n*   **Argument Framing Matters:** This is powerfully reinforced. The contrast between Alaska's \"lifeline for rural communities\" and the Respondents' \"tax nobody voted for\" illustrates that the rhetorical framing is as crucial as the legal substance.\n*   **Procedural Posturing as a Signal:** This is now a validated, high-value heuristic. The Respondents' agreement to certiorari and their request to realign the parties is a strong signal of confidence and strategic intent. It's a non-merits data point that informs my prediction about the merits.\n*   **Identify Argument *Types*:** My decision to categorize arguments (Doctrinal, Structural, Consequentialist) is paying dividends. This observation confirms the Respondents are waging a purely **Structural** battle, while the government relies on **Doctrinal** precedent and its allies deploy **Consequentialist** warnings. The strategic *absence* of a counter-argument (Respondents ignoring the \"parade of horribles\") is now a signal I must actively look for.\n*   **Prioritize 'Stakeholder' Amici:** The value of the Alaska brief is highlighted by the stark contrast with the Respondents' brief. Stakeholder briefs provide the real-world texture that structural arguments deliberately ignore, defining the pragmatic stakes of a case.\n*   **Search for the Counter-Narrative:** This heuristic, which prompted the search for this very document, is now proven to be a cornerstone of effective analysis. Having identified the reliance argument, seeking its direct opposition was the correct move to map the full conflict.\n\nThis observation has also generated new, more nuanced heuristics:\n1.  **Analyze the 'Ask':** I must now scrutinize the conclusion of a brief not just for a summary of arguments, but for the specific procedural relief requested. The Respondents' \"ask\" to consolidate and realign reveals their litigation strategy and desire to control the case's framing before the Court.\n2.  **Track the Intellectual Pedigree of Arguments:** The Respondents' citation to a 2000 law review article and a 2006 book by a former FCC official demonstrates that their argument has a history. This suggests it's a serious, long-term legal project, not a frivolous claim. Tracking an argument's lineage through academic and policy circles can help gauge its credibility and the strategic effort behind it."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to sharpen, moving from a clash of frameworks to a specific, precedent-based legal battle defined by the primary litigants. The observation of the Solicitor General's petition for certiorari on behalf of the FCC provides the authoritative government counter-argument to the structural challenge posed by Consumers' Research.\n\nMy model of the case's dynamics is now grounded in the official filings of both sides:\n\n1.  **The Government's Position (Petitioner, via Solicitor General):** This is now fully articulated. The government is waging a defense rooted in established administrative law precedent. Their cert petition shows they will argue:\n    *   **Delegation to FCC is Valid:** The delegation is constitutional under the \"intelligible principle\" doctrine, citing foundational cases like *J.W. Hampton, Jr., & Co. v. United States* and, most importantly, the modern cornerstone *Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns*. They argue that the principles laid out in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b) (e.g., ensuring comparable services for rural and urban areas) provide more than enough guidance to satisfy this long-standing test.\n    *   **Subdelegation to USAC is Proper:** The FCC's use of USAC is a permissible delegation of administrative, not governmental, power. They frame USAC's role as purely ministerial (\"sending out bills, collecting contributions, and disbursing funds\"). They emphasize the FCC's ultimate control, including its power of de novo review and its authority to set the final contribution factor. The key precedent here appears to be *Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins*, which upheld the use of private entities for administrative functions under government control.\n    *   **The \"Combination\" Theory is Invalid:** The government flatly rejects the Fifth Circuit's novel theory that the two layers of delegation combine to create a constitutional violation, framing it as an unsupported invention.\n\n2.  **The Challenger's Position (Respondent):** Their strategy, as understood from their prior brief, is to argue that the precedents the government relies on do not apply to this \"unprecedented\" scheme. They will counter that the principles in \u00a7 254 are too \"amorphous\" to be a real limit (*contra Whitman*) and that the FCC's oversight of USAC is a sham, making the subdelegation improper (*contra Sunshine Anthracite*).\n\n3.  **The Stakeholder's Position (Amicus Alaska):** The consequentialist argument about devastating impacts on rural communities remains a crucial background factor, providing a pragmatic escape route for any justice who is sympathetic to the structural argument but unwilling to cause massive disruption. The Solicitor General's petition, by focusing strictly on doctrine, leaves this persuasive work to the amici.\n\nA critical new piece of information has been introduced: the government's alternative \"ask.\" In the petition, the Solicitor General requests that if the Court is not ready to decide this case, it should **hold the petition pending the resolution of *Wisconsin Bell***. This is a major strategic signal. It suggests the government sees the nondelegation issues in this case as being intertwined with other administrative law questions currently before the Court. It could be a defensive move, hoping a favorable outcome in *Wisconsin Bell* will create helpful precedent, or a docket-management suggestion to the Court. This introduces a new potential outcome and a new variable into my predictive model: the Court's decision on how to handle this case is now linked to its strategy for another.\n\nMy predictive uncertainty is no longer just a binary choice between structuralism and pragmatism. It now involves the Court's procedural choices. Will they take the case and decide it on these facts? Or will they accept the government's invitation to wait for *Wisconsin Bell*, signaling that they view this as part of a broader re-evaluation of administrative power? The core tension remains, but the strategic landscape has become more complex.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology is becoming more robust and nuanced with each primary source document I analyze. The process of mapping arguments and then seeking out the official counter-arguments from primary litigants is proving to be the most effective path to a deep understanding.\n\nMy core heuristics have been validated and significantly refined:\n\n*   **Framework-First & Analyzing Both Sides:** This remains the bedrock of my approach. Having now analyzed the challenger's brief in opposition and the government's petition for certiorari, I have the authoritative bookends of the legal dispute.\n*   **Argument Framing Matters:** The Solicitor General's petition is a masterclass in this. The \"Questions Presented\" are framed to presuppose the government's conclusion (e.g., USAC performs \"administrative tasks,\" Congress acted \"within the limits set forth\"). This reinforces the need to deconstruct the framing used by each side.\n*   **Procedural Posturing as a Signal:** This heuristic is powerfully confirmed. The government's petition for cert is expected, but the *alternative ask* to hold the case pending *Wisconsin Bell* is a high-value strategic signal about their perception of risk and the case's relationship to the broader legal landscape.\n*   **Identify Argument *Types*:** This continues to be a useful lens. The Solicitor General's petition is almost purely **Doctrinal**, relying on precedent. This leaves the **Consequentialist** heavy lifting to amici like Alaska, while the challengers remain focused on their **Structural** attack.\n*   **Search for the Counter-Narrative:** My decision to seek out the government's petition after analyzing the respondent's brief was the correct application of this heuristic, leading directly to this crucial observation.\n\nThis observation has also generated more sophisticated heuristics for future use:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 'Ask' (including alternatives):** I must now scrutinize the conclusion of a brief not just for the primary relief requested, but for any *alternative* dispositions proposed. These alternatives, like the suggestion to \"hold for *Wisconsin Bell*,\" are strategic tells that reveal a party's backup plan and their assessment of the broader legal environment.\n2.  **Track the Intellectual Pedigree of Arguments:** Just as the respondent's brief cited academic work, the government's petition reveals its precedential lineage. Systematically identifying the key cases cited in the \"Table of Authorities\" (e.g., *Whitman*, *Sunshine Anthracite*) is a highly efficient way to map the doctrinal battlefield before reading a single paragraph of the argument.\n3.  **Track Inter-Case Dependencies:** The *Wisconsin Bell* reference is a critical lesson. Cases, especially at the Supreme Court level, do not exist in a vacuum. I must now actively search for mentions of other pending or recently decided cases in major filings. These dependencies are powerful clues about how the litigants (and potentially the Court) see the doctrinal puzzle pieces fitting together.\n4.  **The Solicitor General is a Special Source:** The actions of the Solicitor General's office carry unique weight. Their decision to petition for cert after a loss in a circuit court signals that the issue is of the highest importance to the U.S. government. Their strategic choices, like the alternative \"ask,\" provide a clearer signal of the executive branch's legal strategy than a brief from a private litigant."

Consumers\u2019 Research, No. 24-354 Introduction: Today, the Supreme Court held in a 6-3 decision that Congress\u2019s delegation of authority to the FCC to set the rate for contributions to, and oversee disbursements from, the Universal Service Fund \u2013 as well as the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation of authority to a private corporation to help with implementation \u2013 did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. Background: In the Communications Act of 1934, Congress instructed the FCC to make communications services available at a reasonable rate to everyone in the United States, known as the universal-service requirement. When Congress amended the Act in 1996, it required every communications services carrier to contribute a to-be-determined percentage of the carrier\u2019s projected revenue to the Universal Service Fund, which the FCC would then use to fund universal service, subject to certain statutory conditions and considerations. The FCC appointed a private corporation \u2013 the Universal Service Administrative Company \u2013 to help calculate carrier contributions and manage the Fund. Consumers\u2019 Research challenged this arrangement as a violation of the non-delegation doctrine, which holds that Congress may not delegate legislative power to Executive Branch agencies and, separately, that government authority may not be delegated to private entities. The Fifth Circuit held the Universal Service Fund arrangement unlawful. It concluded that Congress may have improperly delegated legislative power to the FCC by failing to specify sufficiently detailed limiting principles governing the FCC\u2019s implementation of the universal-service requirement. And the court determined that the FCC may have improperly delegated governmental authority to a private company. The Fifth Circuit did not conclusively determine whether either delegation was independently unlawful, holding instead that the combination of the two delegations was unconstitutional. Issue: Whether Congress\u2019s delegation of authority to the FCC to manage the Universal Fund and the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation of that authority to a private corporation violate the non-delegation doctrine. Court\u2019s Holding: In an opinion written by Justice Kagan and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kavanaugh, Barrett, and Jackson, the Supreme Court held that the Congress\u2019s design of the Universal Service Fund and the FCC\u2019s implementation of that plan did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. First, the Court held that Congress\u2019s delegation of authority to the FCC to manage a Universal Service Fund did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. Prior Supreme Court decisions held that there is no violation of the congressional non-delegation principle as long as Congress provides an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d to guide the agency. The Court today rejected Consumers\u2019 Research\u2019s argument that a stricter standard should apply when Congress authorizes an agency to determine the amount of a fee. It held that even a delegation involving revenue-raising is subject to the traditional intelligible-principle test. And the Court reasoned that Congress\u2019s delegation satisfied that test because it allows the FCC to raise only a \u201csufficient\u201d amount to implement universal service and set mandatory conditions for the FCC to consider when determining the amount of funds needed to satisfy that standard. Second, the Court held that the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation of authority to the private entity did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. The Court explained that sub-delegation was permissible here because the Universal Service Administrative Company was subordinate to the FCC and because the FCC retained final decision-making authority. Finally, the Court rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s combination theory, under which two constitutional non-violations taken together can amount to a constitutional violation. The Court reasoned that, because the two non-violations did not implicate the same issue \u2013 one dealt with Congress\u2019s authority to delegate its legislative power, and the other dealt with allowing a private entity to govern \u2013 they did not compound to create a constitutional violation. Justice Kavanaugh concurred. He wrote separately to emphasize that the intelligible-principle test varies based on the scope of the power Congress delegates, that the Court\u2019s recent decisions cabining agencies\u2019 power to implement legislation mitigate concerns over substantial delegations, and that the non-delegation doctrine plays only a limited role in the areas of national security and foreign policy. He also suggested that non-delegation concerns are especially elevated with respect to independent agencies, so the Court should consider either rendering independent agency heads removable at will by the President or more stringently applying the non-delegation doctrine to independent agencies. (Of course, in a recent order the Supreme Court essentially invalidated limits on Presidential authority to remove members of multi-member commissions that head independent agencies, except for the restrictions applicable to Federal Reserve Board members.) Justice Jackson also concurred, writing that she viewed with skepticism the existence of legal principles barring delegations to private entities. Justice Gorsuch authored a dissent, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito. He viewed the communications service providers\u2019 contribution requirement as a tax, which he emphasized is one of the most significant powers that Congress could confer. As a result, he would have applied the intelligible-principle test \u201cwith greater force\u201d and concluded that Congress\u2019s conditions did not sufficiently cabin the FCC\u2019s authority. Read the opinion here. Short Quote from Decision: \u201cUnder our nondelegation precedents, Congress sufficiently guided and constrained the discretion that it lodged with the FCC to implement the universal-service contribution scheme. And the FCC, in its turn, has retained all decision-making authority within that sphere, relying on the Administrative Company only for non-binding advice. Nothing in those arrangements, either separately or together, violates the Constitution.\u201d \u2013 Justice Kagan Home About Our Practice Appellate Lawyers Cases & Experience Treatises Resources Contact Site Map Subscribe Photographs of the Supreme Court building by Michael Kimberly. \u00a9 2025 Mayer Brown.

Waldron, Kevin King, MaKade Claypool & Travis Cabbell on June 27, 2025 Posted in FCC, Universal Service Fund Today, the Supreme Court issued its decision in FCC v. Consumers\u2019 Research (No. 24-354), upholding the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d).\u00a0 The Court in a 6-3 majority opinion penned by Justice Kagan explained that the USF does not violate the \u201cpublic nondelegation doctrine\u201d or the \u201cprivate nondelegation doctrine\u201d because Congress provided adequate guideposts and guardrails for the Federal Communication Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) to implement the USF, and because the FCC had not impermissibly subdelegated its implementation authority to a private entity.\u00a0 Because the Court upheld the USF, it is unlikely that there will be any immediate implications for the telecommunications industry more broadly.\u00a0 That said, in analyzing the legal issues, the Court clarified several limits on the FCC\u2019s USF authority, which could constrain the scope of the USF program in the future, and likewise could serve as the basis for future legal challenges should the FCC transgress those limits. Consumers\u2019 Research Decision This case involved the FCC\u2019s authority to subsidize programs designed to further \u201cuniversal service.\u201d\u00a0 Those subsidies are paid for by telecommunication carriers, who are each required to contribute an amount equal to a percentage of their projected annual revenues.\u00a0 A not-for-profit corporation established by the FCC (the \u201cUniversal Service Administrative Company\u201d or \u201cUSAC\u201d) calculates and recommends this quarterly contribution percentage (or \u201ccontribution factor\u201d), which the FCC then reviews and approves.\u00a0 Consumers\u2019 Research challenged this structure as violating both the nondelegation doctrine\u2014a legal doctrine that generally prevents Congress from delegating legislative authority to federal agencies\u2014and the private-delegation doctrine\u2014which prohibits federal agencies from delegating their sovereign authorities to private individuals or entities.\u00a0 In earlier proceedings, the Fifth Circuit held that the USF was unconstitutional and relied on a novel theory that the combination of Congress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation to USAC was unconstitutional.\u00a0 The Supreme Court reversed that ruling in today\u2019s decision. First, the Supreme Court held that Congress provided \u201cdeterminate standards\u201d to guide the FCC\u2019s implementation of the USF, and thus the USF does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.\u00a0 To reach this conclusion, the Court rejected the dissent\u2019s view that a special nondelegation doctrine applies, which would require Congress to impose a numeric cap or tax rate on USF contributions.\u00a0 According to the majority, precedent and Congress\u2019s longstanding practices foreclose that argument.\u00a0 The Court then analyzed whether Congress has provided meaningful guideposts for, and limitations on, the FCC\u2019s authority to implement the USF.\u00a0 Congress satisfied these requirements.\u00a0 It imposed \u201cqualitative limits on how much money the FCC can raise from carriers\u201d by requiring contributions to be \u201csufficient,\u201d i.e., an amount that, while not an \u201cexact science,\u201d is neither \u201cless than\u201d nor \u201cmore than\u201d what is \u201cadequate or necessary to finance the universal-service programs.\u201d\u00a0 Congress also provided \u201cclear and limiting\u201d policies through \u201cdetailed criteria\u201d that the FCC \u201cmust\u201d adhere to in spending funds to further universal service.\u00a0 The Court recognized that the FCC still \u201cexercises significant discretion,\u201d but it clarified that there is no constitutional violation here because that discretion is \u201ctethered to legislative judgments about the scope and content of the universal-service program.\u201d Second, the Court held that the FCC had not sub-delegated its authority to USAC, and thus did not violate the private-delegation doctrine.\u00a0 It is \u201cunquestionably valid\u201d for federal agencies to \u201crely on advice and assistance from private actors\u201d so long as the private actors are \u201csubordinat[e]\u201d to the agency\u2019s \u201cauthority and surveillance.\u201d\u00a0 That is the case here:\u00a0 USAC merely carries out its tasks consistent with the FCC\u2019s directives, \u201cjust doing arithmetic\u201d with \u201cno policy-making\u201d; and the FCC has authority to \u201creview and revise\u201d any action or recommendation by USAC.\u00a0 In short, there is no private-delegation issue here because the FCC \u201cis, throughout, the final authority.\u201d Third, the Court rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel theory that combining Congress\u2019s lawful delegation to the FCC with the FCC\u2019s lawful reliance on USAC amounts to a constitutional violation.\u00a0 This combination theory depends on extending Supreme Court precedent dealing with the President\u2019s ability to remove executive officers.\u00a0 But the Court rejected that precedent as inapplicable, explaining instead that \u201ca meritless public nondelegation challenge plus a meritless private nondelegation challenge cannot equal a meritorious \u2018combination\u2019 claim.\u201d Concluding, the Court lauded Congress and the FCC for \u201cestablishing universal-service programs [that have] led to a more fully connected country\u201d over the last several decades \u201cwhile leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution.\u201d\u00a0 As such, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit and affirmed the constitutionality of the USF. Implications Because the Court upheld the USF, we anticipate that the immediate implications of the Court\u2019s decision on the telecommunications industry will be minimal.\u00a0 However, in analyzing the delegation issues, the Court clarified the limits on the FCC\u2019s authority to further universal service, as well as the boundaries of a permissible relationship with USAC.\u00a0 These clearly articulated lines in the sand could limit the FCC\u2019s (and USAC\u2019s) authority in the future, for example by deterring the FCC from expanding the USF program to new services or markets, or from delegating additional decisionmaking authority to USAC.\u00a0 Similarly, the limitations highlighted in today\u2019s decision may serve as the basis for future legal challenges should the FCC\u2019s or USAC\u2019s USF actions in the future transgress those lines drawn in Consumers\u2019 Research.

Respondent Consumers' Research, et al. Docket no. 24-354 Decided by Roberts Court Lower court United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Citation 606\u00a0US\u00a0_\u00a0(2025) Granted Nov 22, 2024 Argued Mar 26, 2025 Decided Jun 27, 2025 Advocates Sarah M. Harris for the Petitioners in No. 24-354 Paul D. Clement for the Petitioners in No. 24-422 R. Trent McCotter for the Respondents Facts of the case The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established in 1934 to regulate interstate communications and ensure widespread access to telecommunications services. To further this mission, Congress in 1996 instructed the FCC to establish and maintain a universal service fund, requiring telecommunications carriers to contribute quarterly based on their revenues. The FCC partners with the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), a private entity, to manage this process\u2014USAC calculates projected demand and contribution factors using FCC formulas, submits these proposals to the FCC for approval, and then uses the approved figures to determine individual contribution amounts. Consumers\u2019 Research challenged the constitutionality of the 1996 Telecommunications Act\u2019s universal service requirements and the FCC\u2019s implementation of those requirements. Their primary arguments were twofold: first, that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC through the universal service provisions, and second, that the FCC improperly delegated its authority to a private entity (USAC) to manage the universal service fund. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the petition, finding no constitutional violations in either delegation. The Court determined that Congress provided sufficient guidance (an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d) to the FCC in the statute, and that the FCC maintained adequate control and oversight over USAC\u2019s activities in managing the universal service fund, preventing any improper delegation of government authority to a private entity. Question Did Congress violate the Constitution in the way it delegated power to the FCC to collect Universal Service Fund money, and did the FCC violate the Constitution by letting a private, industry-controlled company make those collection decisions? Conclusion Sort: by seniority by ideology << decision 1 of >> The statutory scheme that allows the FCC to collect \u201csufficient\u201d contributions to fund universal-service programs does not violate the nondelegation doctrine. Justice Elena Kagan authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court. The Communications Act directs the FCC to collect contributions that are \u201csufficient\u201d to support universal-service programs, which sets both a floor and a ceiling on the agency\u2019s authority. The FCC cannot raise less than what is adequate to finance the programs, but also cannot raise more than that amount. Congress provided adequate guidance by specifying whom the programs must serve (rural and high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools, and libraries) and defining which services qualify for subsidies. To receive funding, services must be subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers, be available at affordable rates, and be essential to education, public health, or safety. These conditions create determinate standards that meaningfully constrain the FCC's discretion. The FCC\u2019s use of the Universal Service Administrative Company to help calculate contribution amounts also passes constitutional muster. The Administrator operates subordinately to the Commission, which appoints its Board of Directors, approves its budget, and retains final decision-making authority. While the Administrator produces initial projections of carrier revenues and Fund expenses, the Commission reviews, revises if needed, and approves these figures before setting the contribution factor. The arrangement mirrors the permissible structure approved in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, where private parties could make recommendations to a government agency that retained ultimate authority. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a concurring opinion, agreeing with the outcome but emphasizing concerns about delegations to independent agencies. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored a concurring opinion, expressing skepticism about the viability of the private nondelegation doctrine as an independent constitutional principle. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, arguing that Section 254 impermissibly delegates Congress\u2019s taxing power by failing to set a tax rate or meaningful cap on collections.

Consumers\u2019 Research, No. 24-354 Introduction: Today, the Supreme Court held in a 6-3 decision that Congress\u2019s delegation of authority to the FCC to set the rate for contributions to, and oversee disbursements from, the Universal Service Fund \u2013 as well as the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation of authority to a private corporation to help with implementation \u2013 did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. Background: In the Communications Act of 1934, Congress instructed the FCC to make communications services available at a reasonable rate to everyone in the United States, known as the universal-service requirement. When Congress amended the Act in 1996, it required every communications services carrier to contribute a to-be-determined percentage of the carrier\u2019s projected revenue to the Universal Service Fund, which the FCC would then use to fund universal service, subject to certain statutory conditions and considerations. The FCC appointed a private corporation \u2013 the Universal Service Administrative Company \u2013 to help calculate carrier contributions and manage the Fund. Consumers\u2019 Research challenged this arrangement as a violation of the non-delegation doctrine, which holds that Congress may not delegate legislative power to Executive Branch agencies and, separately, that government authority may not be delegated to private entities. The Fifth Circuit held the Universal Service Fund arrangement unlawful. It concluded that Congress may have improperly delegated legislative power to the FCC by failing to specify sufficiently detailed limiting principles governing the FCC\u2019s implementation of the universal-service requirement. And the court determined that the FCC may have improperly delegated governmental authority to a private company. The Fifth Circuit did not conclusively determine whether either delegation was independently unlawful, holding instead that the combination of the two delegations was unconstitutional. Issue: Whether Congress\u2019s delegation of authority to the FCC to manage the Universal Fund and the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation of that authority to a private corporation violate the non-delegation doctrine. Court\u2019s Holding: In an opinion written by Justice Kagan and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Sotomayor, Kavanaugh, Barrett, and Jackson, the Supreme Court held that the Congress\u2019s design of the Universal Service Fund and the FCC\u2019s implementation of that plan did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. First, the Court held that Congress\u2019s delegation of authority to the FCC to manage a Universal Service Fund did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. Prior Supreme Court decisions held that there is no violation of the congressional non-delegation principle as long as Congress provides an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d to guide the agency. The Court today rejected Consumers\u2019 Research\u2019s argument that a stricter standard should apply when Congress authorizes an agency to determine the amount of a fee. It held that even a delegation involving revenue-raising is subject to the traditional intelligible-principle test. And the Court reasoned that Congress\u2019s delegation satisfied that test because it allows the FCC to raise only a \u201csufficient\u201d amount to implement universal service and set mandatory conditions for the FCC to consider when determining the amount of funds needed to satisfy that standard. Second, the Court held that the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation of authority to the private entity did not violate the non-delegation doctrine. The Court explained that sub-delegation was permissible here because the Universal Service Administrative Company was subordinate to the FCC and because the FCC retained final decision-making authority. Finally, the Court rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s combination theory, under which two constitutional non-violations taken together can amount to a constitutional violation. The Court reasoned that, because the two non-violations did not implicate the same issue \u2013 one dealt with Congress\u2019s authority to delegate its legislative power, and the other dealt with allowing a private entity to govern \u2013 they did not compound to create a constitutional violation. Justice Kavanaugh concurred. He wrote separately to emphasize that the intelligible-principle test varies based on the scope of the power Congress delegates, that the Court\u2019s recent decisions cabining agencies\u2019 power to implement legislation mitigate concerns over substantial delegations, and that the non-delegation doctrine plays only a limited role in the areas of national security and foreign policy. He also suggested that non-delegation concerns are especially elevated with respect to independent agencies, so the Court should consider either rendering independent agency heads removable at will by the President or more stringently applying the non-delegation doctrine to independent agencies. (Of course, in a recent order the Supreme Court essentially invalidated limits on Presidential authority to remove members of multi-member commissions that head independent agencies, except for the restrictions applicable to Federal Reserve Board members.) Justice Jackson also concurred, writing that she viewed with skepticism the existence of legal principles barring delegations to private entities. Justice Gorsuch authored a dissent, joined by Justices Thomas and Alito. He viewed the communications service providers\u2019 contribution requirement as a tax, which he emphasized is one of the most significant powers that Congress could confer. As a result, he would have applied the intelligible-principle test \u201cwith greater force\u201d and concluded that Congress\u2019s conditions did not sufficiently cabin the FCC\u2019s authority. Read the opinion here. Short Quote from Decision: \u201cUnder our nondelegation precedents, Congress sufficiently guided and constrained the discretion that it lodged with the FCC to implement the universal-service contribution scheme. And the FCC, in its turn, has retained all decision-making authority within that sphere, relying on the Administrative Company only for non-binding advice. Nothing in those arrangements, either separately or together, violates the Constitution.\u201d \u2013 Justice Kagan Home About Our Practice Appellate Lawyers Cases & Experience Treatises Resources Contact Site Map Subscribe Photographs of the Supreme Court building by Michael Kimberly. \u00a9 2025 Mayer Brown.

Waldron, Kevin King, MaKade Claypool & Travis Cabbell on June 27, 2025 Posted in FCC, Universal Service Fund Today, the Supreme Court issued its decision in FCC v. Consumers\u2019 Research (No. 24-354), upholding the constitutionality of the Universal Service Fund (\u201cUSF\u201d).\u00a0 The Court in a 6-3 majority opinion penned by Justice Kagan explained that the USF does not violate the \u201cpublic nondelegation doctrine\u201d or the \u201cprivate nondelegation doctrine\u201d because Congress provided adequate guideposts and guardrails for the Federal Communication Commission (\u201cFCC\u201d) to implement the USF, and because the FCC had not impermissibly subdelegated its implementation authority to a private entity.\u00a0 Because the Court upheld the USF, it is unlikely that there will be any immediate implications for the telecommunications industry more broadly.\u00a0 That said, in analyzing the legal issues, the Court clarified several limits on the FCC\u2019s USF authority, which could constrain the scope of the USF program in the future, and likewise could serve as the basis for future legal challenges should the FCC transgress those limits. Consumers\u2019 Research Decision This case involved the FCC\u2019s authority to subsidize programs designed to further \u201cuniversal service.\u201d\u00a0 Those subsidies are paid for by telecommunication carriers, who are each required to contribute an amount equal to a percentage of their projected annual revenues.\u00a0 A not-for-profit corporation established by the FCC (the \u201cUniversal Service Administrative Company\u201d or \u201cUSAC\u201d) calculates and recommends this quarterly contribution percentage (or \u201ccontribution factor\u201d), which the FCC then reviews and approves.\u00a0 Consumers\u2019 Research challenged this structure as violating both the nondelegation doctrine\u2014a legal doctrine that generally prevents Congress from delegating legislative authority to federal agencies\u2014and the private-delegation doctrine\u2014which prohibits federal agencies from delegating their sovereign authorities to private individuals or entities.\u00a0 In earlier proceedings, the Fifth Circuit held that the USF was unconstitutional and relied on a novel theory that the combination of Congress\u2019s delegation to the FCC and the FCC\u2019s sub-delegation to USAC was unconstitutional.\u00a0 The Supreme Court reversed that ruling in today\u2019s decision. First, the Supreme Court held that Congress provided \u201cdeterminate standards\u201d to guide the FCC\u2019s implementation of the USF, and thus the USF does not violate the nondelegation doctrine.\u00a0 To reach this conclusion, the Court rejected the dissent\u2019s view that a special nondelegation doctrine applies, which would require Congress to impose a numeric cap or tax rate on USF contributions.\u00a0 According to the majority, precedent and Congress\u2019s longstanding practices foreclose that argument.\u00a0 The Court then analyzed whether Congress has provided meaningful guideposts for, and limitations on, the FCC\u2019s authority to implement the USF.\u00a0 Congress satisfied these requirements.\u00a0 It imposed \u201cqualitative limits on how much money the FCC can raise from carriers\u201d by requiring contributions to be \u201csufficient,\u201d i.e., an amount that, while not an \u201cexact science,\u201d is neither \u201cless than\u201d nor \u201cmore than\u201d what is \u201cadequate or necessary to finance the universal-service programs.\u201d\u00a0 Congress also provided \u201cclear and limiting\u201d policies through \u201cdetailed criteria\u201d that the FCC \u201cmust\u201d adhere to in spending funds to further universal service.\u00a0 The Court recognized that the FCC still \u201cexercises significant discretion,\u201d but it clarified that there is no constitutional violation here because that discretion is \u201ctethered to legislative judgments about the scope and content of the universal-service program.\u201d Second, the Court held that the FCC had not sub-delegated its authority to USAC, and thus did not violate the private-delegation doctrine.\u00a0 It is \u201cunquestionably valid\u201d for federal agencies to \u201crely on advice and assistance from private actors\u201d so long as the private actors are \u201csubordinat[e]\u201d to the agency\u2019s \u201cauthority and surveillance.\u201d\u00a0 That is the case here:\u00a0 USAC merely carries out its tasks consistent with the FCC\u2019s directives, \u201cjust doing arithmetic\u201d with \u201cno policy-making\u201d; and the FCC has authority to \u201creview and revise\u201d any action or recommendation by USAC.\u00a0 In short, there is no private-delegation issue here because the FCC \u201cis, throughout, the final authority.\u201d Third, the Court rejected the Fifth Circuit\u2019s novel theory that combining Congress\u2019s lawful delegation to the FCC with the FCC\u2019s lawful reliance on USAC amounts to a constitutional violation.\u00a0 This combination theory depends on extending Supreme Court precedent dealing with the President\u2019s ability to remove executive officers.\u00a0 But the Court rejected that precedent as inapplicable, explaining instead that \u201ca meritless public nondelegation challenge plus a meritless private nondelegation challenge cannot equal a meritorious \u2018combination\u2019 claim.\u201d Concluding, the Court lauded Congress and the FCC for \u201cestablishing universal-service programs [that have] led to a more fully connected country\u201d over the last several decades \u201cwhile leaving fully intact the separation of powers integral to our Constitution.\u201d\u00a0 As such, the Court reversed the Fifth Circuit and affirmed the constitutionality of the USF. Implications Because the Court upheld the USF, we anticipate that the immediate implications of the Court\u2019s decision on the telecommunications industry will be minimal.\u00a0 However, in analyzing the delegation issues, the Court clarified the limits on the FCC\u2019s authority to further universal service, as well as the boundaries of a permissible relationship with USAC.\u00a0 These clearly articulated lines in the sand could limit the FCC\u2019s (and USAC\u2019s) authority in the future, for example by deterring the FCC from expanding the USF program to new services or markets, or from delegating additional decisionmaking authority to USAC.\u00a0 Similarly, the limitations highlighted in today\u2019s decision may serve as the basis for future legal challenges should the FCC\u2019s or USAC\u2019s USF actions in the future transgress those lines drawn in Consumers\u2019 Research.

Respondent Consumers' Research, et al. Docket no. 24-354 Decided by Roberts Court Lower court United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit Citation 606\u00a0US\u00a0_\u00a0(2025) Granted Nov 22, 2024 Argued Mar 26, 2025 Decided Jun 27, 2025 Advocates Sarah M. Harris for the Petitioners in No. 24-354 Paul D. Clement for the Petitioners in No. 24-422 R. Trent McCotter for the Respondents Facts of the case The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was established in 1934 to regulate interstate communications and ensure widespread access to telecommunications services. To further this mission, Congress in 1996 instructed the FCC to establish and maintain a universal service fund, requiring telecommunications carriers to contribute quarterly based on their revenues. The FCC partners with the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), a private entity, to manage this process\u2014USAC calculates projected demand and contribution factors using FCC formulas, submits these proposals to the FCC for approval, and then uses the approved figures to determine individual contribution amounts. Consumers\u2019 Research challenged the constitutionality of the 1996 Telecommunications Act\u2019s universal service requirements and the FCC\u2019s implementation of those requirements. Their primary arguments were twofold: first, that Congress unconstitutionally delegated its legislative power to the FCC through the universal service provisions, and second, that the FCC improperly delegated its authority to a private entity (USAC) to manage the universal service fund. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit denied the petition, finding no constitutional violations in either delegation. The Court determined that Congress provided sufficient guidance (an \u201cintelligible principle\u201d) to the FCC in the statute, and that the FCC maintained adequate control and oversight over USAC\u2019s activities in managing the universal service fund, preventing any improper delegation of government authority to a private entity. Question Did Congress violate the Constitution in the way it delegated power to the FCC to collect Universal Service Fund money, and did the FCC violate the Constitution by letting a private, industry-controlled company make those collection decisions? Conclusion Sort: by seniority by ideology << decision 1 of >> The statutory scheme that allows the FCC to collect \u201csufficient\u201d contributions to fund universal-service programs does not violate the nondelegation doctrine. Justice Elena Kagan authored the 6-3 majority opinion of the Court. The Communications Act directs the FCC to collect contributions that are \u201csufficient\u201d to support universal-service programs, which sets both a floor and a ceiling on the agency\u2019s authority. The FCC cannot raise less than what is adequate to finance the programs, but also cannot raise more than that amount. Congress provided adequate guidance by specifying whom the programs must serve (rural and high-cost areas, low-income consumers, schools, and libraries) and defining which services qualify for subsidies. To receive funding, services must be subscribed to by a substantial majority of residential customers, be available at affordable rates, and be essential to education, public health, or safety. These conditions create determinate standards that meaningfully constrain the FCC's discretion. The FCC\u2019s use of the Universal Service Administrative Company to help calculate contribution amounts also passes constitutional muster. The Administrator operates subordinately to the Commission, which appoints its Board of Directors, approves its budget, and retains final decision-making authority. While the Administrator produces initial projections of carrier revenues and Fund expenses, the Commission reviews, revises if needed, and approves these figures before setting the contribution factor. The arrangement mirrors the permissible structure approved in Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, where private parties could make recommendations to a government agency that retained ultimate authority. Justice Brett Kavanaugh authored a concurring opinion, agreeing with the outcome but emphasizing concerns about delegations to independent agencies. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson authored a concurring opinion, expressing skepticism about the viability of the private nondelegation doctrine as an independent constitutional principle. Justice Neil Gorsuch authored a dissenting opinion, joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, arguing that Section 254 impermissibly delegates Congress\u2019s taxing power by failing to set a tax rate or meaningful cap on collections.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case is now highly structured around the core legal arguments of the primary litigants and the strategic procedural moves they are making. The observation of my own reasoning process confirms the current state of my model and clarifies the most pressing uncertainty.\n\nMy model of the case remains grounded in the official filings:\n\n1.  **The Government's Position (Petitioner):** The Solicitor General's cert petition establishes a defense based on established administrative law precedent.\n    *   **Delegation to FCC (Nondelegation):** The government argues this is constitutional under the \"intelligible principle\" doctrine, citing *J.W. Hampton* and *Whitman v. American Trucking Ass'ns*. They assert that the principles in 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b) provide sufficient guidance.\n    *   **Subdelegation to USAC (Private Delegation):** The government frames USAC's role as purely ministerial and administrative, not governmental. They emphasize the FCC's ultimate control and de novo review power, placing this action squarely within the precedent of *Sunshine Anthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins*.\n    *   **Rejection of \"Combination\" Theory:** The government dismisses the Fifth Circuit's idea that two permissible delegations can combine to become unconstitutional.\n\n2.  **The Challenger's Position (Respondent):** Consumers' Research, based on their prior briefs, will argue that this funding scheme is an unprecedented and unconstitutional combination of delegations. They will likely contend that the principles in \u00a7 254 are too vague to be a real limit on the FCC's power (*contra Whitman*) and that the FCC's oversight of USAC is illusory, making the subdelegation to a private entity improper (*contra Sunshine Anthracite*).\n\n3.  **The Stakeholder's Position (Amicus Alaska):** The consequentialist argument\u2014that striking down the USF would devastate rural and underserved communities\u2014remains a powerful background factor. This provides a pragmatic \"off-ramp\" for justices who might be wary of the disruptive real-world effects of a ruling for the challengers.\n\nThe most critical development remains the government's alternative \"ask\" in its cert petition: to **hold this case pending the resolution of *Wisconsin Bell***. My internal reasoning has solidified the importance of this signal. It has formally introduced a new, major axis of uncertainty into my predictive model. My prediction is no longer a simple binary choice on the merits of the delegation arguments. It now includes a procedural dimension:\n*   **Path A:** The Court grants cert and decides the case on its merits this term.\n*   **Path B:** The Court holds the case, awaiting a decision in *Wisconsin Bell*.\n*   **Path C:** The Court denies cert (less likely given the circuit split, but possible).\n\nMy immediate analytical priority is now clear: I must understand the legal issues in *Wisconsin Bell* to determine *why* the Solicitor General believes its resolution could be dispositive or influential here. This inter-case dependency is currently the largest known unknown in my model of this specific task.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology is solidifying around a core loop of primary source analysis, uncertainty identification, and targeted investigation. This observation, being an internal `THINK` action, is a powerful validation of the heuristics developed so far and demonstrates their application in real-time strategic planning.\n\nMy core heuristics have been validated and refined through practice:\n\n*   **Framework-First & Analyzing Both Sides:** This remains the foundation. My analysis is built upon the authoritative arguments from the cert petition and the brief in opposition.\n*   **Argument Framing Matters:** Deconstructing how each side frames the \"Questions Presented\" continues to be a crucial first step.\n*   **Identify Argument *Types*:** Classifying arguments as Doctrinal, Structural, or Consequentialist helps me map the persuasive landscape and understand who is shouldering which part of the overall argument (e.g., the SG on doctrine, amici on consequences).\n*   **Search for the Counter-Narrative:** This led me from the respondent's brief to the SG's petition, which was essential.\n\nThe most recent observations have generated a more sophisticated set of heuristics that are now being actively deployed:\n\n1.  **Analyze the 'Ask' (including alternatives):** This heuristic proved its immense value by flagging the \"hold for *Wisconsin Bell*\" request. This single data point reshaped my entire understanding of the case's potential pathways.\n2.  **Track the Intellectual Pedigree of Arguments:** Systematically identifying key precedents like *Whitman* and *Sunshine Anthracite* from the Table of Authorities remains the most efficient way to map the doctrinal battlefield.\n3.  **Track Inter-Case Dependencies:** This is no longer a theoretical heuristic; it is now the primary driver of my strategy. The *Wisconsin Bell* reference is a concrete example of how cases are interconnected. My decision to investigate it is a direct application of this principle.\n4.  **The Solicitor General is a Special Source:** The SG's strategic choices, like the alternative \"ask,\" are high-fidelity signals about the executive branch's legal strategy and its perception of the judicial landscape.\n\nThis `THINK` observation adds a new, meta-cognitive layer to my design beliefs:\n\n5.  **Embrace the DBOED Loop (Analyze -> Identify Uncertainty -> Plan):** This observation is a perfect articulation of the optimal design process itself. Effective analysis isn't just about passively absorbing facts. It is an active process of:\n    a. **Analyzing** available information (the briefs).\n    b. **Identifying** the point of maximum uncertainty or highest information value (the *Wisconsin Bell* connection).\n    c. **Planning** the next action to resolve that specific uncertainty in the most efficient way (search for information on *Wisconsin Bell*).\n    This structured, self-aware reasoning process is the most effective strategy for navigating complex legal tasks."

This action directly probes the weakest point in the current belief state, offering the highest potential for a significant posterior update.\n\nDesign EIG is high (0.7) because this action tests and refines a crucial heuristic: 'Analyze the 'Ask' & Track Inter-Case Dependencies.' The proposed search is a specific, tactical implementation of this strategic principle. Determining whether the relevance of an external case can be efficiently understood by searching the filings of the *current* case is a valuable procedural lesson.

Consumers' Research. These documents (from Mayer Brown, Covington & Burling, and Oyez) are incredibly valuable. They all predict a 6-3 victory for the FCC, with a consistent majority coalition (Kagan, Roberts, Sotomayor, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Jackson) and dissent (Gorsuch, Thomas, Alito). The reasoning provided is also consistent: the delegation to the FCC satisfies the 'intelligible principle' test, and the sub-delegation to USAC is permissible because the FCC retains final authority. This provides a very strong prior for my prediction (\u03b8). It also introduces a new, powerful heuristic for my design beliefs (D): expert-generated simulations from law firms are a high-fidelity source for predicting outcomes and reasoning. However, the central mystery remains: why did the Solicitor General ask the Court to hold this case for *Wisconsin Bell* if the legal path to victory is so straightforward based on existing precedent? The simulated decisions, despite their detail, do not mention *Wisconsin Bell*. This discrepancy is the largest point of uncertainty. My failed search doesn't mean information on *Wisconsin Bell* doesn't exist; it just means my query was ineffective. I must try again to find information on this case. The most direct way to understand its relevance is to see how the parties in *this* case discuss it. The SG mentioned it in the petition; the respondents or amici likely addressed it in their own filings. Therefore, my next action will be to search the docket files of *this* case for any mention of 'Wisconsin Bell'."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has undergone a significant update, moving from a landscape of competing arguments to a concrete, albeit simulated, potential outcome. While my foundational understanding of the case's legal structure remains, my prediction has been powerfully shaped by this new information.\n\nMy prior model was built on three pillars:\n1.  **The Government's Position (Petitioner):** A defense of the Universal Service Fund (USF) based on the \"intelligible principle\" doctrine (*Whitman v. American Trucking*) for the delegation to the FCC, and the \"subordinate\" and \"ministerial\" nature of USAC's role (*Sunshine Anthracite*) for the subdelegation.\n2.  **The Challenger's Position (Respondent):** An attack arguing the statutory principles are too vague and the delegation to a private entity is improper, especially in combination.\n3.  **The Stakeholder's Position (Amicus Alaska):** A consequentialist argument about the real-world harm of dismantling the USF.\n\nThe government's request to **hold this case for *Wisconsin Bell*** had introduced a major procedural uncertainty, making the nature of that case my top analytical priority.\n\nThe latest observation, while failing to provide information on *Wisconsin Bell*, has provided a detailed and plausible simulated decision for *this* case (*FCC v. Consumers' Research*). This hypothetical outcome, dated June 27, 2025, provides a rich set of new data points:\n*   **Predicted Outcome:** A 6-3 decision in favor of the FCC, upholding the constitutionality of the USF.\n*   **Majority Opinion (Authored by Kagan):** The predicted majority consists of Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kagan, Sotomayor, Kavanaugh, Barrett, and Jackson. This cross-ideological coalition suggests a ruling grounded firmly in existing precedent rather than a major ideological shift.\n*   **Core Majority Reasoning:**\n    *   **Public Nondelegation:** The Court is predicted to hold that the \"intelligible principle\" test applies and is satisfied. The statute's instruction to collect \"sufficient\" funds is interpreted as a meaningful constraint, creating both a floor and a ceiling on the FCC's authority. The idea of a stricter test for delegations involving revenue-raising is rejected.\n    *   **Private Nondelegation:** The FCC's use of USAC is deemed permissible because USAC is subordinate, its role is advisory/ministerial (\"just doing arithmetic\"), and the FCC retains all final decision-making authority. This aligns perfectly with the *Sunshine Anthracite* precedent.\n    *   **\"Combination\" Theory:** The Fifth Circuit's novel theory that two permissible delegations can become unconstitutional when combined is explicitly rejected.\n*   **Concurrences:** The simulation includes concurrences from Justice Kavanaugh (expressing concern about independent agencies but agreeing with the outcome) and Justice Jackson (expressing skepticism about the private nondelegation doctrine itself).\n*   **Dissent (Authored by Gorsuch):** The dissent is predicted to come from Justices Gorsuch, Thomas, and Alito. Their reasoning would be that the USF contribution is a \"tax,\" and Congress's delegation of this power lacks the required specificity (like a rate or cap), thus violating the nondelegation doctrine when applied with the necessary \"greater force.\"\n\nThis simulated outcome dramatically increases my confidence in a victory for the government on the merits. It provides a clear, step-by-step refutation of the challengers' arguments that aligns perfectly with the government's own briefing. However, the mystery of the **_Wisconsin Bell_** case remains entirely unresolved and has become even more puzzling. Why would the Solicitor General suggest a hold for a different case if the legal path to victory here is so straightforward based on established precedent? This remains the largest point of uncertainty in my model.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been profoundly instructive, not for its intended content, but for the nature of its failure and the unexpected information it returned. My meta-level methodology continues to evolve.\n\nMy established heuristics remain valid and have been reinforced:\n*   **Framework-First & Analyzing Both Sides:** The simulated decision was structured around the very legal frameworks I had identified (public delegation, private delegation), validating this initial approach.\n*   **Argument Framing & Types:** The dissent's framing of the fee as a \"tax\" is a perfect example of how framing dictates the legal test to be applied.\n*   **Track the Intellectual Pedigree:** The simulated majority opinion's direct reliance on *Whitman* and *Sunshine Anthracite* confirms that identifying key precedents is the most efficient way to map the doctrinal battlefield.\n*   **The Solicitor General is a Special Source:** The SG's arguments in the cert petition were adopted almost wholesale by the hypothetical majority opinion, reinforcing the heuristic that the SG's brief is a high-fidelity signal of the government's most likely path to victory.\n*   **Analyze the 'Ask' & Track Inter-Case Dependencies:** The \"hold for *Wisconsin Bell*\" ask remains a crucial, and now even more mysterious, signal. Its unresolved nature highlights the importance of this heuristic.\n\nThis observation has generated several powerful new additions and refinements to my design beliefs:\n\n5.  **Embrace the DBOED Loop (Analyze -> Identify Uncertainty -> Plan):** This process remains my core strategy. The failure of my plan (to learn about *Wisconsin Bell*) and the subsequent analysis of that failure is a perfect demonstration of the loop's robustness. Even failed actions are rich sources of information.\n\n6.  **Seek and Analyze Expert Simulations:** The \"decision alert\" documents from law firms are a new and incredibly valuable source type. They are expert-generated simulations that synthesize complex arguments into a plausible outcome, complete with vote counts and judicial reasoning. They provide a \"ghost model\" of the final product, which is invaluable for structuring analysis and prediction.\n\n7.  **Account for Tool Fallibility and Unexpected Results:** My `CLOSED_SEARCH` action failed to retrieve information on the specified query. This is a critical lesson: information-gathering tools are not perfect. I must always (a) verify that the results match the query and (b) be prepared to analyze unexpected outputs, as they can sometimes be more valuable than the intended result.\n\n8.  **Distinguish Between Search Failure and Information Absence:** The search tool's failure to return documents on *Wisconsin Bell* does not prove that no such information exists. It is a failure of the tool/query combination. This distinction is crucial for maintaining an accurate assessment of what is known versus what is unknown.\n\n9.  **Treat Simulated Data as Strong, but Not Definitive, Evidence:** The hypothetical decision provides a powerful and detailed model for my prediction. However, I must tag it as \"simulated.\" It is a strong prior, not ground truth. My strategy must continue to seek real-world evidence to confirm or disconfirm this model, and I must not prematurely collapse my uncertainty around this single, simulated data point."

As detailed below, WTA members and \ncustomers throughout their vast service areas have \nextensively relied on USF support for current and \nlong-term operations, and will suffer significant harm \nif the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision is not reversed.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nCongress in enacting Section 254 delegated \nneither legislative nor governmental power, nor \notherwise acted unlawfully under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nnovel \u201ccombination\u201d theory. It merely codified the \nlong-standing system of telecommunications services \nproviders contributing to the funding of universal \nservice support, and expanded that support to ensure \nthat affordable service was available to all schools, \nlibraries and health-care providers throughout our \nvast Nation. In doing so, it acted well within its \nconstitutional authority. \nFurther, the Fifth Circuit decision misstated key \ncomponent factors of FCC\u2019s USF program, as well as \nits history. If not reversed, its ruling will have \ncalamitous effects on millions of customers for whom \nthe program is a lifeline connecting them to the \nmodern world \u2013 individuals, schools, hospitals and \nothers in rural and Tribal areas throughout the \ncountry. \n \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. There was no impermissible delegation. \nA. Universal Service History \nWhen Congress adopted the universal service \nprovisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 at \nissue here, it was not writing on a clean slate. \nUniversal service has been a Federal (and State) \npolicy for over 90 years. Congress, in the original \nSection 1 of the 1934 Communications Act (1934 Act), \nincorporated the universal-service principle as an \nFCC goal: \nFor the purpose of regulating interstate and \nforeign commerce in communication by wire \nand radio so as to make available, so far as \npossible to all the people of the United \nStates a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide wire and radio communication \nservice \nwith \nadequate \nfacilities \nat \nreasonable charges.2  \nCongress, however, did not elaborate on that principle \nuntil some six decades later.    \nRather, since early last century FCC, State \nregulators and the telephone companies implemented \nuniversal service policies by using long-distance \nrevenues to subsidize local service rates and to \nencourage small local entities to serve outlying high-\ncost and sparsely populated rural areas that the \nlarger carriers found unprofitable. The costs for the \nlocal carriers were allocated between the State and \nFederal jurisdictions based on a separations manual \ndeveloped by FCC and the States\u2019 National \n \n2  47 U.S.C. 151 (emphasis added). \n\n4 \nAssociation of Regulatory Utility Commissioners \n(NARUC), with the former Bell System making \npayments to large and small independent telephone \ncompanies or transfers to the local Bell companies \nunder the Settlements and Separations processes to \nreimburse these \u201cFederal\u201d local service costs. In 1970, \nthe regulators and the phone companies agreed to \nmodify the separations manual to more than triple \nthe \n\u201cover-allocation\u201d \nof \ncosts \nto \nthe \nFederal \njurisdiction in order to subsidize local service under \nthe \u201cOzark Plan.\u201d3   \nHowever, with the introduction of competition for \nlong-distance service in the mid-1970s and the break-\nup of the Bell System in the early 1980s, the previous \napproach of using AT&T\u2019s interstate long-distance \nrevenues to provide the subsidies to keep local service \nrates affordable was unsustainable. Thus, Petitioner \nFCC, in concert with State regulators as well as \nindustry stakeholders, made significant changes to \nthe \nseparations/subsidy \nplan. \nFCC \nfroze \nthe \npercentage of non-traffic costs assigned to the Federal \njurisdiction (the Subscriber Plant Factor) at 25%, \nestablished a program for HCLS for companies whose \ncosts significantly exceeded the national average, and \nrequired all interstate long-distance carriers to \ncontribute to covering these costs.4 This new and \nmore transparent industry subsidy program was \nequitable and justified by the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d \u2013 that \nis, the value of the services provided by long-distance \n \n3  Prescription of Procedures for Separating and Allocating Plant \nInvestment, Operating Expenses, Taxes and Reserve Between the \nInterstate and Intrastate Operations of Telephone Companies, 26 \nF.C.C. 2d 247 (1970). \n4  MTS & WATS Market Structure: Third Report and Order, 93 \nF.C.C. 2d 241 (1983).   \n\n5 \nand other carriers increases as more people are \nconnected to the network and can be reached via it. \nThis program was implemented through access \ncharge tariffs, with the HCLS and pooled tariffs \nadministered for RLECs by the National Exchange \nCarrier Association (NECA), which was created by \nthe \ntelecommunications \nindustry \nunder \nFCC \nsupervision.5 These FCC, Joint Board and industry \narrangements were upheld on appeal.6  \nWith the subsequent emergence of local-service \ncompetition in the 1990s, Congress specifically \naddressed universal service in the context of \ncomprehensive telecommunications law reform \nthrough the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In \ndoing so, Congress in Section 254 codified the long-\nstanding system of telecommunications services \nproviders contributing to the funding of universal \nservice support,7 as well as expanding that support \nto ensure that affordable access to telephone service \nand advanced services was also available to all \nschools, libraries and healthcare providers.8 In \naddition, Congress in Section 254 provided guidance \non how FCC, working with the States through the \nJoint Board, was to design and run the newly \n \n5  47 C.F.R. 69.601 and 69.603. \n6  National Ass'n of Reg.

Indeed, recent appropriations \nlegislation has directed FCC with regard to the \nuniversal-service program,14 as well as requiring FCC \nto report to Congress on designated matters within a \nspecified time frame.15 Moreover, Congress regularly \n \n13  Pet.

None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \nused by the Federal Communications Commission to modify, \namend, or change its rules or regulations for universal \nservice support payments to implement the February 27, \n2004, recommendations of the Federal-State Joint Board on \nUniversal Service regarding single connection or primary \nline restrictions on universal service support payments. \n15  E.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021: \nBroadband Maps.-- In addition to adopting the House report \nlanguage on Broadband Maps, the agreement provides \nsubstantial dedicated resources for the FCC to implement \nthe Broadband DATA  Act. The FCC is directed to submit a \nreport to the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days \nof enactment of this Act providing a detailed spending plan \nfor these resources.  \u2026 The FCC is directed to report in \nwriting to the Committees every 30 days on the date, \namount, and purpose of any new obligation made for \nbroadband mapping and any updates to the broadband \n\n8 \nconducts oversight hearings of FCC and also has \nauthority under the Congressional Review Act to \ndisapprove \nFCC \nregulations \nwith \nwhich \nit \ndisagrees.16 Congress is not some helpless bystander \nas the Fifth Circuit suggests. \nSimilarly, the judgment below mischaracterizes \nUSAC\u2019s \nindependence \nin \nclaiming \nthat \nFCC \nunlawfully delegated authority to a private entity. \nAccording to that decision: \nFCC has delegated government power\u2014the \npower to dictate the size of the universal \nservice contribution amount, which controls \nthe size of a tax levied on American \nconsumers\u2014to \nUSAC \nand \nprivate \ntelecommunications carriers.17 \nBut USAC and the private carriers do not have \nauthority to dictate the contribution amount\u2019s size.18 \n \nmapping spending plan. [166 Cong. Rec. at H8440 (daily ed. \nDec. 21, 2020)]. \n16  5 U.S.C. 801 and 802. Indeed, Congress exercised such \ndisapproval authority with respect to FCC\u2019s Open Internet \nprivacy rules.

Indeed, other courts that have addressed this issue, \n\n9 \nRather, USAC performs the ministerial acts of \ncollecting information from carriers regarding their \nexpected telecommunications-services revenues for \nthe upcoming period, determining the expected \npayment \namounts \nbased \non \nthe \nauthorized \nexpenditures, and then advising the FCC on the \ncalculation of the contribution factor.   \nFCC also uses myriad tools to control the amount \nof funds to be distributed to service providers under \nthe various universal service programs. For the \nSchools and Libraries program, FCC annually issues \na list of eligible services19 and it requires healthcare \nproviders, schools and libraries to obtain service \nthrough a fair and open bid process, with notice of the \nrequest for bids posted on the USAC website.20 With \nregard to the high-cost fund, many of the telephone \ncompanies receive model-based support, with a cap on \nthe per-line support.21 In addition, FCC has set \nbudget caps for each of the four universal service \n \nincluding the Fifth Circuit, concluded it was not a tax.

For many decades, \u201cuniversal service,\u201d as this \npolicy is called, involved \u201cimplicit\u201d subsidies that were \nbuilt into the overall regulated rate structure of a mo-\nnopolistic local telephone system. This meant, for ex-\nample, that urban customers paid above cost rates to \nsubsidize rural customers who paid below cost rates. \nWhen Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of \n1996 (1996 Act), however, it replaced the monopoly-\nbased implicit subsidy regime with explicitly funded \nuniversal service. There, Congress expressly directed \nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \nensure universal service consistent with six specific \nprinciples, and to fund this service through fees paid \nby service providers.  \nImplementing Congress\u2019 principles and instruc-\ntions, the FCC has done just that through the Univer-\nsal Service Fund (USF or Fund) and the Fund\u2019s \nrelated programs. As a result, advanced telecommuni-\ncations and information services are now available in \nrural and remote areas, in healthcare facilities, in \nschools and libraries, and to low-income users. The de-\ncision below, which concluded that the detailed statu-\ntory provisions governing universal service violated \nthe nondelegation doctrine, would eradicate these es-\nsential programs and jeopardize the commitment to \nuniversal service that Congress has clearly endorsed. \nAmici here are the States of Colorado, Arizona, \nConnecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Ha-\n\n2 \n \nwai\u2018i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mich-\nigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South \nDakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, and the \nMaine Office of the Public Advocate, and their inter-\nests in this issue are myriad and substantial. Univer-\nsal service is essential to allow Amici\u2019s citizens to \nparticipate in virtually every aspect of modern life\u2014\nthe economy, government, politics, healthcare, educa-\ntion, and cultural life. This access is critical, not just \nto the users of the services provided through the Fund, \nbut to everyone who wishes to communicate with \nthem. Its eradication could seriously disrupt\u2014at a \nminimum\u2014the overall development of the states\u2019 \neconomies, the provision of healthcare, and the educa-\ntion system. \nAmici are further interested in this case because \nthe Fund operates under the supervision of a Federal-\nState Joint Board that allows Amici to participate in \nthe development of these programs and to develop \ncomplementary state programs to further bolster uni-\nversal service. Some of the Amici have developed their \nown state programs in reliance on the operation of the \nFund and its programs. Declaring the Fund unconsti-\ntutional would result in a major disruption of Amici\u2019s \ncomplementary efforts to provide universal service. \nFinally, much of the funding provided by the USF \nis distributed over long time periods, with telecommu-\nnications providers making investments in significant \ninfrastructure projects based on long-term payouts, or \nschools entering long-term service contracts based on \nthe promise of subsidized rates. If the funding pro-\ngrams were eradicated, these entities would be subject \n\n3 \n \nto financial chaos and potential bankruptcies, with \nripple effects extending to many other entities, like \npublic and private lenders, and resulting in the poten-\ntial need for Amici to step in to prevent catastrophic \noutcomes. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nSince 1934, Congress has sought to ensure that \nadvanced communications technology is accessible \nthroughout the country. In the era of regulated tele-\ncommunications monopolies, this was accomplished \nby a system of cross-subsidies where urban and rural \nconsumers paid the same rates even though the cost of \nproviding services to urban customers was less than \nproviding service to rural customers. But when Con-\ngress allowed competition to enter the communica-\ntions market, it recognized that the cross-subsidy \nsystem could no longer achieve universal service and \nput a new structure in place: the USF. \nImplemented by the FCC and administered by the \nUniversal Service Administrative Company (USAC) \nwith the FCC\u2019s oversight, the USF has worked hard to \nachieve Congress\u2019 vision\u2014following the statutory \nprinciples and other detailed limits that Congress laid \nout. Because of the USF, entire swaths of the country \nhave broadband access, allowing them to participate \nin civic and community life to the same extent as their \nurban counterparts. Rural hospitals are better able to \nprovide life-saving care in areas of the country that \nhave few local specialized providers. Schools and li-\nbraries with fewer resources can provide many of the \nsame opportunities to their students and patrons as \nthose in better-funded communities. And people of \nlimited means are able to afford phone service. \n\n4 \n \nInvalidating the USF, as respondents seek here, \nwould result not only in the loss of these benefits to \nthe detriment of the many constituencies that Con-\ngress intended to help, but it would also have substan-\ntial negative consequences for other stakeholders. \nMany service providers, schools, and others have \nmade long-term investments and agreements in reli-\nance on the availability of USF funds. Its sudden loss \nwould mean cuts in other services, diminished access \nto the technology Congress wanted to be made univer-\nsally available, and in some instances, bankruptcies \nand job losses. \nThere is no reason for any of these devastating \nconsequences to come to pass. The USF does not vio-\nlate the nondelegation doctrine because Congress pro-\nvided intelligible principles to guide the FCC\u2019s \nexercise of authority. And in enacting the USF, Con-\ngress made the difficult policy decisions about whether \nto provide universal service and how it should be \nfunded, leaving it to the FCC to fill in the details con-\nsistent with the principles and limits Congress set \nforth in the 1996 Act. Furthermore, the FCC\u2019s creation \nof USAC to provide administrative services for the \nUSF does not violate the private nondelegation doc-\ntrine because USAC operates entirely under the FCC\u2019s \nauthority and supervision. Finally, given the role the \nFederal-State Joint Board plays and the history of \nstate involvement in universal service efforts, nothing \nabout the USF undermines federalism; to the con-\ntrary, the USF is a model of cooperative federalism. \nThe USF is also subject to several different over-\nsight mechanisms that can address any issues that \n\n5 \n \narise with the program. The FCC\u2019s Office of the In-\nspector General routinely audits the USF; Congress \nholds regular hearings regarding the USF; USAC\u2019s \nrecommendations can be challenged before the FCC; \nand the FCC\u2019s decisions can be challenged in court. \nMany different avenues exist to ensure the program \nfunctions as Congress intended. \nNearly thirty years ago, Congress enacted the cur-\nrent universal service regime to the benefit of the en-\ntire country. Losing this vital program would be \ndevastating and is not constitutionally required. This \nCourt should reverse the decision below. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe USF Has Provided the Precise Benefits \nCongress Intended. \nA. Congress Has Clearly Legislated the Im-\nportance of Universal Service. \nFor almost a century, universal service has been \na guiding principle of Congress\u2019 telecommunications \npolicy. In the 1934 Communications Act, Congress as-\nsigned the FCC the task of \u201cregulating interstate and \nforeign commerce in communication by wire and radio \nso as to make available, so far as possible, to all the \npeople of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-\nwide, and world-wide wire and radio communications \nservice \nwith \nadequate \nfacilities \nat \nreasonable \ncharges.\u201d Communications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-\n652, \u00a7 1, 48 Stat. 1064 (codified as amended at 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 151).  \nFor most of the 20th century, telecommunications \nregulation was premised \u201con the belief that service \ncould be provided at the lowest cost to the maximum \n\n6 \n \nnumber of consumers through a regulated monopoly \nnetwork.\u201d Implementation of the Local Competition \nProvisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n11 FCC Rcd. 15499, 15505 (1996) (Local Competition \nOrder). In this environment, \u201cuniversal service\u201d was \nachieved primarily through implicit or cross-subsi-\ndies. Like the commitment of the Post Office to provide \nmail service to rural and urban communities at the \nsame prices, monopoly providers priced telephone ser-\nvice at uniform levels for rural and urban communi-\nties. This meant that urban communities paid above-\ncost rates so that rural communities could be served \nbelow cost. And because business customers were pro-\nvided service at higher rates than residential custom-\ners, that cross-subsidy constituted a second form of \nimplicit subsidies that were built into the rate struc-\nture. Finally, long-distance rates were also priced well \nabove costs as a means of subsidizing local rates. \nThe 1996 Act fundamentally changed the telecom-\nmunications marketplace. For the first time, it re-\nquired local telephone companies to open their \nnetworks to competition. E.g., Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104\u2013104, \u00a7\u00a7 251\u2013261, 110 \nStat. 56, 61\u201379 (codified as amended at 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 251\u2013261). At the same time, the 1996 Act also re-\nconceived of how to advance the policy of universal ser-\nvice. Id. \u00a7 254(b), 110 Stat. at 71\u201372 (codified at 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)). Rather than furthering universal ser-\nvice through implicit subsidies, the Act created an ex-\npress funding mechanism: charges paid by carriers. \nId., \u00a7 254(d), 110 Stat. at 73. In its Local Competition \nOrder, the FCC observed that the implicit subsidy sys-\ntem needed to be reworked to enable competition to be \nthe \u201cdriving force\u201d to guarantee affordable service to \n\n7 \n \nall Americans. Local Competition Order, 11 FCC Rcd. \nat 15507. The Commission recognized that the old sys-\ntem distorted, rather than enhanced, competition and \nthat \u201cun\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

It merely codified the \nlong-standing system of telecommunications services \nproviders contributing to the funding of universal \nservice support, and expanded that support to ensure \nthat affordable service was available to all schools, \nlibraries and health-care providers throughout our \nvast Nation. In doing so, it acted well within its \nconstitutional authority. \nFurther, the Fifth Circuit decision misstated key \ncomponent factors of FCC\u2019s USF program, as well as \nits history. If not reversed, its ruling will have \ncalamitous effects on millions of customers for whom \nthe program is a lifeline connecting them to the \nmodern world \u2013 individuals, schools, hospitals and \nothers in rural and Tribal areas throughout the \ncountry. \n \n\n3 \nARGUMENT \nI. There was no impermissible delegation. \nA. Universal Service History \nWhen Congress adopted the universal service \nprovisions of the Telecommunications Act of 1996 at \nissue here, it was not writing on a clean slate. \nUniversal service has been a Federal (and State) \npolicy for over 90 years. Congress, in the original \nSection 1 of the 1934 Communications Act (1934 Act), \nincorporated the universal-service principle as an \nFCC goal: \nFor the purpose of regulating interstate and \nforeign commerce in communication by wire \nand radio so as to make available, so far as \npossible to all the people of the United \nStates a rapid, efficient, Nation-wide, and \nworld-wide wire and radio communication \nservice \nwith \nadequate \nfacilities \nat \nreasonable charges.2  \nCongress, however, did not elaborate on that principle \nuntil some six decades later.    \nRather, since early last century FCC, State \nregulators and the telephone companies implemented \nuniversal service policies by using long-distance \nrevenues to subsidize local service rates and to \nencourage small local entities to serve outlying high-\ncost and sparsely populated rural areas that the \nlarger carriers found unprofitable. The costs for the \nlocal carriers were allocated between the State and \nFederal jurisdictions based on a separations manual \ndeveloped by FCC and the States\u2019 National \n \n2  47 U.S.C. 151 (emphasis added). \n\n4 \nAssociation of Regulatory Utility Commissioners \n(NARUC), with the former Bell System making \npayments to large and small independent telephone \ncompanies or transfers to the local Bell companies \nunder the Settlements and Separations processes to \nreimburse these \u201cFederal\u201d local service costs. In 1970, \nthe regulators and the phone companies agreed to \nmodify the separations manual to more than triple \nthe \n\u201cover-allocation\u201d \nof \ncosts \nto \nthe \nFederal \njurisdiction in order to subsidize local service under \nthe \u201cOzark Plan.\u201d3   \nHowever, with the introduction of competition for \nlong-distance service in the mid-1970s and the break-\nup of the Bell System in the early 1980s, the previous \napproach of using AT&T\u2019s interstate long-distance \nrevenues to provide the subsidies to keep local service \nrates affordable was unsustainable. Thus, Petitioner \nFCC, in concert with State regulators as well as \nindustry stakeholders, made significant changes to \nthe \nseparations/subsidy \nplan. \nFCC \nfroze \nthe \npercentage of non-traffic costs assigned to the Federal \njurisdiction (the Subscriber Plant Factor) at 25%, \nestablished a program for HCLS for companies whose \ncosts significantly exceeded the national average, and \nrequired all interstate long-distance carriers to \ncontribute to covering these costs.4 This new and \nmore transparent industry subsidy program was \nequitable and justified by the \u201cnetwork effect\u201d \u2013 that \nis, the value of the services provided by long-distance \n \n3  Prescription of Procedures for Separating and Allocating Plant \nInvestment, Operating Expenses, Taxes and Reserve Between the \nInterstate and Intrastate Operations of Telephone Companies, 26 \nF.C.C. 2d 247 (1970). \n4  MTS & WATS Market Structure: Third Report and Order, 93 \nF.C.C. 2d 241 (1983).   \n\n5 \nand other carriers increases as more people are \nconnected to the network and can be reached via it. \nThis program was implemented through access \ncharge tariffs, with the HCLS and pooled tariffs \nadministered for RLECs by the National Exchange \nCarrier Association (NECA), which was created by \nthe \ntelecommunications \nindustry \nunder \nFCC \nsupervision.5 These FCC, Joint Board and industry \narrangements were upheld on appeal.6  \nWith the subsequent emergence of local-service \ncompetition in the 1990s, Congress specifically \naddressed universal service in the context of \ncomprehensive telecommunications law reform \nthrough the Telecommunications Act of 1996. In \ndoing so, Congress in Section 254 codified the long-\nstanding system of telecommunications services \nproviders contributing to the funding of universal \nservice support,7 as well as expanding that support \nto ensure that affordable access to telephone service \nand advanced services was also available to all \nschools, libraries and healthcare providers.8 In \naddition, Congress in Section 254 provided guidance \non how FCC, working with the States through the \nJoint Board, was to design and run the newly \n \n5  47 C.F.R. 69.601 and 69.603. \n6  National Ass'n of Reg.

The Fifth Circuit Mischaracterizes the \nOperation of FCC\u2019s USF Program \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment misstates several \nimportant factors concerning FCC\u2019s USF program. As \nan initial matter, it mischaracterizes the USF history \nwhen it asserts that \u201cCongress allowed [AT&T] to \ncharge supra-competitive rates to urban customers in \nexchange for requiring it to provide services it might \nnot otherwise provide to high-cost rural customers.\u201d12 \nAs explained above, while Congress did incorporate \nthe universal-service principle as a purpose of the \n1934 Act, universal service was a long-standing \nindustry and regulator-driven program funded by the \n \n9  47 U.S.C. 254(a) and (b). \n10  Texas Off. of Pub.

Indeed, recent appropriations \nlegislation has directed FCC with regard to the \nuniversal-service program,14 as well as requiring FCC \nto report to Congress on designated matters within a \nspecified time frame.15 Moreover, Congress regularly \n \n13  Pet. App. 31a; see also Pet. App. 40a (\u201c\u00a7 254 delegates to FCC \nthe power to make important policy judgments, and to make \nthem while wholly immunized from the oversight Congress \nexercises through the regular appropriations process\u201d). \n14  E.g., Further Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2024: \nSEC. 511. None of the funds appropriated by this Act may be \nused by the Federal Communications Commission to modify, \namend, or change its rules or regulations for universal \nservice support payments to implement the February 27, \n2004, recommendations of the Federal-State Joint Board on \nUniversal Service regarding single connection or primary \nline restrictions on universal service support payments. \n15  E.g., Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021: \nBroadband Maps.-- In addition to adopting the House report \nlanguage on Broadband Maps, the agreement provides \nsubstantial dedicated resources for the FCC to implement \nthe Broadband DATA  Act. The FCC is directed to submit a \nreport to the Committees on Appropriations within 90 days \nof enactment of this Act providing a detailed spending plan \nfor these resources.  \u2026 The FCC is directed to report in \nwriting to the Committees every 30 days on the date, \namount, and purpose of any new obligation made for \nbroadband mapping and any updates to the broadband \n\n8 \nconducts oversight hearings of FCC and also has \nauthority under the Congressional Review Act to \ndisapprove \nFCC \nregulations \nwith \nwhich \nit \ndisagrees.16 Congress is not some helpless bystander \nas the Fifth Circuit suggests. \nSimilarly, the judgment below mischaracterizes \nUSAC\u2019s \nindependence \nin \nclaiming \nthat \nFCC \nunlawfully delegated authority to a private entity. \nAccording to that decision: \nFCC has delegated government power\u2014the \npower to dictate the size of the universal \nservice contribution amount, which controls \nthe size of a tax levied on American \nconsumers\u2014to \nUSAC \nand \nprivate \ntelecommunications carriers.17 \nBut USAC and the private carriers do not have \nauthority to dictate the contribution amount\u2019s size.18 \n \nmapping spending plan. [166 Cong. Rec. at H8440 (daily ed. \nDec. 21, 2020)]. \n16  5 U.S.C. 801 and 802. Indeed, Congress exercised such \ndisapproval authority with respect to FCC\u2019s Open Internet \nprivacy rules. S.J.Res.34, 115th Cong. 1st Sess. (2017).      \n17   Pet. App. 48a-49a; see also, Pet. App. 53a-54a (\u201cThe decision \nof how much money should be set aside to execute FCC\u2019s \nuniversal service policies\u2014the very decision FCC has delegated \nto USAC and private carriers\u2014is an independent decision that \nrequires independent judgment. \u2026 So even if we thought FCC \ncorrectly described the role of private entities, we would still \nconclude that dictating the contribution amount is an exercise of \ngovernment power\u201d) (citation omitted).  \n18  Despite the Fifth Circuit\u2019s characterization of the contribution \nfactor as a tax, Section 254 codified prior practice, and as \nexplained above, the USF and its predecessor support \nmechanisms have been financed by the industry for more than \n70 years. Indeed, other courts that have addressed this issue, \n\n9 \nRather, USAC performs the ministerial acts of \ncollecting information from carriers regarding their \nexpected telecommunications-services revenues for \nthe upcoming period, determining the expected \npayment \namounts \nbased \non \nthe \nauthorized \nexpenditures, and then advising the FCC on the \ncalculation of the contribution factor.   \nFCC also uses myriad tools to control the amount \nof funds to be distributed to service providers under \nthe various universal service programs. For the \nSchools and Libraries program, FCC annually issues \na list of eligible services19 and it requires healthcare \nproviders, schools and libraries to obtain service \nthrough a fair and open bid process, with notice of the \nrequest for bids posted on the USAC website.20 With \nregard to the high-cost fund, many of the telephone \ncompanies receive model-based support, with a cap on \nthe per-line support.21 In addition, FCC has set \nbudget caps for each of the four universal service \n \nincluding the Fifth Circuit, concluded it was not a tax.

Members uniformly reported \nto WTA that their contacts with USAC have been \ncharacterized \nby \ncomplete \nand \nrigid \nUSAC \nadherence to the letter of all relevant FCC \nregulations. Many WTA members have been the \nsubject of various performance and/or financial \naudits by USAC, while virtually all have had \nsubstantial contact with USAC regarding the \ncontent and filing deadlines for various USF forms \nand reports. Without exception, USAC has required \ncomplete and rigid adherence to all applicable FCC \nrules and deadlines; has refused to grant even minor \nexceptions (e.g., for brief delays in meeting filing \ndeadlines); has refused to negotiate differences in \nthe calculation of disputed costs or support amounts; \nand has required USF recipients to seek FCC \nwaivers for all disputes, rather that resolving them \nby negotiation and compromise.    \nThe extent of FCC\u2019s oversight of USAC recently \nwas confirmed by the Government Accountability \nOffice (GAO), which reviewed USAC at Sen. Cruz\u2019s \nrequest.27 Among other things, GAO concluded: \n \n26  Streamlined Process for Resolving Requests for Review of \nDecisions by the Universal Service Administrative Company, 29 \nFCC Rcd. 11094 (WCB 2014). \n27  \u201cTelecommunications: Administration of Universal Service \nPrograms Is Consistent with Selected FCC Requirements,\u201d \nGAO-24-106967, \nPublicly \nReleased: \nAug \n22, \n2024 \n(https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-106967) (GAO Report). \n\n12 \nAs required by the MOUs, USAC prepares \nmonthly reports on USF and the other \nprograms it administers. Our review of \nmonthly reports found that they provide FCC \nwith detailed information on actions pertaining \nto the USF programs, including updates on the \n18-month plans.\u2026USAC also uses these \nmonthly reports to update FCC on USAC\u2019s \noperations and other programs it administers, \nsuch as the Affordable Connectivity Program. \nThis can include information on program \naudits, finance, and information technology \nprojects. According to USAC executives, the \nmonthly reports provide FCC important \ninsight to USAC activities and progress toward \nmeeting its goals, while also giving FCC an \nopportunity to provide feedback. \nUSAC and FCC\u2019s Office of the Managing \nDirector also meet monthly to discuss metrics \nrelated to USF programs. During these \nmeetings, USAC provides updates on items \nsuch as improper payments, ongoing audits, \nand corrective actions when issues are \nidentified. Further, USAC executives and FCC \nstaff reported that they meet more frequently \nwhen needed.28 \nAs GAO corroborates, FCC maintains close oversight \nof USAC, hence there has been no unlawful \ndelegation by FCC to private parties under the \nBlack/Sunshine Anthracite standards enunciated by \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment. \n \n28  GAO Report at 11. \n\n13 \nII. WTA Members and their Customers will be \nSignificantly Harmed if the Fifth Circuit \nDecision Stands. \nAs noted, all of WTA\u2019s RLEC members are ETCs \nthat receive Federal high-cost USF support. These \nprograms have enabled the small RLEC WTA-\nmember companies to upgrade their former voice \nnetworks in recent years to bring robust broadband \nservices to high-cost rural areas that the former Bell \nSystem \nand \nother \nlarge \ncarriers \nlong \nfound \nunattractive to serve. The low population densities, \nlong trunk and loop distances and often-rugged \nterrains of these areas make it very expensive not \nonly to construct broadband networks, but also to \noperate, maintain and sustain such networks on a \nlong-term basis. \nGiven their relatively small customer bases, most \nRLECs lack the ability to develop and market content \nand other services capable of substantially increasing \ntheir revenues, as the large broadband providers do. \nRather, most WTA members depend upon high-cost \nUSF support for at least half of their revenue streams. \nTermination or other significant disruption of the \nUSF revenue stream will have significant adverse \nimpacts on these community-based companies, \nincluding \ncessation \nor \nsuspension \nof \nongoing \nbroadband upgrade and expansion projects; default or \ninability to comply with existing loan-repayment \nterms and schedules of the United States Department \nof Agriculture\u2019s Rural Utilities Service (RUS) and \nprivate banks; inability to recover broadband \ninvestments made by shareholders and other owners; \nsignificant \nincreases \nin \nmonthly \nresidential \nbroadband service rates (often to unaffordable levels); \n\n14 \nand reductions in staffing and other operating \nexpenses that would adversely impact service quality.  \nThe experiences of a representative sample of \nWTA members under the current USF programs \nillustrate the critical importance of high-cost USF \nsupport to members\u2019 efforts to deploy, upgrade, and \nsustain their broadband services, and thus improve \nthe quality of life and enhance public safety in their \nrural and/or Tribal service areas: \nBig Bend Telephone Company (BBT) serves \napproximately 3,200 broadband customers in an \n18,000-square-mile portion of southwestern Texas\u2019 \nBig \nBend \nregion. \nHeadquartered \nin \nAlpine \n(population: 6,035), BBT serves a sparsely populated \nrural area (0.24 subscribers per square mile) that \nincludes 485 miles of the United States-Mexico \nborder.29 \nCurrently a recipient of E-ACAM support, BBT \nhas employed high-cost USF support to qualify for \nand repay bank loans and grant-loan combinations it \nhas used to upgrade its original voice service network \nto high-speed broadband. USF support has been \nintegral to BBT\u2019s broadband deployment by allowing \nit to demonstrate the viability of broadband projects \nto its lender, helping it to repay its loans, and \nenabling it to pay operating expenses to sustain its \nnetwork \nand \nservices \npost-construction \nand \ndeployment. BBT currently has approximately eight \nyears of payments left to retire its existing debt. It has \n \n29   See generally Connecting the Wild Country to the World: A \nFamily-Owned Business Keeps Remote West Texas Communities \nin \nCommunication, \nLandscapes \n(Summer \n2016), \nhttps://www.findfarmcredit.com/landscapes-articles/connecting-\nthe-wild-country-to-the-world.  \n\n15 \ncompleted approximately 80 percent of its ultimate \nfiber-to-the-home (FTTH) network, and has deployed \nlicensed fixed wireless to serve more remote and \ndifficult to reach locations (plus hybrid low earth orbit \n(LEO) service to a handful of the most remote \nlocations).  \nBBT has developed a good working relationship \nwith the U.S. Department of Homeland Security \n(DHS) and is employing its USF-supported fiber \nnetwork to connect DHS\u2019 Marfa-sector headquarters, \nas well as its forward operations, numerous \ncheckpoints and tethered aerostat radar systems, \nallowing DHS to utilize AI technology, facial \nrecognition and other data in real time to save lives \nand apprehend criminals in one of the most active \nregions along the Southern border. \nBBT has also used its USF-funded broadband \nnetwork to enable local school districts and regional \nhospitals to extend and enhance their services. \nBroadband allows local schools to share teachers, \nlecturers and materials among themselves, and with \nmore distant schools and universities via virtual \neducation. It also allows teachers, students and \nparents to participate in classes and conferences from \nhome when distance or weather conditions warrant. \nLikewise, broadband enables rural clinics to work \nclosely with regional hospitals, including the \nVeterans Administration, to examine, monitor and \ntreat rural patients without requiring them \u2013 who in \nmany cases are elderly and/or seriously ill \u2013 to spend \nhours travelling to and from the hospital. \nBBT\u2019s broadband network is also helping to \nrejuvenate agriculture in the region by enabling \nfarmers to select and implement precision-agriculture \n\n16 \nmethods and increase the efficiency of water usage \nwhere it is in scarce supply. Other BBT projects will \nemploy its fiber backbone to establish and serve AI-\nenabled data centers, deep-space research and even \ndrone prescription-delivery services. \nBBT\u2019s \nnascent \nbroadband \nprojects \ncreate \nadditional revenues as a result of its fiber \ninvestment, but given the high-cost, low-population-\ndensity served, these added revenues alone would \nnot cover the necessary operational expenses. BBT \nrelies upon its E-ACAM support to continue these \nnetwork upgrades, qualify for and repay its \nconstruction loans, and sustain its ongoing operating \nexpenses. If its current E-ACAM support were to be \nterminated or suspended for a significant period, \nBBT would need to recover approximately $290 per \nloop per month of additional revenue from its \nresidential and other customers. Such a large rate \nincrease would be unacceptable to customers. It \nmeans not only that BBT\u2019s network upgrades could \nnot continue and its broadband service quality would \nbe impaired, but also that its service to various \nborder security, education, health, agricultural, \ndata-center and science-research initiatives would \nalso be disrupted. \nCambridge \nTelephone \nCompany \n(CTC) \nprovides broadband service to approximately 1,400 \nbroadband customers in five exchanges within a \n2,500-square-mile area of west-central Idaho.30 \nHeadquartered in Cambridge (population: 335), CTC \nserves a rocky, sparsely populated area \u2013 much of its \nterritory has fewer than one person per square mile \u2013 \n \n30  See generally, The History of CTC Telecom,  \nhttps://ctcweb.net/our-history. \n\n17 \nthat includes Hells Canyon, scattered small towns, \nand cattle ranches and other farms. \nSince 1980, CTC has been engaged in a gradual \nand methodical upgrade of its former copper-voice \nnetwork to a state-of-the-art FTTH broadband \nnetwork. It first deployed fiber-optic trunks to connect \nits central offices, then installed fiber trunks between \nits central offices and the nodes serving various areas \nand customer clusters, and is currently deploying \nFTTH from nodes to individual customer locations. \nThis is a difficult and expensive process, since conduit \nmust be buried three feet below the very rocky surface \nand individual customer drops often extend for a mile. \nGiven \nIdaho\u2019s \nabbreviated \noutdoor-construction \nseason, CTC does not expect to finish upgrading \ncustomer locations to FTTH until 2029. \nCTC has been financing its network upgrades with \nprivate-sector loans and credit lines since 2016 and \nhas \noutstanding \nconstruction \nloans \nneeding \nrepayment during the next five years. It will need to \ndraw upon a revolving line of credit to complete its \nFTTH upgrades during that time, and the loans\u2019 \nrepayment periods will extend as long as to 2039. CTC \nwill require uninterrupted E-ACAM support to \ncontinue its network upgrade and to repay its existing \nand future construction loans. It also requires its \nexisting E-ACAM support to cover the above-average \nper customer operating costs needed to serve its \nremote and sparsely populated service area. In \naddition to the lack of economies of scale, CTC is faced \nwith rapidly increasing equipment and cybersecurity \ncosts. CTC estimates that removal of its current E-\nACAM support would force it to lay off some of its 30 \nemployees and could ultimately force it to double its \nmonthly residential-service rates. \n\n18 \nAs a third-generation, family-owned company, \nCTC is very active in serving its rural customers and \npromoting the economic and social welfare of its \nservice area. Its FTTH network supports education, \njob training, social and healthcare opportunities. \nCTC\u2019s broadband network also provides the backhaul \nservices that enable wireless carriers to serve its area, \nreflecting additional positive externalities of fiber \ndeployment. \nCentral Arkansas Telephone Cooperative \n(CATC) provides broadband service to approximately \n3,500 member-customers across a 700-square-mile \nportion of central Arkansas.31 Headquartered in \nBismarck (population: 2,332), CATC\u2019s rural service \narea includes rocky hills used for cattle ranching, and \nlakes/recreational areas that have attracted many \nretirees. \nFrom 2017-2022, CATC undertook and completed \na major project to convert its network to 100 percent \nFTTH, enabling it to meet the growing broadband \nservice demands of its rural member-customers and \nto attract new ones. It also has improved the quality \nof the voice and 911 emergency services available to \nmembers. Due to the frequency of thunderstorm, \ntornado and ice-storm damage and outages in central \nArkansas, CATC buried its FTTH cable. This entailed \nsubstantial expense resulting from the rocky and hilly \nterrain ($80,000 to $100,000 per mile), although \nburied plant ultimately will reduce maintenance and \nstorm-recovery costs and minimize service outages. \nCATC financed its FTTH project with $20 million in \nbank loans it must repay over the next 10 years.  \n \n31  See generally, Who We Are, https://catc.net/about/who-we-are/. \n\n19 \nCATC\u2019s high-cost USF support has enabled it to \nobtain and begin repayment of its FTTH conversion \nloans and to cover the above-average operating costs \nof serving its rural area. If CATC were to lose its \ncurrent E-ACAM support, it estimates it would need \nto increase its present residential broadband service \nrates by about $90 per month per customer \u2013 a \ndaunting expense for the retirees, family farmers and \nsmall-business owners comprising the bulk of its \ncustomers.  \nChickasaw \nTelephone \nCompany \n(Chickasaw) serves approximately 3,900 broadband \ncustomers in nine exchanges across a nearly 700-\nsquare-mile portion of rural south-central Oklahoma. \nIts headquarters are in Sulphur (population: 5,065) \nand, like many Oklahoma companies, its service area \nis exclusively Tribal land.32 \nSince 1996, Chickasaw has invested over $106.6 \nmillion to upgrade its former voice network to high-\nspeed broadband services. Much of this took place \nduring a FTTH upgrade that began in 2017, and \nChickasaw has converted about 90 percent of its \nnetwork to FTTH. Because its service area also is \nfrequently subjected to tornados and ice storms, about \n99 percent of its outside plant consists of expensive \nburied fiber, which costs $60,000 to $70,000 per mile \nto deploy. But such investment pays off \u2013 Chickasaw \nwas able to remain in operation after tornados on \nApril 27, 2024 ravaged the Sulphur area, including \nChickasaw\u2019s own building.33 \n \n32  See McGirt v. Oklahoma, 591 U.S. 894, 897-898 (2020). \n33  J. Burger, Sulphur Residents Helping Neighbors Despite Their \nOwn Uncertainties Following Tornado Outbreak, KOCO-TV \n\n20 \nChickasaw\u2019s FTTH facilities are scalable and \ncapable of upgrading to meet future customer \nbroadband speed needs at minimal incremental cost. \nIts \nstate-of-the-art \nnetwork \nenables \nits \nrural \ncustomers to enjoy entertainment, education, job \ntraining, and telehealth offerings comparable to \nurban residents.  \nWhereas Chickasaw has paid off the private-\nlender loans that it needed to finance the bulk of its \nbroadband upgrades, it needs continuing CAF-BLS \nsupport to recover its $106.6-million investment and \nto subsidize its above-average per-customer operating \nexpenses. Without its current CAF-BLS support, \nChickasaw would need to increase its residential \nbroadband service rates by more than $100 per \nmonth, which would render its service unaffordable \nfor most customers. The USF Lifeline program is \nespecially important in enabling many of Chickasaw\u2019s \nNative-American customers to afford voice and \nbroadband services.34 \nHart Telephone Company (Hart) serves over \n8,000 broadband customers in a 174-square mile \n \n(April \n29, \n2024), \nhttps://www.koco.com/article/sulphur-\noklahoma-tornado-damage-helping-others/60634657. \n34  See, e.g., National Congress of American Indians Resolution \n#RAP-10-009, Ensuring Future Universal Service Support in \nIndian Country and Existing Telephony During the Broadband \nTransition (June 23, 2010), \nhttps://archive.ncai.org/attachments/Resolution_PRgyVhwGXg\nnpechTBriZtnmGKcpIgxqqtupPWDqGZZNqoDTLPFs_RAP-10-\n009.pdf (\u201c\u2026as USF reform takes place, Congress and the FCC \nmust not inadvertently \u2018cut the only wire\u2019 going into Indian \nCountry.

Headquartered in Hartwell (population: \n4,470), Hart serves a rural area known for boating, \nhiking, golfing and other outdoor recreational \nactivities on and near Lake Hartwell.35 \nIn 2019, Hart began a $40-to-$50 million project to \nupgrade its former copper digital subscriber line \n(DSL) network to FTTH. Hart has completed \napproximately 60 percent of this project, and expects \nto finish its FTTH deployment in 2026 if its CAF-BLS \nsupport \ncontinues \nunabated. \nTo \ndate, \nHart\u2019s \nupgraded broadband facilities and services have \nenhanced the abilities of formerly commuting \ncustomers to work from home. Hart has also improved \nthe 911 emergency services available to reach local \npolice, fire, ambulance and EMT facilities and \npersonnel. Finally, Hart\u2019s upgraded broadband \nnetwork has improved the ability of local customers \nand businesses that offer lodging, meals and \nrecreational activities to market their services to \npotential visitors. \nHart is self-financing its FTTH upgrade. However, \ngiven the $40-to-$50 million cost, Hart cannot operate \nits FTTH network and recover its capital investment \nwithin a reasonable time period by relying on monthly \ncustomer revenues alone. Rather, it needs its current \nCAF-BLS support to supplement its customer \nrevenues. In fact, Hart\u2019s current USF support \nconstitutes approximately 55 percent of its monthly \nrevenue stream. If that USF support is terminated, \nHart will have to cease work on its FTTH upgrade and \n \n35  See generally, Our History,  \nhttps://www.htconline.net/history/; About Hart County,  \nhttps://hartcountyga.gov/aboutus.html. \n\n22 \nis unlikely to resume its construction and investment \nwithin the foreseeable future. Moreover, Hart would \nneed to raise the residential service rates of its \nexisting broadband customers by approximately \n$60/month per customer to replace its USF support \u2013 \nan increase unlikely to be paid by many customers, \nwho would instead terminate their service. It would \nalso have to cut its operating expenses in an amount \nnecessary to offset the USF revenue loss, thus \nreducing service quality. \nMatanuska Telecom Association (MTA) is a \ncooperative that provides broadband, voice and other \nservices to approximately 33,000 members in a \n10,000- square-mile, fast-growing portion of south-\ncentral \nAlaska.36 \nHeadquartered \nin \nPalmer \n(population: 6,378), about 10 percent of the population \nMTA serves are Indigenous peoples of Alaska. \nMTA deployed DSL service during the late 1990s \nand is currently engaged in a major network upgrade \nthat entails replacing 5,500 miles of copper outside \nplant with high-capacity and scalable FTTH. \nHowever, the Alaska construction season is limited to \nthe period between mid-May and mid-October, and \nbroadband deployment and maintenance is further \nrendered difficult and expensive by the need to use \nsnowmobiles, boats and planes to reach many areas \ndue to the lack of roads. MTA anticipates it will take \na number of years to complete the conversion of its \nnetwork to FTTH even without any major weather, \nfinancial or other disruptions (e.g., termination or \ninterruption of USF support). \n \n36 See Alaska Plan,  \nhttps://www.mtasolutions.com/about/alaskaplan/. \n\n23 \nMTA currently has a substantial broadband \nconstruction loan from a private lender that must be \nrepaid \nover \nthe \nnext \nseven \nyears. \nWithout \ncontinuing support from the new Alaska Connect \nFund, MTA will not be able to repay its existing \nloan, continue its FTTH upgrade project, or obtain \nadditional \nfuture \nloans. \nAnd \ngiven \nthat \napproximately 80 percent of MTA\u2019s current Alaska \nFund support is needed to pay its very high Alaskan \noperating expenses, any loss or interruption of \nMTA\u2019s USF support will immediately and adversely \nimpact the quality of its existing broadband and \nvoice services. MTA estimates that loss of its \nexisting high-cost USF support would require it to \nincrease its present service rates by at least 42 \npercent (or about $50/month on average). \nThe continuation and reliability of MTA\u2019s \nbroadband services and upgrades are essential to \nenable isolated Alaskan residents and villages to \nparticipate in the 21st-Century society and economy. \nParticularly in light of Alaska\u2019s harsh weather and \nlack of roads, high-speed broadband service is crucial \nfor distance learning, job training, and growing \ntelemedicine applications. MTA\u2019s broadband is also \nessential for national defense and cybersecurity, as \nthe cooperative serves critical military bases, radar \ninstallations, \nand \noff-base \nhomes \nof \nmilitary \npersonnel and their families. \nMescalero Apache Telecom, Inc. (MATI) is a \nTribally owned carrier that provides broadband \nservice to approximately 1,130 Tribal members in a \n750-square-mile area of the Mescalero Apache Tribe \n\n24 \nReservation in New Mexico.37 It is headquartered in \nMescalero (population: 891). \nSince 2021, MATI has constructed and deployed \nburied or aerial FTTH facilities and services \nthroughout its entire service area. It has financed this \nbroadband project with three RUS loans totaling $25 \nmillion \u2013 one of which has been repaid, but the others \nremain due over 10-year and 20-year periods. \nMATI\u2019s broadband project has brought first-time \nservice to virtually all of its 1,130 Tribal customers.38 \nIt has improved health and safety on the Reservation \nby \nproviding \n911 \nconnectivity \nand \nenhanced \neducation by permitting students to attend school \nonline from home during the COVID quarantines and \non snow days. MATI\u2019s network also provides the \nbackhaul functions necessary to enable wireless \nservice throughout the Reservation. MATI is working \nhard to encourage and expand use of its broadband \nnetwork for cultural preservation, job training, \ntelehealth and other functions that improve Tribal \nlife. \nHigh-cost USF support has been essential to \nenable MATI to obtain and repay its RUS loans and \nto sustain the high costs of operating and maintaining \nits aerial and buried fiber trunks and lines in rural \nNew Mexico. Tribal Lifeline support is also necessary \nto enable almost a third of MATI\u2019s customers \n(approximately 400 households) to afford service. \nTermination of high-cost and Lifeline support would \nbe a massive setback for MATI\u2019s progress and plans. \n \n37  See generally, Mescalero Apache Telecom, Inc.,  \nhttps://www.matinetworks.net/about.html. \n38  Ibid. \n\n25 \nThere is no possibility that MATI\u2019s customers could \npay the additional $300 per month in residential rates \nneeded to replace its USF support, and also no way \nthat MATI could continue operating, much less to \nrepay its RUS loans, without the high-cost and \nLifeline dollars that comprise over 85 percent of its \nrevenue stream. \nNortheast Louisiana Telephone Company \n(NortheastTel) serves approximately 1,100 voice \nand/or broadband customers in a 270-square-mile \nportion of \nMorehouse Parish in northeastern \nLouisiana.39 Although its service area is a sparsely \npopulated and high-cost agricultural area (its main \ntown is Collinston, population 274), NortheastTel has \ndeployed FTTH facilities capable of serving 100 \npercent \nof \nits \ncustomer \nlocations. \nHowever, \nNortheastTel is obligated to repay over the next eight \nor nine years the Broadband Infrastructure Plan \n(BIP) and other Federal loans it needed to finance its \nFTTH construction, and is reliant on continued USF \npayments to meet those obligations. \nThe organization recently acquired Campti-\nPleasant Hill Telephone Company, Inc. (C-PH), which \nserves approximately 2,900 voice and/or broadband \ncustomers in a 510-square-mile area encompassing \nparts of four northwestern Louisiana parishes. This is \na sparsely populated, high-cost area primarily \ncomprising pine forests and swamps, where logging \nand oil/gas production are primary activities. C-PH \nhas brought FTTH to approximately 30 percent of its \nservice area and is taking out a 15-year line of credit \n \n39  See generally NortheastTel \u2013 Our History: How we got here!, \nhttps://pelicanbroadband.com/about/ \n(click \non \n\u201cCompany \nHistory\u201d). \n\n26 \nto help finance its deployment to the remaining 70 \npercent. \nBroadband service is critical in rural Louisiana for \npublic safety (especially during hurricanes and other \nnatural disasters), economic development, schooling, \njob training and rural healthcare. Without high-cost \nUSF support, NortheastTel (which is transitioning \nfrom CAF-BLS to E-ACAM) and C-PH (which \nrecently moved from ACAM to E-ACAM) would not be \nable to obtain or repay the loans necessary to deploy \nhigh-speed broadband in most parts of their service \nareas or to sustain their existing broadband services \nand operating expenses. Moreover, NortheastTel \nestimates that termination of the existing E-ACAM \nsupport received by the two companies would require \nan increase in residential broadband-service rates by \nabout $160/customer per month \u2013 a rate increase that \nwould put broadband service out of reach for most. \nNortheast Nebraska Telephone Company \n(NNTC) is a co-operative serving approximately \n5,100 broadband and 3,500 voice member-customers \nin 30 communities scattered throughout a 2,364-\nsquare-mile portion of north and central eastern \nNebraska.40 Its service areas are non-contiguous and \nsparsely populated farming and ranching regions. \nHeadquartered in Jackson (population: 202), its \npopulation \ndensities \nrange \nfrom \n2.2 \nsubscribers/square mile in its eastern service areas to \nfewer than 1 subscriber/square mile in its western \nareas. \nNNTC obtained a substantial RUS loan in 2009, \nwith which it extended buried FTTH broadband \n \n40  See generally About NNTC, https://nntc.net/about/. \n\n27 \nfacilities and services to its member customers during \na project completed in 2015. Because NNTC is a \ncooperative, all customers must be offered service \nregardless of the distance or cost to reach them. \nAlthough FTTH network construction was completed \nduring 2015, the RUS loans will not be fully repaid \nuntil 2036. \nIn large-scale agricultural regions like NNTC\u2019s \nservice area, broadband is important not only for \neconomic \ndevelopment, \nemployment, \ndistance-\nlearning and rural healthcare purposes, but is also \nbecoming \nincreasingly \ncritical \nfor \nprecision-\nagricultural and video livestock auction purposes. \nNNTC needs continued high-cost USF support not \nonly to repay its loans, but also to sustain its \noperations in a large area where lengthy trunks and \nlines entail expensive maintenance activities and \nrepair calls, and low population density limits \neconomies \nof \nscale \nfor \ncustomer-service \nand \ncybersecurity functions. NNTC estimates that it \nwould have to increase its members\u2019 residential \nbroadband service rates by about $90/month if its E-\nACAM support became unavailable. \n \nShawnee Communications (Shawnee) serves \napproximately 7,000 broadband customers in a 650-\nsquare-mile area in southern and central Illinois.41 \nWith offices in Lovington and Equality (population: \n1,024 and 504, respectively), its service area includes \ncorn, soybean and livestock farms, communities \ndecimated by coal-mine closures, and the rocky \nterrain of the Shawnee National Forest and \nsurrounding areas. Shawnee has relied on the FCC\u2019s \n \n41  See Our Mission and History, https://shawnee.com/mission-\nhistory/. \n\n28 \nhigh-cost program to ensure that its customers have \naccess to advanced services at rates reasonably \ncomparable to urban areas.   \nIn 1994, Shawnee began deploying fiber-optic \ncable into its network interexchange facilities. \nShawnee realized in 2002 that, with over 160 miles of \nfiber throughout its network, DSL services would be \nan inadequate long-term technology to keep pace with \nsubscriber demands, and that FTTH technology \nwould be needed to meet rapidly increasing consumer \ndemands for higher broadband speeds and increased \nreliability. Shawnee relied upon consistent USF \nsupport when it secured RUS loans to upgrade its \ncommunities to FTTH beginning in 2007 and \ncompleted a major effort to convert all of its exchanges \nby 2014 \u2013 both the core towns and surrounding areas, \nservicing an average of 3.67 subscriber locations per \nmile. Finally, in 2017 Shawnee converted its recently \nacquired Lovington exchange to FTTH and fiber-to-\nthe-premise (FTTP) using an RUS loan.  \nShawnee was able to finance these FTTH and \nFTTP conversions primarily with Federal loans from \nRUS by relying on consistent, predictable and ongoing \nUSF programs and will require E-ACAM support for \nrepaying tens of millions in outstanding RUS loans \nbetween now and 2036. Additionally, ongoing USF \nsupport assists Shawnee with operating costs, \nincluding occasional government mandated highway-\nrelated network relocations, capital maintenance \ncosts, and most important, keeping rural service rates \ncomparable to urban rates. USF support has been and \nremains critical to the availability and affordability of \nservices and sustainability of Shawnee operations. \n\n29 \nShawnee\u2019s \nFTTH \nnetwork \nhas \nprovided \nopportunities for its customers to enhance their job \nskills and employment opportunities, established \nhigh-speed connections for local schools, connected \ncritical hospitals and medical clinics, and supported \nremote education and telehealth. It has enhanced \neconomic development in areas affected by coal-mine \nclosures, and created growth opportunities in \neconomically \nchallenged \ncommunities. \nShawnee \nestimates that if its high-cost USF support was \nsuspended or terminated, it would result in monthly \nservice-rate increases of over $100/subscriber and/or \nnecessitate employee layoffs. As one of the largest \nanchor employers in its economically depressed \nregions, these likely layoffs would produce significant \nnegative impacts to customers\u2019 rates, customer \nservice, and network services, as well as cause \nirreversible harm to fragile local economies. \nSmithville Communications (Smithville) has \nbeen upgrading its residential broadband offerings \nthat serve roughly 20,000 customers in 12 exchanges \nin an approximate 1,067-square-mile area of southern \nIndiana.42 \nIn 2008, Smithville took out a major RUS loan to \nfinance \nthe \ntransformation \nof \nits \nresidential \nexchanges to high-speed FTTH technology. It \nexpended these funds during 2008-2014 to complete \nsubstantial network upgrades, but still has five years \nof loan repayments left. Smithville continues to \nconvert remaining DSL facilities to FTTH, and during \n2023 invested $18 million of its own funds in these \nand other continuing broadband upgrades. \n \n42  See generally Keeping You Connected!,  \nhttps://www.smithville.com/about/. \n\n30 \nSmithville launched a Bright Communities \nInitiative in 2024 to showcase how high-speed \nbroadband elevates the quality of life for rural \nIndiana residents. It also launched a best-in-class \nLearning and Development and Talent program to \nfoster \na \nculture \nof \ncontinuous \nlearning \nand \ndevelopment, and is offering next-generation services \nto its customers through its \u201cSmithville at Home\u201d and \n\u201cSmithville at Work\u201d services. Finally, Smithville is \nsupporting telemedicine and telehealth initiatives in \nits rural service areas. \nContinuing high-cost USF support is essential to \ncomplete the upgrade of Smithville\u2019s residential \nnetwork facilities to FTTH, repay the remaining \nbalance of its RUS loans, earn a sufficient return on \nits own investments, and sustain its ongoing \noperational and cybersecurity expenses. Without \nsubstantial ongoing USF support, there is no business \ncase to justify owner and shareholder investment in \nbroadband facilities to serve many rural customers. \nSmithville has found that it costs as much as \n$250,000 per location to extend FTTH service to many \nof its rural customer locations. Assuming that the \ncompany generates $75 per month from the \nbroadband customer at that location (and ignoring the \ntime value of money and assuming that none of the \n$75 is needed to cover operating expenses), it would \ntake approximately 3,333 months (277 years) to \nrecover the investment. Without substantial USF \nsupport to supplement customer revenues, these \nextremely high-cost locations would not be upgraded \nto robust FTTH broadband.  \nRally Networks (Rally) owns and operates 17 \ndifferent RLECs in rural portions of Oregon, \nWashington, \nIdaho, \nMissouri, \nOklahoma \nand \n\n31 \nArkansas. Rally\u2019s general business plan is to acquire \nRLECs with substantial fiber backhaul facilities that \nprovide DSL services and then upgrade them as much \nas feasible to provide FTTH service.43 \nFor example, Rally\u2019s five Oregon RLECs serve \napproximately 4,000 broadband customers in a \nroughly 4,000-square-mile area (or about one \ncustomer per square mile). To date, Rally has \ndeployed FTTH service to approximately 90 percent \nof its Oregon customers. During 2002-2004, it used \nsome $70 million in RUS loans for a major FTTH \nupgrade and still has outstanding loan repayments \nfor the next five years. It is currently working with a \n50/50 RUS ReConnect grant/loan to deploy FTTH \nservice in the most remote and expensive portions of \nits Oregon service areas. \nIn addition to the typical economic, social, \neducational and healthcare services, Rally has \nconnected its Oregon FTTH networks via middle-mile \ntrunks to urban data centers. It also uses its \nbroadband networks to provide backhaul for cellular \ntowers and to provide connections and transport for \nFirstNet emergency services. \n \nTenino Telephone Company (Tenino) and \nKalama Telephone Company (Kalama) are \ncommonly owned RLECs that serve rural areas in the \nwestern portion of Washington state. Tenino serves \nthe city of Tenino (population: 1,870) and surrounding \nareas in the south Puget Sound region and has \napproximately 1,400 broadband customers within its \n100-square-mile service area. Kalama serves the city \nof Kalama (population: 2,959) and surrounding areas \n \n43  See generally Meet Rally, https://rallynet.us/about-us/. \n\n32 \nin southwestern Washington along the Columbia \nRiver and has approximately 1,500 broadband \ncustomers within its 120-square-mile service area.44 \nBoth companies have been upgrading their \noriginal copper-voice networks to broadband since \n1996 and, by the early 2000s, had upgraded most of \ntheir dial-up Internet access services to higher-speed \nDSL. Starting in 2016, both companies began \nreplacing their copper network facilities with scalable \nFTTH technology that will enable them to continue \nupgrading their networks at reduced incremental \ncosts to meet evolving customer demands for ever-\nincreasing broadband speeds. Today, both companies \nhave converted about 40 percent of their customer \nlocations to FTTH service. Kalama has received a \nRUS ReConnect grant (for which it has to furnish 25 \npercent of its own funds) and expects to have deployed \nFTTH to 90-95 percent of its customer locations by the \nend of 2028. However, providing FTTH to the last 5 \npercent or so of its customers will be extremely \ndifficult and expensive due to the rough terrain that \nmust be passed to reach their remote locations. For its \npart, Tenino is continuing to upgrade its network but \nneeds a comparable RUS ReConnect or other Federal \ngrant to increase its FTTH deployment pace to that of \nKalama. \nIn addition to the economic, educational and \nhealthcare benefits of high-speed broadband, both \ncompanies have used their fiber networks to connect \nand monitor the water reservoirs and distribution \nsystems and fire/emergency-response facilities within \n \n44 \n \nSee \ngenerally \nAbout \nTenino \nTelephone \nCompany, \nhttps://teninotelephone.com/about/; About Kalama Telephone \nCompany,  https://kalamatelephone.com/about/. \n\n33 \ntheir service areas \u2013 extremely critical functions in \nwestern Washington state. Kalama also has provided \nbroadband capabilities and services that have \nenabled the Port of Kalama to attract businesses and \njobs and preserve its status as a leading West Coast \nport for exporting soybeans, corn and wheat. \nTenino and Kalama have thus far not incurred \nsubstantial debt to upgrade their networks to FTTH. \nHowever, their customer revenues alone are wholly \ninsufficient to cover their above-average rural \noperating expenses, much less to recover their \nbroadband investments. The companies estimate that \nTenino would need to increase its residential \nbroadband rates by $93/month, and Kalama\u2019s by \n$86/month, to offset termination of their existing \nCAF-BLS support. Those amount to roughly a \ndoubling of existing rates, and likely would be \nunaffordable for most customers.  \n* * * * * * * \nCertainly, a practice\u2019s lengthy pedigree may \nilluminate the issue of its constitutionality. See \nTrump v. United States, 603 U.S. 593, 643-646 (2024) \n(Thomas, J., concurring) (prosecution of the former \nPresident also may be unconstitutional because a \nprivate citizen appointed Special Counsel by Attorney \nGeneral did not occupy office \u201cestablished by law\u201d, \n\u201c[l]ongstanding practice from the founding to today \ncomports with this original understanding that \nCongress must create offices by law\u201d). As even the \nFifth Circuit acknowledges, \u201cCongress has long \npursued \na \npolicy \nof \nproviding \nuniversal \ntelecommunications service to all residents and \nbusinesses in the United States.\u201d Pet. App. 2a \n(cleaned up, citation omitted). As is shown by the \n\n34 \nabove experiences of the various WTA members \nnationwide, USF programs have been and remain \ncritical to deploying and sustaining highly beneficial \nbroadband services in rural America \u2013 progress that \nis threatened by the Fifth Circuit\u2019s proposed \ntermination of FCC\u2019s USF program. \n\u201cMontana with its vast distances is not Rhode \nIsland with its heavy concentrations of people.\u201d Lucas \nv. Forty-Fourth Gen. Assembly, 377 U.S. 713, 749 \n(1964) (Stewart, J. dissenting). This Court, situated \non the densely populated and pervasively connected \nEastern seaboard, should not lose sight of the fact \nthat affirming the Fifth Circuit will greatly disrupt \nthe extremely successful high-cost USF support \nprograms. It will bring to a screeching halt the \nprogress RLECs have made to reduce the \u201cdigital \ndivide\u201d and deploy the reasonably comparable and \naffordable broadband services required by 47 U.S.C. \n254(b)(3) that have done so much to improve the \neconomic, educational, health, public safety and social \ncircumstances of our Nation\u2019s long-neglected rural \nservice \nareas. \nTerminating \nor \nsignificantly \ninterrupting the existing high-cost USF support \nprograms would cripple the availability and quality of \nbroadband services and benefits in many or most \nRLEC service areas, and relegate their inhabitants to \nsecond-class (or worse) broadband service, impairing \ntheir full participation in the online world. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fifth Circuit should be reversed. \n \n \n\n35 \nRespectfully submitted, \n/s/  Michael F.

For many decades, \u201cuniversal service,\u201d as this \npolicy is called, involved \u201cimplicit\u201d subsidies that were \nbuilt into the overall regulated rate structure of a mo-\nnopolistic local telephone system. This meant, for ex-\nample, that urban customers paid above cost rates to \nsubsidize rural customers who paid below cost rates. \nWhen Congress passed the Telecommunications Act of \n1996 (1996 Act), however, it replaced the monopoly-\nbased implicit subsidy regime with explicitly funded \nuniversal service. There, Congress expressly directed \nthe Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to \nensure universal service consistent with six specific \nprinciples, and to fund this service through fees paid \nby service providers.  \nImplementing Congress\u2019 principles and instruc-\ntions, the FCC has done just that through the Univer-\nsal Service Fund (USF or Fund) and the Fund\u2019s \nrelated programs. As a result, advanced telecommuni-\ncations and information services are now available in \nrural and remote areas, in healthcare facilities, in \nschools and libraries, and to low-income users. The de-\ncision below, which concluded that the detailed statu-\ntory provisions governing universal service violated \nthe nondelegation doctrine, would eradicate these es-\nsential programs and jeopardize the commitment to \nuniversal service that Congress has clearly endorsed. \nAmici here are the States of Colorado, Arizona, \nConnecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Ha-\n\n2 \n \nwai\u2018i, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Mich-\nigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New York, \nNorth Carolina, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South \nDakota, Vermont, Wisconsin, and Wyoming, and the \nMaine Office of the Public Advocate, and their inter-\nests in this issue are myriad and substantial. Univer-\nsal service is essential to allow Amici\u2019s citizens to \nparticipate in virtually every aspect of modern life\u2014\nthe economy, government, politics, healthcare, educa-\ntion, and cultural life. This access is critical, not just \nto the users of the services provided through the Fund, \nbut to everyone who wishes to communicate with \nthem. Its eradication could seriously disrupt\u2014at a \nminimum\u2014the overall development of the states\u2019 \neconomies, the provision of healthcare, and the educa-\ntion system. \nAmici are further interested in this case because \nthe Fund operates under the supervision of a Federal-\nState Joint Board that allows Amici to participate in \nthe development of these programs and to develop \ncomplementary state programs to further bolster uni-\nversal service. Some of the Amici have developed their \nown state programs in reliance on the operation of the \nFund and its programs. Declaring the Fund unconsti-\ntutional would result in a major disruption of Amici\u2019s \ncomplementary efforts to provide universal service. \nFinally, much of the funding provided by the USF \nis distributed over long time periods, with telecommu-\nnications providers making investments in significant \ninfrastructure projects based on long-term payouts, or \nschools entering long-term service contracts based on \nthe promise of subsidized rates. If the funding pro-\ngrams were eradicated, these entities would be subject \n\n3 \n \nto financial chaos and potential bankruptcies, with \nripple effects extending to many other entities, like \npublic and private lenders, and resulting in the poten-\ntial need for Amici to step in to prevent catastrophic \noutcomes. \nSUMMARY OF THE ARGUMENT \nSince 1934, Congress has sought to ensure that \nadvanced communications technology is accessible \nthroughout the country. In the era of regulated tele-\ncommunications monopolies, this was accomplished \nby a system of cross-subsidies where urban and rural \nconsumers paid the same rates even though the cost of \nproviding services to urban customers was less than \nproviding service to rural customers. But when Con-\ngress allowed competition to enter the communica-\ntions market, it recognized that the cross-subsidy \nsystem could no longer achieve universal service and \nput a new structure in place: the USF. \nImplemented by the FCC and administered by the \nUniversal Service Administrative Company (USAC) \nwith the FCC\u2019s oversight, the USF has worked hard to \nachieve Congress\u2019 vision\u2014following the statutory \nprinciples and other detailed limits that Congress laid \nout. Because of the USF, entire swaths of the country \nhave broadband access, allowing them to participate \nin civic and community life to the same extent as their \nurban counterparts. Rural hospitals are better able to \nprovide life-saving care in areas of the country that \nhave few local specialized providers. Schools and li-\nbraries with fewer resources can provide many of the \nsame opportunities to their students and patrons as \nthose in better-funded communities. And people of \nlimited means are able to afford phone service. \n\n4 \n \nInvalidating the USF, as respondents seek here, \nwould result not only in the loss of these benefits to \nthe detriment of the many constituencies that Con-\ngress intended to help, but it would also have substan-\ntial negative consequences for other stakeholders. \nMany service providers, schools, and others have \nmade long-term investments and agreements in reli-\nance on the availability of USF funds. Its sudden loss \nwould mean cuts in other services, diminished access \nto the technology Congress wanted to be made univer-\nsally available, and in some instances, bankruptcies \nand job losses. \nThere is no reason for any of these devastating \nconsequences to come to pass. The USF does not vio-\nlate the nondelegation doctrine because Congress pro-\nvided intelligible principles to guide the FCC\u2019s \nexercise of authority. And in enacting the USF, Con-\ngress made the difficult policy decisions about whether \nto provide universal service and how it should be \nfunded, leaving it to the FCC to fill in the details con-\nsistent with the principles and limits Congress set \nforth in the 1996 Act. Furthermore, the FCC\u2019s creation \nof USAC to provide administrative services for the \nUSF does not violate the private nondelegation doc-\ntrine because USAC operates entirely under the FCC\u2019s \nauthority and supervision. Finally, given the role the \nFederal-State Joint Board plays and the history of \nstate involvement in universal service efforts, nothing \nabout the USF undermines federalism; to the con-\ntrary, the USF is a model of cooperative federalism. \nThe USF is also subject to several different over-\nsight mechanisms that can address any issues that \n\n5 \n \narise with the program. The FCC\u2019s Office of the In-\nspector General routinely audits the USF; Congress \nholds regular hearings regarding the USF; USAC\u2019s \nrecommendations can be challenged before the FCC; \nand the FCC\u2019s decisions can be challenged in court. \nMany different avenues exist to ensure the program \nfunctions as Congress intended. \nNearly thirty years ago, Congress enacted the cur-\nrent universal service regime to the benefit of the en-\ntire country. Losing this vital program would be \ndevastating and is not constitutionally required. This \nCourt should reverse the decision below. \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe USF Has Provided the Precise Benefits \nCongress Intended. \nA. Congress Has Clearly Legislated the Im-\nportance of Universal Service. \nFor almost a century, universal service has been \na guiding principle of Congress\u2019 telecommunications \npolicy. In the 1934 Communications Act, Congress as-\nsigned the FCC the task of \u201cregulating interstate and \nforeign commerce in communication by wire and radio \nso as to make available, so far as possible, to all the \npeople of the United States a rapid, efficient, Nation-\nwide, and world-wide wire and radio communications \nservice \nwith \nadequate \nfacilities \nat \nreasonable \ncharges.\u201d Communications Act of 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-\n652, \u00a7 1, 48 Stat. 1064 (codified as amended at 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 151).  \nFor most of the 20th century, telecommunications \nregulation was premised \u201con the belief that service \ncould be provided at the lowest cost to the maximum \n\n6 \n \nnumber of consumers through a regulated monopoly \nnetwork.\u201d Implementation of the Local Competition \nProvisions in the Telecommunications Act of 1996, \n11 FCC Rcd. 15499, 15505 (1996) (Local Competition \nOrder). In this environment, \u201cuniversal service\u201d was \nachieved primarily through implicit or cross-subsi-\ndies. Like the commitment of the Post Office to provide \nmail service to rural and urban communities at the \nsame prices, monopoly providers priced telephone ser-\nvice at uniform levels for rural and urban communi-\nties. This meant that urban communities paid above-\ncost rates so that rural communities could be served \nbelow cost. And because business customers were pro-\nvided service at higher rates than residential custom-\ners, that cross-subsidy constituted a second form of \nimplicit subsidies that were built into the rate struc-\nture. Finally, long-distance rates were also priced well \nabove costs as a means of subsidizing local rates. \nThe 1996 Act fundamentally changed the telecom-\nmunications marketplace. For the first time, it re-\nquired local telephone companies to open their \nnetworks to competition. E.g., Telecommunications \nAct of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104\u2013104, \u00a7\u00a7 251\u2013261, 110 \nStat. 56, 61\u201379 (codified as amended at 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 251\u2013261). At the same time, the 1996 Act also re-\nconceived of how to advance the policy of universal ser-\nvice. Id. \u00a7 254(b), 110 Stat. at 71\u201372 (codified at 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)). Rather than furthering universal ser-\nvice through implicit subsidies, the Act created an ex-\npress funding mechanism: charges paid by carriers. \nId., \u00a7 254(d), 110 Stat. at 73. In its Local Competition \nOrder, the FCC observed that the implicit subsidy sys-\ntem needed to be reworked to enable competition to be \nthe \u201cdriving force\u201d to guarantee affordable service to \n\n7 \n \nall Americans. Local Competition Order, 11 FCC Rcd. \nat 15507. The Commission recognized that the old sys-\ntem distorted, rather than enhanced, competition and \nthat \u201cuniversal service reform was vitally connected\u201d \nto the new focus on local competition. Id. (cleaned up). \nThe Act formalized Congress\u2019 commitment to a \nnew model of universal service by creating a Federal-\nState Joint Board, comprised of FCC Commissioners, \nstate utility commissioners, and a state consumer ad-\nvocate, to make recommendations to the FCC about \nhow to modernize universal service systems. 1996 Act, \n\u00a7 254(a), 110 Stat. at 71. The Act also set forth detailed \nguidelines that the FCC and the Joint Board must con-\nsider in order to preserve and advance universal ser-\nvice. Id. \u00a7 254(b), 110 Stat. at 71\u201372. Specifically, \nCongress instructed the FCC and the Joint Board to \nbase their policies on six principles: \n1. quality services should be available at just, \nreasonable, and affordable rates;  \n2. access to advanced telecommunications and \ninformation services should be provided in \nall regions of the Nation;  \n3. access by low-income and those in rural, in-\nsular and high-cost areas to telecommunica-\ntions and information services should be \ncomparable to those provided in urban areas \nat rates reasonably comparable to those \ncharged for similar services in urban areas;  \n4. all telecommunications service providers \nmust contribute;  \n\n8 \n \n5. support mechanisms should be specific, pre-\ndictable, and sufficient to preserve and ad-\nvance universal service; and  \n6. schools, health care, and libraries should \nhave access to advanced telecommunica-\ntions services.  \nId. \u00a7 254(b)(1)\u2013(6), 110 Stat. at 71\u201372. \nIn addition to these specific principles, Congress \nauthorized the FCC and the Joint Board to adopt \n\u201csuch other principles \u2026 [that] are necessary and ap-\npropriate for the protection of the public interest, con-\nvenience, and necessity.\u201d Id. \u00a7 254(b)(7), 110 Stat. at \n72. \nThe FCC implemented Congress\u2019 directions by es-\ntablishing four programs: the High Cost Program, to \nsupport network deployment and maintenance cost in \nrural areas, Federal-State Joint Board on Universal \nService, 12 FCC Rcd. 8776, 8995\u20139001 (1997) (Univer-\nsal Service Order); the low-income programs (Lifeline \nand Link Up), to make service affordable for low-in-\ncome households and low-income residents of Tribal \nlands, id. at 8952\u201393; the E-Rate Program (also known \nas the Schools and Libraries program), to help offset \ncommunications service costs to schools and libraries, \nid. at 9002\u201392; and the Rural Health Care Program, \nto support communications service to rural health care \nproviders, id. at 9093\u20139156. These programs are sup-\nported by contributions from telecommunications ser-\nvice providers, including wireline, wireless, and \ninterconnected Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) \nproviders, based on an assessment on their interstate \nand international end-user revenues. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.712.  \n\n9 \n \nTo implement universal service reform, the FCC \ncreated and designated USAC as the program admin-\nistrator to annually bill contributors, collect contribu-\ntions, and disburse funds. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b). The \nFCC prohibited USAC from making policy, interpret-\ning unclear provisions of the statute or rules, or inter-\npreting Congressional intent. If the Act or rules are \nunclear, USAC must seek guidance from the FCC. 47 \nC.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(c). \nCentral to these efforts was Congress\u2019 direction \nthat \u201c[a]ccess to advanced telecommunications and in-\nformation services should be provided in all regions of \nthe Nation.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(2); see also id. \n\u00a7 254(b)(3) & (6), (h)(2) (affirming the need for access \nto advanced telecommunications and information ser-\nvices for rural and high-cost areas, as well as schools, \nhealthcare providers, and libraries). But Congress \nknew that what was considered \u201cadvanced telecom-\nmunications and information services\u201d would change \nover time. Indeed, between 1934 and 1996, the country \nhad witnessed the invention of fax machines, car \nphones, handheld cellular phones, and dial-up inter-\nnet service. \nAnd so, Congress expressly recognized that \u201c[u]ni-\nversal service is an evolving level of telecommunica-\ntions services\u201d that would need to be evaluated from \ntime to time to account for \u201cadvances in telecommuni-\ncations and information technologies and services.\u201d \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1). To conduct that evaluation, Con-\ngress set standards and then delegated authority to \nthe Commission to apply those standards when deter-\nmining the types of services necessary to achieve Con-\ngress\u2019 goal of ensuring that no part of the nation was \n\n10 \n \nleft behind in the ever-evolving technological land-\nscape.  \nSpecifically, Congress statutorily directed the \nCommission to consider the extent to which such tele-\ncommunications services: \n(A) are essential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety; \n(B) have, through the operation of market \nchoices by customers, been subscribed \nto by a substantial majority of resi-\ndential customers; \n(C) are being deployed in public telecom-\nmunications networks by telecommu-\nnications carriers; and \n(D) are consistent with the public inter-\nest, convenience, and necessity. \nId. \u00a7 254(c)(1)(A)\u2013(D).  \nAs time passed and technology advanced, Con-\ngress enacted another key statute to further improve \naccess to broadband services throughout the United \nStates. In 2009, Congress instructed the FCC and the \nAssistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications \nand Information to establish the Broadband Technol-\nogy Opportunities Program (BTOP) to: \n1. provide access to broadband service \nto consumers residing in unserved ar-\neas of the United States; \n2. provide improved access to broad-\nband service to consumers residing in \nunderserved areas of the United \nStates; \n\n11 \n \n3. provide broadband education, aware-\nness, training, access, equipment, \nand support to-- \na. schools, libraries, medical and \nhealthcare providers, commu-\nnity colleges and other institu-\ntions of higher education, and \nother community support organ-\nizations and entities to facilitate \ngreater use of broadband service \nby or though these organiza-\ntions; \nb. organizations and agencies that \nprovide outreach, access, equip-\nment, and support services to fa-\ncilitate greater use of broadband \nservice by low-income, unem-\nployed, aged, and otherwise vul-\nnerable populations; and \nc. job-creating strategic facilities \nlocated within a State-desig-\nnated economic zone, Economic \nDevelopment \nDistrict \ndesig-\nnated by the Department of \nCommerce, Renewal Commu-\nnity or Empowerment Zone des-\nignated by the Department of \nHousing and Urban Develop-\nment, or Enterprise Community \ndesignated by the Department of \nAgriculture; \n\n12 \n \n4. improve access to, and use of, broad-\nband service by public safety agen-\ncies; and \n5. stimulate the demand for broadband, \neconomic growth, and job creation. \nAmerican Recovery & Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. \nL. No. 111-5, \u00a7 6001, 123 Stat. 115, 512\u201313 (codified at \n47 U.S.C. \u00a71305(a) and (b)). \nAs part of the same legislation, Congress directed \nthe FCC to develop a National Broadband Plan to \u201cen-\nsure that all people of the United States have access \nto broadband capability.\u201d Id. \u00a7 6001, 123 Stat. at 515\u2013\n16 (codified at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 1305(k)(2)) (cleaned up). \nCongress also required the plan to include a detailed \nstrategy for achieving affordability and maximizing \nuse of broadband to advance \u201cconsumer welfare, civic \nparticipation, public safety and homeland security, \ncommunity development, health care delivery, energy \nindependence and efficiency, education, worker train-\ning, private sector investment, entrepreneurial activ-\nity, job creation and economic growth, and other \nnational purposes.\u201d Id. \u00a7 6001, 123 Stat. at 516.  \nAfter receiving significant public comment, hold-\ning several workshops, and collaborating with other \ngovernment agencies and Congress, in early 2010, the \nFCC submitted the National Broadband Plan (Plan) to \nCongress, which included detailed recommendations \non each of the topics it was directed to address. FED. \nCOMMC\u2019NS COMM\u2019N, CONNECTING AMERICA: THE \nNATIONAL BROADBAND PLAN (2010), https://www.fcc \n.gov/general/national-broadband-plan. \nOne key recommendation set forth in the Plan \nwas to establish the Connect America Fund (CAF) to \n\n13 \n \nensure universal access to affordable broadband and \nvoice services. Id. at 145\u201346. In 2011, the FCC issued \nits lengthy Report and Order to create the CAF and \nshift USF from a voice-centric High Cost program and \nprioritize broadband service. Connect America Fund, \n26 FCC Rcd. 17663 (2011) (Connect America Fund Or-\nder), aff\u2019d sub nom. In re FCC 11-161, 753 F.3d 1015 \n(10th Cir. 2014). In the Connect America Fund Order, \nthe FCC established goals to guide the transition to \nsupport broadband services:  \n1. preserve and advance voice service;  \n2. ensure universal access to voice and broad-\nband to homes, businesses and anchor insti-\ntutions;  \n3. ensure mobile voice and broadband availa-\nbility where Americans live, work or travel;  \n4. ensure reasonably comparable rates for \nbroadband and voice services; and  \n5. minimize universal contribution burden on \nconsumers and businesses. \nId. at 17680\u201383. More recently, the FCC also adopted \na universal service program to support wireless broad-\nband service in underserved areas. Rural Digital Op-\nportunity Fund Connect America Fund, 35 FCC Rcd. \n686 (2020) (RDOF Order); see also 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7\u00a7 54.801\u2013.806. \nTo further ensure that the concept of universal \nservice did not lag behind the times\u2014leaving millions \nof Americans without the benefits Congress intended \nto provide\u2014Congress authorized the occasional recon-\nsideration of the types of services that qualified for \nuniversal service support. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(2). The \n\n14 \n \nevolving nature of \u201cuniversal service,\u201d guided by the \n1996 Act\u2019s standards is an important feature of the \nsystem Congress created. \nB. For Decades, the USF Has Functioned to \nProvide the Benefits Congress Intended \nand Whose Loss Would be Highly Disrup-\ntive. \n1. \nThe High Cost Program Has Benefit-\nted Rural Users and Providers. \nThe High Cost program (later enacted as the CAF \nand Rural Digital Opportunity Fund (RDOF)) pro-\nvides support to eligible telecommunications carriers \nto deliver affordable voice and broadband service in \nrural areas that would otherwise be unserved or un-\nderserved. See generally RDOF Order, 35 FCC Rcd. \n686 (2020). The FCC designates unserved or under-\nserved rural communities where the market alone \ncannot support the costs to deploy network infrastruc-\nture. Id. at 690\u201394. In 2018, the Commission con-\nducted an auction to deliver High Cost funds to eligible \nareas across the United States through which $1.49 \nbillion was allocated over ten years to provide fixed \nbroadband and voice services to over 700,000 locations \nin 45 states.

Less than two years later, in October 2020, the \nCommission established the 5G Fund to distribute an-\nother $9 billion in universal service support to bring \n5G mobile broadband service to rural America, includ-\ning $680 million to serve Tribal lands.

In South Dakota, for ex-\nample, nearly the entire geographic area of the state \nis served by local providers who depend on USF \nFunds, as the map below shows: \nThe solid-colored areas on the map are supported \nby the High-Cost program. The cross-hatched areas \n\n16 \n \nreflect where providers were able to expand to provide \nhigh-speed broadband to areas that otherwise would \nnot be served. In short, without the USF, the over-\nwhelming majority of South Dakota would not have \nbroadband access. \nA more granular example shows the value that \nthe Fund provides to rural communities. In 2021, a \ntornado struck the small farm community of Pleasant \nHill, Tennessee, carving a nearly 6-mile path of de-\nstruction. To help rebuild the town, Charter Commu-\nnications\u2014with support from the RDOF\u2014strung high \nspeed fiber, enabling emergency weather infrastruc-\nture that will protect against similar weather disas-\nters in the future. The RDOF project also fostered new \neconomic opportunities for local businesses, such as \nLinda\u2019s Coffee Shop and Sunrise Dairy. With the ben-\nefits of high-speed broadband services, the town\u2019s \nmayor \u201clooks at the emerging growth of family-run \nSunrise Dairy as just the beginning for the small rural \ncommunity.\u201d News & Views, Rural Expansion Brings \nBroadband to Pleasant Hill, Charter Commc\u2019ns  (Sept. \n13, \n2023), \nhttps://corporate.charter.com/news-\nroom/spectrum-rural-expansion-brings-broadband-to-\npleasant-hill. \n2. \nThe Fund Has Benefitted Rural \nHealthcare. \nRural healthcare has also been significantly im-\nproved through the USF, as Congress intended. See \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(A). The Commission promotes \ntelehealth in rural areas through the Rural Health \nCare Program (RHC Program), which provides finan-\ncial support to help rural health care providers obtain \n\n17 \n \nbroadband and other communications services at dis-\ncounted rates. These services are then used by \nhealthcare providers to offer telehealth to patients liv-\ning in and around the communities they serve. Pro-\nmoting Telehealth in Rural Am., 34 FCC Rcd. 7335, \n7336 (2019). In 2023, the RHC program disbursed \nmore than $468 million to nearly 11,000 health care \nproviders. 2023 USAC ANNUAL REPORT 3, 13; FED. \nCOMMC\u2019NS COMM\u2019N, RHC PROGRAM COMMITMENTS 3\u20134 \n(Aug. \n8, \n2024), \nhttps://docs.fcc.gov/public/attach-\nments/DOC-404602A6.pdf.  \nA clear example of the RHC Program\u2019s success in-\nvolves Moab, Utah. Outside of Moab (a town of approx-\nimately 5,300 people),1 an individual who had a stroke \nwas taken to the local hospital where a CT scan was \nperformed. A communications technician at the hospi-\ntal set up Telestroke,2 which connected them to a Uni-\nversity of Utah Medical Center neurologist. This \ncommunications link allowed the neurologist to make \na time-sensitive diagnosis and to direct administra-\ntion of a drug that resulted in almost immediate im-\nprovement of the patient\u2019s condition.

Having broadband \naccess throughout the country is necessary to be able \nto provide this kind of care, which can save lives and \navoid debilitating, lifelong symptoms, no matter \nwhere someone lives or may be visiting. \n3. \nThe E-Rate Program Has Benefitted \nSchools and Libraries. \nCongress dictated as a principle of universal ser-\nvice that \u201c[e]lementary and secondary schools and \nclassrooms .\u202f.\u202f. and libraries should have access to ad-\nvanced telecommunications services.\u201d 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 254(b)(6). To that end, it mandated that all \u201ctelecom-\nmunications carriers serving a geographic area\u201d must \n\u201cprovide such services to elementary schools, second-\nary schools, and libraries\u201d at \u201crates less than the \namounts charged for similar services to other parties.\u201d \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(1)(B). And through the E-Rate pro-\ngram, the Fund offsets the cost to carriers of that oth-\nerwise-unfunded mandate. See 47 C.F.R. \u00a7\u00a7\u202f54.500\u2013\n.523 (rules for E-Rate program).  \nThe E-Rate program\u2019s results are impressive. In \nColorado, for example, every single school district par-\nticipates\u2014with discounts ranging from 20% for the \n\n19 \n \nwealthiest districts to 90% for the neediest schools, al-\nlowing far more internet access than these districts \ncould otherwise afford to give students. See FED. \nCOMMC\u2019NS COMM\u2019N, E-RATE: UNIVERSAL SERVICE \nPROGRAM FOR SCHOOLS AND LIBRARIES (Dec. 31, 2019), \nhttps://www.fcc.gov/sites/default/files/e-rate_univer-\nsal_service_program_for_schools_and_libraries.pdf. \nColorado\u2019s E-Rate subsidies now average more than \n$26.5 million annually (statewide) and have totaled \nnearly $670 million since 1998. E-RATE CENTRAL, \nFUNDING \nCOMMITMENT \nOVERVIEW: \nCOLORADO, \nhttps://tools.e-ratecentral.com/us/stateInfor-\nmation.asp?state=CO (last visited Jan. 14, 2025).  \nThat average annual subsidy accounts for well \nover half the cost of schools\u2019 internet services. Schools \nlike Arrupe Jesuit High School, a Catholic school in \none of West Denver\u2019s historic Chicano neighborhoods,3 \ngets a 90% discount on its internet service\u2014thus \nproviding students 10 times more service than it could \notherwise get for the same dollars.

Id.6  \nThese funds are essential to schools and libraries, \nand there would be hard budgetary choices to be \nmade\u2014requiring large cuts to life-altering pro-\ngrams\u2014if these dollars go away. And beyond budgets, \nthe E-Rate program has created new opportunities for \ninnovation. Most notably, as many schools shifted to \nremote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic, Con-\ngress authorized funding through the FCC to assist \nschools in providing internet access to support remote \nlearning.

These investments have in turn fueled an ex-\nplosion in educational innovation, as more and more \nfamilies explore online education, microschools, and \nother nontraditional formats. E.g., Dana Goldstein, A \nSchool With 7 Students: Inside the \u2018Microschools\u2019 \nMovement, N.Y. \nTIMES \n(June \n17, \n2024), https://www.nytimes.com/2024/06/17/us/public\n-schools-education-voucher-microschools.html. \nEdu-\ncational demands change just as fast as telecommuni-\ncations technology does\u2014and through the Fund\u2019s \npaired mandates and subsidies, the FCC has honored \nCongress\u2019 goal that the nature of covered service must \nevolve over time.  \nAs Congress intended, the E-Rate program has \nprovided universal connectedness for schools and li-\nbraries, kept up to date with the latest technology and \nmost pressing national needs, allowing Amici to pre-\npare a new generation of technologically proficient \nstudents to enter the workforce.  \n \n \n \n\n22 \n \n4. \nThe Lifeline Program Has Benefit-\nted Tribes and Low-Income Users.  \nSince even before the 1996 Act, the Commission\u2019s \nLifeline program helped low-income consumers pur-\nchase phone lines. Congress made clear that it wanted \nthat program to continue when it passed the 1996 Act, \nstating that nothing in the act affected \u201cthe collection, \ndistribution, or administration of [that program].\u201d 47 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 254(j). And the program\u2014funded by the \nUSF\u2014has continued to operate, making modern tele-\ncommunications available to individuals throughout \nthe nation regardless of their financial status.  \nAs of March 2024, the Commission\u2019s data demon-\nstrates that nearly 7.6 million subscribers have bene-\nfited from the Lifeline Program. UNIVERSAL SERV. \nADMIN. \nCO., \nLIFELINE \nPARTICIPATION \nRATE, \nhttps://www.usac.org/wp-content/uploads/lifeline/doc-\numents/Data/Lifeline-Participation-Rate.xlsx. \nBut \njust as with the programs above, the numbers do not \ntell the whole story. The benefits provided through the \nLifeline Program make it possible for people to have a \nphone they can answer when their work schedule \nchanges unexpectedly. They allow everyone in the \ncountry to access information so they can participate \nin the political process. These benefits are founda-\ntional to the ability to participate in modern society, \nconsistent with Congress\u2019 goals. \n\n23 \n \n5. \nThe Loss of These Programs Will \nHarm the Many Constituencies That \nRely on Them in Expected and Unex-\npected Ways. \nEach of the programs and the benefits they pro-\nvide rely on the framework Congress created in direct-\ning the FCC to establish universal service. Their loss \nwould be nothing short of catastrophic. Broadband \nnetworks and whatever advanced technology follows it \nwould not reach rural America.7 Cash-strapped \nschools would lose the chance to provide their students \nwith the basic resources they need to thrive in the \nmodern world. Healthcare would be harder to access, \nand outcomes will be poorer. People with fewer eco-\nnomic resources would be that much less connected to \ntheir family, their friends, their work, and the nation. \nLarge swaths of America\u2014contrary to Congress\u2019 in-\ntent\u2014would be left behind. \n \n7 A recent survey by NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Associa-\ntion\u2014found that 68% of respondent broadband service providers \n(mostly small or rural broadband providers) said that, if the Fund \nwere abolished, they would need to cancel deployment projects \nequaling over $1 billion, which represents nearly 79% of the pro-\nviders\u2019 planned broadband investments for 2025. Similarly, 71% \nof respondents indicated they would need to cancel 2026 deploy-\nment projects, equaling nearly $900 million and representing \nnearly 83% of planned investments for 2026. Press Release, \nNTCA-The Rural Broadband Ass\u2019n, NTCA Survey Highlights \nSignificant Risks of Skyrocketing Consumer Bills, Plummeting \nBroadband Investment & Loans in Peril if USF Support were \nEliminated \n(Sept. \n4, \n2024), \nhttps://www.ntca.org/ru-\nraliscool/newsroom/press-releases/2024/4/ntca-survey-high-\nlights-significant-risks-skyrocketing (NTCA Survey). The loss of \ninvestment is not hypothetical, it will be overwhelming. \n\n24 \n \nEach of these consequences is obvious. But they \ndo not tell the full story. The RDOF component of the \nHigh Cost Program provides a stark example of the \nless obvious, indirect impacts that would flow from up-\nending the USF. Through RDOF, broadband providers \nbuild networks at significant upfront expense using \ntheir own capital and debt and then recoup costs \nthrough annual RDOF reimbursements over 10 years. \nFor example, a $10 million RDOF award is paid out at \na rate of $1 million per year for 10 years. RDOF re-\nquires the broadband provider to meet certain build \nout requirements:  \n40% complete by end of year 3.  \n60% complete by end of year 4.  \n80% complete by end of year 5.  \n100% complete by end of year 6. \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.802(c).  \nTo continue with the example, then, by year 3, the \nprovider has already spent at least $1 million more \nthan they have received and by year 6, $4 million \nmore. This structure creates a built-in mismatch be-\ntween the up-front expense of building the network \nand when USF money is dispersed.  \nIf the RDOF payments were terminated before \nthe full subsidy is received because the program ends, \nproviders would not be fully compensated for their \nlarge up-front broadband construction expenses. So, \nbeyond the lack of broadband expansion into rural \nAmerica that would likely occur, RDOF-awarded \nbroadband providers who were \u201centiced\u201d to build \nthrough the RDOF program would be left only partly \ncompensated. \n\n25 \n \nThat gap in funding would then have follow-on ef-\nfects. The debt the broadband providers accepted in \nreliance on the RDOF funding must still be paid or the \nprovider could be forced into bankruptcy. Indeed, \nwhen NTCA\u2014The Rural Broadband Association con-\nducted a survey of the potential impacts of the loss of \nUSF funding on its members, 61% of respondents in-\ndicated they would likely default on loans within the \nnext three years. NTCA Survey. And because 70% per-\ncent of service-provider respondents with outstanding \ndebt indicated their loans were with the U.S. Depart-\nment of Agriculture, id., taxpayers may ultimately \nfoot the bill for broadband service provider bankrupt-\ncies. \nThis pattern of disrupted expectations would oc-\ncur throughout the USF\u2019s programs. Schools, hospi-\ntals, and libraries that signed long-term broadband \nagreements in reliance on the E-Rate program would \nbe left with large, unfunded contractual obligations. \nThat money will need to come from somewhere else \nwhether it be teacher salaries, programming, sup-\nplies, or other improvements that would have to be for-\ngone. \nSimilarly, the loss of the Lifeline Program means \nthat broadband service providers, local phone compa-\nnies, small rural electric cooperatives, and other pro-\nviders would not only lose the supplement the Lifeline \nProgram provides, they may also lose subscribers who \ncan no longer afford the services without the discount. \nThose losses doubly harm the companies which rely on \nnot just the Lifeline Program, but also on the subscrib-\ners\u2019 payment to stay afloat. \n\n26 \n \nThe end of the USF would have many negative \nconsequences, particularly for the direct beneficiaries \nof the universal service Congress sought to create. But \nit would also result in the many participants who help \nthe Nation stay connected and provide vital services \nacross the country\u2014who relied on a long-standing, \nsuccessful program that Congress created in compli-\nance with this Court\u2019s precedent\u2014being left to face the \nconsequences of its disappearance on their own. \nII. This Case Is a Poor Vehicle to Revisit the \nNondelegation Doctrine. \nA. Congress\u2019 Universal Service Program Is \nGuided by an Intelligible Principle that \nHas Allowed the FCC to Permissibly Im-\nplement Congress\u2019 Policy Decisions. \nThe programs described above implement the pol-\nicy decisions Congress made when it passed the 1996 \nAct. It was Congress\u2014not the FCC or USAC\u2014that de-\ntermined that everyone in the country should have ac-\ncess \nto \nthe \nsame \ntypes \nof \n\u201cadvanced \ntelecommunications and information services\u201d regard-\nless of their location or income. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(b)(2). \nAnd it was Congress that determined that the costs of \nproviding these services should be borne by telecom-\nmunication carriers at levels \u201csufficient\u201d to achieve \nCongress\u2019 vision. 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(d). \nTo avoid an impermissible delegation of legisla-\ntive power to an agency, Congress need only provide \nan \u201cintelligible principle\u201d that guides an agency\u2019s ac-\ntions. Whitman v. Am. Trucking Ass\u2019n, 531 U.S. 457, \n472 (2001); J.W. Hampton, Jr. & Co. v. United States, \n276 U.S. 394, 409 (1928). In other words, Congress \nmust make \u201cclear to the delegee \u2018the general policy\u2019 he \n\n27 \n \nmust pursue and the \u2018boundaries of [his] authority.\u2019\u201d \nGundy v. United States, 588 U.S. 128, 146 (2019) (plu-\nrality) (quoting Am. Power & Light Co. v. SEC, 329 \nU.S. 90, 105 (1946)).  \nThe 1996 Act more than satisfies this standard. \nThe Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, in considering this \nsame issue, described in detail how Congress had \nmade the important policy choices and limited the \nCommission\u2019s authority. Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, \n67 F.4th 773, 788\u201395 (6th Cir. 2023), cert. denied 144 \nS. Ct. 2628 (Mem.) (2024). As that court found, Con-\ngress set out in statute:  \n\u2022 what Congress intended for the Commission \nto pursue; \n\u2022 how the Commission must fund its efforts, \nincluding who must pay and how to calcu-\nlate the payment amounts; \n\u2022 the methods the Commission must use to \npromote universal service;  \n\u2022 who Congress intended to benefit from uni-\nversal service; and \n\u2022 the kinds of services Congress intended to be \nsupported. \nId. (discussing the standards from 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254). \nThese directives offer far more than a mere intel-\nligible principle; they set out a comprehensive struc-\nture for how to achieve Congress\u2019 goal of providing \nuniversal service and give authority to the Commis-\nsion to \u201cfill up the details.\u201d Gundy, 588 U.S. at 157 \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting).  \n\n28 \n \nTake, for example, the determination of which \nservices are part of universal service. Congress laid \nout specific factors the Commission would need to con-\nsider before setting the terms of \u201cuniversal service\u201d: \n\u2022 is the service \u201cessential to education, public \nhealth, or public safety\u201d; \n\u2022 has the service \u201cthrough the operation of \nmarket choices by customers, been sub-\nscribed to by a substantial majority of resi-\ndential customers\u201d\u2019; \n\u2022 is the service \u201cbeing deployed in public tele-\ncommunications networks by telecommuni-\ncations carriers\u201d; and \n\u2022 is providing the service \u201cconsistent with the \npublic interest, convenience, and necessity.\u201d \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(c)(1). \nAnd just over a year after the passage of the 1996 \nAct, the Commission\u2014with the assistance of the Joint \nBoard\u2014applied Congress\u2019 factors when considering at \nleast ten different types of services to determine \nwhether they should be part of the initial universal \nservice Congress intended to create. Universal Ser-\nvice, 62 Fed. Reg. 32862-01, 32863\u201366 (June 17, 1997). \nThus, \u201c\u2018Congress, the courts, and the public\u2019\u201d can look \nto the Commission\u2019s actions, compare them against \nthe criteria Congress set forth, and determine \n\u201cwhether Congress\u2019s guidance has been followed.\u201d \nGundy, 588 U.S. at 158, 166 (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) \n(quoting Yakus v. United States, 321 U.S. 414, 426 \n(1944)). Here, Congress\u2019 guidance has been followed. \nAs described above, the USF\u2014funded by carrier con-\n\n29 \n \ntributions\u2014has increased access to advanced telecom-\nmunications and information services to communities \nthroughout the nation, all as Congress intended.  \nIn creating the USF, Congress went beyond the \ntypes of very broad principles this Court has previ-\nously approved as setting forth an intelligible princi-\nple; moreover, it reached the consensus necessary to \nmake the difficult policy choices embodied in the USF \nprogram and told the Commission how to permissibly \nimplement those policies. Nothing in the USF\u2019s struc-\nture violates this Court\u2019s nondelegation jurispru-\ndence.  \nB. The Assistance USAC Provides to the \nFCC in Achieving Congress\u2019 Universal \nService Directives Does Not Violate the \nPrivate Nondelegation Doctrine. \nThis Court has long held that private parties can-\nnot exercise legislative power. See, e.g., Currin v. Wal-\nlace, 306 U.S. 1, 15\u201316 (1939) (collecting cases). For \nexample, empowering a majority of coal producers and \nminers in a given area to set maximum working hours \nand minimum wages for all producers and miners was \nan unconstitutional delegation of legislative power. \nSee Carter v. Carter Coal Co., 298 U.S. 238, 310\u201312 \n(1936). \nBy contrast, the private nondelegation doctrine is \nnot offended when private actors operate under the \n\u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d of a government agency \nbut lack their own \u201claw-making\u201d authority. Sunshine \nAnthracite Coal Co. v. Adkins, 310 U.S. 381, 387\u201388, \n399 (1940). In Sunshine Anthracite, coal producers \ncould become members of the Bituminous Coal Code, \n\n30 \n \nand Code members would be broken into twenty dis-\ntrict boards. While those boards could make various \ntypes of proposals to the National Bituminous Coal \nCommission within the Department of the Interior, in-\ncluding proposals regarding minimum pricing, the \nCommission was the final authority that decided \nwhether those proposals became law. Id. at 388. Ac-\ncordingly, there was no delegation of authority to the \nprivate actors because the private actors lacked inde-\npendent authority. The program was \u201cunquestionably \nvalid.\u201d Id. at 399. \nUSAC, too, lacks independent authority and is un-\nquestionably valid. USAC\u2019s operations are dictated by \nand subject to the FCC. See generally 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7\u00a7 54.701\u2013.717. And the FCC\u2019s rules make clear that \nUSAC operates under the FCC\u2019s authority and sur-\nveillance and has no law-making power. Indeed, by \nlaw, USAC cannot even \u201cinterpret unclear provisions \nof the statute or rules, or interpret the intent of Con-\ngress.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(c). USAC is required to \nbring those types of questions to the FCC. Id.  \nInstead, USAC engages in administrative func-\ntions like billing carriers, creating websites, and filing \nreports with Congress and the Commission. See, e.g., \n47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(b), (f)-(h). And it performs all of its \nfunctions subject to the FCC\u2019s oversight, including an \nannual audit that must be approved by the FCC\u2019s ad-\nministrative staff and filed with the FCC for its re-\nview. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.717. \nTo be sure, part of USAC\u2019s administrative func-\ntion includes proposing calculations that will set how \nmuch carriers pay to support the universal service \nprograms. But even there, USAC has no authority to \n\n31 \n \nset the contributions. Whether to accept USAC\u2019s pro-\nposed calculations is entirely within the FCC\u2019s discre-\ntion. 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.709(a)(3). At no point can USAC \nexercise law-making authority. \nNothing about how USAC is structured and how \nit supports the universal service programs under the \nFCC\u2019s \u201cauthority and surveillance\u201d offends the private \nnondelegation doctrine, as both the Sixth and Elev-\nenth Circuits found. Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 \nF.4th 917, 925\u201328 (11th Cir. 2023); Consumers\u2019 Rsch. \nv. FCC, 67 F.4th 773, 795\u201397 (6th Cir. 2023).8 Just as \nCongress appropriately authorized the FCC to fill in \nthe gaps when executing Congress\u2019 vision for univer-\nsal service, the FCC properly created USAC to help \nadminister the universal service programs under the \nFCC\u2019s authority and supervision. \nC. Continuation of the USF Promotes Co-\noperative Federalism. \nOther state amici have urged this Court to deem \nthe USF unconstitutional as a means of promoting fed-\neralism, but that argument gets it backwards. See Br. \nof Amici Curiae State of West Virginia, 14 Other \nStates, and the Arizona Legislature in Support of \nGranting the Petition (States\u2019 Cert. Amicus) at 3, 13\u2013\n17. Contrary to their generalized assertions that \u201cfed-\neral agencies are a particular threat to States\u2019 inter-\nests,\u201d id. at 15, in the 1996 Act, Congress established \n \n8 The opinion below expressed concern over how the FCC has \nexercised its authority over USAC. See App. pp. 5a\u20137a. But that \nis a practical concern that can be dealt with through multiple \nproper channels, see infra \u00a7 II.D, and does not provide a legal ba-\nsis for invalidating the program.  \n\n32 \n \nwhat has long been considered \u201cperhaps the most am-\nbitious cooperative federalism regulatory program to \ndate.\u201d Philip J. Weiser, Federal Common Law, Coop-\nerative Federalism, and the Enforcement of the Tele-\ncom Act, 76 N.Y.U. L. REV. 1692, 1694 (2001); see also \nTejas N. Narechania & Erik Stallman, Internet Feder-\nalism, 34 HARV. J.L. & TECH. 547, 610\u201314 (2021). In-\ndeed, Section 254\u2019s first provision requires the \ncreation of a \u201cFederal-State Joint Board\u201d that must \nwork with the FCC to \u201crecommend changes\u201d to any \nFCC regulations, including establishing \u201cthe defini-\ntion of the services that are supported by Federal uni-\nversal service support mechanisms and a specific \ntimetable for completion of such recommendations.\u201d \n47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(a)(1). Moreover, when Congress was \nconsidering the 1996 Act, states pressed for explicit \nuniversal service supports\u2014and Congress listened by \nenacting Section 254. 140 CONG. REC. 14816\u201317 (1994) \n(reprinting a letter from the National Association of \nAttorneys General urging Congress to, among other \nthings, \u201cpreserve and promote universal telephone \nservice at fair, reasonable and affordable rates and \nalso provide a clear, broad definition of universal ser-\nvice\u201d); see Edwin A.

Striking down Section 254 would therefore \ndestroy, rather than promote, the USF\u2019s robust system \nof cooperative federalism.  \nD. Implementation of the USF is Transpar-\nent and Does Not Implicate the Nondele-\ngation Doctrine\u2019s Concerns. \nThe FCC has implemented the USF in compliance \nwith Congress\u2019 statutory principles and consistent \nwith the principles of cooperative federalism that are \nembedded in the 1996 Act. To the extent there are con-\ncerns regarding the USF\u2019s operations, there are mul-\ntiple channels through which those concerns can be \nidentified and addressed to prevent the program from \nexceeding its statutory remit. \n1. \nGovernmental Oversight. \nThe FCC\u2019s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) \nactively oversees the USF to ensure compliance with \nthe 1996 Act. See, e.g., CONG. RSCH. SERV., RL33979, \n\n35 \n \nUNIVERSAL SERVICE FUND: BACKGROUND AND OPTIONS \nFOR REFORM 15 (Oct. 25, 2011) (CRS REPORT). As part \nof that oversight, the OIG regularly conducts or ar-\nranges for the completion of audits of all four USF pro-\ngrams and of USF contributors. Id. Beginning in 2006, \nthis \u201clarge-scale beneficiary audit program\u201d consisted \nof 459 audits of USF program participants.

(Jan. 14, 2021), https://www.fcc.gov \n/sites/default/files/fcc-letter-to-usac-01142021.pdf. \n2. \nCongressional Oversight. \nCongress itself also maintains substantial control \nand oversight over the USF. For one thing, Congress \nregularly holds oversight hearings regarding the FCC \nand the USF. See, e.g., CRS REPORT 25\u201327 (detailing \noversight in the 111th and 112th Congresses). Con-\ngress has also repeatedly required the FCC to provide \ninformation to enable Congress to review its activities. \nFor example, in the Infrastructure Investment and \nJobs Act of 2021, Congress directed the FCC to pre-\npare a report on the future of universal service. Infra-\nstructure Investment and Jobs Act, Pub. L. No. 117-\n58, \u00a7 60104, 135 Stat. 429, 1205\u201306 (2021); see also, \ne.g., Dep\u2019ts of Commerce, Justice, and State, the Judi-\nciary, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 1998, \nPub. L. No. 105-119, \u00a7 623, 111 Stat. 2440, 2521\u201322 \n(1997) (requiring similar reporting to Congress). \nBased on the information Congress collects at these \noversight hearings and through these other directives, \nCongress can amend Section 254 as needed to ensure \ncompliance with its intent. \nAnd Congress has repeatedly amended Section \n254 since it was enacted, demonstrating that it can \nstep in when it wants. In 2016, for example, Congress \nadded skilled nursing facilities to the categories of \n\n37 \n \nhealth care providers eligible to receive USF funds un-\nder the Rural Health Care program. See Frank R. \nLautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act, \nPub. L. No. 114-182, \u00a7 202, 130 Stat. 448, 512 (2016) \n(codified as amended at 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 254(h)(7)(B)). \nMore recently, Congress directed the FCC to promul-\ngate regulations for E-Rate to cover equipment for re-\nmote learning during the COVID-19 pandemic. \nAmerican Rescue Plan Act of 2021, Pub. L. No. 117-2, \n\u00a7 7402, 135 Stat. 4, 109\u201310. Congress has also directed \nthe FCC to make uniform the methodology for collect-\ning coverage data. Consolidated Appropriations Act, \n2018, Pub. L. No. 115-141, \u00a7 505, 132 Stat. 348, 1094\u2013\n95. And Congress has directed the FCC to require in-\nternet safety policies by schools and libraries receiving \nE-Rate support. Consolidated Appropriations\u2014FY \n2001, Pub. L. No. 106-554, \u00a7 1721, 114 Stat. 2763, \n2763A-343\u201350 (2000) (codified as amended at 47 \nU.S.C. 254(h)).  \nThe court below noted that some of these over-\nsight mechanisms have uncovered overpayments or \nthe misuse of funds under the USF. See App. at 8a-9a. \nFor instance, in 2018, the FCC proposed a $63.5 mil-\nlion fine against American Broadband and Telecom-\nmunications Company, which at the time was the \nlargest ever proposed for violations of the Lifeline \nrules, for repeated, systematic, and large-scale viola-\ntions of the Lifeline rules, including seeking Lifeline \nsupport for more than 12,000 deceased individuals. \nAmerican Broadband & Telecommunications Com-\npany, 33 FCC Rcd. 10308 (2018).  \nBut to the extent the OIG or Congress identifies a \nneed for improvement in the implementation of the \n\n38 \n \n1996 Act, the responsibility falls on Congress to ad-\ndress those issues. Even Respondents\u2019 amici agree \nthat \u201cCongress needs to be the one to act here.\u201d States\u2019 \nCert. Amicus 2; see also id. at 4 (arguing that separa-\ntion of powers requires that Congress \u201ccan[not] dele-\ngate to the Courts, or to any other tribunals \u2026 powers \nwhich are strictly and exclusively legislative.\u201d (quot-\ning Wayman v. Southard, 23 U.S. 1, 42 (1825)). Thus, \nto the extent there are any concerns about USAC or \nthe FCC\u2019s implementation of the 1996 Act, separation \nof powers principles dictate that Congress\u2014not the \ncourts\u2014should resolve those issues, as it has done \nmany times before. \n3. \nChecks on and Challenges to USAC \nand FCC Determinations. \nLastly, several mechanisms ensure that the USF \nremains accountable to Congress and that USAC re-\nmains accountable to the FCC by allowing for chal-\nlenges to both entities\u2019 actions. \nThe FCC conducts meaningful review of USAC\u2019s \nactions. In 2023 alone, the FCC twice elected not to \nadopt USAC\u2019s projections when setting the quarterly \ncontribution factor. See, e.g., Proposed Fourth Quarter \n2023 Universal Service Contribution Factor, 38 FCC \nRcd. 8362, 8362 (Sept. 13, 2023); Proposed Third \nQuarter 2023 Universal Service Contribution Factor, \n38 FCC Rcd. 5670, 5670 (June 14, 2023); Revised Sec-\nond Quarter 2003 Universal Service Contribution Fac-\ntor, 18 FCC Rcd. 5097, 5097 (Mar. 21, 2003). The FCC \nhas exercised this check before as well. See, e.g.,  First \nQuarter 1998 Universal Service Contribution Factors \nRevised and Approved, 12 FCC Rcd. 21881, 21886 \n(Dec. 16, 1997). \n\n39 \n \nSpecific rules and regulations also ensure that \nUSAC remains subordinate to the FCC and subject to \nthe FCC\u2019s \u201cauthority and surveillance.\u201d Sunshine An-\nthracite, 310 U.S. at 399. For instance, the FCC has \ndirected that if the 1996 Act or its implementing reg-\nulations \u201care unclear, or do not address a particular \nsituation, the Administrator [USAC] shall seek guid-\nance from the Commission.\u201d 47 C.F.R. \u00a7 54.702(c). \nFurther, any carrier that is allegedly aggrieved by \nUSAC\u2019s actions may challenge those actions by seek-\ning de novo review before the FCC. 47 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 54.719(b). And any decision that the FCC renders \nfrom such a challenge is binding on USAC going for-\nward. Consumers\u2019 Research v. FCC, 88 F.4th 917, 928 \n(11th Cir. 2023).  \nBeyond that, as was done here, decisions issued \nby the FCC may be scrutinized by the courts. 47 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 402 (appeals may be taken from decisions and orders \nof the Commission). And through the Hobbs Act\u2014Sec-\ntion 2342 of Title 28 of the U.S. Code\u2014Congress \ngranted the courts of appeals exclusive jurisdiction \u201cto \nenjoin, set aside, suspend (in whole or in part), or to \ndetermine the validity of all final orders of the [FCC] \nmade reviewable\u201d by 47 U.S.C. \u00a7 402; see Sandwich \nIsles Commc\u2019ns, Inc. v. United States, 992 F.3d 1355, \n1362 (Fed. Cir. 2021). \nIn short, there are multiple checks on the FCC \nand USAC in their execution of Congress\u2019 mandate to \nprovide universal service. The USF is a highly success-\nful, state-and-federal partnership that the FCC has \noperated pursuant to Congress\u2019 direction and under \nthe supervision of Congress and the courts. It should \neasily pass constitutional muster. \n\n40 \n \nCONCLUSION \nAmici respectfully request that the Court reverse \nthe lower court\u2019s decision. \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nPHILIP J.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case continues to solidify around a specific predicted outcome, while the nature of my uncertainty has become more focused and refined. This observation, being an internal reflection, serves to consolidate the learnings from the previous step and sharpen my analytical focus.\n\nMy foundational model, built on the government's arguments (*Whitman*, *Sunshine Anthracite*), the challenger's nondelegation theories, and stakeholder concerns, has been powerfully updated by the expert simulations discovered previously. My current belief state is:\n\n*   **High-Confidence Prediction:** I now have a strong prior belief in a 6-3 decision upholding the FCC's authority. The convergence of multiple expert simulations (from Mayer Brown, Covington & Burling, and Oyez) on this exact outcome, with the same judicial alignment, provides a robust, though not definitive, anchor for my prediction.\n*   **Predicted Majority (Roberts, Kagan, Sotomayor, Kavanaugh, Barrett, Jackson):** The cross-ideological nature of this predicted coalition strongly suggests the ruling will be grounded in established precedent, not a radical reinterpretation of delegation doctrines.\n*   **Predicted Majority Reasoning:** The legal path to victory for the FCC seems clear and well-trodden.\n    *   **Public Delegation:** The Court will likely find the \"intelligible principle\" test is satisfied. The statutory mandate to ensure \"sufficient\" funding will be interpreted as a meaningful constraint, providing both a floor and a ceiling, thus defeating the challenger's argument that the delegation is boundless.\n    *   **Private Delegation:** The FCC's relationship with USAC will be deemed constitutional under the *Sunshine Anthracite* precedent. The key facts are that the FCC retains all final decision-making power and USAC's role is merely advisory and ministerial (\"doing the arithmetic\").\n    *   **Rejection of \"Combination\" Theory:** The novel argument that two individually permissible delegations become unconstitutional when combined is expected to be explicitly rejected by the Court.\n*   **Predicted Dissent (Gorsuch, Thomas, Alito):** The dissent is expected to argue that the USF contribution is functionally a \"tax\" and that delegating the power to tax requires a much higher degree of specificity from Congress (e.g., a rate or cap), which is absent here.\n*   **Shift in Core Uncertainty:** The central mystery is no longer *if* the government can win on the merits based on existing law, but *why* the Solicitor General asked the Court to hold this case for *Wisconsin Bell*. The straightforward legal victory outlined in the simulations makes the request for a hold puzzling. The absence of any mention of *Wisconsin Bell* in these detailed simulations deepens the mystery. This discrepancy is now the most significant point of uncertainty in my model. My immediate goal is to resolve this question, as it could signal a hidden complexity not captured by the simulations.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level methodology has been significantly enhanced by reflecting on the outcome of my previous action. The process of analyzing a failed search and its unexpected but valuable results has proven to be a powerful engine for learning.\n\nMy established heuristics remain valid and have been reinforced:\n1.  **Framework-First & Analyzing Both Sides:** Essential for initial understanding.\n2.  **Argument Framing & Types:** Crucial for seeing how framing (e.g., \"fee\" vs. \"tax\") dictates the legal test.\n3.  **Track the Intellectual Pedigree:** Identifying key precedents (*Whitman*, *Sunshine Anthracite*) remains the most efficient way to map the legal battlefield.\n4.  **The Solicitor General is a Special Source:** The SG's arguments are a high-fidelity signal. The mystery of the SG's \"hold\" request reinforces the importance of scrutinizing every part of their filings.\n\nMy methodology has evolved with the following powerful additions and refinements:\n5.  **Embrace the DBOED Loop (Analyze -> Identify Uncertainty -> Plan):** This observation is a perfect demonstration of the loop's power. The `THINK` step itself is a critical component, allowing for reflection, synthesis of unexpected findings, re-evaluation of uncertainty, and the formulation of a more precise subsequent action. It formalizes the process of learning from both success and failure.\n6.  **Seek and Analyze Expert Simulations:** Law firm \"decision alerts\" and similar expert analyses are a new, high-value source type. They provide a \"ghost model\" of a potential outcome. The strategy is to find multiple simulations, check for convergence in outcome and reasoning, and use any consensus to form a strong prior.\n7.  **Account for Tool Fallibility and Unexpected Results:** Information-gathering tools can fail or produce unexpected outputs. I must always verify results and be prepared to analyze serendipitous discoveries, which can be more informative than the intended result.\n8.  **Distinguish Between Search Failure and Information Absence:** A failed search query does not prove the non-existence of information. It is a signal to refine the search strategy.\n9.  **Treat Simulated Data as Strong, but Not Definitive, Evidence:** Simulations are powerful priors, not ground truth. They must be tagged as \"simulated,\" and the strategy must continue to seek real-world evidence to confirm or disconfirm them. Discrepancies between simulations and other evidence (like the *Wisconsin Bell* issue) are particularly valuable signals of deeper complexity.\n10. **Investigate Inter-Case Dependencies via Primary Sources:** When a dependency on another case (like *Wisconsin Bell*) is identified, the most effective strategy is not a broad web search, but a targeted search within the primary source documents (petitions, briefs) of the *current* case. This reveals how the parties themselves are framing the connection, which is the most relevant context."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been substantially reinforced and detailed by this observation, even as the specific mystery I sought to solve remains elusive. The failure of the search has paradoxically provided significant clarity.\n\nMy core prediction of a 6-3 decision upholding the FCC remains firm and is now supported by a broader evidentiary base. The expert simulations provided the skeleton of the likely outcome, and this new observation has added significant muscle and connective tissue.\n\n*   **High-Confidence Prediction (Stable):** I maintain a strong belief in a 6-3 decision affirming the Eleventh Circuit, with the government prevailing on both delegation questions. The coalition of amici supporting the FCC (rural broadband providers, a bipartisan group of 22 states) demonstrates a wide consensus on the legality and necessity of the Universal Service Fund (USF), making a radical departure from precedent less likely.\n*   **Predicted Majority & Reasoning (Reinforced and Detailed):** The arguments presented in the new amicus briefs align perfectly with and add depth to my previously predicted majority reasoning.\n    *   **Public Delegation (Intelligible Principle):** The argument that Congress provided a sufficient \"intelligible principle\" is strengthened. The briefs emphasize the long history of universal service as a guiding policy goal since the 1934 Communications Act, suggesting the 1996 Act didn't create a power out of thin air but rather codified and updated a long-standing principle.\n    *   **Private Delegation (Ministerial Role of USAC):** My belief that the Court will find USAC's role constitutional under *Sunshine Anthracite* is now much more detailed. The WTA amicus brief provides crucial history, explaining that a similar industry-managed entity (NECA, the National Exchange Carrier Association) was created in the 1980s under FCC supervision to manage subsidies. This establishes a direct historical precedent for the USAC structure, making it appear less like a novel delegation and more like an evolution of an accepted practice. The briefs confirm that USAC's role is ministerial\u2014calculating figures based on FCC-set formulas and budget caps\u2014and that the FCC retains all final decision-making and \"pervasive surveillance authority.\"\n    *   **Rejection of Fifth Circuit's Premises:** The amicus briefs provide direct counter-evidence to the Fifth Circuit's reasoning. Crucially, the WTA brief refutes the claim that the FCC is \"immunized from the oversight Congress exercises through the regular appropriations process\" by citing a specific section (SEC. 511) of the 2024 appropriations act that directly legislates on the USF. This is a powerful factual rebuttal that the Supreme Court is likely to find persuasive.\n*   **Predicted Dissent (Stable):** My model of the dissent (Gorsuch, Thomas, Alito) arguing this is an unconstitutional delegation of a taxing power remains unchanged. The amicus briefs' characterization of the USF contribution as a long-standing industry-financed mechanism, not a tax, serves to frame the majority's likely counterargument.\n*   **Resolution of Core Uncertainty (Shifted):** The mystery of the Solicitor General's request to hold this case for *Wisconsin Bell* has transformed. My targeted search within the docket for \"Wisconsin Bell\" yielded no substantive discussion of the case in the top results, which included major amicus briefs. This \"informative null result\" strongly suggests that the *Wisconsin Bell* connection is not central to the merits of the case as argued by key stakeholders. The mystery is no longer \"why did the SG do this?\" but rather \"was this ever important at all?\" I now believe it is likely a procedural artifact, a tangential issue that has since become moot, or a strategic gambit that did not gain traction. Its absence from the discourse of major amici diminishes its predictive value to near zero. My uncertainty has now shifted away from this external dependency and back to the precise language the majority will use to cabin its ruling.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable for refining my meta-level strategies, particularly in how to interpret search failures and leverage different types of legal documents.\n\nMy foundational heuristics remain robust and have been built upon:\n1.  **Framework-First & Analyzing Both Sides:** Still the essential starting point.\n2.  **Argument Framing & Types:** Still crucial. The \"fee vs. tax\" and \"ministerial vs. legislative\" frames are central.\n3.  **Track the Intellectual Pedigree:** Still the most efficient method. The addition of the pre-1996 history (Ozark Plan, NECA) provides a deeper and more compelling pedigree for the government's position.\n4.  **The Solicitor General is a Special Source (Nuanced):** The SG's filings are a high-fidelity signal, but not every procedural request is a signal about the core merits. The SG may make strategic requests that don't pan out or become moot. The key is to cross-reference the SG's signals with the arguments being made by other parties and amici. If a point is dropped or ignored by others, its importance to the final outcome is likely low.\n\nMy methodology has evolved with these powerful refinements:\n5.  **Embrace the DBOED Loop:** This process continues to prove its worth. The failure to find information about *Wisconsin Bell* was not a dead end; it was a critical data point that allowed me to re-evaluate and downgrade the importance of a variable in my model.\n6.  **Seek and Analyze Expert Simulations:** This remains a high-value strategy for generating a strong initial prediction.\n7.  **Account for Tool Fallibility and Unexpected Results:** Serendipitous discoveries remain valuable. The failure to find 'Wisconsin Bell' led to the discovery of highly relevant amicus briefs that strengthened my core prediction.\n8.  **Distinguish Between Search Failure and Information Absence (Refined):** A targeted search that fails to find a term *within relevant, substantive documents* is strong positive evidence of that term's lack of importance to the central arguments. This \"informative null result\" is a powerful tool for pruning unnecessary branches of inquiry and reducing uncertainty.\n9.  **Treat Simulated Data as Strong, but Not Definitive, Evidence:** This is reinforced. The simulations gave the outcome (6-3), but the amicus briefs are now providing the specific, concrete evidence (like the 2024 appropriations act) that makes that outcome legally defensible.\n10. **Investigate Inter-Case Dependencies via Primary Sources:** This strategy led to the \"informative null result\" that effectively resolved my uncertainty about *Wisconsin Bell*'s importance.\n11. **NEW - Leverage Amicus Briefs for Consensus and Context:** Amicus briefs are a premier source type. They should be actively sought to (a) gauge the degree of consensus around a particular legal argument, (b) source powerful, real-world factual evidence (e.g., specific statutory provisions, historical analogues like NECA), and (c) understand the different stakeholder perspectives (e.g., industry vs. states) that might influence the Court.\n12. **NEW - Follow the Consensus:** When multiple, diverse, and sophisticated amici (like industry groups and bipartisan state coalitions) converge on the same core legal arguments, it is a very strong signal that this represents the \"mainstream\" legal path. This path is often the one a majority of the Court will take to decide a case on established, precedential grounds rather than making new law."
