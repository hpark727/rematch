    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2012, Danny Rivers was convicted in Texas state court of multiple charges related to sexual abuse of a child and possession of child pornography. He filed his first federal habeas petition in August 2017 challenging these convictions, which was denied by the district court in September 2018. While his appeal of that denial was pending, Rivers filed a second habeas petition in February 2021 raising new claims after obtaining his attorney-client file through a state bar grievance in October 2019. The district court deemed this second petition \u201csuccessive\u201d under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (\u201cAEDPA\u201d) and transferred it to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit for authorization, but Rivers failed to file the required motion for authorization. After the Fifth Circuit ultimately affirmed the denial of his first petition in May 2022, Rivers appealed the transfer order of his second petition, arguing that it should have been treated as a motion to amend his first petition rather than as a successive petition since his first petition was still pending when he filed the second one.\n\nThe Fifth Circuit disagreed and affirmed the district court\u2019s dismissal of Rivers\u2019s second-in-time petition for lack of jurisdiction.",

June 2024) .................... 18, 21 \n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case is about the hurdles a prisoner must clear \nto amend his initial habeas application. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers asked a federal court to review his \nstate conviction, arguing that his counsel had failed \nto investigate his case and had shown up to trial \ndrunk. The district court denied relief, holding that \nRivers had not explained how he was prejudiced. But \nthe answer soon emerged. After fighting for years to \nobtain his lawyers\u2019 records, Rivers finally received \nthem while his case was on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found evidence suggesting he was wrongly \nconvicted: an exculpatory report that his counsel ap-\nparently overlooked. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nraced to court and sought to amend his petition\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. The courts below reasoned \nthat Rivers\u2019s amendment was actually a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application\u201d under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72244(b), divesting the district court of juris-\ndiction to consider it. \nThat was wrong. Congress has already decided \nwhat standard applies when a prisoner seeks to \namend a habeas application mid-appeal\u2014and it\u2019s not \n\u00a72244(b)(2). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242, an application \n\u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the \nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d Those \nrules, in turn, provide for just this situation. District \ncourts may not grant a motion to amend while an ap-\npeal is pending. But Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n62.1(a)(3) authorizes them to consider a such motion \nand state that it \u201craises a substantial issue.\u201d If the \ncourt of appeals agrees, it may vacate and remand, \nclearing the way for amendment. Fed. R. App. P. \n12.1(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106. \n\n2 \n \n \nNone of that happened here because the district \ncourt mistakenly thought that \u00a72244(b) barred Riv-\ners\u2019s filing. But \u00a72244(b) cannot be read to implicitly \nprohibit what \u00a72242 expressly permits. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister v. Davis, 590 \nU.S. 504 (2020), which looked to historical habeas \nand statutory aims when deciding whether a filing is \nsecond or successive. Both point the same way here. \nAs to history, habeas courts traditionally allowed \nprisoners to raise newly discovered evidence, and \ncourts routinely addressed filings like Rivers\u2019s on the \nmerits\u2014instead of deeming them successive. (This \nCourt was no exception.) And as to purposes, forcing \nmotions like Rivers\u2019s to run the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet \nwould have baleful implications for habeas practice, \nmaking it unlikely that Congress \u201cwould have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d 590 U.S. at 513. \nThe Fifth Circuit was also wrong to hold that \n\u00a72244(b) kicks in as soon as a district court enters fi-\nnal judgment, making all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings second or successive. Section 2244(b) functions \nas a statute of repose, ensuring that state prosecutors \ndon\u2019t have to defend the same conviction twice. But \nCongress did not recognize an interest in repose \nwhile a prisoner\u2019s initial petition remains pending. \nInstead, statutory context and historical practice \nshow that the dividing line between first and succes-\nsive petitions is the end of appellate review. Only \nthen does \u00a72244(b) apply. \nThis Court should reverse and remand so the dis-\ntrict court can consider Rivers\u2019s amendment under \nthe proper Rule 15 standard. \n\n3 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The dis-\ntrict court\u2019s unpublished opinion is available at 2021 \nWL 4319670 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. The petition was filed June 24, \n2024 and granted December 6, 2024. This Court has \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nSections 2106, 2242, and 2244(b) of Title 28 are re-\nproduced in the Appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal background \n1. This case concerns when a habeas filing should \nbe deemed a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b). \na. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This path begins \nin the district court. If that court denies relief, the \nprisoner may request a \u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d\u2014\ninitially from the district court, and then from the \ncourt of appeals. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. \n134, 143\u201344 & n.5 (2012). The path ends only when \nthe prisoner has exhausted the chance for review. \n\n4 \n \n \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. To file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b), a prisoner must first \nask the court of appeals for \u201can order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application,\u201d id. \n\u00a72244(b)(3)(A). The appellate court may oblige only if \nthe petition \u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of \nconstitutional law\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscover-\nable facts that would establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(2)). If \nso, the petition goes to the district court, which must \ndecide for itself whether the petition \u201csatisfies the re-\nquirements\u201d of \u00a72244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(4). Only \nthen may the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether a given \nfiling is deemed \u201cpart of resolving a prisoner\u2019s first \nhabeas application,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or in-\nstead a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus applica-\ntion.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b).  \nb. \u201c[S]econd or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of art\u201d that \ndoes not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 follow-\ning an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 \n(citations omitted). To determine when \u00a72244(b) ap-\nplies, \u201cthis Court has looked for guidance in two main \nplaces.\u201d Id. at 512. First, history: \u201cwhether a type of \nlater-in-time filing would have constituted an abuse \nof the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. \n(cleaned up) (citation omitted). Second, \u201cstatutory \naims\u201d: conserving judicial resources, reducing piece-\nmeal litigation, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a rea-\nsonable time.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313 (citation omitted). \n2. Two recent cases have required this Court to \nconsider whether a motion filed under a Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure was actually a second or successive \napplication. The Federal Rules \u201cgenerally govern ha-\n\n5 \n \n \nbeas proceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511; see Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 81(a)(4); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 Rule 12 (Federal \nRules apply \u201cto the extent they are not inconsistent \nwith\u201d a federal statute or Habeas Rule). When mo-\ntions authorized by a given Federal Rule constitute \nsecond or successive applications, however, AEDPA \n\u201cdisplaces\u201d the Federal Rule, and \u201call of \u00a72244(b)\u2019s re-\nstrictions kick in.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511. \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), involved a \nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. The pris-\noner there \u201cabandoned any attempt to seek review\u201d of \nthe order denying his habeas petition, waited a year, \nand then moved to reopen the case under Rule 60(b). \nId. at 527, 537. Because his motion challenged \u201ca \nnonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d the Court found \u201cno basis for contending that \n[it] should be treated like a habeas corpus applica-\ntion\u201d in the first place. Id. at 533\u201334. Had the prison-\ner\u2019s motion gone to the merits, however, the Court \nsuggested that it would have counted as a second or \nsuccessive application (or its functional equivalent). \nSee id. at 531\u201332. \nFive Terms ago, in Banister v. Davis, the Court \nfaced a similar question involving a Rule 59(e) motion \nto alter or amend a judgment. Under Rule 59(e), a \nparty may seek reconsideration up to 28 days after \nthe district court enters judgment, including on the \nbasis of \u201cnew arguments\u201d and \u201cnewly discovered or \npreviously unavailable evidence.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 508 n.2 (quoting 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice & P\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n22: 20250121162416057_Cert_of_Compliance_A.json (score: 0.435)\nRULE 33.1(h) CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nNo. 23-1345 \nDANNY RICHARD RIVERS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \nBOBBY LUMPKIN, DIRECTOR,  \nTEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,  \nCORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION, \nRespondent. \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I, Peter A.

Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 \n(2020). After that, prisoners who file a \u201csecond or suc-\ncessive habeas corpus application\u201d must satisfy the \nstringent gatekeeping requirements of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72244(b)(2). Here, petitioner sought to amend his ini-\ntial habeas application under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 15 while it was pending on appeal. The\nFifth Circuit deemed that filing a second or succes-\nsive application, subject to \u00a72244(b).\nThe question presented is whether \u00a72244(b)(2) ap-\nplies (i) only to habeas filings made after a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his first petition, \n(ii) to all habeas filings submitted after a district\ncourt enters judgment, or (iii) only to some post-final-\njudgment habeas filings.\n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

Procedural history ....................................  \n11 \nSummary of argument .........................................  \n13 \nArgument .............................................................  \n16 \nI. A motion to amend or supplement an  \ninitial habeas petition that is pending  \non appeal is not a \u201csecond or successive\u201d  \napplication ....................................................  \n16 \nA. Section 2242 permits prisoners to seek \nleave to amend or supplement their  \napplications while an appeal is pending. .  \n16 \n1.  Under \u00a72242, a habeas application \nmay be amended or supplemented  \nas provided in the rules of civil  \nprocedure ............................................  \n16 \n2.  The rules of civil procedure provide \nfor motions to amend or supplement \n\niv \n \n \n \na pleading while an appeal is  \npending ...............................................  \n17 \n3.  Section 2244(b) does not override \n\u00a72242 ...................................................  \n22 \nB. Historical practice confirms that mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motions are not second \nor successive habeas applications ...........  \n25 \n1.  The abuse-of-the-writ doctrine did \nnot foreclose petitions presenting \nnewly discovered evidence .................  \n25 \n2.  Habeas courts did not historically \ntreat mid-appeal Rule 15 motions  \nas successive. ......................................  \n27 \nC. AEDPA\u2019s aims favor treating mid-appeal \nRule 15 motions as part and parcel of \nthe initial application ..............................  \n31 \nD. Treating mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as \nsecond or successive would produce per-\nverse results .............................................  \n35 \nII. Alternatively, \u00a72244(b) applies only after \nthe initial petition is final on appeal ...........  \n37 \nA. Before AEDPA, courts applied abuse-of-\nthe-writ principles by reference to appel-\nlate review, not final judgment ...............  \n37 \nB. AEDPA itself pegs finality to the end of \nappellate review, not final judgment ......  \n39 \nC. A state\u2019s interest in repose does not vest \nuntil the end of appellate review .............  \n40 \nIII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary arguments  \nfail .................................................................  \n41 \nA.

Petitioner \nDanny Rivers asked a federal court to review his \nstate conviction, arguing that his counsel had failed \nto investigate his case and had shown up to trial \ndrunk. The district court denied relief, holding that \nRivers had not explained how he was prejudiced. But \nthe answer soon emerged. After fighting for years to \nobtain his lawyers\u2019 records, Rivers finally received \nthem while his case was on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found evidence suggesting he was wrongly \nconvicted: an exculpatory report that his counsel ap-\nparently overlooked. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nraced to court and sought to amend his petition\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. The courts below reasoned \nthat Rivers\u2019s amendment was actually a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application\u201d under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72244(b), divesting the district court of juris-\ndiction to consider it. \nThat was wrong. Congress has already decided \nwhat standard applies when a prisoner seeks to \namend a habeas application mid-appeal\u2014and it\u2019s not \n\u00a72244(b)(2). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242, an application \n\u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the \nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d Those \nrules, in turn, provide for just this situation. District \ncourts may not grant a motion to amend while an ap-\npeal is pending. But Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n62.1(a)(3) authorizes them to consider a such motion \nand state that it \u201craises a substantial issue.\u201d If the \ncourt of appeals agrees, it may vacate and remand, \nclearing the way for amendment. Fed. R. App. P. \n12.1(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106. \n\n2 \n \n \nNone of that happened here because the district \ncourt mistakenly thought that \u00a72244(b) barred Riv-\ners\u2019s filing. But \u00a72244(b) cannot be read to implicitly \nprohibit what \u00a72242 expressly permits. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister v. Davis, 590 \nU.S. 504 (2020), which looked to historical habeas \nand statutory aims when deciding whether a filing is \nsecond or successive. Both point the same way here. \nAs to history, habeas courts traditionally allowed \nprisoners to raise newly discovered evidence, and \ncourts routinely addressed filings like Rivers\u2019s on the \nmerits\u2014instead of deeming them successive. (This \nCourt was no exception.) And as to purposes, forcing \nmotions like Rivers\u2019s to run the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet \nwould have baleful implications for habeas practice, \nmaking it unlikely that Congress \u201cwould have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d 590 U.S. at 513. \nThe Fifth Circuit was also wrong to hold that \n\u00a72244(b) kicks in as soon as a district court enters fi-\nnal judgment, making all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings second or successive. Section 2244(b) functions \nas a statute of repose, ensuring that state prosecutors \ndon\u2019t have to defend the same conviction twice. But \nCongress did not recognize an interest in repose \nwhile a prisoner\u2019s initial petition remains pending. \nInstead, statutory context and historical practice \nshow that the dividing line between first and succes-\nsive petitions is the end of appellate review. Only \nthen does \u00a72244(b) apply. \nThis Court should reverse and remand so the dis-\ntrict court can consider Rivers\u2019s amendment under \nthe proper Rule 15 standard. \n\n3 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The dis-\ntrict court\u2019s unpublished opinion is available at 2021 \nWL 4319670 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. The petition was filed June 24, \n2024 and granted December 6, 2024. This Court has \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nSections 2106, 2242, and 2244(b) of Title 28 are re-\nproduced in the Appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal background \n1. This case concerns when a habeas filing should \nbe deemed a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b). \na. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This path begins \nin the district court. If that court denies relief, the \nprisoner may request a \u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d\u2014\ninitially from the district court, and then from the \ncourt of appeals. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. \n134, 143\u201344 & n.5 (2012). The path ends only when \nthe prisoner has exhausted the chance for review. \n\n4 \n \n \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. To file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b), a prisoner must first \nask the court of appeals for \u201can order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application,\u201d id. \n\u00a72244(b)(3)(A). The appellate court may oblige only if \nthe petition \u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of \nconstitutional law\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscover-\nable facts that would establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(2)). If \nso, the petition goes to the district court, which must \ndecide for itself whether the petition \u201csatisfies the re-\nquirements\u201d of \u00a72244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(4). Only \nthen may the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether a given \nfiling is deemed \u201cpart of resolving a prisoner\u2019s first \nhabeas application,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or in-\nstead a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus applica-\ntion.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b).  \nb. \u201c[S]econd or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of art\u201d that \ndoes not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 follow-\ning an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 \n(citations omitted). To determine when \u00a72244(b) ap-\nplies, \u201cthis Court has looked for guidance in two main \nplaces.\u201d Id. at 512. First, history: \u201cwhether a type of \nlater-in-time filing would have constituted an abuse \nof the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. \n(cleaned up) (citation omitted). Second, \u201cstatutory \naims\u201d: conserving judicial resources, reducing piece-\nmeal litigation, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a rea-\nsonable time.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313 (citation omitted). \n2. Two recent cases have required this Court to \nconsider whether a motion filed under a Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure was actually a second or successive \napplication. The Federal Rules \u201cgenerally govern ha-\n\n5 \n \n \nbeas proceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511; see Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 81(a)(4); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 Rule 12 (Federal \nRules apply \u201cto the extent they are not inconsistent \nwith\u201d a federal statute or Habeas Rule). When mo-\ntions authorized by a given Federal Rule constitute \nsecond or successive applications, however, AEDPA \n\u201cdisplaces\u201d the Federal Rule, and \u201call of \u00a72244(b)\u2019s re-\nstrictions kick in.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511. \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), involved a \nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. The pris-\noner there \u201cabandoned any attempt to seek review\u201d of \nthe order denying his habeas petition, waited a year, \nand then moved to reopen the case under Rule 60(b). \nId. at 527, 537. Because his motion challenged \u201ca \nnonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d the Court found \u201cno basis for contending that \n[it] should be treated like a habeas corpus applica-\ntion\u201d in the first place. Id. at 533\u201334. Had the prison-\ner\u2019s motion gone to the merits, however, the Court \nsuggested that it would have counted as a second or \nsuccessive application (or its functional equivalent). \nSee id. at 531\u201332. \nFive Terms ago, in Banister v. Davis, the Court \nfaced a similar question involving a Rule 59(e) motion \nto alter or amend a judgment. Under Rule 59(e), a \nparty may seek reconsideration up to 28 days after \nthe district court enters judgment, including on the \nbasis of \u201cnew arguments\u201d and \u201cnewly discovered or \npreviously unavailable evidence.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 508 n.2 (quoting 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a72810.1, at 161\u201362 (3d ed. 2012)). \nDistinguishing Gonzalez, the Court held that a Rule \n59(e) motion \u201cdoes not count as a second or successive \nhabeas application.\u201d Id. at 521. \n\n6 \n \n \n3. While federal habeas law does not expressly ad-\ndress the motions at issue in Gonzalez and Banister, \nCongress specifically authorized prisoners to amend \nor supplement their habeas applications. Under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72242, which predates AEDPA and the Habe-\nas Rules, an \u201c[a]pplication for a writ of habeas corpus \n\u2026 may be amended or supplemented as provided in \nthe rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d \nB. Factual background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last thirteen years \nfighting to prove his innocence. While his initial ha-\nbeas petition was pending on appeal, he discovered \nthat exculpatory evidence had been sitting in his trial \ncounsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that his law-\nyers could have used to clear his name. If Rivers is \nright, he not only received ineffective assistance but \nwas also wrongly convicted. This case is about \nwhether \u00a72244(b)(2) bars Rivers from amending his \npetition and bringing the new evidence to light. \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted. \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome and denied his ex-wife\u2019s request for alimony. Id. \nDkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), at 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \n\u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him by \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-\nold stepdaughter, whom he had raised as his own. R-\n2, at 16. \n\n7 \n \n \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station. Both girls met with officers and ac-\ncused Rivers of sexually abusing them. R-2, at 18, \n129. Police then searched Rivers\u2019s home, seized the \nfamily laptop, and launched a forensic examination, \neventually identifying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d\u2014a single \nimage and a single video\u2014that \u201cappeared to be\u201d child \npornography. Id. at 26\u201328; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A grand jury indicted Rivers for indecency with a \nchild, continuous sexual abuse, and two counts of \npossessing child pornography. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, \nwho had no criminal history, R-2, at 161, pleaded not \nguilty. \nTrial looming, Rivers moved to sever the child-\npornography counts, arguing they would poison the \njury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. The \nState opposed severance. Because Texas had \u201cno \nDNA or physical evidence,\u201d it argued that the alleged \nchild pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to establish Riv-\ners\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d Id. at \n14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u201346, 167\u201368. They further claimed that Riv-\ners had shown them child pornography at least sev-\nenty times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded mul-\ntiple videos\u201d and played different films on different \noccasions. Id. at 153, 172. (Texas charged Rivers with \npossessing only one such video.) Rivers\u2019s daughter al-\nso accused her father of secretly recording images in \nthe shower, R-1, at 170, although no hidden cameras \nwere ever found. All told, the girls alleged over 200 \ninstances of shocking abuse, many of which reported-\n\n8 \n \n \nly took place in common areas of the home while their \nmother, uncle, or cousin were present in the house. R-\n1, at 139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. \nNo other witnesses testified that they had seen the \nalleged abuse, and no physical evidence corroborated \nthe story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nThis lack of supporting evidence made the alleged \nchild pornography a key issue at trial. The prosecu-\ntion called multiple witnesses to testify about the \nvideo file and image that Rivers was charged with \npossessing. R-2, at 19, 28, 44, 74, 84, 100. While the \ntrial judge had granted a continuance so the defense \ncould obtain its own experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel \ndid not do so. R-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called \nonly one witness, who testified that he and Rivers \nwere traveling for work when the two files were al-\nlegedly downloaded. R-2, at 113\u201314, 131. That wit-\nness later swore that Rivers\u2019s lawyers never \u201ccontact-\ned [him] until the day they wanted [him] to testify\u201d or \nasked for evidence that would have corroborated Riv-\ners\u2019s alibi. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:17-cv-00124 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 27-3, at 9. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years. R-3, at 213\u201314, \n221\u201329. The court further decreased the sentence: 38 \nyears behind bars, all counts considered\u2014three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief. \na. In 2013, while his direct appeal was still pend-\ning, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send him his \nclient file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what all it con-\n\n9 \n \n \ntains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do this \nthing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. Counsel \u201cnev-\ner responded,\u201d and two years later, hindered by his \nimprisonment, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. \nHe eventually resorted to filing a formal grievance \nwith the Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cperform an objectively reasona-\nble investigation\u201d or \u201cverify the ages of the persons\u201d \nin the alleged child pornography. No. 7:21-cv-00012 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 12-21, at 9. He added that his lead \ncounsel was \u201cinebriated\u201d at the trial. Id. at 11. \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that \nRivers had \u201calleged facts that, if true, might entitle \nhim to relief.\u201d Ex parte Rivers, 2016 WL 5800277, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 5, 2016). It remanded for \nfurther factfinding, ordering the court to appoint \ncounsel if it \u201celect[ed] to hold a hearing.\u201d Id. Judge \nAlcala wrote separately to urge the appointment of \ncounsel \u201cregardless of whether the trial court holds a \nhearing.\u201d Id. (Alcala, J., concurring). \nOn remand, the court neither held a hearing nor \nappointed counsel. Instead, it chiefly relied on affida-\nvits in which trial counsel defended their perfor-\nmance, denied drunkenness, and claimed that Rivers \nhad \u201cadmitted to [them] that he engaged in sexual \nacts with the victims.\u201d Rivers v. Davis, 2018 WL \n4443153, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 27, 2018); see also No. \n7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 24-1, at 24. Rivers re-\nsponded with his own affidavit, categorically \u201cde-\nny[ing] making such admissions.\u201d Dkt. 24-1 at 4. He \n\n10 \n \n \nalso submitted a text message from one of the law-\nyers\u2019 spouses, confirming that counsel \u201cshowed up in-\ntoxicated for court,\u201d id. at 25, and a news report \nshowing that his lead counsel was arrested six \nmonths before the trial \u201cafter showing up at a wom-\nan[\u2019]s house naked and drunk,\u201d id. at 33 (cleaned up) \n(quoting Texoma, Local Attorney Sentenced to Two \nYears Probation (Mar. 18, 2015), bit.ly/Barber-\nArrest). The trial court nonetheless \u201cconcluded that \ncounsel were not ineffective,\u201d and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals affirmed. Ex parte Rivers, 2017 WL \n3380491, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 7, 2017). \nb. Rivers filed a federal habeas petition in 2017, \nraising the same ineffective-assistance claims, among \nother grounds. No. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 1, \nat 6. When the district court denied relief, Rivers \n\u201ctimely filed a notice of appeal,\u201d Rivers v. Lumpkin, \n2022 WL 1517027, at *4 (5th Cir. May 13, 2022), and \nsought a certificate of appealability. \n3. While his habeas appeal is pending, \nRivers discovers new, exculpatory  \nevidence. \nWhile his case was pending on appeal, Rivers final-\nly received the client file that he first requested in \n2013. Pet. App. 2a. In it, he found a state investiga-\ntor\u2019s report analyzing the two files underlying his \nchild-pornography conviction. The report called the \nvideo merely \u201cof interest,\u201d without further comment. \nMeanwhile, the image was labeled \u201cNOT CHILD \nPORN.\u201d J.A. 91\u201392. The report also listed a number \nof other files found on the family laptop. Next to \none\u2014entitled \u201creallyunderagekiddieporn\u201d\u2014the state \ninvestigator had written: \u201calthough the title indicated \nit to be child porn,\u201d it \u201cis not.\u201d Id. at 91. Another, \nwhose title included phrases like \u201cpre-teen tiny chil-\n\n11 \n \n \ndren\u201d and \u201cincest sex porn underage,\u201d was likewise \nmarked \u201cNOT CHILD PORN.\u201d Id. at 92. The report \nalso showed that these files were not saved under \nRivers\u2019s name; they were instead recovered from a \ndownload folder bearing the name of Rivers\u2019s ex-wife.  \nAfter discovering the report, Rivers moved to sup-\nplement the appellate record. See id. at 41. He also \nfiled an affidavit stating that he had never seen the \nreport and noting that his lawyers had \u201cfailed to raise \nthis exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been \u201cin [their] \npossession\u201d all along. Id. at 54\u201355. The affidavit add-\ned that Rivers\u2019s \u201cestranged wife had access to the \nhouse and did in fact enter the house \u2026 while [Riv-\ners] was out of town during the time frame the al-\nleged child porn was downloaded,\u201d id. at 49. The Fifth \nCircuit denied Rivers\u2019s motion but granted a certifi-\ncate of appealability. Id. Dkt. 34, at 2.  \nC. Procedural history \nIn February 2021\u2014more than a year before the last \nfilings were submitted in his pending appeal\u2014Rivers \nreturned to the district court and tried to amend his \ninitial petition. Using the standard \u00a72254 template \nprovided to pro se litigants, Rivers alleged that his \ncounsel had \u201cfail[ed] to present exculpatory evidence \nin their possession\u201d that would have shown \u201cfactual \ninnocence.\u201d J.A. 68. He added that prosecutors had \nviolated due process by \u201cfalsely pursu[ing]\u201d charges \nbased on evidence that \u201ctheir own investigators\u201d \ndeemed \u201cNOT CHILD PORN.\u201d Id. at 75. \nSoon thereafter, Rivers asked the Fifth Circuit to \nstay or remand. Id. at 95. Rivers explained that his \namended petition contained \u201csubstantial [ineffective-\nassistance] claims that [it] should be aware of before \ndetermining if counsel was or was not ineffective.\u201d Id. \n\n12 \n \n \nat 99. Since his \u201coriginal habeas action [remained] \npending,\u201d Rivers reasoned that \u201cjudicial economy \nwould best be served by [the Fifth Circuit\u2019s] one time \nreview,\u201d covering \u201call grounds\u201d\u2014both \u201cthose on ap-\npeal\u201d and \u201cthose currently raised in the district \ncourt.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). To avoid \u201cpiecemeal litiga-\ntion,\u201d Rivers asked the court to either stay appellate \nproceedings so he could \u201cexhaust the new claims and \nthen join the causes\u201d or to \u201cremand this case back to \nthe district court for consideration of the new \ngrounds.\u201d Id. at 100. The court denied the motion in a \none-line order. No. 18-11490 (5th Cir.) Dkt. 78. \nMeanwhile, in the district court, the same magis-\ntrate judge who reviewed Rivers\u2019s initial habeas peti-\ntion recommended that the February 2021 filing be \ndeemed a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition and trans-\nferred to the Fifth Circuit for lack of jurisdiction. See \nPet. App. 3a\u20134a. Rivers objected, maintaining that \nthe filing was \u201can amendment to [his] initial petition \ncurrently pending on appeal.\u201d 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. \nTex.), Dkt. 27, at 5. He then moved the court to stay \nor \u201cconsider an interlocutory review\u201d to \u201cpreserve ju-\ndicial resources.\u201d J.A. 107. The court adopted the \nmagistrate\u2019s recommendation and denied Rivers\u2019s \nstay motion. See Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. Rivers appealed \nin October 2021, again arguing that his filing was \u201can \namendment/supplement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 to \n[his] initial petition.\u201d 5th Cir. No. 21-11031, Dkt. 20, \nFeb. 17, 2022. \nThe Fifth Circuit docketed Rivers\u2019s jurisdictional \nappeal as a separate case. (Now there were two ap-\npeals pending before separate panels.) Seven months \nlater, in May 2022, Panel 1 affirmed the initial habe-\nas denial without addressing Rivers\u2019s amended peti-\ntion or the newly discovered evidence. See Rivers, \n\n13 \n \n \n2022 WL 1517027, cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 1090 \n(2023). Then, in April 2024, Panel 2 affirmed the \ntransfer order\u2014the decision below. Pet. App. 1a\u20132a. \nIt reasoned that \u00a72244(b) applies to \u201cfilings intro-\nduced after a final judgment that raise habeas \nclaims, no matter how titled.\u201d Id. at 10a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nFor two independent reasons, Rivers\u2019s motion to \namend was not a second or successive habeas corpus \napplication. The Court should reverse and remand. \nI. First, a mid-appeal Rule 15 motion is not a sec-\nond or successive habeas corpus application. \nA. Section 2242 of Title 28 expressly states that an \n\u201c[a]pplication for a writ of habeas corpus \u2026 may be \namended or supplemented as provided in the rules of \nprocedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d The civil rules, \nin turn, permit motions to amend or supplement a \npleading while a case is pending on appeal. Although \na district court lacks jurisdiction to grant such a mo-\ntion, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1(a)(3) per-\nmits it to issue an indicative ruling \u201cstat[ing] either \nthat it would grant the motion if the court of appeals \nremands for that purpose or that the motion raises a \nsubstantial issue.\u201d The court of appeals may then va-\ncate the judgment and \u201cremand for further proceed-\nings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1; 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106.  \nBecause \u00a72242 authorizes mid-appeal motions to \namend a habeas application, such motions cannot be \ndeemed \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus applica-\ntion[s]\u201d under \u00a72244(b). Requiring such motions to \nsatisfy \u00a72244(b)(2) would nullify Congress\u2019s instruc-\ntion that habeas applications \u201cmay be amended\u201d if \nthey satisfy \u201cthe rules of procedure applicable to civil \nactions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. It would wrongly treat an \n\n14 \n \n \namendment as a new, independent \u201capplication,\u201d ra-\nther than part and parcel of the initial application. \nAnd it would override Congress\u2019s decision that only a \nlimited subset of amendments not at issue here must \nsatisfy \u00a72244(b)(2). See id. \u00a72266(b)(3)(B). \nB. Historical practice confirms that mid-appeal mo-\ntions to amend are not second or successive habeas \napplications. Courts historically did not treat habeas \npetitions presenting newly discovered evidence as \nsuccessive. Nor did they regard mid-appeal Rule 15 \nmotions as abuses of the writ. Presented with such \nmotions, courts addressed them on the merits, with-\nout suggesting they were abusive. \nC. Treating mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as part of \nand parcel of the initial habeas application would also \nadvance AEDPA\u2019s aims. Channeling such filings to \nthe same judge who has just ruled on the initial peti-\ntion maximizes judicial economy, avoids piecemeal \nlitigation, and hastens the finality of state convic-\ntions. By contrast, diverting them to the court of ap-\npeals under \u00a72244(b) would burden appellate judges, \nlead to simultaneous appeals, and leave states and \nprisoners in limbo. It\u2019s hard to attribute those results \nto a Congress focused on efficiency and finality. \nD. Applying \u00a72244(b)(2) to mid-appeal motions to \namend also leads to anomalous results that Congress \nis unlikely to have intended. On the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nview, Rule 15 applies to nearly every motion to \namend in a habeas case. Only a tiny sliver\u2014those \nfiled by a prisoner while the case is pending appeal\u2014\nmust run the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet. That approach al-\nso creates senseless distinctions between similarly \nsituated prisoners, slamming the door on newly dis-\ncovered evidence while the case is still pending. \n\n15 \n \n \nII. Alternatively, \u00a72244(b) does not apply while a \nprisoner\u2019s initial petition is pending on appeal. In the \npostconviction context, this Court has always under-\nstood finality by reference to the end of appellate re-\nview, not final judgment. Pre-AEDPA courts applied \nabuse-of-the-writ principles in that manner, treating \nthe appellate court\u2019s decision as the dividing line be-\ntween first and successive petitions. Far from reject-\ning that view, Congress embraced it throughout \nAEDPA by pegging finality to the end of appellate re-\nview. And treating appellate review as the relevant \ninflection point here makes sense too. Section 2244(b) \nfunctions as a statute of repose, sparing states the \nburden of defending the same conviction twice. But \nCongress did not recognize a state\u2019s interest in repose \nwhile the initial petition is still pending: that interest \nvests only once the appeal is over. \nIII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary arguments fail. \nA. Gonzalez v. Crosby doesn\u2019t control this case. \nGonzalez neither involved nor addressed mid-appeal \namendments under Rule 15. Nor did it analyze or de-\ncide whether the dividing line between initial peti-\ntions and \u201csecond or successive\u201d petitions is the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s entry of judgment or the end of appellate \nreview. And Gonzalez\u2019s logic doesn\u2019t apply here either \nbecause \u00a72242 expressly permits amendments as \nprovided in the civil rules, which already contain am-\nple safeguards against abuse.  \nB. The Fifth Circuit was also wrong to fear a flood \nof amendments. Given the jurisdictional, procedural, \nand substantive barriers to amending mid-appeal, \nprisoners have every incentive to file all of their \nclaims in their initial petition. The Second Circuit, \nwhere mid-appeal Rule 15 motions have been allowed \nfor the last 20 years, offers an informative case study. \n\n16 \n \n \nDistrict courts there have not been flooded with abu-\nsive amendments, and the motions they have re-\nceived have not proven burdensome. \nIV. This Court should reverse and remand. The \ncourts below made a threshold jurisdictional error \nthat kept them from reaching the merits of Rivers\u2019s \nmotion to amend. On remand, the district court will \nhave the chance to consider whether Rivers\u2019s newly \ndiscovered evidence warrants relief under the proper \nRule 15 standard. \nARGUMENT \nI. A motion to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition that is pending on appeal is \nnot a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application. \nA. Section 2242 permits prisoners to seek \nleave to amend or supplement their  \napplications while an appeal is pending. \nSection 2242 tells courts which rules to apply when \na prisoner moves to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition: \u201cthe rules of procedure applicable to \ncivil actions.\u201d Those rules, in turn, include mecha-\nnisms for updating a pleading mid-appeal. Applying \n\u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping requirements instead of the \ncivil rules would nullify \u00a72242 and disregard Con-\ngress\u2019s drafting choices. \n1. Under \u00a72242, a habeas application \nmay be amended or supplemented  \nas provided in the rules of civil  \nprocedure. \nCongress has told courts that a habeas application \n\u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the \nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72242. Beyond Congress\u2019s \u201cgeneral prescrip-\n\n17 \n \n \ntio[n]\u201d that the Federal Rules apply in habeas cases, \n\u00a72242 \u201cspecifically\u201d requires courts to allow amend-\nment and supplementation per the rules of civil pro-\ncedure. Mayle v. Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 654\u201355 (2005). \nSection 2242 reflects longstanding practice that \npredates both the Habeas Rules and AEDPA. By its \nterms, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 contemplated \namendments only to the jailer\u2019s \u201creturn\u201d and \u201csugges-\ntions made against it,\u201d 14 Stat. 385, 386. But by 1948, \nwhen Congress added the amendment provision to \n\u00a72242, courts had long permitted prisoners to amend \ntheir petitions \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d E.g., Holi-\nday v. Johnston, 313 U.S. 342, 350 (1941); see also \nPrice v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 291\u201392 (1948) (re-\nmanding for amendment). As the Codifier\u2019s Note ex-\nplains, the provision aimed \u201cto conform to [this] exist-\ning practice.\u201d Codifier\u2019s Note, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242 (1952). \nUnder \u00a72242, amending a habeas petition works \njust like amending a pleading \u201cin ordinary civil litiga-\ntion.\u201d Mayle, 545 U.S. at 663. Section 2242 imposes \nno restrictions beyond those \u201cprovided in the rules of \nprocedure.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. Nor did Congress tether \n\u00a72242 to a specific rule. Instead, it broadly instructed \ncourts to allow amendments in accordance with the \n\u201crules\u201d governing \u201ccivil actions.\u201d Id.  \n2. The rules of civil procedure provide \nfor motions to amend or supplement \na pleading while an appeal is  \npending. \na. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 lets parties \namend and supplement their pleadings. Under Rule \n15(a)(2), \u201ca party may amend its pleading\u201d with \u201cthe \ncourt\u2019s leave,\u201d which should be \u201cfreely give[n] when \njustice so requires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2); see Fo-\n\n18 \n \n \nman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). And under \nRule 15(d), a court \u201cmay, on just terms, permit a par-\nty to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any \ntransaction, occurrence, or event that happened af-\nter\u201d the initial pleading. \nUnlike other Federal Rules, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b), (h), these provisions contain no time limit. To \nthe contrary, Rule 15(d) permits supplementation af-\nter a court has found \u201cthe original pleading \u2026 defec-\ntive in stating a claim or defense.\u201d Likewise, leave to \namend \u201chas been granted under Rule 15(a) at various \nstages of the litigation,\u201d including \u201cafter a judgment \nhas been entered\u201d and \u201con remand following appeal.\u201d \n6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \n\u00a71488 & n.11 (3d ed. June 2024); see also Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 15(b)(2) (expressly permitting amendment \u201cafter \njudgment\u201d). \nb. Rule 15 motions may be filed while a case is on \nappeal. Two structural barriers ordinarily prevent \ndistrict courts from granting such motions: the pend-\ning appeal and the final judgment. But those barriers \nare not insurmountable. Federal courts have long ex-\nperience \nwith \nthe \ncomplexities \nof \nlitigation\u2014\nincluding the problem of newly discovered evidence. \nThe \u201crules of procedure applicable to civil actions\u201d re-\nflect that experience, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242, providing ways \nto update the pleadings even after an appeal has been \nfiled. Relevant here, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n62.1(a) permits a district court to issue an indicative \nruling inviting remand, and Federal Rule of Appel-\nlate Procedure 12.1(b) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106 allow the \ncourt of appeals to vacate and remand in response. \ni. An appeal \u201cdivests the district court of its control \nover those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\u201d \nGriggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, \n\n19 \n \n \n58 (1982). That principle precludes a district court \nfrom granting a motion to amend a pleading that is \npending on appeal. The principle does not, however, \npreclude the district court from considering the mo-\ntion. Even if a district court lacks jurisdiction to \ngrant a motion, it still \u201cha[s] jurisdiction to entertain \nthe motion and either deny the motion on its merits, \nor certify its intention to grant the motion to the \nCourt of Appeals, which could then entertain a mo-\ntion to remand.\u201d United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. \n648, 667 n.42 (1984) (citing United States v. Johnson, \n327 U.S. 106, 108\u201309 (1946)). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1(a) is the mod-\nern mechanism for this longstanding practice. It gives \na district court three options when faced with a \u201ctime-\nly motion \u2026 for relief that the court lacks authority \nto grant because of an appeal.\u201d First, the court may \n\u201cdefer considering the motion.\u201d Id. \u00a7(a)(1). Second, it \nmay entertain the motion and \u201cdeny\u201d it. Id. \u00a7(a)(2). \nFinally, the court may issue an \u201c[i]ndicative [r]uling\u201d \n\u201cstat[ing] either that it would grant the motion if the \ncourt of appeals remands for that purpose or that the \nmotion raises a substantial issue.\u201d Id. \u00a7(a)(3). When \nthe court of appeals receives such a ruling, Federal \nRule of Appellate Procedure 12.1(b) allows it to \u201cre-\nmand for further proceedings.\u201d \nAlthough Rule 62.1(a) is often used in conjunction \nwith Rule 60(b) motions, \u201cnothing in [the rule\u2019s] lan-\nguage limits its application\u201d to that context. Ret. Bd. \nof Policemen\u2019s Annuity & Benefit Fund v. Bank of \nN.Y. Mellon, 297 F.R.D. 218, 221 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). In-\nstead, Rule 62.1(a) covers \u201call circumstances in which \na pending appeal ousts district-court authority to \ngrant relief.\u201d Report of the Civil Rules Advisory \nCommittee, Dec. 12, 2006 at 14. That includes mid-\n\n20 \n \n \nappeal Rule 15 motions. See, e.g., Ret. Bd., 297 F.R.D. \nat 220, 223. \nRule 62.1(a) does not require a party to move for an \nindicative ruling. The rule speaks of just one mo-\ntion\u2014the \u201ctimely motion \u2026 for relief that the court \nlacks authority to grant because of an appeal.\u201d Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 62.1(a). A distinct \u201cmotion\u201d for a \u201ctargeted \n\u2018indicative ruling\u2019\u201d is thus unnecessary: the district \ncourt may issue an indicative ruling based solely on \nthe underlying motion for relief. Mendia v. Garcia, \n874 F.3d 1118, 1120\u201321 (9th Cir. 2017) (collecting \ncases); see also, e.g., Scarborough v. U.S. Sec. Assocs., \nInc., 836 F. App\u2019x 60, 61 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2020). \nii. When a district court issues an indicative ruling \nunder Rule 62.1(a), \u201cthe court of appeals may remand \nfor further proceedings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1(b). The \ncourt of appeals may also \u201cvacate\u201d or \u201cset aside\u201d any \n\u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201corder\u201d below and \u201crequire such further \nproceedings \u2026 as may be just under the circumstanc-\nes.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106. Remand on those terms makes a \nseparate motion to reopen the judgment unnecessary.  \nAppellate courts\u2019 authority to grant such relief has \na deep pedigree. For as long as there have been fed-\neral appellate courts, those courts have had to con-\ntend with unforeseen developments on appeal. Some-\ntimes the appellate court was \u201cinformed\u201d of new evi-\ndence. E.g., Estho v. Lear, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 130, 131 \n(1833) (Marshall, C.J.); United States v. Shotwell \nMfg. Co., 355 U.S. 233, 234\u201338 (1957); Levinson v. \nUnited States, 32 F.2d 449, 450 (6th Cir. 1929). \nSometimes an intervening event meant that \u201cgreat \ninjustice\u201d would be done by ruling on \u201cthe present \u2026 \nrecord.\u201d E.g., Ballard v. Searls, 130 U.S. 50, 52 \n(1889); Ransom v. City of Pierre, 101 F. 665, 670\u201371 \n(8th Cir. 1900). And sometimes situations \u201cchanged \n\n21 \n \n \nradically\u201d enough to \u201cpreclud[e]\u201d further action. See \nWatts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca Di Naviga-\nzione, 248 U.S. 9, 21\u201322 (1918) (collecting cases). \nWhen such things happen, courts are not limited to \n\u201ccorrecting error\u201d but may also \u201cdispos[e] of the case \nas justice may at th[e] time require.\u201d Id. at 21. \nD.W. Bosley Co. v. Wirfs, 20 F.2d 629 (8th Cir. \n1927), is illustrative. The plaintiff in Bosley sued the \ndefendant for patent infringement. After losing in the \ndistrict court, the defendant appealed and \u201cthe case \nwas argued and submitted\u201d before the Eighth Circuit. \nId. at 630. Then, while the appeal was still pending, \nthe defendant discovered that another firm had been \nselling products \u201clike those patented to the [plaintiff]\u201d \nyears before the plaintiff applied for his patent. Id. \nThe Eighth Circuit knew what that meant: if the de-\nfendant was right, the evidence \u201cwould be likely to \nlead the court below to a different result from its ear-\nlier conclusion.\u201d Id. At the defendant\u2019s request, the \nEighth Circuit remanded to the district court, where \nthe defendant sought to \u201camend its answer and pre-\nsent [the] newly discovered\u201d evidence. Id; see also, \ne.g., Estho, 32 U.S. at 131 (granting leave to amend); \nDietz v. Horton Mfg. Co., 170 F. 865, 873 (6th Cir. \n1909) (same).  \nA remand order that vacates the judgment \u201creo-\npen[s] litigation.\u201d Mendoza v. Lumpkin, 81 F.4th 461, \n470 (5th Cir. 2023). This makes it unnecessary to ask \nthe district court for relief from judgment under Rule \n60(b). The remand order \u201csuppl[ies] all that is need-\ned by way of authority below and amount[s] in itself \nto a vacation of the judgment for further proceedings, \nincluding amendments.\u201d Markert v. Swift & Co., 173 \nF.2d 517, 520 (2d Cir. 1949). Rule 62.1(c) reflects this \nprinciple, providing that \u201c[t]he district court may de-\n\n22 \n \n \ncide the motion if the court of appeals remands for \nthat purpose.\u201d See also Wright & Miller \u00a71489 (call-\ning such an order \u201ccomparable to a vacation of the \nlower court\u2019s judgment\u201d). \n* \n* \n* \nAll of that boils down to this: While Rule 15 mo-\ntions are most common before final judgment, a party \nmay also seek leave to amend or supplement while an \nappeal is pending. A district court that receives such \na motion may consider it and issue an indicative rul-\ning. Then, if the court of appeals vacates and re-\nmands, the district court is free to grant the motion.  \n3. Section 2244(b) does not override \n\u00a72242. \na. \u201c[I]t is this Court\u2019s duty to interpret Congress\u2019s \nstatutes as a harmonious whole rather than at war \nwith one another.\u201d Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. \n497, 502 (2018). It follows that \u00a72244(b)(2) cannot be \nread to implicitly prohibit what \u00a72242 expressly per-\nmits. Section 2242 expressly allows a prisoner to \n\u201camen[d] or supplemen[t]\u201d his \u201c[a]pplication\u201d \u201cas pro-\nvided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil ac-\ntions.\u201d Section 2242 thus identifies what conditions \nmust be satisfied to amend a habeas petition: the \nconditions specified in the civil rules. Those condi-\ntions don\u2019t include \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s stringent gatekeep-\ning requirements for second or successive petitions. \nConstruing a motion to amend as a second or succes-\nsive petition, and thereby subjecting it to \u00a72244(b)(2), \nwould thus nullify Congress\u2019s instruction that a ha-\nbeas petition \u201cmay be amended\u201d as provided in the \ncivil rules. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. \nTreating an amendment to an application as a \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d application would also \u201celid[e] the \n\n23 \n \n \ndifference\u201d Congress recognized between the two. \nArtuz v. Bennett, 531 U.S. 4, 9 (2000). Section 2244(b) \nrefers to a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application as a \nnew, distinct \u201capplication.\u201d Section 2242, meanwhile, \nmakes clear that an \u201camendment\u201d is not a new and \nindependent application, but rather something that \nhappens to an existing application. See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72242 (providing that \u201c[i]t\u201d\u2014the \u201c[a]pplication\u201d\u2014may \nbe amended); see also Tr. of Oral Arg., Banister, No. \n18-6943 (Assistant to the Solicitor General: \u201cSection \n2242 \u2026 makes clear that that amendment still goes \nto the same application.\u201d). And Congress elsewhere in \nthe statute expressly distinguished between \u201can ap-\nplication,\u201d an \u201camendment to an application,\u201d and a \n\u201csecond \nor \nsuccessive \napplication.\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a72266(b)(2), (b)(3)(B).  \nCongress also showed that it knows how to subject \nan amendment to \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping require-\nments when it wants to. It did so in \u00a72266, part of \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201copt-in\u201d chapter: a set of fast-track proce-\ndures for capital habeas cases that apply when a \nstate meets certain conditions. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72261\u2013\n2266; Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740 (1998). Un-\nder \u00a72266(b)(3)(B), \u201c[n]o amendment \u2026 shall be per-\nmitted after the filing of the answer to the applica-\ntion, except on the grounds specified in section \n2244(b).\u201d Congress thus considered requiring that \namendments satisfy the \u00a72244(b)(2) standards\u2014but \nit did so for only a tiny sliver of amendments: those \nfiled by state prisoners, on death row, whose states \nhave opted in. When \u201cCongress has shown elsewhere \nin the same statute that it knows how to make such a \nrequirement manifest,\u201d this Court should \u201cnot lightly \nassume that Congress has omitted from its adopted \ntext requirements that it nonetheless intends to ap-\nply.\u201d Jama v. ICE, 543 U.S. 335, 341 (2005). \n\n24 \n \n \nb. Viewed another way, treating a motion to amend \nas a second or successive petition would effectively \nread \u00a72244(b) as impliedly repealing \u00a72242. But \u201c[t]he \ncardinal rule is that repeals by implication are not \nfavored.\u201d Posadas v. Nat\u2019l City Bank of N.Y., 296 U.S. \n497, 503 (1936). \u201c[P]resented with two statutes, the \nCourt will regard each as effective\u2014unless Congress\u2019 \nintention to repeal is clear and manifest, or the two \nlaws are irreconcilable.\u201d Me. Cmty. Health Options v. \nUnited States, 590 U.S. 296, 315 (2020) (cleaned up). \nNot so here. \nThere is no evidence\u2014let alone \u201cclear and manifest\u201d \nevidence\u2014that Congress intended \u00a72244(b) to repeal \n\u00a72242. Id. Courts \u201cstrongly presum[e]\u201d that \u201cCongress \nwill specifically address language on the statute \nbooks that it wishes to change.\u201d United States v. \nFausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 (1988). Congress did just \nthat in AEDPA. Title I of the Act, labeled \u201cHabeas \nCorpus Reform,\u201d expressly amended \u00a7\u00a72243, 2244, \n2245, and 2255 of Title 28. Pub. L. No. 104-132, tit. I, \n\u00a7\u00a7101\u2013106 (1996). But neither that title nor any other \nprovision of AEDPA mentions \u00a72242. See id. \nNor are \u00a7\u00a72242 and 2244(b) \u201cirreconcilable.\u201d Me. \nCmty., 590 U.S. at 315. Irreconcilability is a high bar. \nSee J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, \nInc., 534 U.S. 124, 141\u201342 (2001). It is \u201cnot enough to \nshow\u201d that two statutes \u201cproduce differing results \nwhen applied to the same factual situation, for that \nno more than states the problem.\u201d Radzanower v. \nTouche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 155 (1976). And a \n\u201cpolicy preference\u201d for applying one provision over \nanother won\u2019t do either. FCC v. NextWave Personal \nCommc\u2019ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 304 (2003). Instead, two \nstatutes are \u201cirreconcilable\u201d only when they \u201ccannot \nmutually coexist\u201d or there is \u201ca positive repugnancy\u201d \n\n25 \n \n \nbetween them. Radzanower, 426 U.S. at 155. Here, \n\u00a7\u00a72242 and 2244(b) can easily coexist, without \u201cre-\npugnancy,\u201d by confining them each to their own re-\nspective spheres. Section 2242 addresses amend-\nments but not second or successive applications. Sec-\ntion 2244(b), for its part, says much about second or \nsuccessive applications but not a word about amend-\nments. If both provisions stuck to their own jobs, nei-\nther would be out of work. Id.  \nB. Historical practice confirms that mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motions are not second \nor successive habeas applications. \nEven apart from \u00a72242, Banister\u2019s logic yields the \nsame result. To decide \u201cwhat qualifies as second or \nsuccessive,\u201d this Court looks first to \u201chistorical habe-\nas doctrine and practice.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. If \n\u201ca type of later-in-time filing would have constituted \nan abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained\u201d in \nthe Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cases,\u201d it is \u201csuccessive.\u201d Id. \n(citation omitted). \u201c[I]f not, likely not.\u201d Id. As shown \nbelow, history favors Rivers twice over. For one thing, \nhabeas courts did not historically deem the mere act \nof raising newly discovered evidence abusive. More \ntelling still, pre-AEDPA courts routinely decided mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motions on the merits\u2014rather than \ndismissing them as abusive. \n1. The abuse-of-the-writ doctrine did \nnot foreclose petitions presenting \nnewly discovered evidence. \nThe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine was a nineteenth-\ncentury innovation. \u201c[B]y the common law of Eng-\nland, as it stood at the adoption of the constitution,\u201d \nthe denial of habeas relief was \u201cno bar to the issuing \nof a second or third or more writs.\u201d Ex parte Kaine, 14 \n\n26 \n \n \nF. Cas. 78, 80 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1853). Courts were in-\nstead \u201caccustomed to exercise an independent judg-\nment on each successive application, regardless of the \nnumber.\u201d Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U.S. 224, 230\u201331 \n(1924). \u201cTh[is] rule made sense because at common \nlaw an order denying habeas relief could not be re-\nviewed. Successive petitions served as a substitute for \nappeal.\u201d McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 479 (1991) \n(internal citation omitted). \nOnly later, once \u201ca right to an appellate review was \ngiven,\u201d did U.S. courts restrict this practice. Salinger, \n265 U.S. at 231. Abuse-of-the-writ doctrine developed \nto ban successive petitions that presented claims that \nwere \u201cdeliberately with[e]l[d],\u201d Sanders v. United \nStates, 373 U.S. 1, 18 (1963), or that the applicant \n\u201chad [a] full opportunity\u201d to present in his first peti-\ntion, Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U.S. 239, 241 \n(1924). Courts carefully emphasized, however, that \npresenting newly discovered evidence was not itself \nabusive. E.g., Price, 334 U.S. at 290\u201391. \nEx parte Cuddy, one of the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases, illustrates the point. 40 F. 62, 66 (C.C.S.D. \nCal. 1889) (Field, J.). A district court denied Thomas \nCuddy\u2019s initial habeas petition, and this Court af-\nfirmed. Id. at 63. Cuddy then sought habeas relief \nfrom Justice Field, riding circuit. Justice Field or-\ndered the writ dismissed, reasoning that \u201ca second \napplication upon the same facts \u2026 should not be \nheard,\u201d absent \u201cleave to make a new application.\u201d Id. \nat 66. At the same time, he cabined that principle to \n\u201ccases where a second application is made upon the \nsame facts presented, or which might have been pre-\nsented\u201d in the first application. Id. In his view, things \nwould be \u201centirely different\u201d if \u201csubsequent occurring \nevents\u201d offered \u201cnew\u201d grounds for relief. Id. \n\n27 \n \n \nOther courts agreed. In line with Justice Field\u2019s \nremarks, habeas courts did not treat the presentation \nof newly discovered evidence as itself abusive. This \nCourt said as much in Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. \n101, 105 (1942), where the subsequent petition did \nnot raise \u201cthe same issue\u201d as the prior one. Early \ntwentieth-century district courts applied the same \nprinciple, reasoning that a \u201csubstantial change in the \ncircumstances\u201d could warrant a further petition. E.g., \nEx parte Moebus, 148 F. 39, 40 (D.N.H. 1906). So did \nstate courts, which \u201croutinely allowed prisoners to \nintroduce exculpatory evidence that was either un-\nknown or previously unavailable to the prisoner.\u201d \nBoumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 780\u201381 (2008) \n(collecting cases).  \nTo be sure, Congress later restricted prisoners\u2019 abil-\nity to raise newly discovered evidence in \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d applications. But this \u201chistorical habeas \ndoctrine and practice\u201d counsels against construing \nthat phrase more broadly than the statutory text \ncompels. See Banister, 590 U.S. at 512 (If a \u201ctype of \nlater-in-time filing\u201d would not have \u201cconstituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d it is \u201clikely not\u201d successive.). \n2. Habeas courts did not historically \ntreat mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as \nsuccessive. \nThe same rules applied when new grounds for relief \nemerged while an initial petition was pending on ap-\npeal. Had courts viewed mid-appeal Rule 15 motions \nas successive, \u201cthere should be lots of decisions dis-\nmissing them on that basis.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n514. Instead, courts time and again \u201cresolved [such] \nmotions on the merits\u2014and without comment about \nrepetitive litigation.\u201d Id. at 515. \n\n28 \n \n \na. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy is a good example. Af-\nter a district court denied his initial habeas petition, \nPeter Harisiades appealed to the Second Circuit. See \nUnited States ex rel. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 187 \nF.2d 137, 138 (2d Cir. 1951). Then, while his appeal \nwas pending, he returned to the district court and \n\u201cmoved for permission to amend.\u201d Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 90 F. Supp. 431, 432 & n.2 (S.D.N.Y. \n1950). The United States \u201copposed the motion\u201d on \nmultiple grounds, see id. at 432\u201333, but it didn\u2019t \nclaim that Harisiades had abused the writ by moving \nto amend mid-appeal. \nThe district court in Harisiades followed precisely \nthe path that Rivers advocates here. While it recog-\nnized that an appeal \u201cdeprive[s] the District Court of \nauthority,\u201d the court still deemed it \u201cproper\u201d to \u201ccon-\nsider the merits of the \u2026 application to amend.\u201d Id. \nat 433\u201334. In short: exactly what Rule 62.1(a) would \nlater prescribe. See Munoz v. United States, 451 F. \nApp\u2019x 818, 819 n.1 (11th Cir. 2011) (Rule 62.1 \u201ccod-\nif[ied]\u201d existing practice). After doing so, the court \ndenied the motion \u201con the merits\u201d\u2014without a hint \nthat moving to amend was itself an abuse of the writ. \nId. at 820. \nThe Second Circuit affirmed. When Harisiades \nchallenged the denial of his motion to amend, the \ncourt consolidated that appeal with his pending ha-\nbeas appeal, see 187 F.2d at 139, and decided both \ncases in the same four-page opinion. As to the \namendment issue, Judge Swan (joined by Chief Judge \nLearned Hand and Judge Augustus Hand) proceeded \nstraight to the merits and deemed the district court\u2019s \norder \u201ccorrect.\u201d Id. at 139\u201340, 142. That is telling. Af-\nter all, dismissing Harisiades\u2019s motion as successive \n\u201cwould have been easier\u201d than ruling on the merits. \n\n29 \n \n \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 519 n.8. \u201cAnd even more to the \npoint, that course would usually have been required\u201d \nif mid-appeal Rule 15 motions \u201ccounted as succes-\nsive.\u201d Id. The Second Circuit clearly did not view \nthem that way. \nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there. After the Second \nCircuit denied relief, this Court granted certiorari \nand affirmed. See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 \nU.S. 580 (1952). Although the Court\u2019s opinion focuses \nchiefly on the habeas denial, the Court also addressed \nthe amendment issue. Like the lower courts, this \nCourt went straight to the merits. Compare id. at 583 \nn.4, with 90 F. Supp. 437, and 187 F.2d at 139\u201340. \nAnd like the lower courts, this Court said not a word \nabout abuse of the writ\u2014an omission all the more \nstriking for the fact that it came only two months af-\nter the Court had unanimously decried the \u201cproblems \nraised by \u2026 applications for habeas corpus that are \nrepetitious.\u201d United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, \n212 & n.14 (1952). \nb. Nor was Harisiades the only dog that didn\u2019t \nbark. Over the next four decades, prisoners regularly \ntried to amend their petitions after final judgment. \nBut instead of dismissing these motions as succes-\nsive, courts routinely addressed them on the merits. \nIn fact, our research did not find a single pre-AEDPA \ncase where a court treated mid-appeal efforts to \namend or supplement as an abuse of the writ. \nSome of these cases resemble Harisiades. Take \nStrand v. United States, 780 F.2d 1497 (10th Cir. \n1985). The prisoner there filed an \u201camended petition\u201d \nwhile his case was still pending before the district \ncourt. Id. at 1505 (McKay, J., dissenting). The court \nlater denied relief\u2014apparently without considering \nthe amended petition\u2014and the prisoner appealed. Id. \n\n30 \n \n \nat 1498\u201399. While the appeal was pending, he filed a \n\u201crenewed motion to supplement\u201d in the district court. \nId. After that too was denied, the prisoner appealed, \nand the Tenth Circuit consolidated the cases. Id. at \n1499. The court affirmed without a hint that the pris-\noner had abused the writ. See id. at 1500. \nIn other cases, the prisoner tried to amend in the \nappellate court itself. Bennett v. Robbins, 329 F.2d \n146, 147 (1st Cir. 1964), is typical. After the district \ncourt denied habeas relief, the prisoner appealed and \nasked the First Circuit to let him \u201camend his applica-\ntion.\u201d Id. The court declined, without suggesting that \nthe motion was abusive. Id. Petty v. McCotter, 779 \nF.2d 299 (5th Cir. 1986), is much the same. The pris-\noner there introduced a new claim for the first time \non appeal. Id. at 301. In an opinion joined by Judge \nJones, the Fifth Circuit remanded, holding that he \n\u201cshould be given an opportunity to amend.\u201d Id. at \n302. No member of the panel suggested that the pris-\noner was abusing the writ. See also Clarke v. Hender-\nson, 403 F.2d 687, 688 (6th Cir. 1968); Thomas v. \nVirginia, 357 F.2d 87, 90 (4th Cir. 1966). \nIn still other cases, prisoners sought leave to amend \nafter final judgment but before appeal. That\u2019s what \nhappened in Bishop v. Lane, 478 F. Supp. 865, 866 \n(E.D. Tenn. 1978). Instead of deeming the motion \nsuccessive, the court simply walked the prisoner \nthrough the rules of civil procedure and then denied \nleave to amend. Id. at 467. See also Briddle v. Scott, \n63 F.3d 364 (5th Cir. 1995). \nWhat is striking about all these cases is that not a \nsingle judge suggested that any of the prisoners had \nabused the writ. It\u2019s hard to see why \u201ca half century\u2019s \nworth of habeas courts would have resolved [Rule 15] \nmotions on the merits\u201d if they viewed them as succes-\n\n31 \n \n \nsive. Banister, 590 U.S. at 519 n.8. \u201cThe only plausi-\nble account of their actions is that they did not.\u201d Id. \nC. AEDPA\u2019s aims favor treating mid-appeal \nRule 15 motions as part and parcel of \nthe initial application. \n\u201cCongress passed AEDPA against this legal back-\ndrop, and did nothing to change it.\u201d Id. at 515. As \nBanister explained, AEDPA made it harder for sec-\nond or successive petitions to get past the gate\u2014but \nit did not \u201credefine what qualifies as a successive pe-\ntition\u201d in the first place. Id. \u201cNor do AEDPA\u2019s purpos-\nes demand a change\u201d in the practice just described. \nId. Far from it: forcing mid-appeal Rule 15 motions to \nrun the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet would frustrate\u2014not \nfurther\u2014efficiency and finality,\u201d making it unlikely \nthat \u201cCongress would have viewed [them] as succes-\nsive.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313. \n1. Conserving judicial resources. The question \nis not whether prisoners will race to court when ex-\nculpatory evidence emerges mid-appeal. They will\u2014\nno matter what rule the Court adopts. The question \ninstead is how the lower courts should review those \ninevitable filings.  \na. Rivers\u2019s rule lets only the most promising claims \nproceed, efficiently filtering out the rest. Under our \napproach, a mid-appeal Rule 15 motion would go to \nthe district court judge who just decided the initial \npetition: the single decisionmaker most familiar with \nthe case. If the motion raised a \u201csubstantial issue,\u201d \nRule 62.1(a)(3), the court could say so. E.g., Parry v. \nKerestes, 2013 WL 6002358, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 12, \n2013). If not, the court could deny it. Rule 62.1(a)(2). \nEither way, a judge \u201cfamiliar with a habeas appli-\n\n32 \n \n \ncant\u2019s claims\u201d would likely make \u201cquick work\u201d of such \na filing. Banister, 590 U.S. at 517.  \nb. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary rule displaces dis-\ntrict courts and burdens the courts of appeals. Be-\ncause the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach turns on whether a \nmid-appeal filing \u201craise[s] habeas claims,\u201d Pet. App. \n10a, the district court must first decide whether the \nprisoner has asserted \u201cmerits-based\u201d or \u201cintegrity-\nbased\u201d grounds for relief\u2014a \u201cnot-always-easy thresh-\nold determination.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 518 n.7. If \nthe filing raises merits-based claims, the district \ncourt lacks jurisdiction and must either dismiss or \ntransfer it as a second or successive petition. Three \nappellate judges must then decide\u2014from square zero, \nwithout a district-court opinion, and likely without \nadversarial briefing, see In re Williams, 898 F.3d \n1098, 1101 (11th Cir. 2018) (Wilson, J., specially con-\ncurring)\u2014whether \u201cthe factual predicate for the \nclaim\u201d could have been \u201cdiscovered previously \nthrough the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(i). Next they must examine \u201cthe evi-\ndence as a whole\u201d and determine whether \u201cthe facts \nunderlying the claim, if proven,\u201d would be \u201csufficient \nto establish by clear and convincing evidence\u201d that \n\u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d would have convicted but \nfor constitutional error. Id. \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii). That, in \nturn, means considering the state\u2019s \u201ctheory of the \ncase,\u201d the evidence \u201csupport[ing]\u201d that theory, and \nthe counterfactual effect of the \u201cnewly-discovered evi-\ndence,\u201d including how it would have undermined the \nstate\u2019s evidence and influenced the theories\u2014and \neven \u201calternative theories\u201d\u2014that both sides could \nhave \u201coffered the jury.\u201d Munchinski v. Wilson, 694 \nF.3d 308, 335\u201337 (3d Cir. 2012). One recent authori-\nzation case features a two-column, sixteen-row chart \nthat spans three pages of the Federal Reporter. See \n\n33 \n \n \nIn re Will, 970 F.3d 536, 544\u201346 (5th Cir. 2020). And \nthat\u2019s just the first step. If the appellate court author-\nizes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, the case goes \nback to the district court, which must \u201cconduct its \nown thorough review\u201d to ensure \u201cthe requirements of \n\u00a72244(b)(2) have been satisfied.\u201d Id. at 543 (cleaned \nup). Still more: because any claim \u201cpresented in a \nprior application\u201d must be dismissed, \u00a72244(b)(1), \nboth courts must compare the \u201csecond or successive\u201d \npetition to every prior petition and determine precise-\nly what \u201cclaim[s]\u201d were already brought, id. at 541\u2014a \ntask that usually means slogging through \u201cless-than-\nlimpid\u201d pro se filings. Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. \nAll agree that \u201ca three-judge panel of the court of \nappeals\u201d is the first port of call for petitions filed after \na prisoner exhausts appellate review of his initial ap-\nplication. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(3)(B). But a Congress \nconcerned about efficiency had little reason to chan-\nnel filings like Rivers\u2019s down that path\u2014and good \nreason to treat them as \u201cpart and parcel of the first \nhabeas proceeding.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507.  \n2. Reducing piecemeal litigation. AEDPA\u2019s sec-\nond aim likewise favors Rivers\u2019s rule. Under our ap-\nproach, an indicative ruling followed by remand could \nmake further appellate proceedings \u201caltogether un-\nnecessary.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. Conversely, if a \ndistrict court denies leave to amend, there is little \nrisk of \u201cpiecemeal appellate review.\u201d Id. For one \nthing, prisoners \u201cmay not\u201d appeal a \u201cfinal order in a \nhabeas corpus proceeding\u201d without a \u201ccertificate of \nappealability.\u201d See 28 U.S.C. \u00a72253(c)(1). And even if \nsuch an appeal did get off the ground, it would be \nconsolidated with the already-pending habeas appeal, \nsee Harisiades, 187 F.2d at 139; Strand, 780 F.2d \n1499, and reviewed for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d E.g., \n\n34 \n \n \nBrown v. United States, 384 F. App\u2019x 815, 817 (10th \nCir. 2010) (Gorsuch, J.). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary rule calls for two simul-\ntaneous appellate proceedings, demanding the atten-\ntion of up to six judges. Without an indicative ruling, \nPanel 1 (the original merits panel) would have to \npress forward and decide the initial appeal\u2014even if \nthe new evidence was outcome-determinative. Mean-\nwhile, their colleagues on Panel 2 (the authorization \npanel) would have to learn the case from scratch and \nevaluate the new evidence without \u201cthe benefit of the \ndistrict court\u2019s plenary findings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 517. That is the epitome of piecemeal litigation. \n3. Hastening finality. Finality cuts the same way. \nIf the new evidence here isn\u2019t the bombshell that Riv-\ners reckons, the best way to \u201clend[] finality\u201d to his \nconviction \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d would have \nbeen for the district court to say so back in 2021. Ban-\nister, 590 U.S. at 512. District courts are well suited \nto that task, with tools and experience that appellate \ncourts lack. Instead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could keep the \u201ccloud of fed-\neral review\u201d over Rivers\u2019s conviction for years to \ncome. Id. at 523 (Alito, J., dissenting); see, e.g., In re \nWill, 970 F.3d at 536 (authorization proceeding filed \nSeptember 26, 2017 and closed August 5, 2020). \n* \n* \n* \nHad Congress wanted mid-appeal Rule 15 motions \nto count as second or successive petitions, \u201cit easily \ncould have written\u201d such a law. Ali v. Fed. Bureau of \nPrisons, 552 U.S. 214, 227 (2008). But it\u2019s hard to \nsqueeze that rule from the text of \u00a72244(b) and its \nhistorical backdrop. And it\u2019s even harder to attribute \nthe consequences it would entail to a Congress fo-\n\n35 \n \n \ncused on judicial resources, efficiency, and finality. \nFor more than two centuries, this Court has declined \nto \u201cadopt an interpretation that will defeat [a stat-\nute\u2019s] own purpose, if it will admit of any other rea-\nsonable construction.\u201d The Emily, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) \n381, 388 (1824). It should do the same here. \nD. Treating mid-appeal Rule 15 motions  \nas second or successive would produce \nperverse results. \nAll agree that \u00a72244(b) kicks in after a prisoner has \nexhausted the opportunity for review of his initial \nhabeas petition. But applying \u00a72244(b)(2) to mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motions creates a procedural patch-\nwork and slams the door on viable constitutional \nclaims long before AEDPA demands. \n1. Treating mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as second \nor successive applications creates \u201cprocedural anoma-\nlies.\u201d Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 380\u201381 \n(2003). \u201c[T]he courts of appeals agree \u2026 that an \namended petition, filed after the initial one but before \njudgment, is not second or successive.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 512. And if the prisoner won on appeal, Rule \n15 would also govern any post-remand motion to \namend. See Boyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th \n1232, 1240 (11th Cir. 2024) (Pryor, J., concurring); \nMendoza, 81 F.4th at 468\u201371. Under the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s approach, the very same document would be a \nsuccessive application if a prisoner filed it in the dis-\ntrict court after final judgment, but not if the prison-\ner filed it before final judgment or waited until after \nthe court of appeals vacated and remanded.  \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule also draws senseless dis-\ntinctions between similarly situated prisoners.  \n\n36 \n \n \nMany meritorious petitions depend on new evi-\ndence. E.g., Andrus v. Texas, 590 U.S. 806, 807 \n(2020); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 421\u201322 (1995). \nIn such cases, a prisoner must usually show a \u201crea-\nsonable probability\u201d that, had the new evidence \nemerged sooner, \u201cthe result of the [challenged] pro-\nceeding would have been different.\u201d United States v. \nBagley, 473 U.S. 667, 681\u201382 (1985). That\u2019s a bur-\nden\u2014but much lighter than the one imposed by \nAEDPA. Under \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii), a second or succes-\nsive application must present facts that would \u201cestab-\nlish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for \nconstitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would \nhave found the applicant guilty.\u201d That raises the bar. \nNo longer is it enough to \u201cundermin[e] confidence in \nthe outcome of the trial.\u201d Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678. In-\nstead, the evidence must \u201cestablish \u2026 innocence.\u201d \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 509. And AEDPA also ratchets \nup the burden of proof. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is \nless than a preponderance. See Kyles, 514 U.S. at \n434. But \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii) demands \u201cclear and con-\nvincing evidence\u201d: more than a preponderance. Ca. ex \nrel. Cooper v. Mitchell Bros.\u2019 Santa Ana Theater, 454 \nU.S. 90, 93 n.6 (1981). \nThe difference between these two standards means \nthat identically situated prisoners will face different \noutcomes through no fault of their own. Imagine two \nprisoners whose trial counsel sat on mitigating evi-\ndence that would have yielded a lighter sentence. \nPrisoner 1 requests his counsel\u2019s files, receives them \npromptly, and discovers the evidence while preparing \nhis initial habeas petition. Prisoner 2 also requests \nhis counsel\u2019s files, but the lawyer stonewalls for \nyears\u2014turning them over only on pain of disbarment, \nwhile the prisoner\u2019s initial petition is pending on ap-\npeal. Under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule, Prisoner 1 faces \n\n37 \n \n \nthe Strickland standard and may well get a lesser \nsentence. But Prisoner 2 is out of luck. While the evi-\ndence shows ineffective assistance, it doesn\u2019t show \ninnocence, so he fails under \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii). \nII. Alternatively, \u00a72244(b) applies only after \nthe initial petition is final on appeal. \nThe Court may also reverse for the independent \nreason that \u00a72244(b) does not apply while a prisoner\u2019s \ninitial petition is still pending on appeal. United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104\u201305 (3d Cir. \n2019); Whab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d \nCir. 2005). The Fifth Circuit held otherwise, declaring \nthat that \u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims \u2026 are deemed successive.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a. Contra Banister, 590 U.S. at 510\u201311. If \nthat rule sounds familiar, it should. In Banister, Tex-\nas urged this Court to hold that \u201c[e]ntry of final \njudgment is the dividing line between a first and sec-\nond application.\u201d Brief for Respondent, Banister v. \nDavis, No. 18-6943 at 18. The Court declined that in-\nvitation there, and it should do the same here. In the \npostconviction context, this Court has long treated \nthe end of appellate review\u2014not the entry of final \njudgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. Far from \nrejecting that view, Congress embraced it throughout \nAEDPA, under which a state\u2019s interest in repose \nvests only after a prisoner has exhausted the oppor-\ntunity for review.  \nA. Before AEDPA, courts treated the end of \nappellate review as the dividing line  \nbetween first and successive petitions. \nArticle III creates \u201cnot a batch of unconnected \ncourts, but a judicial department composed of \u2018inferior \ncourts\u2019 and \u2018one supreme Court.\u2019\u201d Plaut v. Spendthrift \n\n38 \n \n \nFarm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 227 (1995). From that \nstructure follows \u201ca distinction between judgments \nfrom which all appeals have been foregone or com-\npleted, and judgments that remain on appeal (or sub-\nject to being appealed).\u201d Id. Only the former is \u201cthe \nfinal word of the department.\u201d Id. That is why this \nCourt\u2019s \u201cunvarying understanding of finality for col-\nlateral review purposes\u201d has always looked to the end \nof appellate review. Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. \n522, 527 (2003). In this context, finality attaches only \n\u201cwhen this Court affirms a conviction on the merits \non direct review or denies a petition for a writ of cer-\ntiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari peti-\ntion expires.\u201d Id. at 528. \nNo surprise, then, that the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases recognized that \u201caction \u2026 on [a] second \napplication\u201d should turn on the \u201ccharacter of the \ncourt or officer to whom the first application was \nmade, and the fullness of the consideration given to \nit.\u201d Cuddy, 40 F. at 66. What mattered to this Court \nin Salinger, for example, was that the \u201cprior refusal\u201d \nof habeas relief had been \u201caffirmed in a considered \nopinion by a Circuit Court of Appeals\u201d\u2014not that a \ndistrict court had entered final judgment. 265 U.S. at \n226\u201327, 232 (emphasis added). Likewise, Justice \nField explained in Cuddy that habeas relief was una-\nvailable to a prisoner who had already \u201cinvok[ed] the \njudgment of the appellate court upon the record pre-\nsented\u201d and \u201cfail[ed] therein.\u201d 40 F. at 64 (emphasis \nadded). That implies that consequences for later \nabuses of the writ attached only after a case was final \non appeal. \nCourts continued applying abuse-of-the-writ princi-\nples by reference to appellate review right up until \nCongress enacted AEDPA. Take Walker v. Lockhart, \n\n39 \n \n \n514 F. Supp. 1347 (E.D. Ark. 1981). The prisoner \nthere sought habeas relief in 1967, lost in the district \ncourt (Henley, C.J.), and then lost again on appeal. \nSee id. at 1350. When he filed \u201cidentical\u201d claims \ntwelve years later, the district court (Woods, J.) de-\nclined to \u201creac[h] the merits\u201d of the successive peti-\ntion. Id. If the dividing line between first and succes-\nsive petitions was final judgment, one would expect \nJudge Woods to focus on Chief Judge Henley\u2019s 1967 \nopinion\u2014not the Eighth Circuit\u2019s affirmance. Instead, \nJudge Woods reasoned that reconsidering the claims \n\u201cwould put this Court in the position of reviewing a \ndecision of its Court of Appeals.\u201d Id. at 1352 (empha-\nsis added). Here again, this suggests that appellate \nreview was the dividing line for abuse-of-the-writ \npurposes. See also, e.g., Whitney v. United States, 424 \nF. Supp. 1236, 1237 (E.D. Mo. 1976); Andrews v. \nDeland, 943 F.2d 1162, 1173 (10th Cir. 1991).  \nIf pre-AEDPA courts thought that final judgment \nwas what mattered for abuse-of-the-writ purposes, \n\u201cthere should be lots of decisions\u201d saying so. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 514. Instead, courts consistently spoke as \nthough the end of appellate review marked the divid-\ning line between first and successive petitions. \nAgainst that backdrop, a rule focused on final judg-\nment is \u201cbad wine of recent vintage.\u201d Rotkiske v. \nKlemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019) (citation omitted). \nB. AEDPA itself pegs finality to the end of \nappellate review, not final judgment. \nNumerous provisions of AEDPA treat the end of \nappellate review as the relevant inflection point. It \nwould be strange if \u00a72244(b) broke ranks and focused \non the district court\u2019s entry of judgment. \n\n40 \n \n \nAEDPA ties exhaustion to the end of state appel-\nlate review. To seek federal habeas relief, a state \nprisoner must first \u201cexhaust[t] the remedies available \nin the courts of the State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A). \nThat means receiving not just a final judgment from \nthe trial court, but also \u201cinvoking one complete round \nof the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999). \nSection 2244 itself focuses on the end of appellate \nreview for statute-of-limitations and tolling purposes. \nUnder \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), the one-year deadline for seek-\ning federal habeas relief runs from the date \u201con which \nthe [state] judgment became final by the conclusion of \ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking \nsuch review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) (emphasis \nadded); see also id. \u00a72263(a). And tolling works the \nsame way. AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is tolled \nwhile an application for state postconviction relief is \n\u201cpending.\u201d Id. \u00a72244(d)(2). An application does not \ncease to be pending upon \u201ca lower court\u2019s entry of \njudgment.\u201d Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214, 219 (2002). \nRather, it remains \u201cpending\u201d until it \u201chas achieved \nfinal resolution.\u201d Id. at 220\u201321; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72263(b)(2). \nPostconviction review of federal judgments follows \nthe same pattern. Under \u00a72255(f)(1), a prisoner must \nseek relief within one year after a federal \u201cjudgment \nof conviction becomes final.\u201d In that context, finality \ndoes not attach until this Court has spoken or the \nchance for review has run. Clay, 537 U.S. at 527\u201328. \nC. A state\u2019s interest in repose does not vest \nuntil the end of appellate review. \nAEDPA functions as a statute of repose. Federal \nhabeas law gives prisoners one chance to drag state \n\n41 \n \n \nprosecutors into federal court. After that, \u00a72244(b)(2) \ntells them not to come back unless they have \u201ca new \nand retroactive rule of constitutional law\u201d or \u201cprevi-\nously undiscoverable facts\u201d showing \u201cinnocence.\u201d \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 509. Beyond those narrow ex-\nceptions, AEDPA \u201ceffect[s] a legislative judgment\u201d \nthat states \u201cshould be free\u201d from the burden of de-\nfending the same conviction twice. CTS Corp. v. \nWaldburger, 573 U.S. 1, 9 (2014) (cleaned up). \nBut Congress did not recognize a state\u2019s interest in \nrepose while a prisoner\u2019s first petition remains pend-\ning. If that interest vested after a district court enters \nfinal judgment, the case should end there. Instead, \nCongress authorized \u201cappeals from the habeas court\u2019s \njudgment\u201d and \u201cstill later petitions to this Court\u201d\u2014\ntreating them both as \u201cfurther iterations of the first \nhabeas application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. Since \nthe case is \u201cpending until the appeal is disposed of,\u201d \nMackenzie v. A. Engelhard & Sons Co., 266 U.S. 131, \n142\u201343 (1924), the state\u2019s interest in repose vests on-\nly when the case is final on appeal.    \nIII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary arguments fail. \nA. Gonzalez does not control this case. \nThe Fifth Circuit thought that \u201cprinciples\u201d from \nGonzalez v. Crosby required it to deem Rivers\u2019s mo-\ntion successive. See Pet. App. 10a. Not at all. The \ncourt squeezed those principles from \u201ca handful of \nsentences extracted from [a] decisio[n] that had no \nreason to pass on\u201d the question presented here. \nBrown v. Davenport, 142 S. Ct. 1510, 1528 (2022). \nNor does this case raise the circumvention concerns \nthat motivated Gonzalez. Rule 15 and Rule 60(b) have \nlittle in common, and allowing mid-appeal Rule 15 \n\n42 \n \n \nmotions poses even less circumvention risk than al-\nlowing the Rule 59(e) motions approved in Banister.   \n1. Gonzalez did not address \u00a72242 or analyze when \n\u00a72244(b) first kicks in, so it \u201ccannot make [the Court] \nstop in its tracks.\u201d Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, \u2014 S. Ct. \u2014 (2025) (slip op. at 17). \nThe question in Gonzalez was \u201cwhether a Rule \n60(b) motion filed by a habeas petitioner is a \u2018habeas \ncorpus application\u2019 as the statute uses that term.\u201d \n545 U.S. at 530. To answer that question, the Court \nexplained, the \u201cfirst step of analysis\u201d is to ask wheth-\ner the motion contains a habeas \u201cclaim\u201d\u2014\u201can assert-\ned federal basis for relief\u201d from a state conviction. Id. \nat 530. When a Rule 60(b) motion seeks to \u201cadd a new \nground for relief\u201d or relitigate the \u201cprevious resolu-\ntion of a claim on the merits,\u201d it raises a \u201cclaim.\u201d Id. \nat 532. But that is not the case when the motion at-\ntacks \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal ha-\nbeas proceedings.\u201d Id. The Rule 60(b) motion in Gon-\nzalez attacked a \u201cnonmerits aspect\u201d of the prior habe-\nas proceeding, so there was \u201cno basis\u201d to treat it like a \nhabeas application at all. Id. at 533\u201334.  \nGonzalez also reasoned that a merits-based Rule \n60(b) motion is a habeas application (or at least its \nfunctional equivalent) and \u201cshould be treated accord-\ningly\u201d when the filing is second or successive. Id. at \n531\u201332. We have no quarrel with that proposition. \nThis case involves a Rule 15 motion, not a Rule 60(b) \nmotion. Gonzalez said nothing about Rule 15 or \n\u00a72242, not a single brief cited those provisions, and \nthey did not come up at argument. Nor did Gonzalez \nimplicate or address whether the dividing line be-\ntween an initial petition and a \u201csecond or successive\u201d \npetition is final judgment or the end of the appeal. \nThe Court had no occasion to consider that issue be-\n\n43 \n \n \ncause Aurelio Gonzalez filed his Rule 60(b) motion \nmore than a year after \u201cabandon[ing] any attempt to \nseek review\u201d of the order denying his habeas petition. \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537. So unlike this case, there \nwas no pending appeal in Gonzalez. \n2. Nor does Gonzalez\u2019s logic control. Gonzalez wor-\nried about circumvention because the prisoner there \nwas relying on a generally applicable Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure\u2014not the federal habeas statute itself. \nBut those concerns are misplaced here. When a pris-\noner moves to amend or supplement his initial peti-\ntion, habeas law \u201citself contains\u201d the pathway he \n\u201cseeks to exploit.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 530 (Alito, J., \ndissenting). In other words, Congress has already \nweighed the risks of circumvention and determined \nthat applications \u201cmay be amended or supplemented \nas provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civ-\nil actions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. If \u00a72242 is \u201cbad policy\u201d or \n\u201cworking in unintended ways,\u201d states \u201ccan ask Con-\ngress to change the law.\u201d But \u201cthis Court is not the \nforum for such arguments.\u201d Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Becer-\nra, 596 U.S. 724, 738 (2022).  \nIn all events, mid-appeal Rule 15 motions differ \nfrom the Rule 60(b) motions at issue in Gonzalez \u201cin \njust about every way that matters.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 518. They were not historically deemed abu-\nsive. See supra \u00a71.B.2. They are not \u201copen-ended\u201d: \nthey\u2019re brought within the \u201cfixed \u2026 window\u201d while an \nappeal is pending\u2014the next phase in the \u201coriginal \nproceeding.\u201d 590 U.S. at 519\u201320; see supra \u00a7II.A. Any \nappeal would be consolidated into the pending ap-\npeal. See supra \u00a7I.C.2. And (as we discuss next) nu-\nmerous \u201crules suppres[s] abuse.\u201d 590 U.S. at 520. In \nfact, mid-appeal Rule 15 motions pose far less cir-\ncumvention risk than the Rule 59(e) motions this \n\n44 \n \n \nCourt approved in Banister. Rule 59(e) lets prisoners \nraise \u201cnew arguments\u201d based on \u201cnewly discovered or \npreviously unavailable evidence\u201d with the say-so of a \nsingle judge. Banister 590 U.S. at 508 n.2 (citation \nomitted). By contrast, amending mid-appeal requires \nat least three judges to agree that the claim is worth \nthe candle: the district court plus a panel majority\u2014\nthe same lineup needed for a second or successive pe-\ntition. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(3)\u2013(4). \nB. The ordinary civil rules provide ample \nsafeguards against abusive motions.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also worried about opening the \nfloodgates to \u201can unlimited number of new applica-\ntions until the appeal is over.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Even \nwithout \u00a72244(b)(2), however, numerous barriers still \nincentivize prisoners to bring all their claims at once, \nas 20 years of experience in the Second Circuit shows. \n1. Rivers\u2019s rule \u201cmaintains a prisoner\u2019s incentives to \nconsolidate all of his claims in his initial application.\u201d \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 516. To see why, just count the \nhurdles that a prisoner must clear before amending \nhis petition mid-appeal. First he needs an indicative \nruling from the same judge who just ruled against \nhim. Next he faces an absolute jurisdictional barrier: \nwithout two votes to remand, his motion to amend is \ngoing nowhere. Of course, none of that will happen \nunless he can show that his proposed amendments \nare not prejudicial, dilatory, or futile. Foman, 371 \nU.S. at 182. Then there are abuse-of-the-writ rules, \ne.g., Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106, which turn away \nclaims that \u201cw[ere], or could have been, raised \u2026 ear-\nlier,\u201d James v. Walsh, 308 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. \n2002), or whose \u201cwhose purpose is to vex, harass or \ndelay,\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 179 (2d \nCir. 2002). And that still leaves AEDPA\u2019s one-year \n\n45 \n \n \nstatute of limitations and Rule 15\u2019s relation-back re-\nquirements, see Mayle, 545 U.S. at 648\u201350, which to-\ngether will doom untimely amendments.  \nAll but the most promising claims will falter in that \nobstacle course\u2014and any self-interested prisoner has \ngood reason to avoid it. (Of course, any prisoners who \nwould be undeterred by all of that are likely the sort \nof prisoners who would try their luck on \u00a72244(b)(2) \nas well. Channeling their mid-appeal filings through \nthe district court is far more efficient than saddling \nthe court of appeals with them. See supra \u00a7I.C.1.) \n2. The Second Circuit is a perfect case study. For \nthe last two decades, courts there have applied \n\u00a72244(b) only after a prisoner exhausts appellate re-\nview of his initial petition. Whab, 408 F.3d at 118. \nThey have not seen a flood of mid-appeal habeas mo-\ntions. Nor are they struggling to handle the motions \nthey do receive. Courts in the Second Circuit routine-\nly deny such motions in concise orders, e.g., Cooper v. \nUnited States, 2013 WL 57043 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2013) \n(two pages), issued within a matter of days, e.g., \nSteele v. United States, 2022 WL 4292271 (S.D.N.Y. \nSept. 16, 2022) (seven business days). And they often \ndo so on threshold grounds, without requesting a re-\nsponse. E.g., Lewis v. Brown, 2013 WL 2181520, at *6 \n(W.D.N.Y. May 20, 2013) (abuse of the writ). Two \ndecades in, the sky has not fallen in the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2014and it won\u2019t fall anywhere else either.  \nIV. The Court should reverse and remand. \nA. Under the correct standard, this is an easy case. \nWhen Rivers moved to amend in February 2021, his \npending appeal barred the district court from grant-\ning the motion. See Griggs, 459 U.S. at 58. But Rule \n62.1(a)(3) still permitted the district court to consider \n\n46 \n \n \nthe motion and determine whether it \u201craise[d] a sub-\nstantial issue\u201d under the Rule 15 standards. A court \nthat had \u201calready analyzed\u201d Rivers\u2019s initial petition \nwould have no trouble answering that question. \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 340 n.15 (2010). \nAmendment is plainly warranted here. When the \ndistrict court denied relief in Rivers\u2019s initial habeas \naction, it held that Rivers had not shown his counsel\u2019s \nperformance was \u201cso flawed that it prejudiced his \ncase.\u201d Davis, 2018 WL 4443153, at *5, recommenda-\ntion adopted 2018 WL 4409830, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Sept. \n17, 2018). But the state investigator\u2019s report tips the \nbalance. It shows that counsel had \u201cexculpatory evi-\ndence in their possession\u201d yet failed to use it, J.A. \n68\u2014a classic Strickland violation. E.g., Richards v. \nQuarterman, 566 F.3d 553, 568 (5th Cir. 2009). And it \nalso suggests that the state \u201cfalsely pursued child \npornography charges\u201d based on evidence its \u201cown in-\nvestigators\u201d had deemed \u201cNOT CHILD PORN.\u201d J.A. \n74. That violates due process. See Giles v. Maryland, \n386 U.S. 66, 74\u201380 (1967). All of that makes this a \nstraightforward case under Rule 15. \nB. The Fifth Circuit deemed it \u201cunclear\u201d what relief \nRivers could obtain now that his initial habeas peti-\ntion has been denied, Pet. App. 3a n.2. The answer is \nsimple. If this Court reverses, the district court can \ngrant Rivers effective relief by reopening the judg-\nment denying his initial habeas petition. While Texas \nwill be free to oppose such relief below, it has waived \nany objection here. See Sup. Ct. R. 15.2. \nThe district court\u2019s error skewed the proceedings \nthat followed. Rather than considering Rivers\u2019s mo-\ntion on the merits as part of his original habeas ac-\ntion, the court opened a new action and ultimately \nheld that \u00a72244(b) left it \u201cwithout jurisdiction.\u201d Pet. \n\n47 \n \n \nApp. 19a. That was wrong\u2014and the mistake had con-\nsequences. Rivers tried to amend his initial petition \nin February 2021, a full year before the last filings \nwere submitted in his initial habeas appeal. Compare \nJ.A. 5, with J.A. 9. But for that error, the district \ncourt could have issued an indicative ruling in the \noriginal habeas action, inviting the Fifth Circuit to \nremand well before the panel picked up a single brief. \nInstead, with no indicative ruling, the panel affirmed \nthe denial of habeas relief without addressing the \nnewly discovered evidence. \nOn remand, the district court can give Rivers effec-\ntive relief by setting aside the judgment denying his \nhabeas petition on the ground that its error under-\nmined \u201cthe integrity of\u201d his original habeas action. \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 (addressing integrity-based \nRule 60 motions). The court will then be free to con-\nsider Rivers\u2019s motion on the merits for the first time \nand to let Rivers amend in light of the newly discov-\nered evidence. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand. \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

Eric Guerrero, Director, Texas Department of Criminal Justice, Correctional Institutions Division* (Docket: 23-1345). The case centers on the procedural rules governing federal habeas corpus petitions under the Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 (AEDPA).\n\nThe key facts are:\n1.  Rivers filed a first federal habeas petition in 2017, which was denied.\n2.  While the appeal of that denial was still pending, he filed a second habeas petition in 2021 based on new information.\n3.  The lower courts dismissed this second petition as \"successive\" under AEDPA, which imposes strict limitations on such filings.\n\nThe central legal question for the Supreme Court is a matter of statutory interpretation: Does the \"second or successive\" petition rule in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) apply to a petition filed while the litigation of the petitioner's first petition is not yet final (i.e., an appeal is still pending)? My understanding of the specific legal arguments, the precedents each side will rely on, and the reasoning of the Fifth Circuit remains limited.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief was that I had no knowledge of effective strategies for SCOTUS prediction. This observation has provided my first piece of meta-level guidance.\n\nA foundational strategy for approaching a new case, particularly one involving complex statutory interpretation like this AEDPA case, is to prioritize the primary source documents that frame the dispute for the Court. The agent's reasoning confirms that the most direct path to reducing uncertainty is not a broad search, but a targeted analysis of the core legal arguments.\n\nTherefore, I have learned a new, effective heuristic:\n*   **Strategy:** When beginning analysis of a SCOTUS case, start by reading the petitioner's brief on the merits.\n*   **Rationale:** This source provides the most direct and comprehensive explanation of the legal arguments being advanced, the specific interpretation of the statute at issue, and the key precedents that will form the basis of the legal battle. It is the most efficient way to build a foundational understanding of the task parameters (\u03b8).\n*   **Meta-Knowledge:** The observation that AEDPA cases are \"notoriously complex and technical\" is a crucial piece of design-level information. It suggests that prediction in this area may rely more heavily on close textual analysis and the justices' specific views on statutory interpretation (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism) than on broader ideological leanings. This will guide my future information gathering toward sources that illuminate these technical aspects."

This has significantly reduced my uncertainty about the task parameters (\u03b8) by clarifying the petitioner's legal arguments, their reliance on specific statutes (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242) and precedents (*Banister v. Davis*), and their narrative framing.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be refined. I previously knew the core facts of *Rivers v. Guerrero* (Docket: 23-1345) and the general legal question regarding AEDPA's \"second or successive\" petition rule. I understood that Rivers filed a second habeas petition while his first was on appeal, leading to a procedural dismissal.\n\nThe Petitioner's Brief on the Merits has now provided a detailed, albeit one-sided, view of the legal landscape. My knowledge has been updated significantly:\n\n*   **Refined Legal Arguments:** I now understand the petitioner's two-pronged legal strategy.\n    1.  **Primary Argument (It's an Amendment, not a New Petition):** The petitioner's core claim is that his 2021 filing was not a \"second or successive\" application at all, but rather a motion to amend his *initial* application. This argument is grounded in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242, which explicitly states that a habeas application \"may be amended or supplemented as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\" The brief argues this directly incorporates Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1, which provides a specific mechanism for a district court to consider a motion and flag it as raising a \"substantial issue\" even while an appeal is pending. The petitioner contends that this specific statutory permission to amend (\u00a7 2242) cannot be implicitly overridden by the general restrictions on successive petitions in \u00a7 2244(b).\n    2.  **Alternative Argument (Finality):** If the Court does not accept the \"amendment\" theory, the petitioner argues that \u00a7 2244(b)'s restrictions only apply *after* appellate review of the first petition is complete, not merely after the district court enters a final judgment. This argument relies on pre-AEDPA historical practice (the \"abuse-of-the-writ\" doctrine) and the structure of AEDPA itself, which they claim pegs finality to the conclusion of the entire appellate process.\n\n*   **Key Precedents Identified:** The petitioner's case hinges on the interpretation of two key Supreme Court decisions:\n    *   ***Banister v. Davis* (2020):** This is the central precedent for the petitioner. They use its framework\u2014analyzing historical practice and statutory aims\u2014to argue that a mid-appeal filing based on newly discovered evidence would not have been considered an \"abuse of the writ\" and that treating it as \"successive\" would lead to perverse results, contrary to AEDPA's aims.\n    *   ***Gonzalez v. Crosby* (2005):** The petitioner actively seeks to distinguish this case. They argue *Gonzalez* involved a Rule 60(b) motion filed *after* the petitioner had abandoned his appeal, whereas Rivers filed while his appeal was actively being litigated.\n\n*   **Factual and Narrative Framing:** The petitioner frames the case around fundamental fairness, emphasizing that the new evidence was an \"exculpatory report\" discovered in his attorney's files, who had allegedly been drunk at trial. This narrative context is designed to show the practical, and potentially unjust, consequences of the Fifth Circuit's procedural ruling.\n\nMy predictive model is still uncertain, as I have not yet seen the Respondent's counter-arguments. However, the petitioner has presented a strong, textually-grounded argument based on \u00a7 2242 that appears to be a direct challenge to the Fifth Circuit's reasoning. The case will likely turn on whether the Court sees an irreconcilable conflict between \u00a7 2242 and \u00a7 2244(b), and how it applies the framework from *Banister*.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of how to approach SCOTUS predictions has been significantly reinforced and expanded.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategy:** My initial heuristic\u2014**\"When beginning analysis of a SCOTUS case, start by reading the petitioner's brief on the merits\"**\u2014has been proven exceptionally effective. This single observation transformed my understanding from a general overview to a detailed, argument-specific analysis. It provided the statutory fulcrum of the case, the key precedents, and the narrative framing, dramatically reducing my uncertainty about the task parameters (\u03b8). The brief serves as a comprehensive roadmap to the legal battle.\n\n*   **New Heuristics & Meta-Knowledge:**\n    1.  **Identify the Core Conflict:** In cases of statutory interpretation, a crucial strategy is to locate the central tension between different legal texts. This observation revealed the core conflict is between 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 (which expressly permits amendment) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) (which generally restricts subsequent petitions). Future analysis of similar cases should prioritize identifying this central point of friction.\n    2.  **The \"Term of Art\" Heuristic:** The brief's description of \"second or successive\" as a \"term of art\" is a powerful meta-level signal. When a legal phrase is a \"term of art,\" its plain meaning is insufficient. The correct analytical approach must then incorporate historical context (like the pre-AEDPA \"abuse-of-the-writ\" doctrine) and judicial precedent that has shaped its meaning. This is a generalizable principle for interpreting specialized legal language.\n    3.  **Find the \"Linchpin\" Precedent:** The petitioner's heavy reliance on *Banister v. Davis* highlights its importance. A new, effective strategy is: **\"Identify the most recent and relevant Supreme Court precedent and analyze how each party uses or distinguishes it.\"** This \"linchpin\" case is often the foundation upon which the Court will build its own opinion.\n    4.  **Appreciate Narrative Framing:** The brief's introduction, focusing on the \"exculpatory report\" and the \"drunk\" lawyer, is not just background; it's a strategic choice to frame the procedural question within a narrative of potential injustice. This reinforces a design principle: predicting outcomes requires understanding not only the dry legal arguments but also the persuasive story each side is telling the Court. This is especially relevant for justices who may be swayed by the equitable implications of a ruling.\n    5.  **AEDPA Case Complexity:** This observation reinforces my prior belief that AEDPA cases are \"notoriously complex and technical.\" The petitioner's argument, which weaves together multiple statutes, federal rules, and historical doctrines, confirms that success in this domain requires close textual analysis rather than broad ideological prediction."

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes.

Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n43: 20241015114816247_23-134520Rivers20Word20Count20Cert.json (score: 0.429)\nNo. 23-1345 \n \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nDANNY RICHARD RIVERS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \n \nBOBBY LUMPKIN, DIRECTOR, TDCJ-CID,  \nRespondent. \n \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari \nTo the Fifth Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S WORD COUNT CERTIFICATION \n \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document \ncontains 3,965 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted \nby Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal and factual landscape of *Rivers v. Guerrero* (23-1345) remains stable, as this observation was a reflection on strategy rather than an intake of new case-specific evidence. My knowledge is therefore still based on the petitioner's brief on the merits.\n\n*   **Core Facts:** Danny Rivers filed a second federal habeas petition in February 2021 while his first petition's appeal was still pending. He argues this second filing, based on new evidence from his attorney's file, should be treated as an amendment to the first petition, not a \"successive\" one barred by AEDPA. The Fifth Circuit dismissed it for lack of jurisdiction.\n*   **Petitioner's Legal Arguments:**\n    1.  **Primary Argument (Amendment):** The petitioner's central claim is that 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242, which allows habeas applications to be \"amended or supplemented,\" provides the controlling rule. They argue this incorporates civil procedure rules (like FRCP 62.1) that allow a district court to consider a motion even during an appeal, and that this specific permission to amend cannot be overridden by the general restrictions on successive petitions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b).\n    2.  **Alternative Argument (Finality):** If not an amendment, the petitioner argues a petition is only \"successive\" under \u00a7 2244(b) after the *entire appellate process* for the first petition is complete, not just after the district court's initial judgment. This argument is rooted in pre-AEDPA \"abuse-of-the-writ\" doctrine.\n*   **Key Precedents (Petitioner's View):**\n    *   ***Banister v. Davis* (2020):** Used as the foundational framework to argue that a mid-appeal filing based on new evidence is not the type of \"abuse\" that AEDPA's \"successive\" petition rules were designed to prevent.\n    *   ***Gonzalez v. Crosby* (2005):** Distinguished on the grounds that it involved a post-appeal motion after the petitioner had given up, whereas Rivers was actively litigating his appeal.\n*   **Narrative Frame:** The petitioner presents a story of potential injustice, highlighting the discovery of an \"exculpatory report\" and alleging his trial lawyer was drunk, to underscore the substantive importance of the procedural question.\n*   **Current Uncertainty:** My knowledge is currently comprehensive but critically one-sided. The most significant gap in my understanding is the State of Texas's counter-argument. I cannot form a confident prediction until I know how the respondent will interpret the interplay between \u00a7 2242 and \u00a7 2244(b), how they will apply or distinguish *Banister*, and what precedents they will marshal in support of the Fifth Circuit's bright-line rule.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an internal reflection on strategy, significantly refines my meta-level understanding of effective experimental design for legal prediction. My methodology continues to evolve from simple heuristics to more complex, integrated strategies.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategy:** The heuristic **\"When beginning analysis of a SCOTUS case, start by reading the petitioner's brief on the merits\"** remains a highly effective starting point. It provides the essential roadmap of arguments, statutes, and precedents.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **Identify the Core Conflict:** This remains a crucial strategy. The conflict between \u00a7 2242 (amendment) and \u00a7 2244(b) (successive petitions) is the case's center of gravity.\n    2.  **The \"Term of Art\" Heuristic:** The principle that terms like \"second or successive\" require analysis of historical context and precedent, not just plain meaning, is confirmed as a vital tool for statutory cases.\n    3.  **Find the \"Linchpin\" Precedent:** The strategy of identifying the key recent precedent (*Banister*) and tracking its use by both sides is essential.\n    4.  **Appreciate Narrative Framing:** Understanding the persuasive story (potential injustice vs. procedural finality) remains critical for predicting how different justices might vote.\n    5.  **AEDPA Case Complexity:** The technical nature of AEDPA litigation is reaffirmed, prioritizing close textual analysis.\n    6.  **NEW - The \"Argumentative Symmetry\" Principle:** The previous heuristic of reading the petitioner's brief is now understood as only the first half of a necessary process. A robust prediction requires a dialectical understanding. The refined strategy is: **\"Sequentially analyze the petitioner's and then the respondent's briefs to build a complete, adversarial model of the legal conflict.\"** A one-sided view is inherently fragile.\n    7.  **NEW - Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking:** This observation exemplifies a core DBOED principle. The most effective strategy is to consciously model one's own uncertainty. The new heuristic is: **\"After processing a major piece of evidence, explicitly identify the largest remaining source of uncertainty and prioritize the next action to directly address it.\"** In this instance, the uncertainty is \"the respondent's argument,\" and the optimal action is \"analyze the respondent's brief.\"\n    8.  **NEW - The Value of Strategic Pauses:** The `THINK` action itself demonstrates a powerful meta-strategy. Forcing a moment of reflection to synthesize information, evaluate the current knowledge state, and plan the next move is more effective than simply consuming information reactively. This validates the inclusion of explicit reasoning and planning steps within the overall research process."

Its value is not in introducing new external data, but in synthesizing existing knowledge and optimally planning the next observation.\n\nTask EIG (0.6): The action significantly reduces uncertainty about the *path to a final prediction*. By analyzing the now-symmetrical arguments, it correctly identifies that the influence of third parties (amici) is the next major unknown variable. This act of structuring the problem and identifying the next key question is a tangible form of information gain, as it makes the subsequent search for information far more efficient and targeted. It moves the agent from a general state of uncertainty to a specific, answerable question.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action is a textbook execution of the 'Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking' heuristic that is central to the agent's design. It demonstrates a robust, repeatable cycle: 1) Acquire information (Respondent's BIO), 2) Synthesize and achieve 'argumentative symmetry', 3) Explicitly identify the largest remaining uncertainty (amicus influence), and 4) Formulate a plan to address it. Validating this core loop provides extremely high-value information for the agent's general strategy (D), proving its effectiveness in practice. It also sets up the next 'experiment': evaluating the predictive weight of amicus briefs in this context.\n\nJoint EIG (1.4): The action is highly valuable overall. While the subsequent SEARCH for amicus briefs will provide more direct task-level data, this THINK action is what makes that search optimal.

The previous gap in my knowledge\u2014the respondent's arguments\u2014has now been largely filled by analyzing the Respondent's Brief in Opposition (BIO). While this is a cert-stage document, not a merits brief, it clearly outlines the State of Texas's core legal strategy.\n\n*   **Core Facts:** My understanding of the factual timeline remains stable. Rivers filed a second habeas petition while the appeal of the first was pending, arguing it should be treated as an amendment.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Now Two-Sided):**\n    *   **Petitioner's Stance:** A mid-appeal filing based on new evidence is not an \"abusive\" second bite at the apple. Therefore, it should be governed by the flexible \"amendment\" provision of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242, not the strict gatekeeping rules for \"successive\" petitions in \u00a7 2244(b).\n    *   **Respondent's Stance (New Information):** The Fifth Circuit's decision was correct and mandated by precedent. The key is the entry of a final judgment by the district court. Any subsequent filing that raises new habeas claims is, by its nature, a \"successive\" petition under \u00a7 2244(b). The label \"motion to amend\" is a \"distinction without a difference.\"\n\n*   **The Battleground of Precedent (Now Two-Sided):**\n    *   ***Gonzalez v. Crosby* (2005):**\n        *   **Petitioner's View:** *Gonzalez* is distinguishable because it involved a petitioner whose case was over, not one actively litigating an appeal.\n        *   **Respondent's View (New Information):** *Gonzalez* is the controlling precedent. It established the crucial rule: a post-judgment motion that advances habeas claims is a successive petition. Texas argues Rivers's filing is functionally identical to the Rule 60(b) motion in *Gonzalez*.\n    *   ***Banister v. Davis* (2020):**\n        *   **Petitioner's View:** *Banister* provides the framework, showing that not all second-in-time filings are \"successive\" and that the \"abuse-of-the-writ\" history is relevant.\n        *   **Respondent's View (New Information):** *Banister* is a narrow exception that proves their rule. It applies *only* to Rule 59(e) motions, which are filed within 28 days and suspend the finality of the judgment. Rivers's filing, years later and during an appeal, is procedurally nothing like a Rule 59(e) motion and therefore falls outside the *Banister* exception.\n\n*   **Statutory Interpretation (Now Two-Sided):**\n    *   **Petitioner:** \u00a7 2242 (amendment) is a specific grant of authority that trumps the general prohibition in \u00a7 2244(b).\n    *   **Respondent (New Information):** \u00a7 2244(b) is the specific, stringent gatekeeper for all second-in-time petitions raising new claims post-judgment. It was enacted by Congress to override older, more lenient doctrines and would trump any inconsistent procedural rule, including the petitioner's interpretation of the amendment process.\n\n*   **Narrative Framing (Now Two-Sided):**\n    *   **Petitioner:** A story of potential injustice, where a procedural rule prevents a court from hearing powerful new evidence (exculpatory report, drunk lawyer).\n    *   **Respondent (New Information):** A story of procedural finality and judicial efficiency. Allowing endless \"amendments\" during a pending appeal would frustrate AEDPA's core goals of ending piecemeal litigation and bringing finality to state court judgments. Rivers is attempting a \"second bite of the proverbial apple.\"\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty:** My primary uncertainty has shifted. I no longer lack the respondent's core argument. However, I am still missing:\n    1.  The Respondent's Brief on the Merits, which may contain refined or additional arguments.\n    2.  The views of any *amici curiae*, especially the U.S. Solicitor General, which can be highly influential.\n    3.  The transcript of the oral argument, which will reveal the justices' specific questions and lines of reasoning.\n    My confidence in a prediction is much higher, as the case appears to be a classic clash between a formalist, bright-line rule (*Gonzalez*) and a more purposive, flexible approach (*Banister*). The respondent's argument appears textually and structurally strong.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was highly informative, validating my evolving strategy and providing key insights into the nature of legal information gathering. My methodology continues to become more robust and nuanced.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategy:**\n    *   **\"Start with the petitioner's brief on the merits\"** remains the best initial action.\n    *   **\"Identify the Core Conflict,\" \"The 'Term of Art' Heuristic,\" \"Find the 'Linchpin' Precedent,\"** and **\"Appreciate Narrative Framing\"** are all confirmed as essential analytical tools.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Argumentative Symmetry\" Principle (Refined):** This principle is essential, but its application must be flexible. The refined strategy is: **\"Seek the opposing counsel's core arguments. While the merits brief is ideal, a Brief in Opposition (BIO) is a high-value substitute that reveals the central legal strategy, key precedents, and narrative framing.\"** This observation proves that a perfect document is not required to achieve argumentative symmetry; a good-enough substitute can be transformative.\n    2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (Validated):** This observation is a powerful confirmation of the DBOED model. I explicitly identified \"the respondent's argument\" as my largest uncertainty, and my action directly targeted it. This led to the single most significant reduction in uncertainty so far. The heuristic **\"After processing a major piece of evidence, explicitly identify the largest remaining source of uncertainty and prioritize the next action to directly address it\"** is now a cornerstone of my methodology.\n    3.  **The Value of Strategic Pauses:** The `THINK` action that led to this search remains a validated meta-strategy for synthesizing knowledge and planning effective actions.\n    4.  **NEW - The \"Cert-Stage Preview\" Heuristic:** A BIO is more than just a substitute for a merits brief; it's a distinct information source. The new heuristic is: **\"Analyze the Brief in Opposition not just for legal arguments, but for how a party frames the case's importance and the nature of any circuit split. This provides a preview of their merits strategy and insight into why the Court granted cert.\"** Texas's framing of the circuit split as a \"small minority\" that should \"self-correct\" is a key piece of strategic information gleaned from the BIO.\n    5.  **NEW - The \"Document Type Matters\" Heuristic:** The search returned several documents, but I correctly identified the BIO as the most valuable and distinguished it from the merits brief I was seeking. This highlights a new principle: **\"Always verify the precise type and purpose of a legal document (e.g., BIO vs. Merits Brief, Majority Opinion vs. Dissent). This context is critical for correctly interpreting its strategic intent and informational value.\"** A failed search for one document can be a successful discovery of another, equally valuable one."

Phillips Black further contributes to the \nrule of law by consulting with counsel in habeas cor-\npus litigation, conducting clinical training in law \nschools, and developing research on the administra-\ntion of criminal justice. \nPhillps Black attorneys frequently publish schol-\narship and teach courses on constitutional law and \ncriminal and post-conviction procedure, including \nfederal habeas corpus. Additionally, Phillips Black \nhas represented scores of persons challenging their \nconvictions, at every stage of the federal habeas cor-\npus and state post-conviction processes. In addition \nto federal habeas corpus representations, Phillips \nBlack assists persons wrongfully convicted in advo-\ncating for themselves, including\u2014as set forth herein, \ninfra section II\u2014one who was initially denied all re-\nlief under the federal habeas corpus statute, the An-\nti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d), but was ultimately exonerated and has \ngone on to join our staff.  \n \n1 Amicus Curiae avers this brief was not authored in whole \nor in part by counsel for any party and that no person or entity \nother than amicus curiae or its counsel has made a monetary \ncontribution toward the brief\u2019s preparation or submission.  \n\n2 \nPhillips Black\u2019s experience provides deep famili-\narity with the operation of the federal habeas statute \nand its availability for challenging the validity of \nstate court judgments, including those wrongfully \nconvicted.    \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nFederal habeas corpus, as regulated by AEDPA, \nprovides a vital safeguard in protecting the rights of \nthe 1.9 million persons incarcerated in this country. \nSince the Reconstruction Era, the federal habeas \ncorpus statute has explicitly provided a mechanism \nfor ensuring that state courts provide the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s guarantees in the administration of criminal \nlaw. Even prominent critics of federal habeas corpus \njurisprudence have acknowleged it is a vital vehicle \nfor the wrongfully convicted to obtain relief, urging \nthat innocence play a prominent role in its admin-\nistration.  \nHowever, the Court of late has repeatedly ex-\npressed concerns that the lower federal courts are \ngiving inadequate deference to state court judg-\nments. Indeed, a grant of habeas relief, along with a \ndenial of qualified immunity, may be the category of \ncases most likely to be treated with summary rever-\nsal by this Court.  \nTo the extent the Court harbors concerns that \nthe lower federal courts are too quick to grant relief, \nthe actual practices of those courts tell a different \nstory. Federal petitioners, almost all of whom are pro \nse, are exceedingly unlikely to obtain relief of any \n\n3 \nsort. Instead, it is counseled petitioners\u2014almost ex-\nclusively in capital cases, which are rife with close \nquestions of fact and law\u2014who obtain relief. But \nthose cases represent but a tiny fraction of the the \nprison population in this country and the federal \ncourts\u2019 habeas docket.  \nInstead, it is all too often that AEDPA operates \nto foreclose relief for even those suffering from the \ngravest injustices: those who are factually innocent. \nAmicus has identified dozens of persons who were \nultimately exonerated of their crimes, but were \nbarred from obtaining relief under AEDPA. For \nthose individuals, it was only through state court lit-\nigation or the state\u2019s waiver of AEDPA\u2019s procedural \nbars that they obtained relief. To the extent that the \nCourt is concerned that the administration of habeas \ncorpus in the federal courts is driving injustice, Ami-\ncus urges the Court to consider the experience of \nthese individuals.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nFederal Habeas Corpus Plays a Vital Role \nin the Administration of Justice  \nA. Historically, habeas corpus provided a \npost-conviction \nmechanism \nfor \naddressing constitutional defects in \nconvictions \nThe vitality of federal habeas corpus as a means \nfor addressing defects in criminal judgments dates to \nthe founding. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for \njudicial inquiry \u201cinto the cause of [a federal prison-\n\n4 \ner\u2019s] commitment.\u201d See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 14, 1 \nStat. 81-82. The federal courts in the mid-19th cen-\ntury granted post-conviction relief to federal prison-\ners, notwithstanding a lack of express statutory \npower to inquire into final convictions. See Ex parte \nWells, 59 U.S. 307, 315 (1856). And they did so while \nrejecting arguments when they were not empowered \nto do so. Id. at 330 (Curtis, J., dissenting); see also \nEx parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 178 (1874) (granting re-\nlief and discharging federal prisoner in light of Dou-\nble Jeopardy violation).  \nAlong with many other changes to the constitu-\ntional order, the Civil War brought sweeping change \nto the scope of the federal habeas statute. Congress\u2019s \npost-bellum amendment to the Judiciary Act includ-\ned a dramatic change in the scope of its authoriza-\ntion of the writ of habeas corpus. Act of Feb. 5, 1867, \n14 Stat. 385. It expanded the act to reach \u201call cases \nwhere any person may be restrained of his or her \nliberty\u201d in violation of the the Federal Constitution. \nId.    \nIn the wake of these changes, the federal courts \ngranted relief for all manner of constitutional viola-\ntions. As Justice Kagan has noted: \nThe Court granted post-conviction relief to \nprotect habeas applicants\u2019 rights to a grand \njury indictment, to a jury trial to assistance of \ncounsel, and against self-incrimination. The \nCourt granted post-conviction relief for viola-\ntions of the Equal Protection Clause, the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause, and the Ex Post Facto \nClause. And as the due process rights expand-\n\n5 \ned in the first half of the 20th century, the \nCourt held post-conviction habeas relief prop-\ner for those claims too. \nBrown v. Davenport, 596 U.S. 118, 148\u201349 (2002) \n(Kagan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).  \n Historically, federal habeas corpus has played \nan important role in allowing persons to vindicate \ntheir federal constitutional rights in post-conviction \nproceedings. \nB. Federal habeas corpus remains an \nimportant \nvehicle \nfor \ncorrecting \nunconstitutional sentences \nAgainst this historical backdrop, it is undeniable \nthat the current embodiment of the federal habeas \nstatute marks a sharp turn away from providing a \nmechanism for obtaining relief. Instead of simply as-\nsessing the merits of a constitutional claim, habeas \nadjudications are often enmeshed in layers of proce-\ndural issues, requiring the federal courts to deny re-\nlief notwithstanding the merits of a constitutional \nclaim. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Christeson v. Roper, 574 \nU.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per curiam) (\u201cTo be sure, \nChristeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to \nhaving a federal court consider his habeas peti-\ntion.\u201d).  \nBut federal habeas corpus remains as important \nas ever for addressing constitutional errors in crimi-\nnal cases. See, e.g., Andrew v. White, No. 23-6573, __ \nS. Ct. __, Slip Op. at 1 (Jan. 21, 2025) (holding due \nprocess can serve as basis for habeas relief where \n\n6 \n\u201c\u2018evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial \nthat it renders a trial fundamentally unfair\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991)).  \nWith incarceration at historic highs in the Unit-\ned States, the need for federal supervision remains \nimportant to the fair and reliable administration of \ncriminal law. See Ashley Nellis, Mass Incarceration \nTrends, The Sentencing Project Fig. 1 (May 21, \n2024). Approximately 1.9 million people are current-\nly incarcerated in the United States. See Wendy \nSawyer & Peter Wagner, Mass Incarceration: The \nWhole Pie 2024, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 14, \n2024). Over one million of those people are in state \nprisons. Id. By some estimates, at least 4.1% percent \nof those currently facing execution are innocent. See \nSamuel Gross, et al., Rate of False Conviction of \nCriminal Defendants Who Are Sentenced to Death, \n20 Proc. Nat\u2019l Acad. Sci. 7230, 7230 (2014). Like the \npetitioner here, whether they may ever obtain relief \nwill turn on how this Court interprets questions \nabout the scope of the federal habeas statute.  \nNonetheless, many recent decisions of this Court \nhave lamented that the lower federal courts are too \nquick to grant habeas corpus relief. Indeed, when a \nCircuit Court holds that an inmate is entitled to ha-\nbeas relief, this Court is, perhaps more than in any \nother category of cases, likely to intervene and sum-\nmarily reverse. See John Elwood, Holding Prison Of-\nficials \nAccountable \nfor \nCOVID \nMeasures, \nSCOTUSBlog (Jan. 9, 2025) (noting the Court \u201cde-\nvotes significant resources to summary decisions re-\nversing what it concludes are unwarranted denials of \nqualified immunity, as well as unwarranted grants \n\n7 \nof habeas relief.\u201d). When it intervenes in this way, \nthe Court is also often sharply critical of the lower \ncourt. See, e.g., Sexton v. Beaudreaux, 585 U.S. 961, \n967 (2018) (per curiam); Virginia v. LeBlanc, 582 \nU.S. 91, 96 (2017) (\u201cThe federalism interest impli-\ncated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this \ncase, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding created the potential for significant \ndiscord in the Virginia sentencing process.\u201d); John-\nson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 611 (2016) (\u201cThe Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with \nthe \u2018federalism and comity concerns that motivate \nthe adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas \ncontext.\u2019\u201d); Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 281 (2015) \n(\u201cThis is not how habeas review is supposed to work. \nThe record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nflight of fancy.\u201d). These summary reversals are, gen-\nerally, a \u201crare disposition,\u201d but are quite common \nwhere a lower court has granted relief. Schweiker v. \nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dis-\nsenting). That trend demonstrates a willingness to \nspend significant resources restricting the availabil-\nity of habeas relief.  \nWhatever may be behind the appetite for error \ncorrection in habeas cases, the reality on the ground \ntells another story. For example, \u201cIn 1990, according \nto the Administrative Office of the Courts, the peti-\ntioner prevailed in 2.9% of the cases. In 1996, the pe-\ntitioner prevailed in 3.01% of the cases. By 2003, the \nnumber of cases in which the petitioner prevailed \nhad fallen somewhat to 2.75%.\u201d John H. Blume, \nAEDPA: The \u201cHype\u201d and the \u201cBite\u201d, 91 Cornell L. \nRev. 259, 285 (2006). As of 2006, \u201c[l]ess than 1% of \nstate prisoners who file federal habeas petitions ul-\n\n8 \ntimately prevail.\u201d Id. at 284. Notwithstanding this \nincredibly low success rate and historically high lev-\nels of incarceration, the Court continues to single out \nthose who have been granted habeas relief for error \ncorrection. \nII. Innocent People Are Often Unable to \nOvercome AEDPA\u2019s Restrictions  \nInnocence is missing from much of the Court\u2019s \ndiscussion of the operation of the federal writ. To be \nsure, the historical role of the writ was broader and \nfocused on correcting constitutional defects, a broad-\ner concern than innocence alone. Supra \u00a7 I. But even \nmodern critics of the writ have pressed for the writ \nto be available to those with substantial claims of \ninnocence.  \nFamously, Judge Henry J. Friendly, in a critique \nof the Warren Court\u2019s habeas corpus jurisprudence \nasked, \u201cIs innocence irrelevant?\u201d Henry J. Friendly, \nIs Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Crimi-\nnal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142 (1970). Con-\ncluding that it ought not to be, Judge Friendly \nargued for the centrality of innocence to federal ha-\nbeas jurisprudence, contending that, generally, \u201ccon-\nvictions should be subject to collateral attack only \nwhen the prisoner supplements his constitutional \nplea with a colorable claim of innocence.\u201d Id. at 142. \nJudge Friendly\u2019s argument proved influential: writ-\ning for the majority in Stone v. Powell, Justice Pow-\nell cited Judge Friendly for the view that \u201cthe Court \nshould re-examine the substantive scope of federal \nhabeas jurisdiction and limit collateral review\u201d of  \ncertain non-innocence-based claims to the availabil-\n\n9 \nity and adequacy of state-court review. See Stone v. \nPowell, 428 U.S. 465, 480 & n. 13 (1976). The Stone \nmajority itself hewed to Judge Friendly\u2019s view, cir-\ncumscribing non-innocence-based Fourth Amend-\nment claims in federal habeas to whether \u201cthe State \nhas provided an opportunity for full and fair litiga-\ntion\u201d of the claim. See id. at 494\u201395. And Judge \nFriendly\u2019s insistence on the centrality of innocence \nwould continue to influence Justice Powell in his re-\nport on the state of habeas corpus, which would, in \nturn, serve as the basis for AEDPA. See Bryan Ste-\nvenson, The Politics of Fear and Death, 77 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 699, 723 (2002). Indeed, while the word \u201cdefer-\nence\u201d makes no appearance in AEDPA, the statute \nexplicitly spells out a standard for assessing inno-\ncence-based claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(B).  \nIt is no answer to suggest that the State will \nwaive AEDPA\u2019s restrictions in innocence cases. In-\ndeed, States appearing before this Court have re-\npeatedly taken the position that innocence is not \nenough, particularly in habeas cases. See, e.g., Oral \nArg. at *4, Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez, No. 20-1009, \n2021 WL 9526559 (U.S. Dec. 8, 2021) (\u201cThat no fact-\nfinder could have found the prisoner guilty is not \nenough.\u201d). Texas went as far as suggesting that exe-\ncuting the innocent would not, without more, be un-\nconstitutional. See Resp. Br. at *36, Herrera v. \nCollins, No. 91-7328, 1992 WL 532909 (U.S. July 10, \n1992) (\u201cThe question whether an individual is guilty \nor innocent of a state offense is not just a state law \nquestion, which is outside the ambit of federal juris-\ndiction, but is the ultimate state law question at the \ncriminal trial.\u201d (emphasis added)). Moreover, allow-\n\n10 \ning states to be the gatekeeper to relief would effec-\ntively allow the fox to guard the henhouse.  \nAmicus has identified nearly two dozen persons \nwho were exonerated2 after being denied all relief \nunder AEDPA, as enumerated in the Appendix. To \nbe clear, this cohort does not include any persons \nwho were able to clear AEDPA\u2019s hurdles and obtain \nan exoneration. These individuals were denied relief \nunder AEDPA and then later obtained relief, either \nthrough state court proceedings or in federal pro-\nceedings after the state waived AEDPA\u2019s procedural \ndefenses.  \nAlthough each case is compelling\u2014an innocent \nperson was freed despite the federal courts denying \nrelief\u2014several are illustrative and presented here in \nmore detail for the Court\u2019s consideration as it ad-\ndresses the statutory questions in Mr. Rivers\u2019 case.  \nTake first the example of Stephen Lazar,3 who \nwas exonerated in 2023\u2014more than six years after \nthe federal district court denied habeas relief based \n\u201csolely on the exceedingly deferential framework im-\nposed . . . by [AEDPA].\u201d Lazar v. Coleman, No. 14-\n6907, 2017 WL 783666, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2017) \n \n2 To compile this list, counsel have relied on the University \nof Michigan\u2019s widely used National Registry of Exonerations to \nconfirm these exonerations. See Glossary, The National Regis-\ntry \nof \nExonerations, \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.\naspx.  \n3 Mr. Lazar is an employee of Phillips Black, Inc.   \n\n11 \n(\u201cLazar I\u201d). Mr. Lazar was wrongfully convicted in \n2010 of second-degree murder, robbery, and posses-\nsion of an instrument of crime after Philadelphia po-\nlice neglected to investigate alternative suspects and \nsuppressed the records of misconduct history of the \nlead detective. See Lazar v. The Att\u2019y Gen. of Pa., 659 \nF. Supp. 3d 599, 606\u201308 (E.D. Pa. 2023) (\u201cLazar II\u201d). \nAlthough he was eventually exonerated in federal \ncourt through a writ of habeas corpus, Mr. Lazar \nwas forced to wait until the federal court re-opened \nMr. Lazar\u2019s case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 60(b) and the Commonwealth waived \nAEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See id. at 601, \n609.  \nWhen the district court initially denied Mr. Laz-\nar's petition under AEDPA, the substantial evidence \nof police misconduct that made his wrongful convic-\ntion possible was unknown to both the court and Mr. \nLazar. Without this crucial evidence, the district \ncourt had disagreed with\u2014yet deferred under AED-\nPA to\u2014the state court's analysis of the prejudice \nprong of Mr. Lazar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim. See Lazar I, 2017 WL 783666, at *1, 5. At that \nstage in the proceedings, Mr. Lazar's primary claim \nasserted the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for stipu-\nlating to an incorrect date for Mr. Lazar\u2019s most re-\ncent use of methadone\u2014an error which falsely belied \nMr. Lazar's assertion that he was suffering from \nacute methadone withdrawal at the time that he \ngave a false confession. See id. at *2\u20133. Although the \ndistrict court issued a Certificate of Appealability, \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, also re-\nlying upon AEDPA's deferential standard of review. \n\n12 \nSee Lazar v. Superintendent Fayette SCI, 731 F. \nApp\u2019x 119, 122\u201323 (3d Cir. 2018). \nStrikingly, the claims that ultimately led to Mr. \nLazar\u2019s exoneration did not arise until he was finally \ngiven access to files exclusively possessed by the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office in 2021, three \nyears after the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of \nhabeas relief under AEDPA. See Lazar II, 659 F. \nSupp. 3d at 606. Similarly, the claims Mr. Rivers \nseeks to add in an amended petition did not arise \nuntil \u201che was finally able to review his \u2018long-\nrequested\u2019 attorney-client file\u201d nearly three years af-\nter the district court denied habeas relief. Rivers v. \nLumpkin, 99 F.4th 216, 219 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nTake also the example of Jeffrey Deskovic, who \nwas exonerated by DNA evidence in 2006\u201416 years \nafter his wrongful convictions for murder and rape, \nand 6 years after the Second Circuit affirmed the \ndismissal of his federal habeas petition under AED-\nPA\u2019s stringent timeliness requirements. See Deskovic \nv. City of Peekskill, 894 F. Supp. 2d 443, 449 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201cDeskovic I\u201d). Mr. Deskovic averred \nin his original federal habeas petition that \u201che was \ndenied a fair trial because D.N.A. evidence implicat-\ned a person other than\u201d himself. Deskovic v. Mann, \nNo. 97 Civ. 3023(BSJ), 1997 WL 811524, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1997). The district court, applying \nAEDPA, ruled that Mr. Deskovic\u2019s federal habeas \npetition was untimely, id. at *2, and the Second Cir-\ncuit affirmed, finding that Mr. Deskovic was not en-\ntitled to equitable tolling, see Deskovic v. Mann, 210 \nF.3d 354 (2d Cir. 2000).  \n\n13 \nMr. Deskovic was exonerated when, in 2006, re-\nnewed DNA testing yielded a match with Steven \nCunningham, who had been convicted of sexually as-\nsaulting and murdering another woman three years \nafter the offense that gave rise to Mr. Deskovic\u2019s \nwrongful conviction. Deskovic I, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n449. Mr. Cunningham confessed shortly thereafter, \nand Mr. Deskovic\u2019s convictions were vacated in New \nYork state court. Deskovic v. City of Peekskill, No. \n07-cv-8150 (KMK), 2009 WL 2475001, at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2009). The Westchester District \nAttorney dismissed the indictment \u201con the ground of \nactual innocence.\u201d Id.   \nFinally, consider the case of James Lucien, who \nwas wrongfully convicted in 1995 of murder and \narmed robbery based on his alleged involvement in \nthe shooting death and robbery of Ryan Edwards. \nSee Lucien v. Spencer, No. 07-11338, 2015 WL \n5824726, at *1\u20133 (D. Mass. Sep. 30, 2015). Mr. Ed-\nwards was shot while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a \ncar during a drug transaction; Mr. Lucien had been \nsitting in the back seat, and the victim\u2019s brother had \nbeen in the front passenger seat before exiting the \nvehicle during the transaction. Id. at *2. The victim\u2019s \nbrother testified at trial that he saw Mr. Lucien \nshoot Mr. Edwards. See id. at *27. This false accusa-\ntion by the actual perpetrator was exposed 26 years \nlater, long after federal habeas relief had been de-\nnied under AEDPA.  \nMr. Lucien's federal habeas petition claimed tri-\nal counsel was ineffective for failing to call two ex-\npert witnesses, who would have testified that the \nfatal shot was not fired from Mr. Lucien's position in \n\n14 \nthe back seat, but rather from outside the front pas-\nsenger door. See id. at *27-32.

Phillips Black further contributes to the \nrule of law by consulting with counsel in habeas cor-\npus litigation, conducting clinical training in law \nschools, and developing research on the administra-\ntion of criminal justice. \nPhillps Black attorneys frequently publish schol-\narship and teach courses on constitutional law and \ncriminal and post-conviction procedure, including \nfederal habeas corpus. Additionally, Phillips Black \nhas represented scores of persons challenging their \nconvictions, at every stage of the federal habeas cor-\npus and state post-conviction processes. In addition \nto federal habeas corpus representations, Phillips \nBlack assists persons wrongfully convicted in advo-\ncating for themselves, including\u2014as set forth herein, \ninfra section II\u2014one who was initially denied all re-\nlief under the federal habeas corpus statute, the An-\nti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d), but was ultimately exonerated and has \ngone on to join our staff.  \n \n1 Amicus Curiae avers this brief was not authored in whole \nor in part by counsel for any party and that no person or entity \nother than amicus curiae or its counsel has made a monetary \ncontribution toward the brief\u2019s preparation or submission.  \n\n2 \nPhillips Black\u2019s experience provides deep famili-\narity with the operation of the federal habeas statute \nand its availability for challenging the validity of \nstate court judgments, including those wrongfully \nconvicted.    \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nFederal habeas corpus, as regulated by AEDPA, \nprovides a vital safeguard in protecting the rights of \nthe 1.9 million persons incarcerated in this country. \nSince the Reconstruction Era, the federal habeas \ncorpus statute has explicitly provided a mechanism \nfor ensuring that state courts provide the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s guarantees in the administration of criminal \nlaw. Even prominent critics of federal habeas corpus \njurisprudence have acknowleged it is a vital vehicle \nfor the wrongfully convicted to obtain relief, urging \nthat innocence play a prominent role in its admin-\nistration.  \nHowever, the Court of late has repeatedly ex-\npressed concerns that the lower federal courts are \ngiving inadequate deference to state court judg-\nments. Indeed, a grant of habeas relief, along with a \ndenial of qualified immunity, may be the category of \ncases most likely to be treated with summary rever-\nsal by this Court.  \nTo the extent the Court harbors concerns that \nthe lower federal courts are too quick to grant relief, \nthe actual practices of those courts tell a different \nstory. Federal petitioners, almost all of whom are pro \nse, are exceedingly unlikely to obtain relief of any \n\n3 \nsort. Instead, it is counseled petitioners\u2014almost ex-\nclusively in capital cases, which are rife with close \nquestions of fact and law\u2014who obtain relief. But \nthose cases represent but a tiny fraction of the the \nprison population in this country and the federal \ncourts\u2019 habeas docket.  \nInstead, it is all too often that AEDPA operates \nto foreclose relief for even those suffering from the \ngravest injustices: those who are factually innocent. \nAmicus has identified dozens of persons who were \nultimately exonerated of their crimes, but were \nbarred from obtaining relief under AEDPA. For \nthose individuals, it was only through state court lit-\nigation or the state\u2019s waiver of AEDPA\u2019s procedural \nbars that they obtained relief. To the extent that the \nCourt is concerned that the administration of habeas \ncorpus in the federal courts is driving injustice, Ami-\ncus urges the Court to consider the experience of \nthese individuals.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nFederal Habeas Corpus Plays a Vital Role \nin the Administration of Justice  \nA. Historically, habeas corpus provided a \npost-conviction \nmechanism \nfor \naddressing constitutional defects in \nconvictions \nThe vitality of federal habeas corpus as a means \nfor addressing defects in criminal judgments dates to \nthe founding. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for \njudicial inquiry \u201cinto the cause of [a federal prison-\n\n4 \ner\u2019s] commitment.\u201d See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 14, 1 \nStat. 81-82. The federal courts in the mid-19th cen-\ntury granted post-conviction relief to federal prison-\ners, notwithstanding a lack of express statutory \npower to inquire into final convictions. See Ex parte \nWells, 59 U.S. 307, 315 (1856). And they did so while \nrejecting arguments when they were not empowered \nto do so. Id. at 330 (Curtis, J., dissenting); see also \nEx parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 178 (1874) (granting re-\nlief and discharging federal prisoner in light of Dou-\nble Jeopardy violation).  \nAlong with many other changes to the constitu-\ntional order, the Civil War brought sweeping change \nto the scope of the federal habeas statute. Congress\u2019s \npost-bellum amendment to the Judiciary Act includ-\ned a dramatic change in the scope of its authoriza-\ntion of the writ of habeas corpus. Act of Feb. 5, 1867, \n14 Stat. 385. It expanded the act to reach \u201call cases \nwhere any person may be restrained of his or her \nliberty\u201d in violation of the the Federal Constitution. \nId.    \nIn the wake of these changes, the federal courts \ngranted relief for all manner of constitutional viola-\ntions. As Justice Kagan has noted: \nThe Court granted post-conviction relief to \nprotect habeas applicants\u2019 rights to a grand \njury indictment, to a jury trial to assistance of \ncounsel, and against self-incrimination. The \nCourt granted post-conviction relief for viola-\ntions of the Equal Protection Clause, the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause, and the Ex Post Facto \nClause. And as the due process rights expand-\n\n5 \ned in the first half of the 20th century, the \nCourt held post-conviction habeas relief prop-\ner for those claims too. \nBrown v. Davenport, 596 U.S. 118, 148\u201349 (2002) \n(Kagan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).  \n Historically, federal habeas corpus has played \nan important role in allowing persons to vindicate \ntheir federal constitutional rights in post-conviction \nproceedings. \nB. Federal habeas corpus remains an \nimportant \nvehicle \nfor \ncorrecting \nunconstitutional sentences \nAgainst this historical backdrop, it is undeniable \nthat the current embodiment of the federal habeas \nstatute marks a sharp turn away from providing a \nmechanism for obtaining relief. Instead of simply as-\nsessing the merits of a constitutional claim, habeas \nadjudications are often enmeshed in layers of proce-\ndural issues, requiring the federal courts to deny re-\nlief notwithstanding the merits of a constitutional \nclaim. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Christeson v. Roper, 574 \nU.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per curiam) (\u201cTo be sure, \nChristeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to \nhaving a federal court consider his habeas peti-\ntion.\u201d).  \nBut federal habeas corpus remains as important \nas ever for addressing constitutional errors in crimi-\nnal cases. See, e.g., Andrew v. White, No. 23-6573, __ \nS. Ct. __, Slip Op. at 1 (Jan. 21, 2025) (holding due \nprocess can serve as basis for habeas relief where \n\n6 \n\u201c\u2018evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial \nthat it renders a trial fundamentally unfair\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991)).  \nWith incarceration at historic highs in the Unit-\ned States, the need for federal supervision remains \nimportant to the fair and reliable administration of \ncriminal law. See Ashley Nellis, Mass Incarceration \nTrends, The Sentencing Project Fig. 1 (May 21, \n2024). Approximately 1.9 million people are current-\nly incarcerated in the United States. See Wendy \nSawyer & Peter Wagner, Mass Incarceration: The \nWhole Pie 2024, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 14, \n2024). Over one million of those people are in state \nprisons. Id. By some estimates, at least 4.1% percent \nof those currently facing execution are innocent. See \nSamuel Gross, et al., Rate of False Conviction of \nCriminal Defendants Who Are Sentenced to Death, \n20 Proc. Nat\u2019l Acad. Sci. 7230, 7230 (2014). Like the \npetitioner here, whether they may ever obtain relief \nwill turn on how this Court interprets questions \nabout the scope of the federal habeas statute.  \nNonetheless, many recent decisions of this Court \nhave lamented that the lower federal courts are too \nquick to grant habeas corpus relief. Indeed, when a \nCircuit Court holds that an inmate is entitled to ha-\nbeas relief, this Court is, perhaps more than in any \nother category of cases, likely to intervene and sum-\nmarily reverse. See John Elwood, Holding Prison Of-\nficials \nAccountable \nfor \nCOVID \nMeasures, \nSCOTUSBlog (Jan. 9, 2025) (noting the Court \u201cde-\nvotes significant resources to summary decisions re-\nversing what it concludes are unwarranted denials of \nqualified immunity, as well as unwarranted grants \n\n7 \nof habeas relief.\u201d). When it intervenes in this way, \nthe Court is also often sharply critical of the lower \ncourt. See, e.g., Sexton v. Beaudreaux, 585 U.S. 961, \n967 (2018) (per curiam); Virginia v. LeBlanc, 582 \nU.S. 91, 96 (2017) (\u201cThe federalism interest impli-\ncated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this \ncase, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding created the potential for significant \ndiscord in the Virginia sentencing process.\u201d); John-\nson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 611 (2016) (\u201cThe Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with \nthe \u2018federalism and comity concerns that motivate \nthe adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas \ncontext.\u2019\u201d); Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 281 (2015) \n(\u201cThis is not how habeas review is supposed to work. \nThe record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nflight of fancy.\u201d). These summary reversals are, gen-\nerally, a \u201crare disposition,\u201d but are quite common \nwhere a lower court has granted relief. Schweiker v. \nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dis-\nsenting). That trend demonstrates a willingness to \nspend significant resources restricting the availabil-\nity of habeas relief.  \nWhatever may be behind the appetite for error \ncorrection in habeas cases, the reality on the ground \ntells another story. For example, \u201cIn 1990, according \nto the Administrative Office of the Courts, the peti-\ntioner prevailed in 2.9% of the cases. In 1996, the pe-\ntitioner prevailed in 3.01% of the cases. By 2003, the \nnumber of cases in which the petitioner prevailed \nhad fallen somewhat to 2.75%.\u201d John H. Blume, \nAEDPA: The \u201cHype\u201d and the \u201cBite\u201d, 91 Cornell L. \nRev. 259, 285 (2006). As of 2006, \u201c[l]ess than 1% of \nstate prisoners who file federal habeas petitions ul-\n\n8 \ntimately prevail.\u201d Id. at 284. Notwithstanding this \nincredibly low success rate and historically high lev-\nels of incarceration, the Court continues to single out \nthose who have been granted habeas relief for error \ncorrection. \nII. Innocent People Are Often Unable to \nOvercome AEDPA\u2019s Restrictions  \nInnocence is missing from much of the Court\u2019s \ndiscussion of the operation of the federal writ. To be \nsure, the historical role of the writ was broader and \nfocused on correcting constitutional defects, a broad-\ner concern than innocence alone. Supra \u00a7 I. But even \nmodern critics of the writ have pressed for the writ \nto be available to those with substantial claims of \ninnocence.  \nFamously, Judge Henry J. Friendly, in a critique \nof the Warren Court\u2019s habeas corpus jurisprudence \nasked, \u201cIs innocence irrelevant?\u201d Henry J. Friendly, \nIs Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Crimi-\nnal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142 (1970). Con-\ncluding that it ought not to be, Judge Friendly \nargued for the centrality of innocence to federal ha-\nbeas jurisprudence, contending that, generally, \u201ccon-\nvictions should be subject to collateral attack only \nwhen the prisoner supplements his constitutional \nplea with a colorable claim of innocence.\u201d Id. at 142. \nJudge Friendly\u2019s argument proved influential: writ-\ning for the majority in Stone v. Powell, Justice Pow-\nell cited Judge Friendly for the view that \u201cthe Court \nshould re-examine the substantive scope of federal \nhabeas jurisdiction and limit collateral review\u201d of  \ncertain non-innocence-based claims to the availabil-\n\n9 \nity and adequacy of state-court review. See Stone v. \nPowell, 428 U.S. 465, 480 & n. 13 (1976). The Stone \nmajority itself hewed to Judge Friendly\u2019s view, cir-\ncumscribing non-innocence-based Fourth Amend-\nment claims in federal habeas to whether \u201cthe State \nhas provided an opportunity for full and fair litiga-\ntion\u201d of the claim. See id. at 494\u201395. And Judge \nFriendly\u2019s insistence on the centrality of innocence \nwould continue to influence Justice Powell in his re-\nport on the state of habeas corpus, which would, in \nturn, serve as the basis for AEDPA. See Bryan Ste-\nvenson, The Politics of Fear and Death, 77 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 699, 723 (2002). Indeed, while the word \u201cdefer-\nence\u201d makes no appearance in AEDPA, the statute \nexplicitly spells out a standard for assessing inno-\ncence-based claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(B).  \nIt is no answer to suggest that the State will \nwaive AEDPA\u2019s restrictions in innocence cases. In-\ndeed, States appearing before this Court have re-\npeatedly taken the position that innocence is not \nenough, particularly in habeas cases. See, e.g., Oral \nArg. at *4, Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez, No. 20-1009, \n2021 WL 9526559 (U.S. Dec. 8, 2021) (\u201cThat no fact-\nfinder could have found the prisoner guilty is not \nenough.\u201d). Texas went as far as suggesting that exe-\ncuting the innocent would not, without more, be un-\nconstitutional. See Resp. Br. at *36, Herrera v. \nCollins, No. 91-7328, 1992 WL 532909 (U.S. July 10, \n1992) (\u201cThe question whether an individual is guilty \nor innocent of a state offense is not just a state law \nquestion, which is outside the ambit of federal juris-\ndiction, but is the ultimate state law question at the \ncriminal trial.\u201d (emphasis added)). Moreover, allow-\n\n10 \ning states to be the gatekeeper to relief would effec-\ntively allow the fox to guard the henhouse.  \nAmicus has identified nearly two dozen persons \nwho were exonerated2 after being denied all relief \nunder AEDPA, as enumerated in the Appendix. To \nbe clear, this cohort does not include any persons \nwho were able to clear AEDPA\u2019s hurdles and obtain \nan exoneration. These individuals were denied relief \nunder AEDPA and then later obtained relief, either \nthrough state court proceedings or in federal pro-\nceedings after the state waived AEDPA\u2019s procedural \ndefenses.  \nAlthough each case is compelling\u2014an innocent \nperson was freed despite the federal courts denying \nrelief\u2014several are illustrative and presented here in \nmore detail for the Court\u2019s consideration as it ad-\ndresses the statutory questions in Mr. Rivers\u2019 case.  \nTake first the example of Stephen Lazar,3 who \nwas exonerated in 2023\u2014more than six years after \nthe federal district court denied habeas relief based \n\u201csolely on the exceedingly deferential framework im-\nposed . . . by [AEDPA].\u201d Lazar v. Coleman, No. 14-\n6907, 2017 WL 783666, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2017) \n \n2 To compile this list, counsel have relied on the University \nof Michigan\u2019s widely used National Registry of Exonerations to \nconfirm these exonerations. See Glossary, The National Regis-\ntry \nof \nExonerations, \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.\naspx.  \n3 Mr. Lazar is an employee of Phillips Black, Inc.   \n\n11 \n(\u201cLazar I\u201d). Mr. Lazar was wrongfully convicted in \n2010 of second-degree murder, robbery, and posses-\nsion of an instrument of crime after Philadelphia po-\nlice neglected to investigate alternative suspects and \nsuppressed the records of misconduct history of the \nlead detective. See Lazar v. The Att\u2019y Gen. of Pa., 659 \nF. Supp. 3d 599, 606\u201308 (E.D. Pa. 2023) (\u201cLazar II\u201d). \nAlthough he was eventually exonerated in federal \ncourt through a writ of habeas corpus, Mr. Lazar \nwas forced to wait until the federal court re-opened \nMr. Lazar\u2019s case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 60(b) and the Commonwealth waived \nAEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See id. at 601, \n609.  \nWhen the district court initially denied Mr. Laz-\nar's petition under AEDPA, the substantial evidence \nof police misconduct that made his wrongful convic-\ntion possible was unknown to both the court and Mr. \nLazar. Without this crucial evidence, the district \ncourt had disagreed with\u2014yet deferred under AED-\nPA to\u2014the state court's analysis of the prejudice \nprong of Mr. Lazar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim. See Lazar I, 2017 WL 783666, at *1, 5. At that \nstage in the proceedings, Mr. Lazar's primary claim \nasserted the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for stipu-\nlating to an incorrect date for Mr. Lazar\u2019s most re-\ncent use of methadone\u2014an error which falsely belied \nMr. Lazar's assertion that he was suffering from \nacute methadone withdrawal at the time that he \ngave a false confession. See id. at *2\u20133. Although the \ndistrict court issued a Certificate of Appealability, \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, also re-\nlying upon AEDPA's deferential standard of review. \n\n12 \nSee Lazar v. Superintendent Fayette SCI, 731 F. \nApp\u2019x 119, 122\u201323 (3d Cir. 2018). \nStrikingly, the claims that ultimately led to Mr. \nLazar\u2019s exoneration did not arise until he was finally \ngiven access to files exclusively possessed by the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office in 2021, three \nyears after the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of \nhabeas relief under AEDPA. See Lazar II, 659 F. \nSupp. 3d at 606. Similarly, the claims Mr. Rivers \nseeks to add in an amended petition did not arise \nuntil \u201che was finally able to review his \u2018long-\nrequested\u2019 attorney-client file\u201d nearly three years af-\nter the district court denied habeas relief. Rivers v. \nLumpkin, 99 F.4th 216, 219 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nTake also the example of Jeffrey Deskovic, who \nwas exonerated by DNA evidence in 2006\u201416 years \nafter his wrongful convictions for murder and rape, \nand 6 years after the Second Circuit affirmed the \ndismissal of his federal habeas petition under AED-\nPA\u2019s stringent timeliness requirements. See Deskovic \nv. City of Peekskill, 894 F. Supp. 2d 443, 449 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201cDeskovic I\u201d). Mr. Deskovic averred \nin his original federal habeas petition that \u201che was \ndenied a fair trial because D.N.A. evidence implicat-\ned a person other than\u201d himself. Deskovic v. Mann, \nNo. 97 Civ. 3023(BSJ), 1997 WL 811524, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1997). The district court, applying \nAEDPA, ruled that Mr. Deskovic\u2019s federal habeas \npetition was untimely, id. at *2, and the Second Cir-\ncuit affirmed, finding that Mr. Deskovic was not en-\ntitled to equitable tolling, see Deskovic v. Mann, 210 \nF.3d 354 (2d Cir. 2000).  \n\n13 \nMr. Deskovic was exonerated when, in 2006, re-\nnewed DNA testing yielded a match with Steven \nCunningham, who had been convicted of sexually as-\nsaulting and murdering another woman three years \nafter the offense that gave rise to Mr. Deskovic\u2019s \nwrongful conviction. Deskovic I, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n449. Mr. Cunningham confessed shortly thereafter, \nand Mr. Deskovic\u2019s convictions were vacated in New \nYork state court. Deskovic v. City of Peekskill, No. \n07-cv-8150 (KMK), 2009 WL 2475001, at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2009). The Westchester District \nAttorney dismissed the indictment \u201con the ground of \nactual innocence.\u201d Id.   \nFinally, consider the case of James Lucien, who \nwas wrongfully convicted in 1995 of murder and \narmed robbery based on his alleged involvement in \nthe shooting death and robbery of Ryan Edwards. \nSee Lucien v. Spencer, No. 07-11338, 2015 WL \n5824726, at *1\u20133 (D. Mass. Sep. 30, 2015). Mr. Ed-\nwards was shot while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a \ncar during a drug transaction; Mr. Lucien had been \nsitting in the back seat, and the victim\u2019s brother had \nbeen in the front passenger seat before exiting the \nvehicle during the transaction. Id. at *2. The victim\u2019s \nbrother testified at trial that he saw Mr. Lucien \nshoot Mr. Edwards. See id. at *27. This false accusa-\ntion by the actual perpetrator was exposed 26 years \nlater, long after federal habeas relief had been de-\nnied under AEDPA.  \nMr. Lucien's federal habeas petition claimed tri-\nal counsel was ineffective for failing to call two ex-\npert witnesses, who would have testified that the \nfatal shot was not fired from Mr. Lucien's position in \n\n14 \nthe back seat, but rather from outside the front pas-\nsenger door. See id. at *27-32. Under AEDPA's def-\nerential standard of review, the federal court \ndeferred to the state court's conclusion that trial \ncounsel strategically elected not to call these experts. \nId. Trial counsel\u2019s only proffered reason for not call-\ning these experts was that he did not want \u201cto anger \nthem\u201d by calling them to testify in a trial scheduled \nfor the week of Thanksgiving. See id. at *4, 28; see \nalso Lucien v. Spencer, 871 F.3d 117, 128\u201329 (1st \nCir. 2017) (\u201cLucien II\u201d). In affirming the district \ncourt, the First Circuit implied that trial counsel\u2019s \ndecision may have been negligent but emphasized \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard of review \nand deferred to the state-court analysis of Mr. Luci-\nen\u2019s claim. See Lucien II, 871 F.3d at 131.  \nIn 2021, the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s \nOffice reviewed Mr. Lucien's conviction in light of \nrevelations of severe and pervasive misconduct by \nthe lead detective. Maurice Possley, James Lucien, \nThe National Registry of Exonerations (Dec. 2, 2024) \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Page\ns/casedetail.aspx?caseid=6088. \nThrough \nthis \nre-\ninvestigation, the victim\u2019s brother emerged as a chief \nalternative suspect, and Mr. Lucien was exonerated \nin state court. See id.  \nAs this Court interprets whether Mr. Rivers \nshould be able to present his claim for relief, amicus \nurges the Court to consider the experience of these \nindividuals and the important role for habeas corpus \nto play in protecting the innocent.  \n\n15 \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should re-\nverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. \nRespectfully submitted, \nThomas Roberts \nPHILLIPS BLACK, INC.  \n1901 South 9th St. \nSuite 608 \nPhiladelphia, PA 19148 \nJohn R.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal synthesis, did not introduce new external facts but served to consolidate my model of the case and sharpen my understanding of the remaining uncertainty. My knowledge of the core legal conflict is now stable and well-defined.\n\n*   **Core Facts:** My understanding of the factual timeline remains unchanged. Danny Rivers filed a second habeas petition in February 2021 while the appeal of his first (denied) petition was still pending. The district court treated it as a \"successive\" petition under AEDPA, which the Fifth Circuit affirmed.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The battle lines are clearly drawn.\n    *   **Petitioner's Stance:** A filing made while an appeal is actively pending is not an \"abusive\" second petition. It should be treated as a motion to amend the original petition under the more flexible 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242.\n    *   **Respondent's Stance:** The entry of a final judgment by the district court is the dispositive event. Any subsequent filing raising new claims is a \"successive\" petition governed by the strict gatekeeping of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b), regardless of a pending appeal.\n\n*   **The Battleground of Precedent (Stable):** The key cases and their interpretations by each side are fixed in my model.\n    *   ***Gonzalez v. Crosby* (2005):** The respondent's linchpin, establishing that a post-judgment motion advancing new habeas claims is a successive petition. The petitioner argues it's distinguishable because the case was not on appeal.\n    *   ***Banister v. Davis* (2020):** The petitioner's key support, showing not all second-in-time filings are \"successive.\" The respondent frames this as a narrow exception for Rule 59(e) motions that toll finality, which does not apply to Rivers's filing years later.\n\n*   **Statutory Interpretation (Stable):** The conflict is between \u00a7 2242 (amendment, favored by petitioner) and \u00a7 2244(b) (successive petition gatekeeper, favored by respondent), with the respondent arguing \u00a7 2244(b) is the more specific and controlling statute in this context.\n\n*   **Narrative Framing (Stable):** The case pits a narrative of potential injustice (procedural rules blocking new evidence) against one of procedural finality (preventing endless litigation, as intended by AEDPA).\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty (Refined):** My uncertainty has been significantly refined. I have achieved \"argumentative symmetry\" between the petitioner and respondent. The primary remaining uncertainty is no longer the respondent's position, but rather the broader context and potential influence of third parties. Specifically, I need to know:\n    1.  The positions of any *amici curiae* (friends of the court).\n    2.  Whether the U.S. Solicitor General has filed a brief, and which side it supports. This is often a powerful signal to the Court.\n    3.  The arguments made by groups of states or legal organizations, which can frame the issue in terms of its practical impact on the justice system.\n    My next predictive step requires moving beyond the parties' direct arguments to these external signals.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a moment of pure strategic reflection, provides powerful validation for several core heuristics and adds a new layer of sophistication to my methodology. It demonstrates the critical importance of pausing to synthesize information and plan the next move.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Start with the petitioner's brief on the merits,\" \"Identify the Core Conflict,\" \"The 'Term of Art' Heuristic,\" \"Find the 'Linchpin' Precedent,\"** and **\"Appreciate Narrative Framing\"** remain foundational analytical tools.\n    *   **\"The 'Argumentative Symmetry' Principle\"** and **\"The 'Cert-Stage Preview' Heuristic\"** (using a BIO as a substitute for a merits brief) were successfully employed to build a complete picture of the legal clash.\n    *   **\"The 'Document Type Matters' Heuristic\"** was implicitly validated by the agent's ability to distinguish the BIO from a merits brief and understand its strategic value.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (New & Refined):** This observation perfectly embodies a crucial meta-strategy. The previous \"Value of Strategic Pauses\" is now refined into a formal, repeatable cycle: **1. Synthesize existing knowledge to build a coherent model. 2. Explicitly identify the greatest point of remaining uncertainty in that model. 3. Formulate the next action to directly target that specific uncertainty.** This `Synthesize -> Identify -> Target` loop is the engine of efficient knowledge acquisition.\n    2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (Strongly Validated):** This action is a direct result of applying this principle. By identifying the lack of third-party views as the next major uncertainty, the agent can avoid redundant or low-value information gathering and move directly to the next most informative source.\n    3.  **NEW - The \"Amicus Signal\" Heuristic:** This observation identifies a new, critical stage in the research process. The heuristic is: **\"Once argumentative symmetry between the primary parties is achieved, the next highest-value information source is often amicus curiae briefs.\"** These briefs are valuable for three reasons:\n        *   **Influence:** A brief from the Solicitor General or a large, ideologically diverse group of states can strongly signal the direction the Court may lean.\n        *   **Policy Framing:** Amici often articulate the broader real-world consequences and policy implications of a decision, which can influence pragmatically-minded justices.\n        *   **Argument Reinforcement:** They can introduce novel arguments or provide additional weight and perspective to the arguments made by the parties.\n    4.  **Connecting Task and Design Goals (Validated):** The agent's reasoning explicitly notes that searching for amicus briefs serves both the task goal (reducing \u03b8 uncertainty for the prediction) and the design goal (learning about the predictive weight of amicus briefs for D). This confirms the core DBOED principle of designing experiments that simultaneously solve the problem and improve the problem-solving process itself."

Finding that the SG supports the petitioner, the respondent, or has remained silent will each cause a massive and direct update to my predictive model (\u03b8) for this specific case.\n\nDesign EIG is also very high (0.8) because this action provides the first crucial data point for my newly developed 'Specialist vs. Generalist Amicus' heuristic. Analyzing the SG's brief (or lack thereof) will allow me to contrast the influence of an 'institutional' amicus with the 'specialist' amicus I've already observed, thereby refining my general model (D) for weighing different types of external influence in all future cases. This is a foundational piece of knowledge for SCOTUS prediction.\n\nThe joint EIG is therefore exceptionally high, as this action perfectly embodies the DBOED principle: the search for information that most reduces task uncertainty also provides the most valuable generalizable lesson for my design.",

Phillips Black further contributes to the \nrule of law by consulting with counsel in habeas cor-\npus litigation, conducting clinical training in law \nschools, and developing research on the administra-\ntion of criminal justice. \nPhillps Black attorneys frequently publish schol-\narship and teach courses on constitutional law and \ncriminal and post-conviction procedure, including \nfederal habeas corpus. Additionally, Phillips Black \nhas represented scores of persons challenging their \nconvictions, at every stage of the federal habeas cor-\npus and state post-conviction processes. In addition \nto federal habeas corpus representations, Phillips \nBlack assists persons wrongfully convicted in advo-\ncating for themselves, including\u2014as set forth herein, \ninfra section II\u2014one who was initially denied all re-\nlief under the federal habeas corpus statute, the An-\nti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d), but was ultimately exonerated and has \ngone on to join our staff.  \n \n1 Amicus Curiae avers this brief was not authored in whole \nor in part by counsel for any party and that no person or entity \nother than amicus curiae or its counsel has made a monetary \ncontribution toward the brief\u2019s preparation or submission.  \n\n2 \nPhillips Black\u2019s experience provides deep famili-\narity with the operation of the federal habeas statute \nand its availability for challenging the validity of \nstate court judgments, including those wrongfully \nconvicted.    \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nFederal habeas corpus, as regulated by AEDPA, \nprovides a vital safeguard in protecting the rights of \nthe 1.9 million persons incarcerated in this country. \nSince the Reconstruction Era, the federal habeas \ncorpus statute has explicitly provided a mechanism \nfor ensuring that state courts provide the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s guarantees in the administration of criminal \nlaw. Even prominent critics of federal habeas corpus \njurisprudence have acknowleged it is a vital vehicle \nfor the wrongfully convicted to obtain relief, urging \nthat innocence play a prominent role in its admin-\nistration.  \nHowever, the Court of late has repeatedly ex-\npressed concerns that the lower federal courts are \ngiving inadequate deference to state court judg-\nments. Indeed, a grant of habeas relief, along with a \ndenial of qualified immunity, may be the category of \ncases most likely to be treated with summary rever-\nsal by this Court.  \nTo the extent the Court harbors concerns that \nthe lower federal courts are too quick to grant relief, \nthe actual practices of those courts tell a different \nstory. Federal petitioners, almost all of whom are pro \nse, are exceedingly unlikely to obtain relief of any \n\n3 \nsort. Instead, it is counseled petitioners\u2014almost ex-\nclusively in capital cases, which are rife with close \nquestions of fact and law\u2014who obtain relief. But \nthose cases represent but a tiny fraction of the the \nprison population in this country and the federal \ncourts\u2019 habeas docket.  \nInstead, it is all too often that AEDPA operates \nto foreclose relief for even those suffering from the \ngravest injustices: those who are factually innocent. \nAmicus has identified dozens of persons who were \nultimately exonerated of their crimes, but were \nbarred from obtaining relief under AEDPA. For \nthose individuals, it was only through state court lit-\nigation or the state\u2019s waiver of AEDPA\u2019s procedural \nbars that they obtained relief. To the extent that the \nCourt is concerned that the administration of habeas \ncorpus in the federal courts is driving injustice, Ami-\ncus urges the Court to consider the experience of \nthese individuals.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nFederal Habeas Corpus Plays a Vital Role \nin the Administration of Justice  \nA. Historically, habeas corpus provided a \npost-conviction \nmechanism \nfor \naddressing constitutional defects in \nconvictions \nThe vitality of federal habeas corpus as a means \nfor addressing defects in criminal judgments dates to \nthe founding. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for \njudicial inquiry \u201cinto the cause of [a federal prison-\n\n4 \ner\u2019s] commitment.\u201d See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 14, 1 \nStat. 81-82. The federal courts in the mid-19th cen-\ntury granted post-conviction relief to federal prison-\ners, notwithstanding a lack of express statutory \npower to inquire into final convictions. See Ex parte \nWells, 59 U.S. 307, 315 (1856). And they did so while \nrejecting arguments when they were not empowered \nto do so. Id. at 330 (Curtis, J., dissenting); see also \nEx parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 178 (1874) (granting re-\nlief and discharging federal prisoner in light of Dou-\nble Jeopardy violation).  \nAlong with many other changes to the constitu-\ntional order, the Civil War brought sweeping change \nto the scope of the federal habeas statute. Congress\u2019s \npost-bellum amendment to the Judiciary Act includ-\ned a dramatic change in the scope of its authoriza-\ntion of the writ of habeas corpus. Act of Feb. 5, 1867, \n14 Stat. 385. It expanded the act to reach \u201call cases \nwhere any person may be restrained of his or her \nliberty\u201d in violation of the the Federal Constitution. \nId.    \nIn the wake of these changes, the federal courts \ngranted relief for all manner of constitutional viola-\ntions. As Justice Kagan has noted: \nThe Court granted post-conviction relief to \nprotect habeas applicants\u2019 rights to a grand \njury indictment, to a jury trial to assistance of \ncounsel, and against self-incrimination. The \nCourt granted post-conviction relief for viola-\ntions of the Equal Protection Clause, the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause, and the Ex Post Facto \nClause. And as the due process rights expand-\n\n5 \ned in the first half of the 20th century, the \nCourt held post-conviction habeas relief prop-\ner for those claims too. \nBrown v. Davenport, 596 U.S. 118, 148\u201349 (2002) \n(Kagan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).  \n Historically, federal habeas corpus has played \nan important role in allowing persons to vindicate \ntheir federal constitutional rights in post-conviction \nproceedings. \nB. Federal habeas corpus remains an \nimportant \nvehicle \nfor \ncorrecting \nunconstitutional sentences \nAgainst this historical backdrop, it is undeniable \nthat the current embodiment of the federal habeas \nstatute marks a sharp turn away from providing a \nmechanism for obtaining relief. Instead of simply as-\nsessing the merits of a constitutional claim, habeas \nadjudications are often enmeshed in layers of proce-\ndural issues, requiring the federal courts to deny re-\nlief notwithstanding the merits of a constitutional \nclaim. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Christeson v. Roper, 574 \nU.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per curiam) (\u201cTo be sure, \nChristeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to \nhaving a federal court consider his habeas peti-\ntion.\u201d).  \nBut federal habeas corpus remains as important \nas ever for addressing constitutional errors in crimi-\nnal cases. See, e.g., Andrew v. White, No. 23-6573, __ \nS. Ct. __, Slip Op. at 1 (Jan. 21, 2025) (holding due \nprocess can serve as basis for habeas relief where \n\n6 \n\u201c\u2018evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial \nthat it renders a trial fundamentally unfair\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991)).  \nWith incarceration at historic highs in the Unit-\ned States, the need for federal supervision remains \nimportant to the fair and reliable administration of \ncriminal law. See Ashley Nellis, Mass Incarceration \nTrends, The Sentencing Project Fig. 1 (May 21, \n2024). Approximately 1.9 million people are current-\nly incarcerated in the United States. See Wendy \nSawyer & Peter Wagner, Mass Incarceration: The \nWhole Pie 2024, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 14, \n2024). Over one million of those people are in state \nprisons. Id. By some estimates, at least 4.1% percent \nof those currently facing execution are innocent. See \nSamuel Gross, et al., Rate of False Conviction of \nCriminal Defendants Who Are Sentenced to Death, \n20 Proc. Nat\u2019l Acad. Sci. 7230, 7230 (2014). Like the \npetitioner here, whether they may ever obtain relief \nwill turn on how this Court interprets questions \nabout the scope of the federal habeas statute.  \nNonetheless, many recent decisions of this Court \nhave lamented that the lower federal courts are too \nquick to grant habeas corpus relief. Indeed, when a \nCircuit Court holds that an inmate is entitled to ha-\nbeas relief, this Court is, perhaps more than in any \nother category of cases, likely to intervene and sum-\nmarily reverse. See John Elwood, Holding Prison Of-\nficials \nAccountable \nfor \nCOVID \nMeasures, \nSCOTUSBlog (Jan. 9, 2025) (noting the Court \u201cde-\nvotes significant resources to summary decisions re-\nversing what it concludes are unwarranted denials of \nqualified immunity, as well as unwarranted grants \n\n7 \nof habeas relief.\u201d). When it intervenes in this way, \nthe Court is also often sharply critical of the lower \ncourt. See, e.g., Sexton v. Beaudreaux, 585 U.S. 961, \n967 (2018) (per curiam); Virginia v. LeBlanc, 582 \nU.S. 91, 96 (2017) (\u201cThe federalism interest impli-\ncated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this \ncase, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding created the potential for significant \ndiscord in the Virginia sentencing process.\u201d); John-\nson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 611 (2016) (\u201cThe Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with \nthe \u2018federalism and comity concerns that motivate \nthe adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas \ncontext.\u2019\u201d); Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 281 (2015) \n(\u201cThis is not how habeas review is supposed to work. \nThe record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nflight of fancy.\u201d). These summary reversals are, gen-\nerally, a \u201crare disposition,\u201d but are quite common \nwhere a lower court has granted relief. Schweiker v. \nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dis-\nsenting). That trend demonstrates a willingness to \nspend significant resources restricting the availabil-\nity of habeas relief.  \nWhatever may be behind the appetite for error \ncorrection in habeas cases, the reality on the ground \ntells another story. For example, \u201cIn 1990, according \nto the Administrative Office of the Courts, the peti-\ntioner prevailed in 2.9% of the cases. In 1996, the pe-\ntitioner prevailed in 3.01% of the cases. By 2003, the \nnumber of cases in which the petitioner prevailed \nhad fallen somewhat to 2.75%.\u201d John H. Blume, \nAEDPA: The \u201cHype\u201d and the \u201cBite\u201d, 91 Cornell L. \nRev. 259, 285 (2006). As of 2006, \u201c[l]ess than 1% of \nstate prisoners who file federal habeas petitions ul-\n\n8 \ntimately prevail.\u201d Id. at 284. Notwithstanding this \nincredibly low success rate and historically high lev-\nels of incarceration, the Court continues to single out \nthose who have been granted habeas relief for error \ncorrection. \nII. Innocent People Are Often Unable to \nOvercome AEDPA\u2019s Restrictions  \nInnocence is missing from much of the Court\u2019s \ndiscussion of the operation of the federal writ. To be \nsure, the historical role of the writ was broader and \nfocused on correcting constitutional defects, a broad-\ner concern than innocence alone. Supra \u00a7 I. But even \nmodern critics of the writ have pressed for the writ \nto be available to those with substantial claims of \ninnocence.  \nFamously, Judge Henry J. Friendly, in a critique \nof the Warren Court\u2019s habeas corpus jurisprudence \nasked, \u201cIs innocence irrelevant?\u201d Henry J. Friendly, \nIs Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Crimi-\nnal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142 (1970). Con-\ncluding that it ought not to be, Judge Friendly \nargued for the centrality of innocence to federal ha-\nbeas jurisprudence, contending that, generally, \u201ccon-\nvictions should be subject to collateral attack only \nwhen the prisoner supplements his constitutional \nplea with a colorable claim of innocence.\u201d Id. at 142. \nJudge Friendly\u2019s argument proved influential: writ-\ning for the majority in Stone v. Powell, Justice Pow-\nell cited Judge Friendly for the view that \u201cthe Court \nshould re-examine the substantive scope of federal \nhabeas jurisdiction and limit collateral review\u201d of  \ncertain non-innocence-based claims to the availabil-\n\n9 \nity and adequacy of state-court review. See Stone v. \nPowell, 428 U.S. 465, 480 & n. 13 (1976). The Stone \nmajority itself hewed to Judge Friendly\u2019s view, cir-\ncumscribing non-innocence-based Fourth Amend-\nment claims in federal habeas to whether \u201cthe State \nhas provided an opportunity for full and fair litiga-\ntion\u201d of the claim. See id. at 494\u201395. And Judge \nFriendly\u2019s insistence on the centrality of innocence \nwould continue to influence Justice Powell in his re-\nport on the state of habeas corpus, which would, in \nturn, serve as the basis for AEDPA. See Bryan Ste-\nvenson, The Politics of Fear and Death, 77 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 699, 723 (2002). Indeed, while the word \u201cdefer-\nence\u201d makes no appearance in AEDPA, the statute \nexplicitly spells out a standard for assessing inno-\ncence-based claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(B).  \nIt is no answer to suggest that the State will \nwaive AEDPA\u2019s restrictions in innocence cases. In-\ndeed, States appearing before this Court have re-\npeatedly taken the position that innocence is not \nenough, particularly in habeas cases. See, e.g., Oral \nArg. at *4, Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez, No. 20-1009, \n2021 WL 9526559 (U.S. Dec. 8, 2021) (\u201cThat no fact-\nfinder could have found the prisoner guilty is not \nenough.\u201d). Texas went as far as suggesting that exe-\ncuting the innocent would not, without more, be un-\nconstitutional. See Resp. Br. at *36, Herrera v. \nCollins, No. 91-7328, 1992 WL 532909 (U.S. July 10, \n1992) (\u201cThe question whether an individual is guilty \nor innocent of a state offense is not just a state law \nquestion, which is outside the ambit of federal juris-\ndiction, but is the ultimate state law question at the \ncriminal trial.\u201d (emphasis added)). Moreover, allow-\n\n10 \ning states to be the gatekeeper to relief would effec-\ntively allow the fox to guard the henhouse.  \nAmicus has identified nearly two dozen persons \nwho were exonerated2 after being denied all relief \nunder AEDPA, as enumerated in the Appendix. To \nbe clear, this cohort does not include any persons \nwho were able to clear AEDPA\u2019s hurdles and obtain \nan exoneration. These individuals were denied relief \nunder AEDPA and then later obtained relief, either \nthrough state court proceedings or in federal pro-\nceedings after the state waived AEDPA\u2019s procedural \ndefenses.  \nAlthough each case is compelling\u2014an innocent \nperson was freed despite the federal courts denying \nrelief\u2014several are illustrative and presented here in \nmore detail for the Court\u2019s consideration as it ad-\ndresses the statutory questions in Mr. Rivers\u2019 case.  \nTake first the example of Stephen Lazar,3 who \nwas exonerated in 2023\u2014more than six years after \nthe federal district court denied habeas relief based \n\u201csolely on the exceedingly deferential framework im-\nposed . . . by [AEDPA].\u201d Lazar v. Coleman, No. 14-\n6907, 2017 WL 783666, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2017) \n \n2 To compile this list, counsel have relied on the University \nof Michigan\u2019s widely used National Registry of Exonerations to \nconfirm these exonerations. See Glossary, The National Regis-\ntry \nof \nExonerations, \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.\naspx.  \n3 Mr. Lazar is an employee of Phillips Black, Inc.   \n\n11 \n(\u201cLazar I\u201d). Mr. Lazar was wrongfully convicted in \n2010 of second-degree murder, robbery, and posses-\nsion of an instrument of crime after Philadelphia po-\nlice neglected to investigate alternative suspects and \nsuppressed the records of misconduct history of the \nlead detective. See Lazar v. The Att\u2019y Gen. of Pa., 659 \nF. Supp. 3d 599, 606\u201308 (E.D. Pa. 2023) (\u201cLazar II\u201d). \nAlthough he was eventually exonerated in federal \ncourt through a writ of habeas corpus, Mr. Lazar \nwas forced to wait until the federal court re-opened \nMr. Lazar\u2019s case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 60(b) and the Commonwealth waived \nAEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See id. at 601, \n609.  \nWhen the district court initially denied Mr. Laz-\nar's petition under AEDPA, the substantial evidence \nof police misconduct that made his wrongful convic-\ntion possible was unknown to both the court and Mr. \nLazar. Without this crucial evidence, the district \ncourt had disagreed with\u2014yet deferred under AED-\nPA to\u2014the state court's analysis of the prejudice \nprong of Mr. Lazar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim. See Lazar I, 2017 WL 783666, at *1, 5. At that \nstage in the proceedings, Mr. Lazar's primary claim \nasserted the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for stipu-\nlating to an incorrect date for Mr. Lazar\u2019s most re-\ncent use of methadone\u2014an error which falsely belied \nMr. Lazar's assertion that he was suffering from \nacute methadone withdrawal at the time that he \ngave a false confession. See id. at *2\u20133. Although the \ndistrict court issued a Certificate of Appealability, \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, also re-\nlying upon AEDPA's deferential standard of review. \n\n12 \nSee Lazar v. Superintendent Fayette SCI, 731 F. \nApp\u2019x 119, 122\u201323 (3d Cir. 2018). \nStrikingly, the claims that ultimately led to Mr. \nLazar\u2019s exoneration did not arise until he was finally \ngiven access to files exclusively possessed by the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office in 2021, three \nyears after the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of \nhabeas relief under AEDPA. See Lazar II, 659 F. \nSupp. 3d at 606. Similarly, the claims Mr. Rivers \nseeks to add in an amended petition did not arise \nuntil \u201che was finally able to review his \u2018long-\nrequested\u2019 attorney-client file\u201d nearly three years af-\nter the district court denied habeas relief. Rivers v. \nLumpkin, 99 F.4th 216, 219 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nTake also the example of Jeffrey Deskovic, who \nwas exonerated by DNA evidence in 2006\u201416 years \nafter his wrongful convictions for murder and rape, \nand 6 years after the Second Circuit affirmed the \ndismissal of his federal habeas petition under AED-\nPA\u2019s stringent timeliness requirements. See Deskovic \nv. City of Peekskill, 894 F. Supp. 2d 443, 449 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201cDeskovic I\u201d). Mr. Deskovic averred \nin his original federal habeas petition that \u201che was \ndenied a fair trial because D.N.A. evidence implicat-\ned a person other than\u201d himself. Deskovic v. Mann, \nNo. 97 Civ. 3023(BSJ), 1997 WL 811524, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1997). The district court, applying \nAEDPA, ruled that Mr. Deskovic\u2019s federal habeas \npetition was untimely, id. at *2, and the Second Cir-\ncuit affirmed, finding that Mr. Deskovic was not en-\ntitled to equitable tolling, see Deskovic v. Mann, 210 \nF.3d 354 (2d Cir. 2000).  \n\n13 \nMr. Deskovic was exonerated when, in 2006, re-\nnewed DNA testing yielded a match with Steven \nCunningham, who had been convicted of sexually as-\nsaulting and murdering another woman three years \nafter the offense that gave rise to Mr. Deskovic\u2019s \nwrongful conviction. Deskovic I, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n449. Mr. Cunningham confessed shortly thereafter, \nand Mr. Deskovic\u2019s convictions were vacated in New \nYork state court. Deskovic v. City of Peekskill, No. \n07-cv-8150 (KMK), 2009 WL 2475001, at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2009). The Westchester District \nAttorney dismissed the indictment \u201con the ground of \nactual innocence.\u201d Id.   \nFinally, consider the case of James Lucien, who \nwas wrongfully convicted in 1995 of murder and \narmed robbery based on his alleged involvement in \nthe shooting death and robbery of Ryan Edwards. \nSee Lucien v. Spencer, No. 07-11338, 2015 WL \n5824726, at *1\u20133 (D. Mass. Sep. 30, 2015). Mr. Ed-\nwards was shot while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a \ncar during a drug transaction; Mr. Lucien had been \nsitting in the back seat, and the victim\u2019s brother had \nbeen in the front passenger seat before exiting the \nvehicle during the transaction. Id. at *2. The victim\u2019s \nbrother testified at trial that he saw Mr. Lucien \nshoot Mr. Edwards. See id. at *27. This false accusa-\ntion by the actual perpetrator was exposed 26 years \nlater, long after federal habeas relief had been de-\nnied under AEDPA.  \nMr. Lucien's federal habeas petition claimed tri-\nal counsel was ineffective for failing to call two ex-\npert witnesses, who would have testified that the \nfatal shot was not fired from Mr. Lucien's position in \n\n14 \nthe back seat, but rather from outside the front pas-\nsenger door. See id. at *27-32.

Phillips Black further contributes to the \nrule of law by consulting with counsel in habeas cor-\npus litigation, conducting clinical training in law \nschools, and developing research on the administra-\ntion of criminal justice. \nPhillps Black attorneys frequently publish schol-\narship and teach courses on constitutional law and \ncriminal and post-conviction procedure, including \nfederal habeas corpus. Additionally, Phillips Black \nhas represented scores of persons challenging their \nconvictions, at every stage of the federal habeas cor-\npus and state post-conviction processes. In addition \nto federal habeas corpus representations, Phillips \nBlack assists persons wrongfully convicted in advo-\ncating for themselves, including\u2014as set forth herein, \ninfra section II\u2014one who was initially denied all re-\nlief under the federal habeas corpus statute, the An-\nti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d), but was ultimately exonerated and has \ngone on to join our staff.  \n \n1 Amicus Curiae avers this brief was not authored in whole \nor in part by counsel for any party and that no person or entity \nother than amicus curiae or its counsel has made a monetary \ncontribution toward the brief\u2019s preparation or submission.  \n\n2 \nPhillips Black\u2019s experience provides deep famili-\narity with the operation of the federal habeas statute \nand its availability for challenging the validity of \nstate court judgments, including those wrongfully \nconvicted.    \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nFederal habeas corpus, as regulated by AEDPA, \nprovides a vital safeguard in protecting the rights of \nthe 1.9 million persons incarcerated in this country. \nSince the Reconstruction Era, the federal habeas \ncorpus statute has explicitly provided a mechanism \nfor ensuring that state courts provide the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s guarantees in the administration of criminal \nlaw. Even prominent critics of federal habeas corpus \njurisprudence have acknowleged it is a vital vehicle \nfor the wrongfully convicted to obtain relief, urging \nthat innocence play a prominent role in its admin-\nistration.  \nHowever, the Court of late has repeatedly ex-\npressed concerns that the lower federal courts are \ngiving inadequate deference to state court judg-\nments. Indeed, a grant of habeas relief, along with a \ndenial of qualified immunity, may be the category of \ncases most likely to be treated with summary rever-\nsal by this Court.  \nTo the extent the Court harbors concerns that \nthe lower federal courts are too quick to grant relief, \nthe actual practices of those courts tell a different \nstory. Federal petitioners, almost all of whom are pro \nse, are exceedingly unlikely to obtain relief of any \n\n3 \nsort. Instead, it is counseled petitioners\u2014almost ex-\nclusively in capital cases, which are rife with close \nquestions of fact and law\u2014who obtain relief. But \nthose cases represent but a tiny fraction of the the \nprison population in this country and the federal \ncourts\u2019 habeas docket.  \nInstead, it is all too often that AEDPA operates \nto foreclose relief for even those suffering from the \ngravest injustices: those who are factually innocent. \nAmicus has identified dozens of persons who were \nultimately exonerated of their crimes, but were \nbarred from obtaining relief under AEDPA. For \nthose individuals, it was only through state court lit-\nigation or the state\u2019s waiver of AEDPA\u2019s procedural \nbars that they obtained relief. To the extent that the \nCourt is concerned that the administration of habeas \ncorpus in the federal courts is driving injustice, Ami-\ncus urges the Court to consider the experience of \nthese individuals.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nFederal Habeas Corpus Plays a Vital Role \nin the Administration of Justice  \nA. Historically, habeas corpus provided a \npost-conviction \nmechanism \nfor \naddressing constitutional defects in \nconvictions \nThe vitality of federal habeas corpus as a means \nfor addressing defects in criminal judgments dates to \nthe founding. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for \njudicial inquiry \u201cinto the cause of [a federal prison-\n\n4 \ner\u2019s] commitment.\u201d See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 14, 1 \nStat. 81-82. The federal courts in the mid-19th cen-\ntury granted post-conviction relief to federal prison-\ners, notwithstanding a lack of express statutory \npower to inquire into final convictions. See Ex parte \nWells, 59 U.S. 307, 315 (1856). And they did so while \nrejecting arguments when they were not empowered \nto do so. Id. at 330 (Curtis, J., dissenting); see also \nEx parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 178 (1874) (granting re-\nlief and discharging federal prisoner in light of Dou-\nble Jeopardy violation).  \nAlong with many other changes to the constitu-\ntional order, the Civil War brought sweeping change \nto the scope of the federal habeas statute. Congress\u2019s \npost-bellum amendment to the Judiciary Act includ-\ned a dramatic change in the scope of its authoriza-\ntion of the writ of habeas corpus. Act of Feb. 5, 1867, \n14 Stat. 385. It expanded the act to reach \u201call cases \nwhere any person may be restrained of his or her \nliberty\u201d in violation of the the Federal Constitution. \nId.    \nIn the wake of these changes, the federal courts \ngranted relief for all manner of constitutional viola-\ntions. As Justice Kagan has noted: \nThe Court granted post-conviction relief to \nprotect habeas applicants\u2019 rights to a grand \njury indictment, to a jury trial to assistance of \ncounsel, and against self-incrimination. The \nCourt granted post-conviction relief for viola-\ntions of the Equal Protection Clause, the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause, and the Ex Post Facto \nClause. And as the due process rights expand-\n\n5 \ned in the first half of the 20th century, the \nCourt held post-conviction habeas relief prop-\ner for those claims too. \nBrown v. Davenport, 596 U.S. 118, 148\u201349 (2002) \n(Kagan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).  \n Historically, federal habeas corpus has played \nan important role in allowing persons to vindicate \ntheir federal constitutional rights in post-conviction \nproceedings. \nB. Federal habeas corpus remains an \nimportant \nvehicle \nfor \ncorrecting \nunconstitutional sentences \nAgainst this historical backdrop, it is undeniable \nthat the current embodiment of the federal habeas \nstatute marks a sharp turn away from providing a \nmechanism for obtaining relief. Instead of simply as-\nsessing the merits of a constitutional claim, habeas \nadjudications are often enmeshed in layers of proce-\ndural issues, requiring the federal courts to deny re-\nlief notwithstanding the merits of a constitutional \nclaim. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Christeson v. Roper, 574 \nU.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per curiam) (\u201cTo be sure, \nChristeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to \nhaving a federal court consider his habeas peti-\ntion.\u201d).  \nBut federal habeas corpus remains as important \nas ever for addressing constitutional errors in crimi-\nnal cases. See, e.g., Andrew v. White, No. 23-6573, __ \nS. Ct. __, Slip Op. at 1 (Jan. 21, 2025) (holding due \nprocess can serve as basis for habeas relief where \n\n6 \n\u201c\u2018evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial \nthat it renders a trial fundamentally unfair\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991)).  \nWith incarceration at historic highs in the Unit-\ned States, the need for federal supervision remains \nimportant to the fair and reliable administration of \ncriminal law. See Ashley Nellis, Mass Incarceration \nTrends, The Sentencing Project Fig. 1 (May 21, \n2024). Approximately 1.9 million people are current-\nly incarcerated in the United States. See Wendy \nSawyer & Peter Wagner, Mass Incarceration: The \nWhole Pie 2024, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 14, \n2024). Over one million of those people are in state \nprisons. Id. By some estimates, at least 4.1% percent \nof those currently facing execution are innocent. See \nSamuel Gross, et al., Rate of False Conviction of \nCriminal Defendants Who Are Sentenced to Death, \n20 Proc. Nat\u2019l Acad. Sci. 7230, 7230 (2014). Like the \npetitioner here, whether they may ever obtain relief \nwill turn on how this Court interprets questions \nabout the scope of the federal habeas statute.  \nNonetheless, many recent decisions of this Court \nhave lamented that the lower federal courts are too \nquick to grant habeas corpus relief. Indeed, when a \nCircuit Court holds that an inmate is entitled to ha-\nbeas relief, this Court is, perhaps more than in any \nother category of cases, likely to intervene and sum-\nmarily reverse. See John Elwood, Holding Prison Of-\nficials \nAccountable \nfor \nCOVID \nMeasures, \nSCOTUSBlog (Jan. 9, 2025) (noting the Court \u201cde-\nvotes significant resources to summary decisions re-\nversing what it concludes are unwarranted denials of \nqualified immunity, as well as unwarranted grants \n\n7 \nof habeas relief.\u201d). When it intervenes in this way, \nthe Court is also often sharply critical of the lower \ncourt. See, e.g., Sexton v. Beaudreaux, 585 U.S. 961, \n967 (2018) (per curiam); Virginia v. LeBlanc, 582 \nU.S. 91, 96 (2017) (\u201cThe federalism interest impli-\ncated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this \ncase, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding created the potential for significant \ndiscord in the Virginia sentencing process.\u201d); John-\nson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 611 (2016) (\u201cThe Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with \nthe \u2018federalism and comity concerns that motivate \nthe adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas \ncontext.\u2019\u201d); Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 281 (2015) \n(\u201cThis is not how habeas review is supposed to work. \nThe record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nflight of fancy.\u201d). These summary reversals are, gen-\nerally, a \u201crare disposition,\u201d but are quite common \nwhere a lower court has granted relief. Schweiker v. \nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dis-\nsenting). That trend demonstrates a willingness to \nspend significant resources restricting the availabil-\nity of habeas relief.  \nWhatever may be behind the appetite for error \ncorrection in habeas cases, the reality on the ground \ntells another story. For example, \u201cIn 1990, according \nto the Administrative Office of the Courts, the peti-\ntioner prevailed in 2.9% of the cases. In 1996, the pe-\ntitioner prevailed in 3.01% of the cases. By 2003, the \nnumber of cases in which the petitioner prevailed \nhad fallen somewhat to 2.75%.\u201d John H. Blume, \nAEDPA: The \u201cHype\u201d and the \u201cBite\u201d, 91 Cornell L. \nRev. 259, 285 (2006). As of 2006, \u201c[l]ess than 1% of \nstate prisoners who file federal habeas petitions ul-\n\n8 \ntimately prevail.\u201d Id. at 284. Notwithstanding this \nincredibly low success rate and historically high lev-\nels of incarceration, the Court continues to single out \nthose who have been granted habeas relief for error \ncorrection. \nII. Innocent People Are Often Unable to \nOvercome AEDPA\u2019s Restrictions  \nInnocence is missing from much of the Court\u2019s \ndiscussion of the operation of the federal writ. To be \nsure, the historical role of the writ was broader and \nfocused on correcting constitutional defects, a broad-\ner concern than innocence alone. Supra \u00a7 I. But even \nmodern critics of the writ have pressed for the writ \nto be available to those with substantial claims of \ninnocence.  \nFamously, Judge Henry J. Friendly, in a critique \nof the Warren Court\u2019s habeas corpus jurisprudence \nasked, \u201cIs innocence irrelevant?\u201d Henry J. Friendly, \nIs Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Crimi-\nnal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142 (1970). Con-\ncluding that it ought not to be, Judge Friendly \nargued for the centrality of innocence to federal ha-\nbeas jurisprudence, contending that, generally, \u201ccon-\nvictions should be subject to collateral attack only \nwhen the prisoner supplements his constitutional \nplea with a colorable claim of innocence.\u201d Id. at 142. \nJudge Friendly\u2019s argument proved influential: writ-\ning for the majority in Stone v. Powell, Justice Pow-\nell cited Judge Friendly for the view that \u201cthe Court \nshould re-examine the substantive scope of federal \nhabeas jurisdiction and limit collateral review\u201d of  \ncertain non-innocence-based claims to the availabil-\n\n9 \nity and adequacy of state-court review. See Stone v. \nPowell, 428 U.S. 465, 480 & n. 13 (1976). The Stone \nmajority itself hewed to Judge Friendly\u2019s view, cir-\ncumscribing non-innocence-based Fourth Amend-\nment claims in federal habeas to whether \u201cthe State \nhas provided an opportunity for full and fair litiga-\ntion\u201d of the claim. See id. at 494\u201395. And Judge \nFriendly\u2019s insistence on the centrality of innocence \nwould continue to influence Justice Powell in his re-\nport on the state of habeas corpus, which would, in \nturn, serve as the basis for AEDPA. See Bryan Ste-\nvenson, The Politics of Fear and Death, 77 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 699, 723 (2002). Indeed, while the word \u201cdefer-\nence\u201d makes no appearance in AEDPA, the statute \nexplicitly spells out a standard for assessing inno-\ncence-based claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(B).  \nIt is no answer to suggest that the State will \nwaive AEDPA\u2019s restrictions in innocence cases. In-\ndeed, States appearing before this Court have re-\npeatedly taken the position that innocence is not \nenough, particularly in habeas cases. See, e.g., Oral \nArg. at *4, Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez, No. 20-1009, \n2021 WL 9526559 (U.S. Dec. 8, 2021) (\u201cThat no fact-\nfinder could have found the prisoner guilty is not \nenough.\u201d). Texas went as far as suggesting that exe-\ncuting the innocent would not, without more, be un-\nconstitutional. See Resp. Br. at *36, Herrera v. \nCollins, No. 91-7328, 1992 WL 532909 (U.S. July 10, \n1992) (\u201cThe question whether an individual is guilty \nor innocent of a state offense is not just a state law \nquestion, which is outside the ambit of federal juris-\ndiction, but is the ultimate state law question at the \ncriminal trial.\u201d (emphasis added)). Moreover, allow-\n\n10 \ning states to be the gatekeeper to relief would effec-\ntively allow the fox to guard the henhouse.  \nAmicus has identified nearly two dozen persons \nwho were exonerated2 after being denied all relief \nunder AEDPA, as enumerated in the Appendix. To \nbe clear, this cohort does not include any persons \nwho were able to clear AEDPA\u2019s hurdles and obtain \nan exoneration. These individuals were denied relief \nunder AEDPA and then later obtained relief, either \nthrough state court proceedings or in federal pro-\nceedings after the state waived AEDPA\u2019s procedural \ndefenses.  \nAlthough each case is compelling\u2014an innocent \nperson was freed despite the federal courts denying \nrelief\u2014several are illustrative and presented here in \nmore detail for the Court\u2019s consideration as it ad-\ndresses the statutory questions in Mr. Rivers\u2019 case.  \nTake first the example of Stephen Lazar,3 who \nwas exonerated in 2023\u2014more than six years after \nthe federal district court denied habeas relief based \n\u201csolely on the exceedingly deferential framework im-\nposed . . . by [AEDPA].\u201d Lazar v. Coleman, No. 14-\n6907, 2017 WL 783666, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2017) \n \n2 To compile this list, counsel have relied on the University \nof Michigan\u2019s widely used National Registry of Exonerations to \nconfirm these exonerations. See Glossary, The National Regis-\ntry \nof \nExonerations, \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.\naspx.  \n3 Mr. Lazar is an employee of Phillips Black, Inc.   \n\n11 \n(\u201cLazar I\u201d). Mr. Lazar was wrongfully convicted in \n2010 of second-degree murder, robbery, and posses-\nsion of an instrument of crime after Philadelphia po-\nlice neglected to investigate alternative suspects and \nsuppressed the records of misconduct history of the \nlead detective. See Lazar v. The Att\u2019y Gen. of Pa., 659 \nF. Supp. 3d 599, 606\u201308 (E.D. Pa. 2023) (\u201cLazar II\u201d). \nAlthough he was eventually exonerated in federal \ncourt through a writ of habeas corpus, Mr. Lazar \nwas forced to wait until the federal court re-opened \nMr. Lazar\u2019s case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 60(b) and the Commonwealth waived \nAEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See id. at 601, \n609.  \nWhen the district court initially denied Mr. Laz-\nar's petition under AEDPA, the substantial evidence \nof police misconduct that made his wrongful convic-\ntion possible was unknown to both the court and Mr. \nLazar. Without this crucial evidence, the district \ncourt had disagreed with\u2014yet deferred under AED-\nPA to\u2014the state court's analysis of the prejudice \nprong of Mr. Lazar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim. See Lazar I, 2017 WL 783666, at *1, 5. At that \nstage in the proceedings, Mr. Lazar's primary claim \nasserted the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for stipu-\nlating to an incorrect date for Mr. Lazar\u2019s most re-\ncent use of methadone\u2014an error which falsely belied \nMr. Lazar's assertion that he was suffering from \nacute methadone withdrawal at the time that he \ngave a false confession. See id. at *2\u20133. Although the \ndistrict court issued a Certificate of Appealability, \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, also re-\nlying upon AEDPA's deferential standard of review. \n\n12 \nSee Lazar v. Superintendent Fayette SCI, 731 F. \nApp\u2019x 119, 122\u201323 (3d Cir. 2018). \nStrikingly, the claims that ultimately led to Mr. \nLazar\u2019s exoneration did not arise until he was finally \ngiven access to files exclusively possessed by the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office in 2021, three \nyears after the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of \nhabeas relief under AEDPA. See Lazar II, 659 F. \nSupp. 3d at 606. Similarly, the claims Mr. Rivers \nseeks to add in an amended petition did not arise \nuntil \u201che was finally able to review his \u2018long-\nrequested\u2019 attorney-client file\u201d nearly three years af-\nter the district court denied habeas relief. Rivers v. \nLumpkin, 99 F.4th 216, 219 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nTake also the example of Jeffrey Deskovic, who \nwas exonerated by DNA evidence in 2006\u201416 years \nafter his wrongful convictions for murder and rape, \nand 6 years after the Second Circuit affirmed the \ndismissal of his federal habeas petition under AED-\nPA\u2019s stringent timeliness requirements. See Deskovic \nv. City of Peekskill, 894 F. Supp. 2d 443, 449 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201cDeskovic I\u201d). Mr. Deskovic averred \nin his original federal habeas petition that \u201che was \ndenied a fair trial because D.N.A. evidence implicat-\ned a person other than\u201d himself. Deskovic v. Mann, \nNo. 97 Civ. 3023(BSJ), 1997 WL 811524, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1997). The district court, applying \nAEDPA, ruled that Mr. Deskovic\u2019s federal habeas \npetition was untimely, id. at *2, and the Second Cir-\ncuit affirmed, finding that Mr. Deskovic was not en-\ntitled to equitable tolling, see Deskovic v. Mann, 210 \nF.3d 354 (2d Cir. 2000).  \n\n13 \nMr. Deskovic was exonerated when, in 2006, re-\nnewed DNA testing yielded a match with Steven \nCunningham, who had been convicted of sexually as-\nsaulting and murdering another woman three years \nafter the offense that gave rise to Mr. Deskovic\u2019s \nwrongful conviction. Deskovic I, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n449. Mr. Cunningham confessed shortly thereafter, \nand Mr. Deskovic\u2019s convictions were vacated in New \nYork state court. Deskovic v. City of Peekskill, No. \n07-cv-8150 (KMK), 2009 WL 2475001, at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2009). The Westchester District \nAttorney dismissed the indictment \u201con the ground of \nactual innocence.\u201d Id.   \nFinally, consider the case of James Lucien, who \nwas wrongfully convicted in 1995 of murder and \narmed robbery based on his alleged involvement in \nthe shooting death and robbery of Ryan Edwards. \nSee Lucien v. Spencer, No. 07-11338, 2015 WL \n5824726, at *1\u20133 (D. Mass. Sep. 30, 2015). Mr. Ed-\nwards was shot while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a \ncar during a drug transaction; Mr. Lucien had been \nsitting in the back seat, and the victim\u2019s brother had \nbeen in the front passenger seat before exiting the \nvehicle during the transaction. Id. at *2. The victim\u2019s \nbrother testified at trial that he saw Mr. Lucien \nshoot Mr. Edwards. See id. at *27. This false accusa-\ntion by the actual perpetrator was exposed 26 years \nlater, long after federal habeas relief had been de-\nnied under AEDPA.  \nMr. Lucien's federal habeas petition claimed tri-\nal counsel was ineffective for failing to call two ex-\npert witnesses, who would have testified that the \nfatal shot was not fired from Mr. Lucien's position in \n\n14 \nthe back seat, but rather from outside the front pas-\nsenger door. See id. at *27-32. Under AEDPA's def-\nerential standard of review, the federal court \ndeferred to the state court's conclusion that trial \ncounsel strategically elected not to call these experts. \nId. Trial counsel\u2019s only proffered reason for not call-\ning these experts was that he did not want \u201cto anger \nthem\u201d by calling them to testify in a trial scheduled \nfor the week of Thanksgiving. See id. at *4, 28; see \nalso Lucien v. Spencer, 871 F.3d 117, 128\u201329 (1st \nCir. 2017) (\u201cLucien II\u201d). In affirming the district \ncourt, the First Circuit implied that trial counsel\u2019s \ndecision may have been negligent but emphasized \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard of review \nand deferred to the state-court analysis of Mr. Luci-\nen\u2019s claim. See Lucien II, 871 F.3d at 131.  \nIn 2021, the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s \nOffice reviewed Mr. Lucien's conviction in light of \nrevelations of severe and pervasive misconduct by \nthe lead detective. Maurice Possley, James Lucien, \nThe National Registry of Exonerations (Dec. 2, 2024) \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Page\ns/casedetail.aspx?caseid=6088. \nThrough \nthis \nre-\ninvestigation, the victim\u2019s brother emerged as a chief \nalternative suspect, and Mr. Lucien was exonerated \nin state court. See id.  \nAs this Court interprets whether Mr. Rivers \nshould be able to present his claim for relief, amicus \nurges the Court to consider the experience of these \nindividuals and the important role for habeas corpus \nto play in protecting the innocent.  \n\n15 \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should re-\nverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. \nRespectfully submitted, \nThomas Roberts \nPHILLIPS BLACK, INC.  \n1901 South 9th St. \nSuite 608 \nPhiladelphia, PA 19148 \nJohn R.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case is now expanding from the direct legal conflict between the parties to the broader policy and narrative context shaped by outside actors. This observation provides the first concrete piece of external evidence I previously identified as critical.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable):** The factual timeline remains unchanged: Danny Rivers filed a second habeas petition in February 2021 while his first petition's appeal was pending. The lower courts deemed it a \"successive\" petition under AEDPA's strict rules, which Rivers contests.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The core legal dispute is fixed between the petitioner's argument for flexible amendment under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 and the respondent's argument for rigid finality under the successive petition gatekeeping of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). The key precedents of *Gonzalez v. Crosby* (respondent's support) and *Banister v. Davis* (petitioner's support) remain the primary legal battleground.\n\n*   **NEW - Amicus Curiae Support for Petitioner:** I have now confirmed the existence of an amicus brief filed by **Phillips Black, Inc.**, a non-profit legal organization specializing in post-conviction representation, **in support of the petitioner**. This is a significant development.\n    *   **Argument Focus:** The brief does not focus on the technical statutory debate. Instead, it makes a powerful **policy and narrative argument** about the real-world consequences of interpreting AEDPA's procedural rules too rigidly.\n    *   **Key Arguments:**\n        1.  **Habeas as a Vital Safeguard:** It frames federal habeas corpus as a historically crucial tool for correcting constitutional errors and injustices, particularly in an era of mass incarceration.\n        2.  **Critique of the Court's Trend:** It subtly criticizes the Supreme Court's recent tendency to summarily reverse lower court decisions that grant habeas relief, suggesting the Court may be overly concerned with finality at the expense of justice. It counters this perceived concern with data showing how rarely petitioners actually succeed.\n        3.  **Innocence and Procedural Bars:** The brief's central thrust is that AEDPA's strict procedural rules, like the one at issue, often operate to deny relief to factually innocent individuals. It provides a list of nearly two dozen people who were denied relief under AEDPA but later exonerated.\n    *   **Narrative Reinforcement:** The brief powerfully reinforces the petitioner's narrative of potential injustice. It uses the specific, compelling stories of exonerated individuals like Stephen Lazar\u2014whose case mirrors Rivers's in that crucial evidence was discovered *after* his initial petition was procedurally blocked\u2014to transform the case from a dry procedural question into a matter of fundamental justice and preventing wrongful convictions.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty (Partially Resolved & Refined):** My previous primary uncertainty was the stance of third parties.\n    *   **Resolved:** I now know there is organized support for the petitioner's position, and the nature of that support is to frame the case in terms of preventing injustice and wrongful convictions.\n    *   **Refined:** My uncertainty now shifts to two key areas:\n        1.  **Is there countervailing amicus support for the respondent?** A brief from a group of states arguing for the importance of finality would be a strong counter-signal.\n        2.  **What is the position of the U.S. Solicitor General?** This remains the most critical unknown. The SG's view on a matter of federal statutory interpretation carries significant weight with the Court.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful confirmation for my recently developed research strategy and allows for the creation of more nuanced heuristics regarding the analysis of external signals like amicus briefs.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   The foundational heuristics (\"Start with the petitioner's brief,\" \"Identify the Core Conflict,\" \"Find the 'Linchpin' Precedent,\" etc.) remain the bedrock of my initial analysis.\n    *   The \"Argumentative Symmetry\" principle and the \"Cert-Stage Preview\" heuristic were the essential precursors to this stage of research.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`) (Strongly Validated):** This observation is the direct and successful result of this cycle. I synthesized the parties' arguments, identified amicus briefs as the key uncertainty, and executed a targeted search. The high value of the resulting information validates this as a core, efficient methodology.\n    2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (Strongly Validated):** By focusing on the next most uncertain point, I avoided redundant analysis of the parties' arguments and moved directly to a source that added a new, crucial dimension to my model of the case.\n    3.  **The \"Amicus Signal\" Heuristic (Strongly Validated):** This action confirms the immense value of this heuristic. The Phillips Black brief perfectly illustrates the three reasons why amici are important: it seeks to **influence** the Court with powerful stories, it **frames the policy** implications around innocence and justice, and it **reinforces** the petitioner's underlying narrative.\n    4.  **NEW - The \"Argumentative Framing\" Heuristic:** This observation reveals that the *frame* of an argument can be as important as its substance. The parties are debating statutory text; the amicus is debating fundamental justice. The heuristic is: **\"Analyze not just the legal claims in a brief, but the persuasive frame it attempts to place around the case. Shifting the debate from a technical one to a moral or policy-based one is a key persuasive strategy.\"**\n    5.  **NEW - The \"Specialist vs. Generalist Amicus\" Heuristic:** This observation prompts a new distinction. Phillips Black is a \"specialist\" amicus with deep, ground-level experience. This is distinct from a \"generalist\" or \"institutional\" amicus like the Solicitor General or a coalition of states. The heuristic is: **\"Categorize amici to better weigh their arguments. Specialist briefs often provide powerful pathos and narrative evidence, while institutional briefs can be stronger signals of administrative concerns and the view of the Court's ideological center.\"**\n    6.  **Connecting Task and Design Goals (Validated):** This process continues to be a model of DBOED. The search for amicus briefs simultaneously reduced my uncertainty about the case prediction (\u03b8) and taught me valuable, generalizable lessons about the types and functions of amicus briefs in Supreme Court litigation (D)."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case is becoming more refined. Having previously identified the powerful \"justice and innocence\" frame brought by the petitioner's amicus support, I now have a crucial, albeit negative, piece of evidence regarding institutional support for that position.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable):** The factual predicate of the case is unchanged. Danny Rivers filed a second habeas petition while his first was on appeal. The lower courts ruled this was a \"successive\" petition under AEDPA, which requires appellate court pre-authorization that Rivers did not secure. Rivers argues it should have been treated as an amendment to his still-pending first petition.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The legal dispute remains a direct conflict between two interpretations of federal habeas statutes. The petitioner relies on the flexibility of amendment rules (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242) and the precedent of *Banister v. Davis*. The respondent champions the strict gatekeeping provisions for successive petitions in AEDPA (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)) and the precedent of *Gonzalez v. Crosby*.\n\n*   **Amicus Landscape (Partially Resolved):**\n    *   **Confirmed Petitioner Support:** The amicus brief from Phillips Black, Inc. remains a key piece of evidence. It strategically shifts the frame of the debate from a dry procedural question to one of fundamental justice, arguing that rigid procedural bars like AEDPA's often prevent the exoneration of factually innocent individuals. It uses compelling narratives (e.g., Stephen Lazar) to add a powerful emotional and policy-based weight to the petitioner's side.\n    *   **NEW - Absence of U.S. Solicitor General Support:** My targeted search for a brief from the U.S. Solicitor General (SG) yielded no results. This is a highly significant observation. The SG is frequently invited to weigh in on cases involving the interpretation of major federal statutes like AEDPA. Their silence is a signal.\n        *   **Interpretation:** The absence of an SG brief supporting the petitioner strongly suggests the government is unwilling to endorse a more flexible interpretation of AEDPA's successive petition rules. This removes a powerful potential ally for the petitioner. While not explicit support for the respondent, the SG's silence implicitly benefits the respondent's position by maintaining the status quo and not lending the government's institutional weight to the call for change. This makes the petitioner's task of persuading the Court significantly more difficult.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty (Refined and Re-focused):**\n    *   My primary uncertainty regarding the SG's position is now resolved: they are silent.\n    *   My most critical remaining uncertainty is now singular and elevated in importance: **Is there any amicus support for the respondent?** A brief from a coalition of states, for example, arguing that the petitioner's proposed rule would undermine finality and create administrative burdens for state justice systems, would be a powerful counterweight to the Phillips Black brief and would strongly bolster the respondent's case. The presence or absence of such a brief is now the most informative unknown variable.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a negative search result, provides a crucial lesson in intelligence gathering and analysis, leading to the refinement of existing heuristics and the creation of new, more sophisticated ones.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   The foundational heuristics (\"Start with the petitioner's brief,\" \"Identify the Core Conflict,\" etc.) and the \"Argumentative Symmetry\" principle continue to provide a solid framework for initial analysis.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`) (Strongly Validated):** This cycle has once again proven its effectiveness. I synthesized the case, identified the SG's position as a key uncertainty, and executed a targeted search. The result, even though negative, was highly informative and directly advanced my model of the case.\n    2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (Strongly Validated):** This remains my most powerful meta-heuristic. By focusing on the most impactful unknown, I resolved a major variable and can now re-prioritize my next search on the new most impactful unknown (respondent's amicus support).\n    3.  **The \"Amicus Signal\" Heuristic (Evolved):** This observation forces an important evolution of this heuristic. It's not just about what briefs are filed, but also about what briefs are *not* filed.\n        *   **NEW Corollary - The Signal of Silence:** The absence of a brief from an expected, influential party (like the SG in a federal statutory case) is itself a strong signal. It often indicates neutrality at best, or a tacit preference for the status quo, which typically benefits the respondent.\n    4.  **The \"Argumentative Framing\" Heuristic (Validated):** This observation reinforces the importance of this heuristic. The case currently features a \"justice/innocence\" frame from a specialist amicus, but it now lacks the \"federal government interest\" frame that an SG brief would have provided. The overall argumentative landscape is shaped as much by the missing arguments as the present ones.\n    5.  **The \"Specialist vs. Generalist Amicus\" Heuristic (Strongly Validated):** The absence of the quintessential \"generalist/institutional\" amicus (the SG) makes the contribution of the \"specialist\" amicus (Phillips Black) stand out more starkly. It highlights that the petitioner's support is rooted in on-the-ground experience with wrongful convictions, but lacks the broader institutional backing of the federal government. This distinction is critical for weighing the different types of persuasion being aimed at the Court.\n    6.  **NEW - The \"Informative Absence\" Principle:** A targeted search that fails to find an expected document is not a failure of inquiry; it is a successful observation of a negative fact. This principle dictates that null results from well-designed queries should be treated as valuable data points to be analyzed, rather than as dead ends.\n    7.  **NEW - The \"Expected Actor\" Heuristic:** In any complex system (like a Supreme Court case), identify the actors who have a strong institutional or historical reason to participate. Actively check for their presence or absence. The SG is an \"expected actor\" in cases concerning federal statutes governing federal courts. Their silence is therefore a meaningful event that requires interpretation."

Phillips Black further contributes to the \nrule of law by consulting with counsel in habeas cor-\npus litigation, conducting clinical training in law \nschools, and developing research on the administra-\ntion of criminal justice. \nPhillps Black attorneys frequently publish schol-\narship and teach courses on constitutional law and \ncriminal and post-conviction procedure, including \nfederal habeas corpus. Additionally, Phillips Black \nhas represented scores of persons challenging their \nconvictions, at every stage of the federal habeas cor-\npus and state post-conviction processes. In addition \nto federal habeas corpus representations, Phillips \nBlack assists persons wrongfully convicted in advo-\ncating for themselves, including\u2014as set forth herein, \ninfra section II\u2014one who was initially denied all re-\nlief under the federal habeas corpus statute, the An-\nti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d), but was ultimately exonerated and has \ngone on to join our staff.  \n \n1 Amicus Curiae avers this brief was not authored in whole \nor in part by counsel for any party and that no person or entity \nother than amicus curiae or its counsel has made a monetary \ncontribution toward the brief\u2019s preparation or submission.  \n\n2 \nPhillips Black\u2019s experience provides deep famili-\narity with the operation of the federal habeas statute \nand its availability for challenging the validity of \nstate court judgments, including those wrongfully \nconvicted.    \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nFederal habeas corpus, as regulated by AEDPA, \nprovides a vital safeguard in protecting the rights of \nthe 1.9 million persons incarcerated in this country. \nSince the Reconstruction Era, the federal habeas \ncorpus statute has explicitly provided a mechanism \nfor ensuring that state courts provide the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s guarantees in the administration of criminal \nlaw. Even prominent critics of federal habeas corpus \njurisprudence have acknowleged it is a vital vehicle \nfor the wrongfully convicted to obtain relief, urging \nthat innocence play a prominent role in its admin-\nistration.  \nHowever, the Court of late has repeatedly ex-\npressed concerns that the lower federal courts are \ngiving inadequate deference to state court judg-\nments. Indeed, a grant of habeas relief, along with a \ndenial of qualified immunity, may be the category of \ncases most likely to be treated with summary rever-\nsal by this Court.  \nTo the extent the Court harbors concerns that \nthe lower federal courts are too quick to grant relief, \nthe actual practices of those courts tell a different \nstory. Federal petitioners, almost all of whom are pro \nse, are exceedingly unlikely to obtain relief of any \n\n3 \nsort. Instead, it is counseled petitioners\u2014almost ex-\nclusively in capital cases, which are rife with close \nquestions of fact and law\u2014who obtain relief. But \nthose cases represent but a tiny fraction of the the \nprison population in this country and the federal \ncourts\u2019 habeas docket.  \nInstead, it is all too often that AEDPA operates \nto foreclose relief for even those suffering from the \ngravest injustices: those who are factually innocent. \nAmicus has identified dozens of persons who were \nultimately exonerated of their crimes, but were \nbarred from obtaining relief under AEDPA. For \nthose individuals, it was only through state court lit-\nigation or the state\u2019s waiver of AEDPA\u2019s procedural \nbars that they obtained relief. To the extent that the \nCourt is concerned that the administration of habeas \ncorpus in the federal courts is driving injustice, Ami-\ncus urges the Court to consider the experience of \nthese individuals.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nFederal Habeas Corpus Plays a Vital Role \nin the Administration of Justice  \nA. Historically, habeas corpus provided a \npost-conviction \nmechanism \nfor \naddressing constitutional defects in \nconvictions \nThe vitality of federal habeas corpus as a means \nfor addressing defects in criminal judgments dates to \nthe founding. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for \njudicial inquiry \u201cinto the cause of [a federal prison-\n\n4 \ner\u2019s] commitment.\u201d See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 14, 1 \nStat. 81-82. The federal courts in the mid-19th cen-\ntury granted post-conviction relief to federal prison-\ners, notwithstanding a lack of express statutory \npower to inquire into final convictions. See Ex parte \nWells, 59 U.S. 307, 315 (1856). And they did so while \nrejecting arguments when they were not empowered \nto do so. Id. at 330 (Curtis, J., dissenting); see also \nEx parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 178 (1874) (granting re-\nlief and discharging federal prisoner in light of Dou-\nble Jeopardy violation).  \nAlong with many other changes to the constitu-\ntional order, the Civil War brought sweeping change \nto the scope of the federal habeas statute. Congress\u2019s \npost-bellum amendment to the Judiciary Act includ-\ned a dramatic change in the scope of its authoriza-\ntion of the writ of habeas corpus. Act of Feb. 5, 1867, \n14 Stat. 385. It expanded the act to reach \u201call cases \nwhere any person may be restrained of his or her \nliberty\u201d in violation of the the Federal Constitution. \nId.    \nIn the wake of these changes, the federal courts \ngranted relief for all manner of constitutional viola-\ntions. As Justice Kagan has noted: \nThe Court granted post-conviction relief to \nprotect habeas applicants\u2019 rights to a grand \njury indictment, to a jury trial to assistance of \ncounsel, and against self-incrimination. The \nCourt granted post-conviction relief for viola-\ntions of the Equal Protection Clause, the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause, and the Ex Post Facto \nClause. And as the due process rights expand-\n\n5 \ned in the first half of the 20th century, the \nCourt held post-conviction habeas relief prop-\ner for those claims too. \nBrown v. Davenport, 596 U.S. 118, 148\u201349 (2002) \n(Kagan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).  \n Historically, federal habeas corpus has played \nan important role in allowing persons to vindicate \ntheir federal constitutional rights in post-conviction \nproceedings. \nB. Federal habeas corpus remains an \nimportant \nvehicle \nfor \ncorrecting \nunconstitutional sentences \nAgainst this historical backdrop, it is undeniable \nthat the current embodiment of the federal habeas \nstatute marks a sharp turn away from providing a \nmechanism for obtaining relief. Instead of simply as-\nsessing the merits of a constitutional claim, habeas \nadjudications are often enmeshed in layers of proce-\ndural issues, requiring the federal courts to deny re-\nlief notwithstanding the merits of a constitutional \nclaim. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Christeson v. Roper, 574 \nU.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per curiam) (\u201cTo be sure, \nChristeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to \nhaving a federal court consider his habeas peti-\ntion.\u201d).  \nBut federal habeas corpus remains as important \nas ever for addressing constitutional errors in crimi-\nnal cases. See, e.g., Andrew v. White, No. 23-6573, __ \nS. Ct. __, Slip Op. at 1 (Jan. 21, 2025) (holding due \nprocess can serve as basis for habeas relief where \n\n6 \n\u201c\u2018evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial \nthat it renders a trial fundamentally unfair\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991)).  \nWith incarceration at historic highs in the Unit-\ned States, the need for federal supervision remains \nimportant to the fair and reliable administration of \ncriminal law. See Ashley Nellis, Mass Incarceration \nTrends, The Sentencing Project Fig. 1 (May 21, \n2024). Approximately 1.9 million people are current-\nly incarcerated in the United States. See Wendy \nSawyer & Peter Wagner, Mass Incarceration: The \nWhole Pie 2024, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 14, \n2024). Over one million of those people are in state \nprisons. Id. By some estimates, at least 4.1% percent \nof those currently facing execution are innocent. See \nSamuel Gross, et al., Rate of False Conviction of \nCriminal Defendants Who Are Sentenced to Death, \n20 Proc. Nat\u2019l Acad. Sci. 7230, 7230 (2014). Like the \npetitioner here, whether they may ever obtain relief \nwill turn on how this Court interprets questions \nabout the scope of the federal habeas statute.  \nNonetheless, many recent decisions of this Court \nhave lamented that the lower federal courts are too \nquick to grant habeas corpus relief. Indeed, when a \nCircuit Court holds that an inmate is entitled to ha-\nbeas relief, this Court is, perhaps more than in any \nother category of cases, likely to intervene and sum-\nmarily reverse. See John Elwood, Holding Prison Of-\nficials \nAccountable \nfor \nCOVID \nMeasures, \nSCOTUSBlog (Jan. 9, 2025) (noting the Court \u201cde-\nvotes significant resources to summary decisions re-\nversing what it concludes are unwarranted denials of \nqualified immunity, as well as unwarranted grants \n\n7 \nof habeas relief.\u201d). When it intervenes in this way, \nthe Court is also often sharply critical of the lower \ncourt. See, e.g., Sexton v. Beaudreaux, 585 U.S. 961, \n967 (2018) (per curiam); Virginia v. LeBlanc, 582 \nU.S. 91, 96 (2017) (\u201cThe federalism interest impli-\ncated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this \ncase, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding created the potential for significant \ndiscord in the Virginia sentencing process.\u201d); John-\nson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 611 (2016) (\u201cThe Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with \nthe \u2018federalism and comity concerns that motivate \nthe adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas \ncontext.\u2019\u201d); Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 281 (2015) \n(\u201cThis is not how habeas review is supposed to work. \nThe record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nflight of fancy.\u201d). These summary reversals are, gen-\nerally, a \u201crare disposition,\u201d but are quite common \nwhere a lower court has granted relief. Schweiker v. \nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dis-\nsenting). That trend demonstrates a willingness to \nspend significant resources restricting the availabil-\nity of habeas relief.  \nWhatever may be behind the appetite for error \ncorrection in habeas cases, the reality on the ground \ntells another story. For example, \u201cIn 1990, according \nto the Administrative Office of the Courts, the peti-\ntioner prevailed in 2.9% of the cases. In 1996, the pe-\ntitioner prevailed in 3.01% of the cases. By 2003, the \nnumber of cases in which the petitioner prevailed \nhad fallen somewhat to 2.75%.\u201d John H. Blume, \nAEDPA: The \u201cHype\u201d and the \u201cBite\u201d, 91 Cornell L. \nRev. 259, 285 (2006). As of 2006, \u201c[l]ess than 1% of \nstate prisoners who file federal habeas petitions ul-\n\n8 \ntimately prevail.\u201d Id. at 284. Notwithstanding this \nincredibly low success rate and historically high lev-\nels of incarceration, the Court continues to single out \nthose who have been granted habeas relief for error \ncorrection. \nII. Innocent People Are Often Unable to \nOvercome AEDPA\u2019s Restrictions  \nInnocence is missing from much of the Court\u2019s \ndiscussion of the operation of the federal writ. To be \nsure, the historical role of the writ was broader and \nfocused on correcting constitutional defects, a broad-\ner concern than innocence alone. Supra \u00a7 I. But even \nmodern critics of the writ have pressed for the writ \nto be available to those with substantial claims of \ninnocence.  \nFamously, Judge Henry J. Friendly, in a critique \nof the Warren Court\u2019s habeas corpus jurisprudence \nasked, \u201cIs innocence irrelevant?\u201d Henry J. Friendly, \nIs Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Crimi-\nnal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142 (1970). Con-\ncluding that it ought not to be, Judge Friendly \nargued for the centrality of innocence to federal ha-\nbeas jurisprudence, contending that, generally, \u201ccon-\nvictions should be subject to collateral attack only \nwhen the prisoner supplements his constitutional \nplea with a colorable claim of innocence.\u201d Id. at 142. \nJudge Friendly\u2019s argument proved influential: writ-\ning for the majority in Stone v. Powell, Justice Pow-\nell cited Judge Friendly for the view that \u201cthe Court \nshould re-examine the substantive scope of federal \nhabeas jurisdiction and limit collateral review\u201d of  \ncertain non-innocence-based claims to the availabil-\n\n9 \nity and adequacy of state-court review. See Stone v. \nPowell, 428 U.S. 465, 480 & n. 13 (1976). The Stone \nmajority itself hewed to Judge Friendly\u2019s view, cir-\ncumscribing non-innocence-based Fourth Amend-\nment claims in federal habeas to whether \u201cthe State \nhas provided an opportunity for full and fair litiga-\ntion\u201d of the claim. See id. at 494\u201395. And Judge \nFriendly\u2019s insistence on the centrality of innocence \nwould continue to influence Justice Powell in his re-\nport on the state of habeas corpus, which would, in \nturn, serve as the basis for AEDPA. See Bryan Ste-\nvenson, The Politics of Fear and Death, 77 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 699, 723 (2002). Indeed, while the word \u201cdefer-\nence\u201d makes no appearance in AEDPA, the statute \nexplicitly spells out a standard for assessing inno-\ncence-based claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(B).  \nIt is no answer to suggest that the State will \nwaive AEDPA\u2019s restrictions in innocence cases. In-\ndeed, States appearing before this Court have re-\npeatedly taken the position that innocence is not \nenough, particularly in habeas cases. See, e.g., Oral \nArg. at *4, Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez, No. 20-1009, \n2021 WL 9526559 (U.S. Dec. 8, 2021) (\u201cThat no fact-\nfinder could have found the prisoner guilty is not \nenough.\u201d). Texas went as far as suggesting that exe-\ncuting the innocent would not, without more, be un-\nconstitutional. See Resp. Br. at *36, Herrera v. \nCollins, No. 91-7328, 1992 WL 532909 (U.S. July 10, \n1992) (\u201cThe question whether an individual is guilty \nor innocent of a state offense is not just a state law \nquestion, which is outside the ambit of federal juris-\ndiction, but is the ultimate state law question at the \ncriminal trial.\u201d (emphasis added)). Moreover, allow-\n\n10 \ning states to be the gatekeeper to relief would effec-\ntively allow the fox to guard the henhouse.  \nAmicus has identified nearly two dozen persons \nwho were exonerated2 after being denied all relief \nunder AEDPA, as enumerated in the Appendix. To \nbe clear, this cohort does not include any persons \nwho were able to clear AEDPA\u2019s hurdles and obtain \nan exoneration. These individuals were denied relief \nunder AEDPA and then later obtained relief, either \nthrough state court proceedings or in federal pro-\nceedings after the state waived AEDPA\u2019s procedural \ndefenses.  \nAlthough each case is compelling\u2014an innocent \nperson was freed despite the federal courts denying \nrelief\u2014several are illustrative and presented here in \nmore detail for the Court\u2019s consideration as it ad-\ndresses the statutory questions in Mr. Rivers\u2019 case.  \nTake first the example of Stephen Lazar,3 who \nwas exonerated in 2023\u2014more than six years after \nthe federal district court denied habeas relief based \n\u201csolely on the exceedingly deferential framework im-\nposed . . . by [AEDPA].\u201d Lazar v. Coleman, No. 14-\n6907, 2017 WL 783666, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2017) \n \n2 To compile this list, counsel have relied on the University \nof Michigan\u2019s widely used National Registry of Exonerations to \nconfirm these exonerations. See Glossary, The National Regis-\ntry \nof \nExonerations, \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.\naspx.  \n3 Mr. Lazar is an employee of Phillips Black, Inc.   \n\n11 \n(\u201cLazar I\u201d). Mr. Lazar was wrongfully convicted in \n2010 of second-degree murder, robbery, and posses-\nsion of an instrument of crime after Philadelphia po-\nlice neglected to investigate alternative suspects and \nsuppressed the records of misconduct history of the \nlead detective. See Lazar v. The Att\u2019y Gen. of Pa., 659 \nF. Supp. 3d 599, 606\u201308 (E.D. Pa. 2023) (\u201cLazar II\u201d). \nAlthough he was eventually exonerated in federal \ncourt through a writ of habeas corpus, Mr. Lazar \nwas forced to wait until the federal court re-opened \nMr. Lazar\u2019s case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 60(b) and the Commonwealth waived \nAEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See id. at 601, \n609.  \nWhen the district court initially denied Mr. Laz-\nar's petition under AEDPA, the substantial evidence \nof police misconduct that made his wrongful convic-\ntion possible was unknown to both the court and Mr. \nLazar. Without this crucial evidence, the district \ncourt had disagreed with\u2014yet deferred under AED-\nPA to\u2014the state court's analysis of the prejudice \nprong of Mr. Lazar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim. See Lazar I, 2017 WL 783666, at *1, 5. At that \nstage in the proceedings, Mr. Lazar's primary claim \nasserted the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for stipu-\nlating to an incorrect date for Mr. Lazar\u2019s most re-\ncent use of methadone\u2014an error which falsely belied \nMr. Lazar's assertion that he was suffering from \nacute methadone withdrawal at the time that he \ngave a false confession. See id. at *2\u20133. Although the \ndistrict court issued a Certificate of Appealability, \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, also re-\nlying upon AEDPA's deferential standard of review. \n\n12 \nSee Lazar v. Superintendent Fayette SCI, 731 F. \nApp\u2019x 119, 122\u201323 (3d Cir. 2018). \nStrikingly, the claims that ultimately led to Mr. \nLazar\u2019s exoneration did not arise until he was finally \ngiven access to files exclusively possessed by the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office in 2021, three \nyears after the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of \nhabeas relief under AEDPA. See Lazar II, 659 F. \nSupp. 3d at 606. Similarly, the claims Mr. Rivers \nseeks to add in an amended petition did not arise \nuntil \u201che was finally able to review his \u2018long-\nrequested\u2019 attorney-client file\u201d nearly three years af-\nter the district court denied habeas relief. Rivers v. \nLumpkin, 99 F.4th 216, 219 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nTake also the example of Jeffrey Deskovic, who \nwas exonerated by DNA evidence in 2006\u201416 years \nafter his wrongful convictions for murder and rape, \nand 6 years after the Second Circuit affirmed the \ndismissal of his federal habeas petition under AED-\nPA\u2019s stringent timeliness requirements. See Deskovic \nv. City of Peekskill, 894 F. Supp. 2d 443, 449 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201cDeskovic I\u201d). Mr. Deskovic averred \nin his original federal habeas petition that \u201che was \ndenied a fair trial because D.N.A. evidence implicat-\ned a person other than\u201d himself. Deskovic v. Mann, \nNo. 97 Civ. 3023(BSJ), 1997 WL 811524, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1997). The district court, applying \nAEDPA, ruled that Mr. Deskovic\u2019s federal habeas \npetition was untimely, id. at *2, and the Second Cir-\ncuit affirmed, finding that Mr. Deskovic was not en-\ntitled to equitable tolling, see Deskovic v. Mann, 210 \nF.3d 354 (2d Cir. 2000).  \n\n13 \nMr. Deskovic was exonerated when, in 2006, re-\nnewed DNA testing yielded a match with Steven \nCunningham, who had been convicted of sexually as-\nsaulting and murdering another woman three years \nafter the offense that gave rise to Mr. Deskovic\u2019s \nwrongful conviction. Deskovic I, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n449. Mr. Cunningham confessed shortly thereafter, \nand Mr. Deskovic\u2019s convictions were vacated in New \nYork state court. Deskovic v. City of Peekskill, No. \n07-cv-8150 (KMK), 2009 WL 2475001, at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2009). The Westchester District \nAttorney dismissed the indictment \u201con the ground of \nactual innocence.\u201d Id.   \nFinally, consider the case of James Lucien, who \nwas wrongfully convicted in 1995 of murder and \narmed robbery based on his alleged involvement in \nthe shooting death and robbery of Ryan Edwards. \nSee Lucien v. Spencer, No. 07-11338, 2015 WL \n5824726, at *1\u20133 (D. Mass. Sep. 30, 2015). Mr. Ed-\nwards was shot while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a \ncar during a drug transaction; Mr. Lucien had been \nsitting in the back seat, and the victim\u2019s brother had \nbeen in the front passenger seat before exiting the \nvehicle during the transaction. Id. at *2. The victim\u2019s \nbrother testified at trial that he saw Mr. Lucien \nshoot Mr. Edwards. See id. at *27. This false accusa-\ntion by the actual perpetrator was exposed 26 years \nlater, long after federal habeas relief had been de-\nnied under AEDPA.  \nMr. Lucien's federal habeas petition claimed tri-\nal counsel was ineffective for failing to call two ex-\npert witnesses, who would have testified that the \nfatal shot was not fired from Mr. Lucien's position in \n\n14 \nthe back seat, but rather from outside the front pas-\nsenger door. See id. at *27-32.

Phillips Black further contributes to the \nrule of law by consulting with counsel in habeas cor-\npus litigation, conducting clinical training in law \nschools, and developing research on the administra-\ntion of criminal justice. \nPhillps Black attorneys frequently publish schol-\narship and teach courses on constitutional law and \ncriminal and post-conviction procedure, including \nfederal habeas corpus. Additionally, Phillips Black \nhas represented scores of persons challenging their \nconvictions, at every stage of the federal habeas cor-\npus and state post-conviction processes. In addition \nto federal habeas corpus representations, Phillips \nBlack assists persons wrongfully convicted in advo-\ncating for themselves, including\u2014as set forth herein, \ninfra section II\u2014one who was initially denied all re-\nlief under the federal habeas corpus statute, the An-\nti-terrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996 \n(\u201cAEDPA\u201d), but was ultimately exonerated and has \ngone on to join our staff.  \n \n1 Amicus Curiae avers this brief was not authored in whole \nor in part by counsel for any party and that no person or entity \nother than amicus curiae or its counsel has made a monetary \ncontribution toward the brief\u2019s preparation or submission.  \n\n2 \nPhillips Black\u2019s experience provides deep famili-\narity with the operation of the federal habeas statute \nand its availability for challenging the validity of \nstate court judgments, including those wrongfully \nconvicted.    \nINTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY OF \nARGUMENT \nFederal habeas corpus, as regulated by AEDPA, \nprovides a vital safeguard in protecting the rights of \nthe 1.9 million persons incarcerated in this country. \nSince the Reconstruction Era, the federal habeas \ncorpus statute has explicitly provided a mechanism \nfor ensuring that state courts provide the Constitu-\ntion\u2019s guarantees in the administration of criminal \nlaw. Even prominent critics of federal habeas corpus \njurisprudence have acknowleged it is a vital vehicle \nfor the wrongfully convicted to obtain relief, urging \nthat innocence play a prominent role in its admin-\nistration.  \nHowever, the Court of late has repeatedly ex-\npressed concerns that the lower federal courts are \ngiving inadequate deference to state court judg-\nments. Indeed, a grant of habeas relief, along with a \ndenial of qualified immunity, may be the category of \ncases most likely to be treated with summary rever-\nsal by this Court.  \nTo the extent the Court harbors concerns that \nthe lower federal courts are too quick to grant relief, \nthe actual practices of those courts tell a different \nstory. Federal petitioners, almost all of whom are pro \nse, are exceedingly unlikely to obtain relief of any \n\n3 \nsort. Instead, it is counseled petitioners\u2014almost ex-\nclusively in capital cases, which are rife with close \nquestions of fact and law\u2014who obtain relief. But \nthose cases represent but a tiny fraction of the the \nprison population in this country and the federal \ncourts\u2019 habeas docket.  \nInstead, it is all too often that AEDPA operates \nto foreclose relief for even those suffering from the \ngravest injustices: those who are factually innocent. \nAmicus has identified dozens of persons who were \nultimately exonerated of their crimes, but were \nbarred from obtaining relief under AEDPA. For \nthose individuals, it was only through state court lit-\nigation or the state\u2019s waiver of AEDPA\u2019s procedural \nbars that they obtained relief. To the extent that the \nCourt is concerned that the administration of habeas \ncorpus in the federal courts is driving injustice, Ami-\ncus urges the Court to consider the experience of \nthese individuals.  \nARGUMENT \nI. \nFederal Habeas Corpus Plays a Vital Role \nin the Administration of Justice  \nA. Historically, habeas corpus provided a \npost-conviction \nmechanism \nfor \naddressing constitutional defects in \nconvictions \nThe vitality of federal habeas corpus as a means \nfor addressing defects in criminal judgments dates to \nthe founding. The Judiciary Act of 1789 provided for \njudicial inquiry \u201cinto the cause of [a federal prison-\n\n4 \ner\u2019s] commitment.\u201d See Act of Sept. 24, 1789, \u00a7 14, 1 \nStat. 81-82. The federal courts in the mid-19th cen-\ntury granted post-conviction relief to federal prison-\ners, notwithstanding a lack of express statutory \npower to inquire into final convictions. See Ex parte \nWells, 59 U.S. 307, 315 (1856). And they did so while \nrejecting arguments when they were not empowered \nto do so. Id. at 330 (Curtis, J., dissenting); see also \nEx parte Lange, 85 U.S. 163, 178 (1874) (granting re-\nlief and discharging federal prisoner in light of Dou-\nble Jeopardy violation).  \nAlong with many other changes to the constitu-\ntional order, the Civil War brought sweeping change \nto the scope of the federal habeas statute. Congress\u2019s \npost-bellum amendment to the Judiciary Act includ-\ned a dramatic change in the scope of its authoriza-\ntion of the writ of habeas corpus. Act of Feb. 5, 1867, \n14 Stat. 385. It expanded the act to reach \u201call cases \nwhere any person may be restrained of his or her \nliberty\u201d in violation of the the Federal Constitution. \nId.    \nIn the wake of these changes, the federal courts \ngranted relief for all manner of constitutional viola-\ntions. As Justice Kagan has noted: \nThe Court granted post-conviction relief to \nprotect habeas applicants\u2019 rights to a grand \njury indictment, to a jury trial to assistance of \ncounsel, and against self-incrimination. The \nCourt granted post-conviction relief for viola-\ntions of the Equal Protection Clause, the Dou-\nble Jeopardy Clause, and the Ex Post Facto \nClause. And as the due process rights expand-\n\n5 \ned in the first half of the 20th century, the \nCourt held post-conviction habeas relief prop-\ner for those claims too. \nBrown v. Davenport, 596 U.S. 118, 148\u201349 (2002) \n(Kagan, J., dissenting) (citations omitted).  \n Historically, federal habeas corpus has played \nan important role in allowing persons to vindicate \ntheir federal constitutional rights in post-conviction \nproceedings. \nB. Federal habeas corpus remains an \nimportant \nvehicle \nfor \ncorrecting \nunconstitutional sentences \nAgainst this historical backdrop, it is undeniable \nthat the current embodiment of the federal habeas \nstatute marks a sharp turn away from providing a \nmechanism for obtaining relief. Instead of simply as-\nsessing the merits of a constitutional claim, habeas \nadjudications are often enmeshed in layers of proce-\ndural issues, requiring the federal courts to deny re-\nlief notwithstanding the merits of a constitutional \nclaim. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254; Christeson v. Roper, 574 \nU.S. 373, 380 (2015) (per curiam) (\u201cTo be sure, \nChristeson faces a host of procedural obstacles to \nhaving a federal court consider his habeas peti-\ntion.\u201d).  \nBut federal habeas corpus remains as important \nas ever for addressing constitutional errors in crimi-\nnal cases. See, e.g., Andrew v. White, No. 23-6573, __ \nS. Ct. __, Slip Op. at 1 (Jan. 21, 2025) (holding due \nprocess can serve as basis for habeas relief where \n\n6 \n\u201c\u2018evidence is introduced that is so unduly prejudicial \nthat it renders a trial fundamentally unfair\u2019\u201d (quot-\ning Payne v. Tennessee, 501 U.S. 808, 825 (1991)).  \nWith incarceration at historic highs in the Unit-\ned States, the need for federal supervision remains \nimportant to the fair and reliable administration of \ncriminal law. See Ashley Nellis, Mass Incarceration \nTrends, The Sentencing Project Fig. 1 (May 21, \n2024). Approximately 1.9 million people are current-\nly incarcerated in the United States. See Wendy \nSawyer & Peter Wagner, Mass Incarceration: The \nWhole Pie 2024, Prison Policy Initiative (Mar. 14, \n2024). Over one million of those people are in state \nprisons. Id. By some estimates, at least 4.1% percent \nof those currently facing execution are innocent. See \nSamuel Gross, et al., Rate of False Conviction of \nCriminal Defendants Who Are Sentenced to Death, \n20 Proc. Nat\u2019l Acad. Sci. 7230, 7230 (2014). Like the \npetitioner here, whether they may ever obtain relief \nwill turn on how this Court interprets questions \nabout the scope of the federal habeas statute.  \nNonetheless, many recent decisions of this Court \nhave lamented that the lower federal courts are too \nquick to grant habeas corpus relief. Indeed, when a \nCircuit Court holds that an inmate is entitled to ha-\nbeas relief, this Court is, perhaps more than in any \nother category of cases, likely to intervene and sum-\nmarily reverse. See John Elwood, Holding Prison Of-\nficials \nAccountable \nfor \nCOVID \nMeasures, \nSCOTUSBlog (Jan. 9, 2025) (noting the Court \u201cde-\nvotes significant resources to summary decisions re-\nversing what it concludes are unwarranted denials of \nqualified immunity, as well as unwarranted grants \n\n7 \nof habeas relief.\u201d). When it intervenes in this way, \nthe Court is also often sharply critical of the lower \ncourt. See, e.g., Sexton v. Beaudreaux, 585 U.S. 961, \n967 (2018) (per curiam); Virginia v. LeBlanc, 582 \nU.S. 91, 96 (2017) (\u201cThe federalism interest impli-\ncated in AEDPA cases is of central relevance in this \ncase, for the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s holding created the potential for significant \ndiscord in the Virginia sentencing process.\u201d); John-\nson v. Lee, 578 U.S. 605, 611 (2016) (\u201cThe Ninth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is thus fundamentally at odds with \nthe \u2018federalism and comity concerns that motivate \nthe adequate state ground doctrine in the habeas \ncontext.\u2019\u201d); Davis v. Ayala, 576 U.S. 257, 281 (2015) \n(\u201cThis is not how habeas review is supposed to work. \nThe record provides no basis for the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nflight of fancy.\u201d). These summary reversals are, gen-\nerally, a \u201crare disposition,\u201d but are quite common \nwhere a lower court has granted relief. Schweiker v. \nHansen, 450 U.S. 785, 791 (1981) (Marshall, J., dis-\nsenting). That trend demonstrates a willingness to \nspend significant resources restricting the availabil-\nity of habeas relief.  \nWhatever may be behind the appetite for error \ncorrection in habeas cases, the reality on the ground \ntells another story. For example, \u201cIn 1990, according \nto the Administrative Office of the Courts, the peti-\ntioner prevailed in 2.9% of the cases. In 1996, the pe-\ntitioner prevailed in 3.01% of the cases. By 2003, the \nnumber of cases in which the petitioner prevailed \nhad fallen somewhat to 2.75%.\u201d John H. Blume, \nAEDPA: The \u201cHype\u201d and the \u201cBite\u201d, 91 Cornell L. \nRev. 259, 285 (2006). As of 2006, \u201c[l]ess than 1% of \nstate prisoners who file federal habeas petitions ul-\n\n8 \ntimately prevail.\u201d Id. at 284. Notwithstanding this \nincredibly low success rate and historically high lev-\nels of incarceration, the Court continues to single out \nthose who have been granted habeas relief for error \ncorrection. \nII. Innocent People Are Often Unable to \nOvercome AEDPA\u2019s Restrictions  \nInnocence is missing from much of the Court\u2019s \ndiscussion of the operation of the federal writ. To be \nsure, the historical role of the writ was broader and \nfocused on correcting constitutional defects, a broad-\ner concern than innocence alone. Supra \u00a7 I. But even \nmodern critics of the writ have pressed for the writ \nto be available to those with substantial claims of \ninnocence.  \nFamously, Judge Henry J. Friendly, in a critique \nof the Warren Court\u2019s habeas corpus jurisprudence \nasked, \u201cIs innocence irrelevant?\u201d Henry J. Friendly, \nIs Innocence Irrelevant? Collateral Attack on Crimi-\nnal Judgments, 38 U. Chi. L. Rev. 142 (1970). Con-\ncluding that it ought not to be, Judge Friendly \nargued for the centrality of innocence to federal ha-\nbeas jurisprudence, contending that, generally, \u201ccon-\nvictions should be subject to collateral attack only \nwhen the prisoner supplements his constitutional \nplea with a colorable claim of innocence.\u201d Id. at 142. \nJudge Friendly\u2019s argument proved influential: writ-\ning for the majority in Stone v. Powell, Justice Pow-\nell cited Judge Friendly for the view that \u201cthe Court \nshould re-examine the substantive scope of federal \nhabeas jurisdiction and limit collateral review\u201d of  \ncertain non-innocence-based claims to the availabil-\n\n9 \nity and adequacy of state-court review. See Stone v. \nPowell, 428 U.S. 465, 480 & n. 13 (1976). The Stone \nmajority itself hewed to Judge Friendly\u2019s view, cir-\ncumscribing non-innocence-based Fourth Amend-\nment claims in federal habeas to whether \u201cthe State \nhas provided an opportunity for full and fair litiga-\ntion\u201d of the claim. See id. at 494\u201395. And Judge \nFriendly\u2019s insistence on the centrality of innocence \nwould continue to influence Justice Powell in his re-\nport on the state of habeas corpus, which would, in \nturn, serve as the basis for AEDPA. See Bryan Ste-\nvenson, The Politics of Fear and Death, 77 N.Y.U. L. \nRev. 699, 723 (2002). Indeed, while the word \u201cdefer-\nence\u201d makes no appearance in AEDPA, the statute \nexplicitly spells out a standard for assessing inno-\ncence-based claims. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2254(e)(2)(B).  \nIt is no answer to suggest that the State will \nwaive AEDPA\u2019s restrictions in innocence cases. In-\ndeed, States appearing before this Court have re-\npeatedly taken the position that innocence is not \nenough, particularly in habeas cases. See, e.g., Oral \nArg. at *4, Shinn v. Martinez Ramirez, No. 20-1009, \n2021 WL 9526559 (U.S. Dec. 8, 2021) (\u201cThat no fact-\nfinder could have found the prisoner guilty is not \nenough.\u201d). Texas went as far as suggesting that exe-\ncuting the innocent would not, without more, be un-\nconstitutional. See Resp. Br. at *36, Herrera v. \nCollins, No. 91-7328, 1992 WL 532909 (U.S. July 10, \n1992) (\u201cThe question whether an individual is guilty \nor innocent of a state offense is not just a state law \nquestion, which is outside the ambit of federal juris-\ndiction, but is the ultimate state law question at the \ncriminal trial.\u201d (emphasis added)). Moreover, allow-\n\n10 \ning states to be the gatekeeper to relief would effec-\ntively allow the fox to guard the henhouse.  \nAmicus has identified nearly two dozen persons \nwho were exonerated2 after being denied all relief \nunder AEDPA, as enumerated in the Appendix. To \nbe clear, this cohort does not include any persons \nwho were able to clear AEDPA\u2019s hurdles and obtain \nan exoneration. These individuals were denied relief \nunder AEDPA and then later obtained relief, either \nthrough state court proceedings or in federal pro-\nceedings after the state waived AEDPA\u2019s procedural \ndefenses.  \nAlthough each case is compelling\u2014an innocent \nperson was freed despite the federal courts denying \nrelief\u2014several are illustrative and presented here in \nmore detail for the Court\u2019s consideration as it ad-\ndresses the statutory questions in Mr. Rivers\u2019 case.  \nTake first the example of Stephen Lazar,3 who \nwas exonerated in 2023\u2014more than six years after \nthe federal district court denied habeas relief based \n\u201csolely on the exceedingly deferential framework im-\nposed . . . by [AEDPA].\u201d Lazar v. Coleman, No. 14-\n6907, 2017 WL 783666, at *1 (E.D. Pa. Mar. 1, 2017) \n \n2 To compile this list, counsel have relied on the University \nof Michigan\u2019s widely used National Registry of Exonerations to \nconfirm these exonerations. See Glossary, The National Regis-\ntry \nof \nExonerations, \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Pages/glossary.\naspx.  \n3 Mr. Lazar is an employee of Phillips Black, Inc.   \n\n11 \n(\u201cLazar I\u201d). Mr. Lazar was wrongfully convicted in \n2010 of second-degree murder, robbery, and posses-\nsion of an instrument of crime after Philadelphia po-\nlice neglected to investigate alternative suspects and \nsuppressed the records of misconduct history of the \nlead detective. See Lazar v. The Att\u2019y Gen. of Pa., 659 \nF. Supp. 3d 599, 606\u201308 (E.D. Pa. 2023) (\u201cLazar II\u201d). \nAlthough he was eventually exonerated in federal \ncourt through a writ of habeas corpus, Mr. Lazar \nwas forced to wait until the federal court re-opened \nMr. Lazar\u2019s case pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 60(b) and the Commonwealth waived \nAEDPA\u2019s exhaustion requirement. See id. at 601, \n609.  \nWhen the district court initially denied Mr. Laz-\nar's petition under AEDPA, the substantial evidence \nof police misconduct that made his wrongful convic-\ntion possible was unknown to both the court and Mr. \nLazar. Without this crucial evidence, the district \ncourt had disagreed with\u2014yet deferred under AED-\nPA to\u2014the state court's analysis of the prejudice \nprong of Mr. Lazar\u2019s ineffective assistance of counsel \nclaim. See Lazar I, 2017 WL 783666, at *1, 5. At that \nstage in the proceedings, Mr. Lazar's primary claim \nasserted the ineffectiveness of trial counsel for stipu-\nlating to an incorrect date for Mr. Lazar\u2019s most re-\ncent use of methadone\u2014an error which falsely belied \nMr. Lazar's assertion that he was suffering from \nacute methadone withdrawal at the time that he \ngave a false confession. See id. at *2\u20133. Although the \ndistrict court issued a Certificate of Appealability, \nthe Third Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed, also re-\nlying upon AEDPA's deferential standard of review. \n\n12 \nSee Lazar v. Superintendent Fayette SCI, 731 F. \nApp\u2019x 119, 122\u201323 (3d Cir. 2018). \nStrikingly, the claims that ultimately led to Mr. \nLazar\u2019s exoneration did not arise until he was finally \ngiven access to files exclusively possessed by the \nPhiladelphia District Attorney\u2019s Office in 2021, three \nyears after the Third Circuit affirmed the denial of \nhabeas relief under AEDPA. See Lazar II, 659 F. \nSupp. 3d at 606. Similarly, the claims Mr. Rivers \nseeks to add in an amended petition did not arise \nuntil \u201che was finally able to review his \u2018long-\nrequested\u2019 attorney-client file\u201d nearly three years af-\nter the district court denied habeas relief. Rivers v. \nLumpkin, 99 F.4th 216, 219 (5th Cir. 2024).  \nTake also the example of Jeffrey Deskovic, who \nwas exonerated by DNA evidence in 2006\u201416 years \nafter his wrongful convictions for murder and rape, \nand 6 years after the Second Circuit affirmed the \ndismissal of his federal habeas petition under AED-\nPA\u2019s stringent timeliness requirements. See Deskovic \nv. City of Peekskill, 894 F. Supp. 2d 443, 449 \n(S.D.N.Y. 2012) (\u201cDeskovic I\u201d). Mr. Deskovic averred \nin his original federal habeas petition that \u201che was \ndenied a fair trial because D.N.A. evidence implicat-\ned a person other than\u201d himself. Deskovic v. Mann, \nNo. 97 Civ. 3023(BSJ), 1997 WL 811524, at *1 \n(S.D.N.Y. Nov. 20, 1997). The district court, applying \nAEDPA, ruled that Mr. Deskovic\u2019s federal habeas \npetition was untimely, id. at *2, and the Second Cir-\ncuit affirmed, finding that Mr. Deskovic was not en-\ntitled to equitable tolling, see Deskovic v. Mann, 210 \nF.3d 354 (2d Cir. 2000).  \n\n13 \nMr. Deskovic was exonerated when, in 2006, re-\nnewed DNA testing yielded a match with Steven \nCunningham, who had been convicted of sexually as-\nsaulting and murdering another woman three years \nafter the offense that gave rise to Mr. Deskovic\u2019s \nwrongful conviction. Deskovic I, 894 F. Supp. 2d at \n449. Mr. Cunningham confessed shortly thereafter, \nand Mr. Deskovic\u2019s convictions were vacated in New \nYork state court. Deskovic v. City of Peekskill, No. \n07-cv-8150 (KMK), 2009 WL 2475001, at *6 \n(S.D.N.Y. Aug. 13, 2009). The Westchester District \nAttorney dismissed the indictment \u201con the ground of \nactual innocence.\u201d Id.   \nFinally, consider the case of James Lucien, who \nwas wrongfully convicted in 1995 of murder and \narmed robbery based on his alleged involvement in \nthe shooting death and robbery of Ryan Edwards. \nSee Lucien v. Spencer, No. 07-11338, 2015 WL \n5824726, at *1\u20133 (D. Mass. Sep. 30, 2015). Mr. Ed-\nwards was shot while sitting in the driver\u2019s seat of a \ncar during a drug transaction; Mr. Lucien had been \nsitting in the back seat, and the victim\u2019s brother had \nbeen in the front passenger seat before exiting the \nvehicle during the transaction. Id. at *2. The victim\u2019s \nbrother testified at trial that he saw Mr. Lucien \nshoot Mr. Edwards. See id. at *27. This false accusa-\ntion by the actual perpetrator was exposed 26 years \nlater, long after federal habeas relief had been de-\nnied under AEDPA.  \nMr. Lucien's federal habeas petition claimed tri-\nal counsel was ineffective for failing to call two ex-\npert witnesses, who would have testified that the \nfatal shot was not fired from Mr. Lucien's position in \n\n14 \nthe back seat, but rather from outside the front pas-\nsenger door. See id. at *27-32. Under AEDPA's def-\nerential standard of review, the federal court \ndeferred to the state court's conclusion that trial \ncounsel strategically elected not to call these experts. \nId. Trial counsel\u2019s only proffered reason for not call-\ning these experts was that he did not want \u201cto anger \nthem\u201d by calling them to testify in a trial scheduled \nfor the week of Thanksgiving. See id. at *4, 28; see \nalso Lucien v. Spencer, 871 F.3d 117, 128\u201329 (1st \nCir. 2017) (\u201cLucien II\u201d). In affirming the district \ncourt, the First Circuit implied that trial counsel\u2019s \ndecision may have been negligent but emphasized \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201cdoubly deferential\u201d standard of review \nand deferred to the state-court analysis of Mr. Luci-\nen\u2019s claim. See Lucien II, 871 F.3d at 131.  \nIn 2021, the Suffolk County District Attorney\u2019s \nOffice reviewed Mr. Lucien's conviction in light of \nrevelations of severe and pervasive misconduct by \nthe lead detective. Maurice Possley, James Lucien, \nThe National Registry of Exonerations (Dec. 2, 2024) \nhttps://www.law.umich.edu/special/exoneration/Page\ns/casedetail.aspx?caseid=6088. \nThrough \nthis \nre-\ninvestigation, the victim\u2019s brother emerged as a chief \nalternative suspect, and Mr. Lucien was exonerated \nin state court. See id.  \nAs this Court interprets whether Mr. Rivers \nshould be able to present his claim for relief, amicus \nurges the Court to consider the experience of these \nindividuals and the important role for habeas corpus \nto play in protecting the innocent.  \n\n15 \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should re-\nverse the judgment of the Fifth Circuit. \nRespectfully submitted, \nThomas Roberts \nPHILLIPS BLACK, INC.  \n1901 South 9th St. \nSuite 608 \nPhiladelphia, PA 19148 \nJohn R.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case remains stable, as this observation was a moment of internal synthesis rather than the introduction of new external evidence. This step has solidified my current understanding and clarified the most critical remaining uncertainty.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable):** The case concerns Danny Rivers's second federal habeas petition, filed in February 2021 while his first was still on appeal. The lower courts dismissed it as a \"successive\" petition under AEDPA (Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty Act of 1996) because he failed to get the required pre-authorization from the court of appeals. Rivers argues it should have been treated as an amendment to his first petition.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The conflict is between two statutory interpretations. The petitioner's argument for flexibility relies on 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 (governing amendments to habeas petitions) and the precedent in *Banister v. Davis*. The respondent's argument for strict proceduralism relies on AEDPA's gatekeeping rules for successive petitions in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) and the precedent in *Gonzalez v. Crosby*.\n\n*   **Amicus Landscape (Stable but with Sharpened Focus):**\n    *   **Petitioner's Support:** The petitioner is supported by a specialized amicus, Phillips Black, Inc. This brief introduces a powerful \"justice and innocence\" frame, arguing that rigid procedural rules can prevent the correction of wrongful convictions and citing compelling examples.\n    *   **Absence of Key Support:** My previous search confirmed the U.S. Solicitor General has not filed a brief. This silence is a significant negative signal for the petitioner, as it indicates the federal government is not endorsing a more flexible interpretation of AEDPA. This implicitly strengthens the respondent's position by favoring the status quo.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty (Re-Prioritized and Solidified):** This observation confirms that my primary uncertainty has shifted. Having resolved the question of the SG's involvement, the single most valuable piece of information to acquire next is whether the respondent (Texas) has any amicus support. The most likely and powerful form of such support would be a brief from a coalition of states. Such a brief would almost certainly argue for the importance of finality in state convictions and the need to prevent administrative burdens on state judicial systems, creating a direct \"states' rights/finality\" counter-narrative to the petitioner's \"justice/innocence\" frame. The presence or absence of this support is now the pivotal unknown in my model of the case.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an internal thought process, does not introduce new external data but strongly validates the meta-cognitive framework for conducting inquiry. It reinforces the importance of pausing to synthesize information and strategically plan the next action.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   The foundational heuristics (\"Start with the petitioner's brief,\" \"Identify the Core Conflict,\" etc.) and the \"Argumentative Symmetry\" principle remain the solid bedrock of my analytical process.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`) (Strongly Validated):** This `THINK` action is a perfect embodiment of this cycle. I synthesized the current state (petitioner has specialist support, SG is absent), identified the next key uncertainty (respondent's amicus support), and planned a targeted action to resolve it.\n    2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (Strongly Validated):** This remains the core of my methodology. The internal monologue explicitly articulated the shift in my primary uncertainty, demonstrating a conscious and efficient re-allocation of analytical resources toward the most informative next question.\n    3.  **The \"Amicus Signal\" Heuristic (Stable):** This heuristic, including its \"Signal of Silence\" corollary, is stable. The current plan to search for respondent's amici is a direct application of this heuristic, seeking to complete the picture of the argumentative landscape.\n    4.  **The \"Argumentative Framing\" Heuristic (Stable):** My reasoning confirms the importance of this heuristic by hypothesizing the likely frame of a potential states' amicus brief (\"finality/administrative burden\") and how it would create a powerful counter-narrative.\n    5.  **The \"Specialist vs. Generalist Amicus\" Heuristic (Stable):** This remains a key lens for analysis. My current model contrasts the petitioner's \"specialist\" support with the absence of \"generalist/institutional\" support from the SG. The next search will determine if the respondent has \"generalist/institutional\" support from other states.\n    6.  **The \"Informative Absence\" Principle (Stable):** This principle, validated by the SG's silence, is now being proactively applied to the next search. The absence of a states' amicus brief would be just as informative as its presence.\n    7.  **The \"Expected Actor\" Heuristic (Stable & In Use):** Having identified the SG as an \"expected actor,\" I am now treating a coalition of states as another \"expected actor\" in a case that impacts state-level judicial administration under AEDPA. My next action will test this hypothesis.\n    8.  **NEW - The \"Reflective Synthesis\" Principle:** This `THINK` action itself demonstrates the value of a dedicated, reflective step in the analytical process. Pausing to explicitly summarize the current belief state, articulate the primary remaining uncertainty, and formulate a precise plan for the next action is not a wasted step; it is a crucial mechanism for ensuring the inquiry remains focused, efficient, and logically sound. It prevents aimless searching and maximizes the value of each subsequent action."

This observation, a null result from a targeted search, is a powerful signal that shifts the likely balance of the case in the petitioner's favor.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable):** The case still centers on Danny Rivers's second federal habeas petition, filed while his first was on appeal. The lower courts dismissed it as a \"successive\" petition under AEDPA for failure to obtain pre-authorization. Rivers argues it should have been treated as an amendment to the first petition.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The legal question remains a contest between two interpretations: the petitioner's view, favoring flexibility via 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 (amendments) and *Banister v. Davis*, versus the respondent's view, advocating for strict procedural gatekeeping under AEDPA's 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) (successive petitions) and *Gonzalez v. Crosby*.\n\n*   **Amicus Landscape (Major Update & Solidified):** The picture of external support is now much clearer and strikingly asymmetrical.\n    *   **Petitioner's Support (Stable):** The petitioner is supported by Phillips Black, Inc., a specialized amicus that frames the issue as one of fundamental justice and access for potentially innocent petitioners. Their brief argues that AEDPA's rigid rules, as interpreted by the lower court, can block the correction of wrongful convictions.\n    *   **Respondent's Support (New Information - Critical Absence):** My targeted search for amicus briefs in support of the respondent (Texas) yielded no results. This is a highly significant finding. I had hypothesized that a coalition of states would be an \"expected actor\" in this case, arguing for finality and against administrative burdens. Their collective silence strongly suggests that other states do not view the petitioner's proposed rule (allowing a second-in-time petition to be treated as an amendment while the first is pending) as a significant threat to their interests.\n    *   **U.S. Solicitor General (Stable):** The SG's absence remains a known factor, indicating the federal government is not actively pushing for a change to the status quo. However, the weight of this signal is now counterbalanced by the absence of state-level support for the respondent.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Shifted and Strengthened):** The absence of a states' amicus brief severely weakens the potential \"states' rights/finality\" counter-narrative. It suggests the respondent's arguments about administrative chaos or the floodgates of litigation may be overstated. The argumentative landscape is now lopsided: the petitioner has a compelling \"justice/innocence\" frame backed by a specialist amicus, while the respondent stands alone, unsupported by other states who would presumably share their interest in finality. This significantly increases my confidence in a potential victory for the petitioner. The key uncertainty is no longer about external support but about how the Justices themselves will weigh the textual arguments in light of this asymmetrical landscape.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for several key heuristics, particularly those related to proactive, uncertainty-driven inquiry and the interpretation of \"negative\" evidence.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   The foundational heuristics (\"Start with the petitioner's brief,\" \"Identify the Core Conflict,\" etc.) and the \"Argumentative Symmetry\" principle continue to provide a reliable structure for analysis.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`) (Strongly Validated):** This process has proven highly effective. The previous synthesis step correctly identified the respondent's amicus support as the most valuable unknown, leading to a targeted search that, despite yielding no direct hits, provided a crucial piece of the puzzle.\n    2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (Strongly Validated):** This action confirms that focusing inquiry on the greatest point of uncertainty is the most efficient path to updating a belief model. Resolving the amicus question has had a disproportionately large impact on my assessment of the case.\n    3.  **The \"Informative Absence\" Principle (Strongly Validated):** This is the most significant methodological lesson from this observation. Proactively searching for an expected piece of evidence (a states' amicus brief) and finding nothing is not a failed search; it is a successful discovery of a \"negative fact\" that is just as, if not more, informative than finding the evidence would have been.\n    4.  **The \"Expected Actor\" Heuristic (Strongly Validated & Refined):** My hypothesis that a coalition of states was an \"expected actor\" was a useful framing. Testing for their presence and finding them absent is a powerful signal. This refines the heuristic: identifying expected actors is critical, and their absence allows for strong inferences about how those actors perceive the stakes of the case. Here, it suggests the issue is not a major concern for state judicial systems writ large.\n    5.  **The \"Reflective Synthesis\" Principle (Strongly Validated):** The value of the previous `THINK` step is demonstrated by the precision of this action and the clarity of its outcome. Pausing to plan prevents wasted effort and maximizes the informational yield of each action.\n    6.  **The \"Amicus Signal\" Heuristic (Refined):** This heuristic is now more nuanced. It's not just about who files briefs, but also about who *doesn't* file, especially when they are an \"expected actor.\" The pattern of presence and absence across the full amicus landscape provides a meta-narrative about the case.\n    7.  **NEW - The \"Search Result Interpretation\" Heuristic:** One must interpret the *entirety* of a search result, not just whether it contains the exact item sought. My query for respondent's amici returned documents for the petitioner's amicus. The correct interpretation is twofold: (a) the sought-after documents likely do not exist in the database, and (b) the system's \"near misses\" confirm the presence of evidence for the opposing side. A null result from a well-formed query is data, not a lack of data."

The\nFifth Circuit deemed that filing a second or succes-\nsive application, subject to \u00a72244(b).\nThe question presented is whether \u00a72244(b)(2) ap-\nplies (i) only to habeas filings made after a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his first petition, \n(ii) to all habeas filings submitted after a district\ncourt enters judgment, or (iii) only to some post-final-\njudgment habeas filings.\n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

June 2024) .................... 18, 21 \n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case is about the hurdles a prisoner must clear \nto amend his initial habeas application. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers asked a federal court to review his \nstate conviction, arguing that his counsel had failed \nto investigate his case and had shown up to trial \ndrunk. The district court denied relief, holding that \nRivers had not explained how he was prejudiced. But \nthe answer soon emerged. After fighting for years to \nobtain his lawyers\u2019 records, Rivers finally received \nthem while his case was on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found evidence suggesting he was wrongly \nconvicted: an exculpatory report that his counsel ap-\nparently overlooked. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nraced to court and sought to amend his petition\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. The courts below reasoned \nthat Rivers\u2019s amendment was actually a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application\u201d under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72244(b), divesting the district court of juris-\ndiction to consider it. \nThat was wrong. Congress has already decided \nwhat standard applies when a prisoner seeks to \namend a habeas application mid-appeal\u2014and it\u2019s not \n\u00a72244(b)(2). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242, an application \n\u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the \nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d Those \nrules, in turn, provide for just this situation. District \ncourts may not grant a motion to amend while an ap-\npeal is pending. But Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n62.1(a)(3) authorizes them to consider a such motion \nand state that it \u201craises a substantial issue.\u201d If the \ncourt of appeals agrees, it may vacate and remand, \nclearing the way for amendment. Fed. R. App. P. \n12.1(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106. \n\n2 \n \n \nNone of that happened here because the district \ncourt mistakenly thought that \u00a72244(b) barred Riv-\ners\u2019s filing. But \u00a72244(b) cannot be read to implicitly \nprohibit what \u00a72242 expressly permits. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister v. Davis, 590 \nU.S. 504 (2020), which looked to historical habeas \nand statutory aims when deciding whether a filing is \nsecond or successive. Both point the same way here. \nAs to history, habeas courts traditionally allowed \nprisoners to raise newly discovered evidence, and \ncourts routinely addressed filings like Rivers\u2019s on the \nmerits\u2014instead of deeming them successive. (This \nCourt was no exception.) And as to purposes, forcing \nmotions like Rivers\u2019s to run the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet \nwould have baleful implications for habeas practice, \nmaking it unlikely that Congress \u201cwould have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d 590 U.S. at 513. \nThe Fifth Circuit was also wrong to hold that \n\u00a72244(b) kicks in as soon as a district court enters fi-\nnal judgment, making all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings second or successive. Section 2244(b) functions \nas a statute of repose, ensuring that state prosecutors \ndon\u2019t have to defend the same conviction twice. But \nCongress did not recognize an interest in repose \nwhile a prisoner\u2019s initial petition remains pending. \nInstead, statutory context and historical practice \nshow that the dividing line between first and succes-\nsive petitions is the end of appellate review. Only \nthen does \u00a72244(b) apply. \nThis Court should reverse and remand so the dis-\ntrict court can consider Rivers\u2019s amendment under \nthe proper Rule 15 standard. \n\n3 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The dis-\ntrict court\u2019s unpublished opinion is available at 2021 \nWL 4319670 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. The petition was filed June 24, \n2024 and granted December 6, 2024. This Court has \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nSections 2106, 2242, and 2244(b) of Title 28 are re-\nproduced in the Appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal background \n1. This case concerns when a habeas filing should \nbe deemed a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b). \na. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This path begins \nin the district court. If that court denies relief, the \nprisoner may request a \u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d\u2014\ninitially from the district court, and then from the \ncourt of appeals. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. \n134, 143\u201344 & n.5 (2012). The path ends only when \nthe prisoner has exhausted the chance for review. \n\n4 \n \n \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. To file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b), a prisoner must first \nask the court of appeals for \u201can order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application,\u201d id. \n\u00a72244(b)(3)(A). The appellate court may oblige only if \nthe petition \u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of \nconstitutional law\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscover-\nable facts that would establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(2)). If \nso, the petition goes to the district court, which must \ndecide for itself whether the petition \u201csatisfies the re-\nquirements\u201d of \u00a72244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(4). Only \nthen may the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether a given \nfiling is deemed \u201cpart of resolving a prisoner\u2019s first \nhabeas application,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or in-\nstead a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus applica-\ntion.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b).  \nb. \u201c[S]econd or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of art\u201d that \ndoes not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 follow-\ning an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 \n(citations omitted). To determine when \u00a72244(b) ap-\nplies, \u201cthis Court has looked for guidance in two main \nplaces.\u201d Id. at 512. First, history: \u201cwhether a type of \nlater-in-time filing would have constituted an abuse \nof the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. \n(cleaned up) (citation omitted). Second, \u201cstatutory \naims\u201d: conserving judicial resources, reducing piece-\nmeal litigation, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a rea-\nsonable time.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313 (citation omitted). \n2. Two recent cases have required this Court to \nconsider whether a motion filed under a Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure was actually a second or successive \napplication. The Federal Rules \u201cgenerally govern ha-\n\n5 \n \n \nbeas proceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511; see Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 81(a)(4); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 Rule 12 (Federal \nRules apply \u201cto the extent they are not inconsistent \nwith\u201d a federal statute or Habeas Rule). When mo-\ntions authorized by a given Federal Rule constitute \nsecond or successive applications, however, AEDPA \n\u201cdisplaces\u201d the Federal Rule, and \u201call of \u00a72244(b)\u2019s re-\nstrictions kick in.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511. \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), involved a \nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. The pris-\noner there \u201cabandoned any attempt to seek review\u201d of \nthe order denying his habeas petition, waited a year, \nand then moved to reopen the case under Rule 60(b). \nId. at 527, 537. Because his motion challenged \u201ca \nnonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d the Court found \u201cno basis for contending that \n[it] should be treated like a habeas corpus applica-\ntion\u201d in the first place. Id. at 533\u201334. Had the prison-\ner\u2019s motion gone to the merits, however, the Court \nsuggested that it would have counted as a second or \nsuccessive application (or its functional equivalent). \nSee id. at 531\u201332. \nFive Terms ago, in Banister v. Davis, the Court \nfaced a similar question involving a Rule 59(e) motion \nto alter or amend a judgment. Under Rule 59(e), a \nparty may seek reconsideration up to 28 days after \nthe district court enters judgment, including on the \nbasis of \u201cnew arguments\u201d and \u201cnewly discovered or \npreviously unavailable evidence.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 508 n.2 (quoting 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice & P\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n22: 20250121162416057_Cert_of_Compliance_A.json (score: 0.435)\nRULE 33.1(h) CERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nNo. 23-1345 \nDANNY RICHARD RIVERS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \nBOBBY LUMPKIN, DIRECTOR,  \nTEXAS DEPARTMENT OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE,  \nCORRECTIONAL INSTITUTIONS DIVISION, \nRespondent. \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I, Peter A.

Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 509 \n(2020). After that, prisoners who file a \u201csecond or suc-\ncessive habeas corpus application\u201d must satisfy the \nstringent gatekeeping requirements of 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72244(b)(2). Here, petitioner sought to amend his ini-\ntial habeas application under Federal Rule of Civil\nProcedure 15 while it was pending on appeal. The\nFifth Circuit deemed that filing a second or succes-\nsive application, subject to \u00a72244(b).\nThe question presented is whether \u00a72244(b)(2) ap-\nplies (i) only to habeas filings made after a prisoner \nhas exhausted appellate review of his first petition, \n(ii) to all habeas filings submitted after a district\ncourt enters judgment, or (iii) only to some post-final-\njudgment habeas filings.\n\nii \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nEx parte Rivers, WR-84,550-01 & 84,550-02 (Tex. \nCt.

June 2024) .................... 18, 21 \n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case is about the hurdles a prisoner must clear \nto amend his initial habeas application. Petitioner \nDanny Rivers asked a federal court to review his \nstate conviction, arguing that his counsel had failed \nto investigate his case and had shown up to trial \ndrunk. The district court denied relief, holding that \nRivers had not explained how he was prejudiced. But \nthe answer soon emerged. After fighting for years to \nobtain his lawyers\u2019 records, Rivers finally received \nthem while his case was on appeal. Among the files, \nRivers found evidence suggesting he was wrongly \nconvicted: an exculpatory report that his counsel ap-\nparently overlooked. New evidence in hand, Rivers \nraced to court and sought to amend his petition\u2014only \nto find the doors barred. The courts below reasoned \nthat Rivers\u2019s amendment was actually a \u201csecond or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application\u201d under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72244(b), divesting the district court of juris-\ndiction to consider it. \nThat was wrong. Congress has already decided \nwhat standard applies when a prisoner seeks to \namend a habeas application mid-appeal\u2014and it\u2019s not \n\u00a72244(b)(2). Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242, an application \n\u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the \nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d Those \nrules, in turn, provide for just this situation. District \ncourts may not grant a motion to amend while an ap-\npeal is pending. But Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n62.1(a)(3) authorizes them to consider a such motion \nand state that it \u201craises a substantial issue.\u201d If the \ncourt of appeals agrees, it may vacate and remand, \nclearing the way for amendment. Fed. R. App. P. \n12.1(b); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106. \n\n2 \n \n \nNone of that happened here because the district \ncourt mistakenly thought that \u00a72244(b) barred Riv-\ners\u2019s filing. But \u00a72244(b) cannot be read to implicitly \nprohibit what \u00a72242 expressly permits. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister v. Davis, 590 \nU.S. 504 (2020), which looked to historical habeas \nand statutory aims when deciding whether a filing is \nsecond or successive. Both point the same way here. \nAs to history, habeas courts traditionally allowed \nprisoners to raise newly discovered evidence, and \ncourts routinely addressed filings like Rivers\u2019s on the \nmerits\u2014instead of deeming them successive. (This \nCourt was no exception.) And as to purposes, forcing \nmotions like Rivers\u2019s to run the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet \nwould have baleful implications for habeas practice, \nmaking it unlikely that Congress \u201cwould have viewed \n[them] as successive.\u201d 590 U.S. at 513. \nThe Fifth Circuit was also wrong to hold that \n\u00a72244(b) kicks in as soon as a district court enters fi-\nnal judgment, making all post-judgment habeas fil-\nings second or successive. Section 2244(b) functions \nas a statute of repose, ensuring that state prosecutors \ndon\u2019t have to defend the same conviction twice. But \nCongress did not recognize an interest in repose \nwhile a prisoner\u2019s initial petition remains pending. \nInstead, statutory context and historical practice \nshow that the dividing line between first and succes-\nsive petitions is the end of appellate review. Only \nthen does \u00a72244(b) apply. \nThis Court should reverse and remand so the dis-\ntrict court can consider Rivers\u2019s amendment under \nthe proper Rule 15 standard. \n\n3 \n \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s opinion is reported at 99 F.4th \n216 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The dis-\ntrict court\u2019s unpublished opinion is available at 2021 \nWL 4319670 and is reproduced at Pet. App. 12a\u201317a. \nJURISDICTION \nThe Fifth Circuit issued judgment on April 15, \n2024. Pet. App. 1a. The petition was filed June 24, \n2024 and granted December 6, 2024. This Court has \njurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a71254(1). \nRELEVANT STATUTORY PROVISIONS \nSections 2106, 2242, and 2244(b) of Title 28 are re-\nproduced in the Appendix to this brief. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal background \n1. This case concerns when a habeas filing should \nbe deemed a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b). \na. The Antiterrorism and Effective Death Penalty \nAct of 1996 creates a dual-track system for federal \nhabeas relief. One path is for first-time petitioners. \n\u201cUnder AEDPA, a state prisoner always gets one \nchance to bring a federal habeas challenge to his con-\nviction.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This path begins \nin the district court. If that court denies relief, the \nprisoner may request a \u201ccertificate of appealability\u201d\u2014\ninitially from the district court, and then from the \ncourt of appeals. See Gonzalez v. Thaler, 565 U.S. \n134, 143\u201344 & n.5 (2012). The path ends only when \nthe prisoner has exhausted the chance for review. \n\n4 \n \n \nThe second path is \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n509. To file a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus ap-\nplication,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b), a prisoner must first \nask the court of appeals for \u201can order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application,\u201d id. \n\u00a72244(b)(3)(A). The appellate court may oblige only if \nthe petition \u201crelies on a new and retroactive rule of \nconstitutional law\u201d or \u201calleges previously undiscover-\nable facts that would establish \u2026 innocence,\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 509 (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(2)). If \nso, the petition goes to the district court, which must \ndecide for itself whether the petition \u201csatisfies the re-\nquirements\u201d of \u00a72244. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(4). Only \nthen may the district court reach the merits. \nThe upshot is that much rides on whether a given \nfiling is deemed \u201cpart of resolving a prisoner\u2019s first \nhabeas application,\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507, or in-\nstead a \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus applica-\ntion.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b).  \nb. \u201c[S]econd or successive\u201d is a \u201cterm of art\u201d that \ndoes not refer simply to \u201call habeas filings \u2026 follow-\ning an initial application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 \n(citations omitted). To determine when \u00a72244(b) ap-\nplies, \u201cthis Court has looked for guidance in two main \nplaces.\u201d Id. at 512. First, history: \u201cwhether a type of \nlater-in-time filing would have constituted an abuse \nof the writ\u201d under the Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cases.\u201d Id. \n(cleaned up) (citation omitted). Second, \u201cstatutory \naims\u201d: conserving judicial resources, reducing piece-\nmeal litigation, and achieving finality \u201cwithin a rea-\nsonable time.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313 (citation omitted). \n2. Two recent cases have required this Court to \nconsider whether a motion filed under a Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure was actually a second or successive \napplication. The Federal Rules \u201cgenerally govern ha-\n\n5 \n \n \nbeas proceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511; see Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 81(a)(4); 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254 Rule 12 (Federal \nRules apply \u201cto the extent they are not inconsistent \nwith\u201d a federal statute or Habeas Rule). When mo-\ntions authorized by a given Federal Rule constitute \nsecond or successive applications, however, AEDPA \n\u201cdisplaces\u201d the Federal Rule, and \u201call of \u00a72244(b)\u2019s re-\nstrictions kick in.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511. \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), involved a \nRule 60(b) motion for relief from judgment. The pris-\noner there \u201cabandoned any attempt to seek review\u201d of \nthe order denying his habeas petition, waited a year, \nand then moved to reopen the case under Rule 60(b). \nId. at 527, 537. Because his motion challenged \u201ca \nnonmerits aspect of the first federal habeas proceed-\ning,\u201d the Court found \u201cno basis for contending that \n[it] should be treated like a habeas corpus applica-\ntion\u201d in the first place. Id. at 533\u201334. Had the prison-\ner\u2019s motion gone to the merits, however, the Court \nsuggested that it would have counted as a second or \nsuccessive application (or its functional equivalent). \nSee id. at 531\u201332. \nFive Terms ago, in Banister v. Davis, the Court \nfaced a similar question involving a Rule 59(e) motion \nto alter or amend a judgment. Under Rule 59(e), a \nparty may seek reconsideration up to 28 days after \nthe district court enters judgment, including on the \nbasis of \u201cnew arguments\u201d and \u201cnewly discovered or \npreviously unavailable evidence.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 508 n.2 (quoting 11 Wright & Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a72810.1, at 161\u201362 (3d ed. 2012)). \nDistinguishing Gonzalez, the Court held that a Rule \n59(e) motion \u201cdoes not count as a second or successive \nhabeas application.\u201d Id. at 521. \n\n6 \n \n \n3. While federal habeas law does not expressly ad-\ndress the motions at issue in Gonzalez and Banister, \nCongress specifically authorized prisoners to amend \nor supplement their habeas applications. Under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72242, which predates AEDPA and the Habe-\nas Rules, an \u201c[a]pplication for a writ of habeas corpus \n\u2026 may be amended or supplemented as provided in \nthe rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d \nB. Factual background \nDanny Rivers has spent the last thirteen years \nfighting to prove his innocence. While his initial ha-\nbeas petition was pending on appeal, he discovered \nthat exculpatory evidence had been sitting in his trial \ncounsel\u2019s files all the while\u2014evidence that his law-\nyers could have used to clear his name. If Rivers is \nright, he not only received ineffective assistance but \nwas also wrongly convicted. This case is about \nwhether \u00a72244(b)(2) bars Rivers from amending his \npetition and bringing the new evidence to light. \n1. Rivers is tried and convicted. \nIn 2012, a Texas jury convicted Rivers of sexually \nabusing his children and possessing child pornogra-\nphy. He is currently serving a 38-year sentence. \na. This case began amidst a bitter divorce. In 2008, \na Texas judge awarded Rivers temporary custody of \nhis 9-year-old daughter. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 11-14 (\u201cR-1\u201d), at 156, 164. \nThe court also granted Rivers sole use of the family \nhome and denied his ex-wife\u2019s request for alimony. Id. \nDkt. 11-15 (\u201cR-2\u201d), at 15. In response, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife \n\u201cpunish[ed]\u201d him by \u201cnot letting him see\u201d his 12-year-\nold stepdaughter, whom he had raised as his own. R-\n2, at 16. \n\n7 \n \n \nThe following year, with custody arrangements un-\nchanged, Rivers\u2019s ex-wife drove the children to the \npolice station. Both girls met with officers and ac-\ncused Rivers of sexually abusing them. R-2, at 18, \n129. Police then searched Rivers\u2019s home, seized the \nfamily laptop, and launched a forensic examination, \neventually identifying \u201ctwo files of interest\u201d\u2014a single \nimage and a single video\u2014that \u201cappeared to be\u201d child \npornography. Id. at 26\u201328; id. Dkt. 11-10 (\u201cR-3\u201d), at \n13, 31, 73; id. Dkt. 11-16, at 15, 66\u201367. \nb. A grand jury indicted Rivers for indecency with a \nchild, continuous sexual abuse, and two counts of \npossessing child pornography. R-3, at 8\u201315. Rivers, \nwho had no criminal history, R-2, at 161, pleaded not \nguilty. \nTrial looming, Rivers moved to sever the child-\npornography counts, arguing they would poison the \njury\u2019s views on the other charges. R-1, at 15. The \nState opposed severance. Because Texas had \u201cno \nDNA or physical evidence,\u201d it argued that the alleged \nchild pornography was \u201cnecessary\u201d to establish Riv-\ners\u2019s \u201cmotive\u201d and \u201cattraction to young girls.\u201d Id. at \n14\u201315. The court refused to sever. Id. at 23. \nc. At trial, Rivers\u2019s daughter and stepdaughter al-\nleged a staggering pattern of sexual abuse. R-1, at \n142, 145\u201346, 167\u201368. They further claimed that Riv-\ners had shown them child pornography at least sev-\nenty times, testifying that he had \u201cdownloaded mul-\ntiple videos\u201d and played different films on different \noccasions. Id. at 153, 172. (Texas charged Rivers with \npossessing only one such video.) Rivers\u2019s daughter al-\nso accused her father of secretly recording images in \nthe shower, R-1, at 170, although no hidden cameras \nwere ever found. All told, the girls alleged over 200 \ninstances of shocking abuse, many of which reported-\n\n8 \n \n \nly took place in common areas of the home while their \nmother, uncle, or cousin were present in the house. R-\n1, at 139, 147, 152\u201353, 156, 158, 166; R-2, at 12, 90. \nNo other witnesses testified that they had seen the \nalleged abuse, and no physical evidence corroborated \nthe story. R-2, at 34, 64. \nThis lack of supporting evidence made the alleged \nchild pornography a key issue at trial. The prosecu-\ntion called multiple witnesses to testify about the \nvideo file and image that Rivers was charged with \npossessing. R-2, at 19, 28, 44, 74, 84, 100. While the \ntrial judge had granted a continuance so the defense \ncould obtain its own experts, R-3, at 31, 40, counsel \ndid not do so. R-2, at 112. Instead, the defense called \nonly one witness, who testified that he and Rivers \nwere traveling for work when the two files were al-\nlegedly downloaded. R-2, at 113\u201314, 131. That wit-\nness later swore that Rivers\u2019s lawyers never \u201ccontact-\ned [him] until the day they wanted [him] to testify\u201d or \nasked for evidence that would have corroborated Riv-\ners\u2019s alibi. Rivers v. Lumpkin, No. 7:17-cv-00124 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 27-3, at 9. \nd. The jury convicted Rivers on all charges, Pet. \nApp. 2a. It rejected the prosecution\u2019s call for a 169-\nyear sentence, however, and recommended that the \ncourt sentence Rivers to 42 years. R-3, at 213\u201314, \n221\u201329. The court further decreased the sentence: 38 \nyears behind bars, all counts considered\u2014three years \nabove the minimum. Pet. App. 13a. The Texas Court \nof Appeals affirmed. \n2. Rivers seeks postconviction relief. \na. In 2013, while his direct appeal was still pend-\ning, Rivers began asking his lawyers to send him his \nclient file. He explained: \u201cI don\u2019t know what all it con-\n\n9 \n \n \ntains, but it looks like I\u2019m going to have to do this \nthing pro se, so I need everything I can get.\u201d No. 7:21-\ncv-00012 (N.D. Tex.) Dkt. 15-11, at 67. Counsel \u201cnev-\ner responded,\u201d and two years later, hindered by his \nimprisonment, Rivers was still trying. Id. at 68\u201369. \nHe eventually resorted to filing a formal grievance \nwith the Texas state bar. \nMeanwhile, Rivers pressed forward with what rec-\nords he had. In 2016, he sought state postconviction \nrelief based on ineffective assistance, among other \ngrounds. Relevant here, he argued that his trial \ncounsel had failed to \u201cperform an objectively reasona-\nble investigation\u201d or \u201cverify the ages of the persons\u201d \nin the alleged child pornography. No. 7:21-cv-00012 \n(N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 12-21, at 9. He added that his lead \ncounsel was \u201cinebriated\u201d at the trial. Id. at 11. \nThe Texas Court of Criminal Appeals found that \nRivers had \u201calleged facts that, if true, might entitle \nhim to relief.\u201d Ex parte Rivers, 2016 WL 5800277, at \n*1 (Tex. Crim. App. Oct. 5, 2016). It remanded for \nfurther factfinding, ordering the court to appoint \ncounsel if it \u201celect[ed] to hold a hearing.\u201d Id. Judge \nAlcala wrote separately to urge the appointment of \ncounsel \u201cregardless of whether the trial court holds a \nhearing.\u201d Id. (Alcala, J., concurring). \nOn remand, the court neither held a hearing nor \nappointed counsel. Instead, it chiefly relied on affida-\nvits in which trial counsel defended their perfor-\nmance, denied drunkenness, and claimed that Rivers \nhad \u201cadmitted to [them] that he engaged in sexual \nacts with the victims.\u201d Rivers v. Davis, 2018 WL \n4443153, at *3 (N.D. Tex. July 27, 2018); see also No. \n7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 24-1, at 24. Rivers re-\nsponded with his own affidavit, categorically \u201cde-\nny[ing] making such admissions.\u201d Dkt. 24-1 at 4. He \n\n10 \n \n \nalso submitted a text message from one of the law-\nyers\u2019 spouses, confirming that counsel \u201cshowed up in-\ntoxicated for court,\u201d id. at 25, and a news report \nshowing that his lead counsel was arrested six \nmonths before the trial \u201cafter showing up at a wom-\nan[\u2019]s house naked and drunk,\u201d id. at 33 (cleaned up) \n(quoting Texoma, Local Attorney Sentenced to Two \nYears Probation (Mar. 18, 2015), bit.ly/Barber-\nArrest). The trial court nonetheless \u201cconcluded that \ncounsel were not ineffective,\u201d and the Court of Crimi-\nnal Appeals affirmed. Ex parte Rivers, 2017 WL \n3380491, at *1 (Tex. Crim. App. June 7, 2017). \nb. Rivers filed a federal habeas petition in 2017, \nraising the same ineffective-assistance claims, among \nother grounds. No. 7:17-cv-00124 (N.D. Tex.), Dkt. 1, \nat 6. When the district court denied relief, Rivers \n\u201ctimely filed a notice of appeal,\u201d Rivers v. Lumpkin, \n2022 WL 1517027, at *4 (5th Cir. May 13, 2022), and \nsought a certificate of appealability. \n3. While his habeas appeal is pending, \nRivers discovers new, exculpatory  \nevidence. \nWhile his case was pending on appeal, Rivers final-\nly received the client file that he first requested in \n2013. Pet. App. 2a. In it, he found a state investiga-\ntor\u2019s report analyzing the two files underlying his \nchild-pornography conviction. The report called the \nvideo merely \u201cof interest,\u201d without further comment. \nMeanwhile, the image was labeled \u201cNOT CHILD \nPORN.\u201d J.A. 91\u201392. The report also listed a number \nof other files found on the family laptop. Next to \none\u2014entitled \u201creallyunderagekiddieporn\u201d\u2014the state \ninvestigator had written: \u201calthough the title indicated \nit to be child porn,\u201d it \u201cis not.\u201d Id. at 91. Another, \nwhose title included phrases like \u201cpre-teen tiny chil-\n\n11 \n \n \ndren\u201d and \u201cincest sex porn underage,\u201d was likewise \nmarked \u201cNOT CHILD PORN.\u201d Id. at 92. The report \nalso showed that these files were not saved under \nRivers\u2019s name; they were instead recovered from a \ndownload folder bearing the name of Rivers\u2019s ex-wife.  \nAfter discovering the report, Rivers moved to sup-\nplement the appellate record. See id. at 41. He also \nfiled an affidavit stating that he had never seen the \nreport and noting that his lawyers had \u201cfailed to raise \nthis exculpatory evidence\u201d that had been \u201cin [their] \npossession\u201d all along. Id. at 54\u201355. The affidavit add-\ned that Rivers\u2019s \u201cestranged wife had access to the \nhouse and did in fact enter the house \u2026 while [Riv-\ners] was out of town during the time frame the al-\nleged child porn was downloaded,\u201d id. at 49. The Fifth \nCircuit denied Rivers\u2019s motion but granted a certifi-\ncate of appealability. Id. Dkt. 34, at 2.  \nC. Procedural history \nIn February 2021\u2014more than a year before the last \nfilings were submitted in his pending appeal\u2014Rivers \nreturned to the district court and tried to amend his \ninitial petition. Using the standard \u00a72254 template \nprovided to pro se litigants, Rivers alleged that his \ncounsel had \u201cfail[ed] to present exculpatory evidence \nin their possession\u201d that would have shown \u201cfactual \ninnocence.\u201d J.A. 68. He added that prosecutors had \nviolated due process by \u201cfalsely pursu[ing]\u201d charges \nbased on evidence that \u201ctheir own investigators\u201d \ndeemed \u201cNOT CHILD PORN.\u201d Id. at 75. \nSoon thereafter, Rivers asked the Fifth Circuit to \nstay or remand. Id. at 95. Rivers explained that his \namended petition contained \u201csubstantial [ineffective-\nassistance] claims that [it] should be aware of before \ndetermining if counsel was or was not ineffective.\u201d Id. \n\n12 \n \n \nat 99. Since his \u201coriginal habeas action [remained] \npending,\u201d Rivers reasoned that \u201cjudicial economy \nwould best be served by [the Fifth Circuit\u2019s] one time \nreview,\u201d covering \u201call grounds\u201d\u2014both \u201cthose on ap-\npeal\u201d and \u201cthose currently raised in the district \ncourt.\u201d Id. (cleaned up). To avoid \u201cpiecemeal litiga-\ntion,\u201d Rivers asked the court to either stay appellate \nproceedings so he could \u201cexhaust the new claims and \nthen join the causes\u201d or to \u201cremand this case back to \nthe district court for consideration of the new \ngrounds.\u201d Id. at 100. The court denied the motion in a \none-line order. No. 18-11490 (5th Cir.) Dkt. 78. \nMeanwhile, in the district court, the same magis-\ntrate judge who reviewed Rivers\u2019s initial habeas peti-\ntion recommended that the February 2021 filing be \ndeemed a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition and trans-\nferred to the Fifth Circuit for lack of jurisdiction. See \nPet. App. 3a\u20134a. Rivers objected, maintaining that \nthe filing was \u201can amendment to [his] initial petition \ncurrently pending on appeal.\u201d 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. \nTex.), Dkt. 27, at 5. He then moved the court to stay \nor \u201cconsider an interlocutory review\u201d to \u201cpreserve ju-\ndicial resources.\u201d J.A. 107. The court adopted the \nmagistrate\u2019s recommendation and denied Rivers\u2019s \nstay motion. See Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. Rivers appealed \nin October 2021, again arguing that his filing was \u201can \namendment/supplement under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15 to \n[his] initial petition.\u201d 5th Cir. No. 21-11031, Dkt. 20, \nFeb. 17, 2022. \nThe Fifth Circuit docketed Rivers\u2019s jurisdictional \nappeal as a separate case. (Now there were two ap-\npeals pending before separate panels.) Seven months \nlater, in May 2022, Panel 1 affirmed the initial habe-\nas denial without addressing Rivers\u2019s amended peti-\ntion or the newly discovered evidence. See Rivers, \n\n13 \n \n \n2022 WL 1517027, cert. denied, 143 S. Ct. 1090 \n(2023). Then, in April 2024, Panel 2 affirmed the \ntransfer order\u2014the decision below. Pet. App. 1a\u20132a. \nIt reasoned that \u00a72244(b) applies to \u201cfilings intro-\nduced after a final judgment that raise habeas \nclaims, no matter how titled.\u201d Id. at 10a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nFor two independent reasons, Rivers\u2019s motion to \namend was not a second or successive habeas corpus \napplication. The Court should reverse and remand. \nI. First, a mid-appeal Rule 15 motion is not a sec-\nond or successive habeas corpus application. \nA. Section 2242 of Title 28 expressly states that an \n\u201c[a]pplication for a writ of habeas corpus \u2026 may be \namended or supplemented as provided in the rules of \nprocedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d The civil rules, \nin turn, permit motions to amend or supplement a \npleading while a case is pending on appeal. Although \na district court lacks jurisdiction to grant such a mo-\ntion, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1(a)(3) per-\nmits it to issue an indicative ruling \u201cstat[ing] either \nthat it would grant the motion if the court of appeals \nremands for that purpose or that the motion raises a \nsubstantial issue.\u201d The court of appeals may then va-\ncate the judgment and \u201cremand for further proceed-\nings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1; 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106.  \nBecause \u00a72242 authorizes mid-appeal motions to \namend a habeas application, such motions cannot be \ndeemed \u201csecond or successive habeas corpus applica-\ntion[s]\u201d under \u00a72244(b). Requiring such motions to \nsatisfy \u00a72244(b)(2) would nullify Congress\u2019s instruc-\ntion that habeas applications \u201cmay be amended\u201d if \nthey satisfy \u201cthe rules of procedure applicable to civil \nactions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. It would wrongly treat an \n\n14 \n \n \namendment as a new, independent \u201capplication,\u201d ra-\nther than part and parcel of the initial application. \nAnd it would override Congress\u2019s decision that only a \nlimited subset of amendments not at issue here must \nsatisfy \u00a72244(b)(2). See id. \u00a72266(b)(3)(B). \nB. Historical practice confirms that mid-appeal mo-\ntions to amend are not second or successive habeas \napplications. Courts historically did not treat habeas \npetitions presenting newly discovered evidence as \nsuccessive. Nor did they regard mid-appeal Rule 15 \nmotions as abuses of the writ. Presented with such \nmotions, courts addressed them on the merits, with-\nout suggesting they were abusive. \nC. Treating mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as part of \nand parcel of the initial habeas application would also \nadvance AEDPA\u2019s aims. Channeling such filings to \nthe same judge who has just ruled on the initial peti-\ntion maximizes judicial economy, avoids piecemeal \nlitigation, and hastens the finality of state convic-\ntions. By contrast, diverting them to the court of ap-\npeals under \u00a72244(b) would burden appellate judges, \nlead to simultaneous appeals, and leave states and \nprisoners in limbo. It\u2019s hard to attribute those results \nto a Congress focused on efficiency and finality. \nD. Applying \u00a72244(b)(2) to mid-appeal motions to \namend also leads to anomalous results that Congress \nis unlikely to have intended. On the Fifth Circuit\u2019s \nview, Rule 15 applies to nearly every motion to \namend in a habeas case. Only a tiny sliver\u2014those \nfiled by a prisoner while the case is pending appeal\u2014\nmust run the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet. That approach al-\nso creates senseless distinctions between similarly \nsituated prisoners, slamming the door on newly dis-\ncovered evidence while the case is still pending. \n\n15 \n \n \nII. Alternatively, \u00a72244(b) does not apply while a \nprisoner\u2019s initial petition is pending on appeal. In the \npostconviction context, this Court has always under-\nstood finality by reference to the end of appellate re-\nview, not final judgment. Pre-AEDPA courts applied \nabuse-of-the-writ principles in that manner, treating \nthe appellate court\u2019s decision as the dividing line be-\ntween first and successive petitions. Far from reject-\ning that view, Congress embraced it throughout \nAEDPA by pegging finality to the end of appellate re-\nview. And treating appellate review as the relevant \ninflection point here makes sense too. Section 2244(b) \nfunctions as a statute of repose, sparing states the \nburden of defending the same conviction twice. But \nCongress did not recognize a state\u2019s interest in repose \nwhile the initial petition is still pending: that interest \nvests only once the appeal is over. \nIII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary arguments fail. \nA. Gonzalez v. Crosby doesn\u2019t control this case. \nGonzalez neither involved nor addressed mid-appeal \namendments under Rule 15. Nor did it analyze or de-\ncide whether the dividing line between initial peti-\ntions and \u201csecond or successive\u201d petitions is the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s entry of judgment or the end of appellate \nreview. And Gonzalez\u2019s logic doesn\u2019t apply here either \nbecause \u00a72242 expressly permits amendments as \nprovided in the civil rules, which already contain am-\nple safeguards against abuse.  \nB. The Fifth Circuit was also wrong to fear a flood \nof amendments. Given the jurisdictional, procedural, \nand substantive barriers to amending mid-appeal, \nprisoners have every incentive to file all of their \nclaims in their initial petition. The Second Circuit, \nwhere mid-appeal Rule 15 motions have been allowed \nfor the last 20 years, offers an informative case study. \n\n16 \n \n \nDistrict courts there have not been flooded with abu-\nsive amendments, and the motions they have re-\nceived have not proven burdensome. \nIV. This Court should reverse and remand. The \ncourts below made a threshold jurisdictional error \nthat kept them from reaching the merits of Rivers\u2019s \nmotion to amend. On remand, the district court will \nhave the chance to consider whether Rivers\u2019s newly \ndiscovered evidence warrants relief under the proper \nRule 15 standard. \nARGUMENT \nI. A motion to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition that is pending on appeal is \nnot a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application. \nA. Section 2242 permits prisoners to seek \nleave to amend or supplement their  \napplications while an appeal is pending. \nSection 2242 tells courts which rules to apply when \na prisoner moves to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition: \u201cthe rules of procedure applicable to \ncivil actions.\u201d Those rules, in turn, include mecha-\nnisms for updating a pleading mid-appeal. Applying \n\u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping requirements instead of the \ncivil rules would nullify \u00a72242 and disregard Con-\ngress\u2019s drafting choices. \n1. Under \u00a72242, a habeas application \nmay be amended or supplemented  \nas provided in the rules of civil  \nprocedure. \nCongress has told courts that a habeas application \n\u201cmay be amended or supplemented as provided in the \nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a72242. Beyond Congress\u2019s \u201cgeneral prescrip-\n\n17 \n \n \ntio[n]\u201d that the Federal Rules apply in habeas cases, \n\u00a72242 \u201cspecifically\u201d requires courts to allow amend-\nment and supplementation per the rules of civil pro-\ncedure. Mayle v. Felix, 545 U.S. 644, 654\u201355 (2005). \nSection 2242 reflects longstanding practice that \npredates both the Habeas Rules and AEDPA. By its \nterms, the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867 contemplated \namendments only to the jailer\u2019s \u201creturn\u201d and \u201csugges-\ntions made against it,\u201d 14 Stat. 385, 386. But by 1948, \nwhen Congress added the amendment provision to \n\u00a72242, courts had long permitted prisoners to amend \ntheir petitions \u201cin the interest of justice.\u201d E.g., Holi-\nday v. Johnston, 313 U.S. 342, 350 (1941); see also \nPrice v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266, 291\u201392 (1948) (re-\nmanding for amendment). As the Codifier\u2019s Note ex-\nplains, the provision aimed \u201cto conform to [this] exist-\ning practice.\u201d Codifier\u2019s Note, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242 (1952). \nUnder \u00a72242, amending a habeas petition works \njust like amending a pleading \u201cin ordinary civil litiga-\ntion.\u201d Mayle, 545 U.S. at 663. Section 2242 imposes \nno restrictions beyond those \u201cprovided in the rules of \nprocedure.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. Nor did Congress tether \n\u00a72242 to a specific rule. Instead, it broadly instructed \ncourts to allow amendments in accordance with the \n\u201crules\u201d governing \u201ccivil actions.\u201d Id.  \n2. The rules of civil procedure provide \nfor motions to amend or supplement \na pleading while an appeal is  \npending. \na. Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 15 lets parties \namend and supplement their pleadings. Under Rule \n15(a)(2), \u201ca party may amend its pleading\u201d with \u201cthe \ncourt\u2019s leave,\u201d which should be \u201cfreely give[n] when \njustice so requires.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 15(a)(2); see Fo-\n\n18 \n \n \nman v. Davis, 371 U.S. 178, 182 (1962). And under \nRule 15(d), a court \u201cmay, on just terms, permit a par-\nty to serve a supplemental pleading setting out any \ntransaction, occurrence, or event that happened af-\nter\u201d the initial pleading. \nUnlike other Federal Rules, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. \n12(b), (h), these provisions contain no time limit. To \nthe contrary, Rule 15(d) permits supplementation af-\nter a court has found \u201cthe original pleading \u2026 defec-\ntive in stating a claim or defense.\u201d Likewise, leave to \namend \u201chas been granted under Rule 15(a) at various \nstages of the litigation,\u201d including \u201cafter a judgment \nhas been entered\u201d and \u201con remand following appeal.\u201d \n6 Wright & Miller, Federal Practice & Procedure \n\u00a71488 & n.11 (3d ed. June 2024); see also Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 15(b)(2) (expressly permitting amendment \u201cafter \njudgment\u201d). \nb. Rule 15 motions may be filed while a case is on \nappeal. Two structural barriers ordinarily prevent \ndistrict courts from granting such motions: the pend-\ning appeal and the final judgment. But those barriers \nare not insurmountable. Federal courts have long ex-\nperience \nwith \nthe \ncomplexities \nof \nlitigation\u2014\nincluding the problem of newly discovered evidence. \nThe \u201crules of procedure applicable to civil actions\u201d re-\nflect that experience, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242, providing ways \nto update the pleadings even after an appeal has been \nfiled. Relevant here, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n62.1(a) permits a district court to issue an indicative \nruling inviting remand, and Federal Rule of Appel-\nlate Procedure 12.1(b) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106 allow the \ncourt of appeals to vacate and remand in response. \ni. An appeal \u201cdivests the district court of its control \nover those aspects of the case involved in the appeal.\u201d \nGriggs v. Provident Consumer Disc. Co., 459 U.S. 56, \n\n19 \n \n \n58 (1982). That principle precludes a district court \nfrom granting a motion to amend a pleading that is \npending on appeal. The principle does not, however, \npreclude the district court from considering the mo-\ntion. Even if a district court lacks jurisdiction to \ngrant a motion, it still \u201cha[s] jurisdiction to entertain \nthe motion and either deny the motion on its merits, \nor certify its intention to grant the motion to the \nCourt of Appeals, which could then entertain a mo-\ntion to remand.\u201d United States v. Cronic, 466 U.S. \n648, 667 n.42 (1984) (citing United States v. Johnson, \n327 U.S. 106, 108\u201309 (1946)). \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1(a) is the mod-\nern mechanism for this longstanding practice. It gives \na district court three options when faced with a \u201ctime-\nly motion \u2026 for relief that the court lacks authority \nto grant because of an appeal.\u201d First, the court may \n\u201cdefer considering the motion.\u201d Id. \u00a7(a)(1). Second, it \nmay entertain the motion and \u201cdeny\u201d it. Id. \u00a7(a)(2). \nFinally, the court may issue an \u201c[i]ndicative [r]uling\u201d \n\u201cstat[ing] either that it would grant the motion if the \ncourt of appeals remands for that purpose or that the \nmotion raises a substantial issue.\u201d Id. \u00a7(a)(3). When \nthe court of appeals receives such a ruling, Federal \nRule of Appellate Procedure 12.1(b) allows it to \u201cre-\nmand for further proceedings.\u201d \nAlthough Rule 62.1(a) is often used in conjunction \nwith Rule 60(b) motions, \u201cnothing in [the rule\u2019s] lan-\nguage limits its application\u201d to that context. Ret. Bd. \nof Policemen\u2019s Annuity & Benefit Fund v. Bank of \nN.Y. Mellon, 297 F.R.D. 218, 221 (S.D.N.Y. 2013). In-\nstead, Rule 62.1(a) covers \u201call circumstances in which \na pending appeal ousts district-court authority to \ngrant relief.\u201d Report of the Civil Rules Advisory \nCommittee, Dec. 12, 2006 at 14. That includes mid-\n\n20 \n \n \nappeal Rule 15 motions. See, e.g., Ret. Bd., 297 F.R.D. \nat 220, 223. \nRule 62.1(a) does not require a party to move for an \nindicative ruling. The rule speaks of just one mo-\ntion\u2014the \u201ctimely motion \u2026 for relief that the court \nlacks authority to grant because of an appeal.\u201d Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 62.1(a). A distinct \u201cmotion\u201d for a \u201ctargeted \n\u2018indicative ruling\u2019\u201d is thus unnecessary: the district \ncourt may issue an indicative ruling based solely on \nthe underlying motion for relief. Mendia v. Garcia, \n874 F.3d 1118, 1120\u201321 (9th Cir. 2017) (collecting \ncases); see also, e.g., Scarborough v. U.S. Sec. Assocs., \nInc., 836 F. App\u2019x 60, 61 & n.1 (2d Cir. 2020). \nii. When a district court issues an indicative ruling \nunder Rule 62.1(a), \u201cthe court of appeals may remand \nfor further proceedings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1(b). The \ncourt of appeals may also \u201cvacate\u201d or \u201cset aside\u201d any \n\u201cjudgment\u201d or \u201corder\u201d below and \u201crequire such further \nproceedings \u2026 as may be just under the circumstanc-\nes.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72106. Remand on those terms makes a \nseparate motion to reopen the judgment unnecessary.  \nAppellate courts\u2019 authority to grant such relief has \na deep pedigree. For as long as there have been fed-\neral appellate courts, those courts have had to con-\ntend with unforeseen developments on appeal. Some-\ntimes the appellate court was \u201cinformed\u201d of new evi-\ndence. E.g., Estho v. Lear, 32 U.S. (7 Pet.) 130, 131 \n(1833) (Marshall, C.J.); United States v. Shotwell \nMfg. Co., 355 U.S. 233, 234\u201338 (1957); Levinson v. \nUnited States, 32 F.2d 449, 450 (6th Cir. 1929). \nSometimes an intervening event meant that \u201cgreat \ninjustice\u201d would be done by ruling on \u201cthe present \u2026 \nrecord.\u201d E.g., Ballard v. Searls, 130 U.S. 50, 52 \n(1889); Ransom v. City of Pierre, 101 F. 665, 670\u201371 \n(8th Cir. 1900). And sometimes situations \u201cchanged \n\n21 \n \n \nradically\u201d enough to \u201cpreclud[e]\u201d further action. See \nWatts, Watts & Co. v. Unione Austriaca Di Naviga-\nzione, 248 U.S. 9, 21\u201322 (1918) (collecting cases). \nWhen such things happen, courts are not limited to \n\u201ccorrecting error\u201d but may also \u201cdispos[e] of the case \nas justice may at th[e] time require.\u201d Id. at 21. \nD.W. Bosley Co. v. Wirfs, 20 F.2d 629 (8th Cir. \n1927), is illustrative. The plaintiff in Bosley sued the \ndefendant for patent infringement. After losing in the \ndistrict court, the defendant appealed and \u201cthe case \nwas argued and submitted\u201d before the Eighth Circuit. \nId. at 630. Then, while the appeal was still pending, \nthe defendant discovered that another firm had been \nselling products \u201clike those patented to the [plaintiff]\u201d \nyears before the plaintiff applied for his patent. Id. \nThe Eighth Circuit knew what that meant: if the de-\nfendant was right, the evidence \u201cwould be likely to \nlead the court below to a different result from its ear-\nlier conclusion.\u201d Id. At the defendant\u2019s request, the \nEighth Circuit remanded to the district court, where \nthe defendant sought to \u201camend its answer and pre-\nsent [the] newly discovered\u201d evidence. Id; see also, \ne.g., Estho, 32 U.S. at 131 (granting leave to amend); \nDietz v. Horton Mfg. Co., 170 F. 865, 873 (6th Cir. \n1909) (same).  \nA remand order that vacates the judgment \u201creo-\npen[s] litigation.\u201d Mendoza v. Lumpkin, 81 F.4th 461, \n470 (5th Cir. 2023). This makes it unnecessary to ask \nthe district court for relief from judgment under Rule \n60(b). The remand order \u201csuppl[ies] all that is need-\ned by way of authority below and amount[s] in itself \nto a vacation of the judgment for further proceedings, \nincluding amendments.\u201d Markert v. Swift & Co., 173 \nF.2d 517, 520 (2d Cir. 1949). Rule 62.1(c) reflects this \nprinciple, providing that \u201c[t]he district court may de-\n\n22 \n \n \ncide the motion if the court of appeals remands for \nthat purpose.\u201d See also Wright & Miller \u00a71489 (call-\ning such an order \u201ccomparable to a vacation of the \nlower court\u2019s judgment\u201d). \n* \n* \n* \nAll of that boils down to this: While Rule 15 mo-\ntions are most common before final judgment, a party \nmay also seek leave to amend or supplement while an \nappeal is pending. A district court that receives such \na motion may consider it and issue an indicative rul-\ning. Then, if the court of appeals vacates and re-\nmands, the district court is free to grant the motion.  \n3. Section 2244(b) does not override \n\u00a72242. \na. \u201c[I]t is this Court\u2019s duty to interpret Congress\u2019s \nstatutes as a harmonious whole rather than at war \nwith one another.\u201d Epic Sys. Corp. v. Lewis, 584 U.S. \n497, 502 (2018). It follows that \u00a72244(b)(2) cannot be \nread to implicitly prohibit what \u00a72242 expressly per-\nmits. Section 2242 expressly allows a prisoner to \n\u201camen[d] or supplemen[t]\u201d his \u201c[a]pplication\u201d \u201cas pro-\nvided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil ac-\ntions.\u201d Section 2242 thus identifies what conditions \nmust be satisfied to amend a habeas petition: the \nconditions specified in the civil rules. Those condi-\ntions don\u2019t include \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s stringent gatekeep-\ning requirements for second or successive petitions. \nConstruing a motion to amend as a second or succes-\nsive petition, and thereby subjecting it to \u00a72244(b)(2), \nwould thus nullify Congress\u2019s instruction that a ha-\nbeas petition \u201cmay be amended\u201d as provided in the \ncivil rules. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. \nTreating an amendment to an application as a \u201csec-\nond or successive\u201d application would also \u201celid[e] the \n\n23 \n \n \ndifference\u201d Congress recognized between the two. \nArtuz v. Bennett, 531 U.S. 4, 9 (2000). Section 2244(b) \nrefers to a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application as a \nnew, distinct \u201capplication.\u201d Section 2242, meanwhile, \nmakes clear that an \u201camendment\u201d is not a new and \nindependent application, but rather something that \nhappens to an existing application. See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72242 (providing that \u201c[i]t\u201d\u2014the \u201c[a]pplication\u201d\u2014may \nbe amended); see also Tr. of Oral Arg., Banister, No. \n18-6943 (Assistant to the Solicitor General: \u201cSection \n2242 \u2026 makes clear that that amendment still goes \nto the same application.\u201d). And Congress elsewhere in \nthe statute expressly distinguished between \u201can ap-\nplication,\u201d an \u201camendment to an application,\u201d and a \n\u201csecond \nor \nsuccessive \napplication.\u201d \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a72266(b)(2), (b)(3)(B).  \nCongress also showed that it knows how to subject \nan amendment to \u00a72244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping require-\nments when it wants to. It did so in \u00a72266, part of \nAEDPA\u2019s \u201copt-in\u201d chapter: a set of fast-track proce-\ndures for capital habeas cases that apply when a \nstate meets certain conditions. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a72261\u2013\n2266; Calderon v. Ashmus, 523 U.S. 740 (1998). Un-\nder \u00a72266(b)(3)(B), \u201c[n]o amendment \u2026 shall be per-\nmitted after the filing of the answer to the applica-\ntion, except on the grounds specified in section \n2244(b).\u201d Congress thus considered requiring that \namendments satisfy the \u00a72244(b)(2) standards\u2014but \nit did so for only a tiny sliver of amendments: those \nfiled by state prisoners, on death row, whose states \nhave opted in. When \u201cCongress has shown elsewhere \nin the same statute that it knows how to make such a \nrequirement manifest,\u201d this Court should \u201cnot lightly \nassume that Congress has omitted from its adopted \ntext requirements that it nonetheless intends to ap-\nply.\u201d Jama v. ICE, 543 U.S. 335, 341 (2005). \n\n24 \n \n \nb. Viewed another way, treating a motion to amend \nas a second or successive petition would effectively \nread \u00a72244(b) as impliedly repealing \u00a72242. But \u201c[t]he \ncardinal rule is that repeals by implication are not \nfavored.\u201d Posadas v. Nat\u2019l City Bank of N.Y., 296 U.S. \n497, 503 (1936). \u201c[P]resented with two statutes, the \nCourt will regard each as effective\u2014unless Congress\u2019 \nintention to repeal is clear and manifest, or the two \nlaws are irreconcilable.\u201d Me. Cmty. Health Options v. \nUnited States, 590 U.S. 296, 315 (2020) (cleaned up). \nNot so here. \nThere is no evidence\u2014let alone \u201cclear and manifest\u201d \nevidence\u2014that Congress intended \u00a72244(b) to repeal \n\u00a72242. Id. Courts \u201cstrongly presum[e]\u201d that \u201cCongress \nwill specifically address language on the statute \nbooks that it wishes to change.\u201d United States v. \nFausto, 484 U.S. 439, 453 (1988). Congress did just \nthat in AEDPA. Title I of the Act, labeled \u201cHabeas \nCorpus Reform,\u201d expressly amended \u00a7\u00a72243, 2244, \n2245, and 2255 of Title 28. Pub. L. No. 104-132, tit. I, \n\u00a7\u00a7101\u2013106 (1996). But neither that title nor any other \nprovision of AEDPA mentions \u00a72242. See id. \nNor are \u00a7\u00a72242 and 2244(b) \u201cirreconcilable.\u201d Me. \nCmty., 590 U.S. at 315. Irreconcilability is a high bar. \nSee J.E.M. Ag Supply, Inc. v. Pioneer Hi-Bred Int\u2019l, \nInc., 534 U.S. 124, 141\u201342 (2001). It is \u201cnot enough to \nshow\u201d that two statutes \u201cproduce differing results \nwhen applied to the same factual situation, for that \nno more than states the problem.\u201d Radzanower v. \nTouche Ross & Co., 426 U.S. 148, 155 (1976). And a \n\u201cpolicy preference\u201d for applying one provision over \nanother won\u2019t do either. FCC v. NextWave Personal \nCommc\u2019ns Inc., 537 U.S. 293, 304 (2003). Instead, two \nstatutes are \u201cirreconcilable\u201d only when they \u201ccannot \nmutually coexist\u201d or there is \u201ca positive repugnancy\u201d \n\n25 \n \n \nbetween them. Radzanower, 426 U.S. at 155. Here, \n\u00a7\u00a72242 and 2244(b) can easily coexist, without \u201cre-\npugnancy,\u201d by confining them each to their own re-\nspective spheres. Section 2242 addresses amend-\nments but not second or successive applications. Sec-\ntion 2244(b), for its part, says much about second or \nsuccessive applications but not a word about amend-\nments. If both provisions stuck to their own jobs, nei-\nther would be out of work. Id.  \nB. Historical practice confirms that mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motions are not second \nor successive habeas applications. \nEven apart from \u00a72242, Banister\u2019s logic yields the \nsame result. To decide \u201cwhat qualifies as second or \nsuccessive,\u201d this Court looks first to \u201chistorical habe-\nas doctrine and practice.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. If \n\u201ca type of later-in-time filing would have constituted \nan abuse of the writ, as that concept is explained\u201d in \nthe Court\u2019s \u201cpre-AEDPA cases,\u201d it is \u201csuccessive.\u201d Id. \n(citation omitted). \u201c[I]f not, likely not.\u201d Id. As shown \nbelow, history favors Rivers twice over. For one thing, \nhabeas courts did not historically deem the mere act \nof raising newly discovered evidence abusive. More \ntelling still, pre-AEDPA courts routinely decided mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motions on the merits\u2014rather than \ndismissing them as abusive. \n1. The abuse-of-the-writ doctrine did \nnot foreclose petitions presenting \nnewly discovered evidence. \nThe abuse-of-the-writ doctrine was a nineteenth-\ncentury innovation. \u201c[B]y the common law of Eng-\nland, as it stood at the adoption of the constitution,\u201d \nthe denial of habeas relief was \u201cno bar to the issuing \nof a second or third or more writs.\u201d Ex parte Kaine, 14 \n\n26 \n \n \nF. Cas. 78, 80 (C.C.S.D.N.Y. 1853). Courts were in-\nstead \u201caccustomed to exercise an independent judg-\nment on each successive application, regardless of the \nnumber.\u201d Salinger v. Loisel, 265 U.S. 224, 230\u201331 \n(1924). \u201cTh[is] rule made sense because at common \nlaw an order denying habeas relief could not be re-\nviewed. Successive petitions served as a substitute for \nappeal.\u201d McCleskey v. Zant, 499 U.S. 467, 479 (1991) \n(internal citation omitted). \nOnly later, once \u201ca right to an appellate review was \ngiven,\u201d did U.S. courts restrict this practice. Salinger, \n265 U.S. at 231. Abuse-of-the-writ doctrine developed \nto ban successive petitions that presented claims that \nwere \u201cdeliberately with[e]l[d],\u201d Sanders v. United \nStates, 373 U.S. 1, 18 (1963), or that the applicant \n\u201chad [a] full opportunity\u201d to present in his first peti-\ntion, Wong Doo v. United States, 265 U.S. 239, 241 \n(1924). Courts carefully emphasized, however, that \npresenting newly discovered evidence was not itself \nabusive. E.g., Price, 334 U.S. at 290\u201391. \nEx parte Cuddy, one of the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases, illustrates the point. 40 F. 62, 66 (C.C.S.D. \nCal. 1889) (Field, J.). A district court denied Thomas \nCuddy\u2019s initial habeas petition, and this Court af-\nfirmed. Id. at 63. Cuddy then sought habeas relief \nfrom Justice Field, riding circuit. Justice Field or-\ndered the writ dismissed, reasoning that \u201ca second \napplication upon the same facts \u2026 should not be \nheard,\u201d absent \u201cleave to make a new application.\u201d Id. \nat 66. At the same time, he cabined that principle to \n\u201ccases where a second application is made upon the \nsame facts presented, or which might have been pre-\nsented\u201d in the first application. Id. In his view, things \nwould be \u201centirely different\u201d if \u201csubsequent occurring \nevents\u201d offered \u201cnew\u201d grounds for relief. Id. \n\n27 \n \n \nOther courts agreed. In line with Justice Field\u2019s \nremarks, habeas courts did not treat the presentation \nof newly discovered evidence as itself abusive. This \nCourt said as much in Waley v. Johnston, 316 U.S. \n101, 105 (1942), where the subsequent petition did \nnot raise \u201cthe same issue\u201d as the prior one. Early \ntwentieth-century district courts applied the same \nprinciple, reasoning that a \u201csubstantial change in the \ncircumstances\u201d could warrant a further petition. E.g., \nEx parte Moebus, 148 F. 39, 40 (D.N.H. 1906). So did \nstate courts, which \u201croutinely allowed prisoners to \nintroduce exculpatory evidence that was either un-\nknown or previously unavailable to the prisoner.\u201d \nBoumediene v. Bush, 553 U.S. 723, 780\u201381 (2008) \n(collecting cases).  \nTo be sure, Congress later restricted prisoners\u2019 abil-\nity to raise newly discovered evidence in \u201csecond or \nsuccessive\u201d applications. But this \u201chistorical habeas \ndoctrine and practice\u201d counsels against construing \nthat phrase more broadly than the statutory text \ncompels. See Banister, 590 U.S. at 512 (If a \u201ctype of \nlater-in-time filing\u201d would not have \u201cconstituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d it is \u201clikely not\u201d successive.). \n2. Habeas courts did not historically \ntreat mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as \nsuccessive. \nThe same rules applied when new grounds for relief \nemerged while an initial petition was pending on ap-\npeal. Had courts viewed mid-appeal Rule 15 motions \nas successive, \u201cthere should be lots of decisions dis-\nmissing them on that basis.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at \n514. Instead, courts time and again \u201cresolved [such] \nmotions on the merits\u2014and without comment about \nrepetitive litigation.\u201d Id. at 515. \n\n28 \n \n \na. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy is a good example. Af-\nter a district court denied his initial habeas petition, \nPeter Harisiades appealed to the Second Circuit. See \nUnited States ex rel. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 187 \nF.2d 137, 138 (2d Cir. 1951). Then, while his appeal \nwas pending, he returned to the district court and \n\u201cmoved for permission to amend.\u201d Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 90 F. Supp. 431, 432 & n.2 (S.D.N.Y. \n1950). The United States \u201copposed the motion\u201d on \nmultiple grounds, see id. at 432\u201333, but it didn\u2019t \nclaim that Harisiades had abused the writ by moving \nto amend mid-appeal. \nThe district court in Harisiades followed precisely \nthe path that Rivers advocates here. While it recog-\nnized that an appeal \u201cdeprive[s] the District Court of \nauthority,\u201d the court still deemed it \u201cproper\u201d to \u201ccon-\nsider the merits of the \u2026 application to amend.\u201d Id. \nat 433\u201334. In short: exactly what Rule 62.1(a) would \nlater prescribe. See Munoz v. United States, 451 F. \nApp\u2019x 818, 819 n.1 (11th Cir. 2011) (Rule 62.1 \u201ccod-\nif[ied]\u201d existing practice). After doing so, the court \ndenied the motion \u201con the merits\u201d\u2014without a hint \nthat moving to amend was itself an abuse of the writ. \nId. at 820. \nThe Second Circuit affirmed. When Harisiades \nchallenged the denial of his motion to amend, the \ncourt consolidated that appeal with his pending ha-\nbeas appeal, see 187 F.2d at 139, and decided both \ncases in the same four-page opinion. As to the \namendment issue, Judge Swan (joined by Chief Judge \nLearned Hand and Judge Augustus Hand) proceeded \nstraight to the merits and deemed the district court\u2019s \norder \u201ccorrect.\u201d Id. at 139\u201340, 142. That is telling. Af-\nter all, dismissing Harisiades\u2019s motion as successive \n\u201cwould have been easier\u201d than ruling on the merits. \n\n29 \n \n \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 519 n.8. \u201cAnd even more to the \npoint, that course would usually have been required\u201d \nif mid-appeal Rule 15 motions \u201ccounted as succes-\nsive.\u201d Id. The Second Circuit clearly did not view \nthem that way. \nBut the story doesn\u2019t end there. After the Second \nCircuit denied relief, this Court granted certiorari \nand affirmed. See Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 \nU.S. 580 (1952). Although the Court\u2019s opinion focuses \nchiefly on the habeas denial, the Court also addressed \nthe amendment issue. Like the lower courts, this \nCourt went straight to the merits. Compare id. at 583 \nn.4, with 90 F. Supp. 437, and 187 F.2d at 139\u201340. \nAnd like the lower courts, this Court said not a word \nabout abuse of the writ\u2014an omission all the more \nstriking for the fact that it came only two months af-\nter the Court had unanimously decried the \u201cproblems \nraised by \u2026 applications for habeas corpus that are \nrepetitious.\u201d United States v. Hayman, 342 U.S. 205, \n212 & n.14 (1952). \nb. Nor was Harisiades the only dog that didn\u2019t \nbark. Over the next four decades, prisoners regularly \ntried to amend their petitions after final judgment. \nBut instead of dismissing these motions as succes-\nsive, courts routinely addressed them on the merits. \nIn fact, our research did not find a single pre-AEDPA \ncase where a court treated mid-appeal efforts to \namend or supplement as an abuse of the writ. \nSome of these cases resemble Harisiades. Take \nStrand v. United States, 780 F.2d 1497 (10th Cir. \n1985). The prisoner there filed an \u201camended petition\u201d \nwhile his case was still pending before the district \ncourt. Id. at 1505 (McKay, J., dissenting). The court \nlater denied relief\u2014apparently without considering \nthe amended petition\u2014and the prisoner appealed. Id. \n\n30 \n \n \nat 1498\u201399. While the appeal was pending, he filed a \n\u201crenewed motion to supplement\u201d in the district court. \nId. After that too was denied, the prisoner appealed, \nand the Tenth Circuit consolidated the cases. Id. at \n1499. The court affirmed without a hint that the pris-\noner had abused the writ. See id. at 1500. \nIn other cases, the prisoner tried to amend in the \nappellate court itself. Bennett v. Robbins, 329 F.2d \n146, 147 (1st Cir. 1964), is typical. After the district \ncourt denied habeas relief, the prisoner appealed and \nasked the First Circuit to let him \u201camend his applica-\ntion.\u201d Id. The court declined, without suggesting that \nthe motion was abusive. Id. Petty v. McCotter, 779 \nF.2d 299 (5th Cir. 1986), is much the same. The pris-\noner there introduced a new claim for the first time \non appeal. Id. at 301. In an opinion joined by Judge \nJones, the Fifth Circuit remanded, holding that he \n\u201cshould be given an opportunity to amend.\u201d Id. at \n302. No member of the panel suggested that the pris-\noner was abusing the writ. See also Clarke v. Hender-\nson, 403 F.2d 687, 688 (6th Cir. 1968); Thomas v. \nVirginia, 357 F.2d 87, 90 (4th Cir. 1966). \nIn still other cases, prisoners sought leave to amend \nafter final judgment but before appeal. That\u2019s what \nhappened in Bishop v. Lane, 478 F. Supp. 865, 866 \n(E.D. Tenn. 1978). Instead of deeming the motion \nsuccessive, the court simply walked the prisoner \nthrough the rules of civil procedure and then denied \nleave to amend. Id. at 467. See also Briddle v. Scott, \n63 F.3d 364 (5th Cir. 1995). \nWhat is striking about all these cases is that not a \nsingle judge suggested that any of the prisoners had \nabused the writ. It\u2019s hard to see why \u201ca half century\u2019s \nworth of habeas courts would have resolved [Rule 15] \nmotions on the merits\u201d if they viewed them as succes-\n\n31 \n \n \nsive. Banister, 590 U.S. at 519 n.8. \u201cThe only plausi-\nble account of their actions is that they did not.\u201d Id. \nC. AEDPA\u2019s aims favor treating mid-appeal \nRule 15 motions as part and parcel of \nthe initial application. \n\u201cCongress passed AEDPA against this legal back-\ndrop, and did nothing to change it.\u201d Id. at 515. As \nBanister explained, AEDPA made it harder for sec-\nond or successive petitions to get past the gate\u2014but \nit did not \u201credefine what qualifies as a successive pe-\ntition\u201d in the first place. Id. \u201cNor do AEDPA\u2019s purpos-\nes demand a change\u201d in the practice just described. \nId. Far from it: forcing mid-appeal Rule 15 motions to \nrun the \u00a72244(b)(2) gauntlet would frustrate\u2014not \nfurther\u2014efficiency and finality,\u201d making it unlikely \nthat \u201cCongress would have viewed [them] as succes-\nsive.\u201d Id. at 512\u201313. \n1. Conserving judicial resources. The question \nis not whether prisoners will race to court when ex-\nculpatory evidence emerges mid-appeal. They will\u2014\nno matter what rule the Court adopts. The question \ninstead is how the lower courts should review those \ninevitable filings.  \na. Rivers\u2019s rule lets only the most promising claims \nproceed, efficiently filtering out the rest. Under our \napproach, a mid-appeal Rule 15 motion would go to \nthe district court judge who just decided the initial \npetition: the single decisionmaker most familiar with \nthe case. If the motion raised a \u201csubstantial issue,\u201d \nRule 62.1(a)(3), the court could say so. E.g., Parry v. \nKerestes, 2013 WL 6002358, at *2 (W.D. Pa. Nov. 12, \n2013). If not, the court could deny it. Rule 62.1(a)(2). \nEither way, a judge \u201cfamiliar with a habeas appli-\n\n32 \n \n \ncant\u2019s claims\u201d would likely make \u201cquick work\u201d of such \na filing. Banister, 590 U.S. at 517.  \nb. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary rule displaces dis-\ntrict courts and burdens the courts of appeals. Be-\ncause the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach turns on whether a \nmid-appeal filing \u201craise[s] habeas claims,\u201d Pet. App. \n10a, the district court must first decide whether the \nprisoner has asserted \u201cmerits-based\u201d or \u201cintegrity-\nbased\u201d grounds for relief\u2014a \u201cnot-always-easy thresh-\nold determination.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 518 n.7. If \nthe filing raises merits-based claims, the district \ncourt lacks jurisdiction and must either dismiss or \ntransfer it as a second or successive petition. Three \nappellate judges must then decide\u2014from square zero, \nwithout a district-court opinion, and likely without \nadversarial briefing, see In re Williams, 898 F.3d \n1098, 1101 (11th Cir. 2018) (Wilson, J., specially con-\ncurring)\u2014whether \u201cthe factual predicate for the \nclaim\u201d could have been \u201cdiscovered previously \nthrough the exercise of due diligence.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(i). Next they must examine \u201cthe evi-\ndence as a whole\u201d and determine whether \u201cthe facts \nunderlying the claim, if proven,\u201d would be \u201csufficient \nto establish by clear and convincing evidence\u201d that \n\u201cno reasonable factfinder\u201d would have convicted but \nfor constitutional error. Id. \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii). That, in \nturn, means considering the state\u2019s \u201ctheory of the \ncase,\u201d the evidence \u201csupport[ing]\u201d that theory, and \nthe counterfactual effect of the \u201cnewly-discovered evi-\ndence,\u201d including how it would have undermined the \nstate\u2019s evidence and influenced the theories\u2014and \neven \u201calternative theories\u201d\u2014that both sides could \nhave \u201coffered the jury.\u201d Munchinski v. Wilson, 694 \nF.3d 308, 335\u201337 (3d Cir. 2012). One recent authori-\nzation case features a two-column, sixteen-row chart \nthat spans three pages of the Federal Reporter. See \n\n33 \n \n \nIn re Will, 970 F.3d 536, 544\u201346 (5th Cir. 2020). And \nthat\u2019s just the first step. If the appellate court author-\nizes a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, the case goes \nback to the district court, which must \u201cconduct its \nown thorough review\u201d to ensure \u201cthe requirements of \n\u00a72244(b)(2) have been satisfied.\u201d Id. at 543 (cleaned \nup). Still more: because any claim \u201cpresented in a \nprior application\u201d must be dismissed, \u00a72244(b)(1), \nboth courts must compare the \u201csecond or successive\u201d \npetition to every prior petition and determine precise-\nly what \u201cclaim[s]\u201d were already brought, id. at 541\u2014a \ntask that usually means slogging through \u201cless-than-\nlimpid\u201d pro se filings. Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. \nAll agree that \u201ca three-judge panel of the court of \nappeals\u201d is the first port of call for petitions filed after \na prisoner exhausts appellate review of his initial ap-\nplication. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(3)(B). But a Congress \nconcerned about efficiency had little reason to chan-\nnel filings like Rivers\u2019s down that path\u2014and good \nreason to treat them as \u201cpart and parcel of the first \nhabeas proceeding.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 507.  \n2. Reducing piecemeal litigation. AEDPA\u2019s sec-\nond aim likewise favors Rivers\u2019s rule. Under our ap-\nproach, an indicative ruling followed by remand could \nmake further appellate proceedings \u201caltogether un-\nnecessary.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. Conversely, if a \ndistrict court denies leave to amend, there is little \nrisk of \u201cpiecemeal appellate review.\u201d Id. For one \nthing, prisoners \u201cmay not\u201d appeal a \u201cfinal order in a \nhabeas corpus proceeding\u201d without a \u201ccertificate of \nappealability.\u201d See 28 U.S.C. \u00a72253(c)(1). And even if \nsuch an appeal did get off the ground, it would be \nconsolidated with the already-pending habeas appeal, \nsee Harisiades, 187 F.2d at 139; Strand, 780 F.2d \n1499, and reviewed for \u201cabuse of discretion.\u201d E.g., \n\n34 \n \n \nBrown v. United States, 384 F. App\u2019x 815, 817 (10th \nCir. 2010) (Gorsuch, J.). \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary rule calls for two simul-\ntaneous appellate proceedings, demanding the atten-\ntion of up to six judges. Without an indicative ruling, \nPanel 1 (the original merits panel) would have to \npress forward and decide the initial appeal\u2014even if \nthe new evidence was outcome-determinative. Mean-\nwhile, their colleagues on Panel 2 (the authorization \npanel) would have to learn the case from scratch and \nevaluate the new evidence without \u201cthe benefit of the \ndistrict court\u2019s plenary findings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. \nat 517. That is the epitome of piecemeal litigation. \n3. Hastening finality. Finality cuts the same way. \nIf the new evidence here isn\u2019t the bombshell that Riv-\ners reckons, the best way to \u201clend[] finality\u201d to his \nconviction \u201cwithin a reasonable time\u201d would have \nbeen for the district court to say so back in 2021. Ban-\nister, 590 U.S. at 512. District courts are well suited \nto that task, with tools and experience that appellate \ncourts lack. Instead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could keep the \u201ccloud of fed-\neral review\u201d over Rivers\u2019s conviction for years to \ncome. Id. at 523 (Alito, J., dissenting); see, e.g., In re \nWill, 970 F.3d at 536 (authorization proceeding filed \nSeptember 26, 2017 and closed August 5, 2020). \n* \n* \n* \nHad Congress wanted mid-appeal Rule 15 motions \nto count as second or successive petitions, \u201cit easily \ncould have written\u201d such a law. Ali v. Fed. Bureau of \nPrisons, 552 U.S. 214, 227 (2008). But it\u2019s hard to \nsqueeze that rule from the text of \u00a72244(b) and its \nhistorical backdrop. And it\u2019s even harder to attribute \nthe consequences it would entail to a Congress fo-\n\n35 \n \n \ncused on judicial resources, efficiency, and finality. \nFor more than two centuries, this Court has declined \nto \u201cadopt an interpretation that will defeat [a stat-\nute\u2019s] own purpose, if it will admit of any other rea-\nsonable construction.\u201d The Emily, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) \n381, 388 (1824). It should do the same here. \nD. Treating mid-appeal Rule 15 motions  \nas second or successive would produce \nperverse results. \nAll agree that \u00a72244(b) kicks in after a prisoner has \nexhausted the opportunity for review of his initial \nhabeas petition. But applying \u00a72244(b)(2) to mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motions creates a procedural patch-\nwork and slams the door on viable constitutional \nclaims long before AEDPA demands. \n1. Treating mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as second \nor successive applications creates \u201cprocedural anoma-\nlies.\u201d Castro v. United States, 540 U.S. 375, 380\u201381 \n(2003). \u201c[T]he courts of appeals agree \u2026 that an \namended petition, filed after the initial one but before \njudgment, is not second or successive.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 512. And if the prisoner won on appeal, Rule \n15 would also govern any post-remand motion to \namend. See Boyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th \n1232, 1240 (11th Cir. 2024) (Pryor, J., concurring); \nMendoza, 81 F.4th at 468\u201371. Under the Fifth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s approach, the very same document would be a \nsuccessive application if a prisoner filed it in the dis-\ntrict court after final judgment, but not if the prison-\ner filed it before final judgment or waited until after \nthe court of appeals vacated and remanded.  \n2. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule also draws senseless dis-\ntinctions between similarly situated prisoners.  \n\n36 \n \n \nMany meritorious petitions depend on new evi-\ndence. E.g., Andrus v. Texas, 590 U.S. 806, 807 \n(2020); Kyles v. Whitley, 514 U.S. 419, 421\u201322 (1995). \nIn such cases, a prisoner must usually show a \u201crea-\nsonable probability\u201d that, had the new evidence \nemerged sooner, \u201cthe result of the [challenged] pro-\nceeding would have been different.\u201d United States v. \nBagley, 473 U.S. 667, 681\u201382 (1985). That\u2019s a bur-\nden\u2014but much lighter than the one imposed by \nAEDPA. Under \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii), a second or succes-\nsive application must present facts that would \u201cestab-\nlish by clear and convincing evidence that, but for \nconstitutional error, no reasonable factfinder would \nhave found the applicant guilty.\u201d That raises the bar. \nNo longer is it enough to \u201cundermin[e] confidence in \nthe outcome of the trial.\u201d Bagley, 473 U.S. at 678. In-\nstead, the evidence must \u201cestablish \u2026 innocence.\u201d \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 509. And AEDPA also ratchets \nup the burden of proof. A \u201creasonable probability\u201d is \nless than a preponderance. See Kyles, 514 U.S. at \n434. But \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii) demands \u201cclear and con-\nvincing evidence\u201d: more than a preponderance. Ca. ex \nrel. Cooper v. Mitchell Bros.\u2019 Santa Ana Theater, 454 \nU.S. 90, 93 n.6 (1981). \nThe difference between these two standards means \nthat identically situated prisoners will face different \noutcomes through no fault of their own. Imagine two \nprisoners whose trial counsel sat on mitigating evi-\ndence that would have yielded a lighter sentence. \nPrisoner 1 requests his counsel\u2019s files, receives them \npromptly, and discovers the evidence while preparing \nhis initial habeas petition. Prisoner 2 also requests \nhis counsel\u2019s files, but the lawyer stonewalls for \nyears\u2014turning them over only on pain of disbarment, \nwhile the prisoner\u2019s initial petition is pending on ap-\npeal. Under the Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule, Prisoner 1 faces \n\n37 \n \n \nthe Strickland standard and may well get a lesser \nsentence. But Prisoner 2 is out of luck. While the evi-\ndence shows ineffective assistance, it doesn\u2019t show \ninnocence, so he fails under \u00a72244(b)(2)(B)(ii). \nII. Alternatively, \u00a72244(b) applies only after \nthe initial petition is final on appeal. \nThe Court may also reverse for the independent \nreason that \u00a72244(b) does not apply while a prisoner\u2019s \ninitial petition is still pending on appeal. United \nStates v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 104\u201305 (3d Cir. \n2019); Whab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d \nCir. 2005). The Fifth Circuit held otherwise, declaring \nthat that \u201cfilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims \u2026 are deemed successive.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a. Contra Banister, 590 U.S. at 510\u201311. If \nthat rule sounds familiar, it should. In Banister, Tex-\nas urged this Court to hold that \u201c[e]ntry of final \njudgment is the dividing line between a first and sec-\nond application.\u201d Brief for Respondent, Banister v. \nDavis, No. 18-6943 at 18. The Court declined that in-\nvitation there, and it should do the same here. In the \npostconviction context, this Court has long treated \nthe end of appellate review\u2014not the entry of final \njudgment\u2014as the relevant inflection point. Far from \nrejecting that view, Congress embraced it throughout \nAEDPA, under which a state\u2019s interest in repose \nvests only after a prisoner has exhausted the oppor-\ntunity for review.  \nA. Before AEDPA, courts treated the end of \nappellate review as the dividing line  \nbetween first and successive petitions. \nArticle III creates \u201cnot a batch of unconnected \ncourts, but a judicial department composed of \u2018inferior \ncourts\u2019 and \u2018one supreme Court.\u2019\u201d Plaut v. Spendthrift \n\n38 \n \n \nFarm, Inc., 514 U.S. 211, 227 (1995). From that \nstructure follows \u201ca distinction between judgments \nfrom which all appeals have been foregone or com-\npleted, and judgments that remain on appeal (or sub-\nject to being appealed).\u201d Id. Only the former is \u201cthe \nfinal word of the department.\u201d Id. That is why this \nCourt\u2019s \u201cunvarying understanding of finality for col-\nlateral review purposes\u201d has always looked to the end \nof appellate review. Clay v. United States, 537 U.S. \n522, 527 (2003). In this context, finality attaches only \n\u201cwhen this Court affirms a conviction on the merits \non direct review or denies a petition for a writ of cer-\ntiorari, or when the time for filing a certiorari peti-\ntion expires.\u201d Id. at 528. \nNo surprise, then, that the earliest abuse-of-the-\nwrit cases recognized that \u201caction \u2026 on [a] second \napplication\u201d should turn on the \u201ccharacter of the \ncourt or officer to whom the first application was \nmade, and the fullness of the consideration given to \nit.\u201d Cuddy, 40 F. at 66. What mattered to this Court \nin Salinger, for example, was that the \u201cprior refusal\u201d \nof habeas relief had been \u201caffirmed in a considered \nopinion by a Circuit Court of Appeals\u201d\u2014not that a \ndistrict court had entered final judgment. 265 U.S. at \n226\u201327, 232 (emphasis added). Likewise, Justice \nField explained in Cuddy that habeas relief was una-\nvailable to a prisoner who had already \u201cinvok[ed] the \njudgment of the appellate court upon the record pre-\nsented\u201d and \u201cfail[ed] therein.\u201d 40 F. at 64 (emphasis \nadded). That implies that consequences for later \nabuses of the writ attached only after a case was final \non appeal. \nCourts continued applying abuse-of-the-writ princi-\nples by reference to appellate review right up until \nCongress enacted AEDPA. Take Walker v. Lockhart, \n\n39 \n \n \n514 F. Supp. 1347 (E.D. Ark. 1981). The prisoner \nthere sought habeas relief in 1967, lost in the district \ncourt (Henley, C.J.), and then lost again on appeal. \nSee id. at 1350. When he filed \u201cidentical\u201d claims \ntwelve years later, the district court (Woods, J.) de-\nclined to \u201creac[h] the merits\u201d of the successive peti-\ntion. Id. If the dividing line between first and succes-\nsive petitions was final judgment, one would expect \nJudge Woods to focus on Chief Judge Henley\u2019s 1967 \nopinion\u2014not the Eighth Circuit\u2019s affirmance. Instead, \nJudge Woods reasoned that reconsidering the claims \n\u201cwould put this Court in the position of reviewing a \ndecision of its Court of Appeals.\u201d Id. at 1352 (empha-\nsis added). Here again, this suggests that appellate \nreview was the dividing line for abuse-of-the-writ \npurposes. See also, e.g., Whitney v. United States, 424 \nF. Supp. 1236, 1237 (E.D. Mo. 1976); Andrews v. \nDeland, 943 F.2d 1162, 1173 (10th Cir. 1991).  \nIf pre-AEDPA courts thought that final judgment \nwas what mattered for abuse-of-the-writ purposes, \n\u201cthere should be lots of decisions\u201d saying so. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 514. Instead, courts consistently spoke as \nthough the end of appellate review marked the divid-\ning line between first and successive petitions. \nAgainst that backdrop, a rule focused on final judg-\nment is \u201cbad wine of recent vintage.\u201d Rotkiske v. \nKlemm, 589 U.S. 8, 14 (2019) (citation omitted). \nB. AEDPA itself pegs finality to the end of \nappellate review, not final judgment. \nNumerous provisions of AEDPA treat the end of \nappellate review as the relevant inflection point. It \nwould be strange if \u00a72244(b) broke ranks and focused \non the district court\u2019s entry of judgment. \n\n40 \n \n \nAEDPA ties exhaustion to the end of state appel-\nlate review. To seek federal habeas relief, a state \nprisoner must first \u201cexhaust[t] the remedies available \nin the courts of the State.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(b)(1)(A). \nThat means receiving not just a final judgment from \nthe trial court, but also \u201cinvoking one complete round \nof the State\u2019s established appellate review process.\u201d \nO\u2019Sullivan v. Boerckel, 526 U.S. 838, 845 (1999). \nSection 2244 itself focuses on the end of appellate \nreview for statute-of-limitations and tolling purposes. \nUnder \u00a72244(d)(1)(A), the one-year deadline for seek-\ning federal habeas relief runs from the date \u201con which \nthe [state] judgment became final by the conclusion of \ndirect review or the expiration of the time for seeking \nsuch review.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(d)(1)(A) (emphasis \nadded); see also id. \u00a72263(a). And tolling works the \nsame way. AEDPA\u2019s statute of limitations is tolled \nwhile an application for state postconviction relief is \n\u201cpending.\u201d Id. \u00a72244(d)(2). An application does not \ncease to be pending upon \u201ca lower court\u2019s entry of \njudgment.\u201d Carey v. Saffold, 536 U.S. 214, 219 (2002). \nRather, it remains \u201cpending\u201d until it \u201chas achieved \nfinal resolution.\u201d Id. at 220\u201321; see also 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a72263(b)(2). \nPostconviction review of federal judgments follows \nthe same pattern. Under \u00a72255(f)(1), a prisoner must \nseek relief within one year after a federal \u201cjudgment \nof conviction becomes final.\u201d In that context, finality \ndoes not attach until this Court has spoken or the \nchance for review has run. Clay, 537 U.S. at 527\u201328. \nC. A state\u2019s interest in repose does not vest \nuntil the end of appellate review. \nAEDPA functions as a statute of repose. Federal \nhabeas law gives prisoners one chance to drag state \n\n41 \n \n \nprosecutors into federal court. After that, \u00a72244(b)(2) \ntells them not to come back unless they have \u201ca new \nand retroactive rule of constitutional law\u201d or \u201cprevi-\nously undiscoverable facts\u201d showing \u201cinnocence.\u201d \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 509. Beyond those narrow ex-\nceptions, AEDPA \u201ceffect[s] a legislative judgment\u201d \nthat states \u201cshould be free\u201d from the burden of de-\nfending the same conviction twice. CTS Corp. v. \nWaldburger, 573 U.S. 1, 9 (2014) (cleaned up). \nBut Congress did not recognize a state\u2019s interest in \nrepose while a prisoner\u2019s first petition remains pend-\ning. If that interest vested after a district court enters \nfinal judgment, the case should end there. Instead, \nCongress authorized \u201cappeals from the habeas court\u2019s \njudgment\u201d and \u201cstill later petitions to this Court\u201d\u2014\ntreating them both as \u201cfurther iterations of the first \nhabeas application.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. Since \nthe case is \u201cpending until the appeal is disposed of,\u201d \nMackenzie v. A. Engelhard & Sons Co., 266 U.S. 131, \n142\u201343 (1924), the state\u2019s interest in repose vests on-\nly when the case is final on appeal.    \nIII. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s contrary arguments fail. \nA. Gonzalez does not control this case. \nThe Fifth Circuit thought that \u201cprinciples\u201d from \nGonzalez v. Crosby required it to deem Rivers\u2019s mo-\ntion successive. See Pet. App. 10a. Not at all. The \ncourt squeezed those principles from \u201ca handful of \nsentences extracted from [a] decisio[n] that had no \nreason to pass on\u201d the question presented here. \nBrown v. Davenport, 142 S. Ct. 1510, 1528 (2022). \nNor does this case raise the circumvention concerns \nthat motivated Gonzalez. Rule 15 and Rule 60(b) have \nlittle in common, and allowing mid-appeal Rule 15 \n\n42 \n \n \nmotions poses even less circumvention risk than al-\nlowing the Rule 59(e) motions approved in Banister.   \n1. Gonzalez did not address \u00a72242 or analyze when \n\u00a72244(b) first kicks in, so it \u201ccannot make [the Court] \nstop in its tracks.\u201d Royal Canin U.S.A., Inc. v. Wull-\nschleger, \u2014 S. Ct. \u2014 (2025) (slip op. at 17). \nThe question in Gonzalez was \u201cwhether a Rule \n60(b) motion filed by a habeas petitioner is a \u2018habeas \ncorpus application\u2019 as the statute uses that term.\u201d \n545 U.S. at 530. To answer that question, the Court \nexplained, the \u201cfirst step of analysis\u201d is to ask wheth-\ner the motion contains a habeas \u201cclaim\u201d\u2014\u201can assert-\ned federal basis for relief\u201d from a state conviction. Id. \nat 530. When a Rule 60(b) motion seeks to \u201cadd a new \nground for relief\u201d or relitigate the \u201cprevious resolu-\ntion of a claim on the merits,\u201d it raises a \u201cclaim.\u201d Id. \nat 532. But that is not the case when the motion at-\ntacks \u201csome defect in the integrity of the federal ha-\nbeas proceedings.\u201d Id. The Rule 60(b) motion in Gon-\nzalez attacked a \u201cnonmerits aspect\u201d of the prior habe-\nas proceeding, so there was \u201cno basis\u201d to treat it like a \nhabeas application at all. Id. at 533\u201334.  \nGonzalez also reasoned that a merits-based Rule \n60(b) motion is a habeas application (or at least its \nfunctional equivalent) and \u201cshould be treated accord-\ningly\u201d when the filing is second or successive. Id. at \n531\u201332. We have no quarrel with that proposition. \nThis case involves a Rule 15 motion, not a Rule 60(b) \nmotion. Gonzalez said nothing about Rule 15 or \n\u00a72242, not a single brief cited those provisions, and \nthey did not come up at argument. Nor did Gonzalez \nimplicate or address whether the dividing line be-\ntween an initial petition and a \u201csecond or successive\u201d \npetition is final judgment or the end of the appeal. \nThe Court had no occasion to consider that issue be-\n\n43 \n \n \ncause Aurelio Gonzalez filed his Rule 60(b) motion \nmore than a year after \u201cabandon[ing] any attempt to \nseek review\u201d of the order denying his habeas petition. \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 537. So unlike this case, there \nwas no pending appeal in Gonzalez. \n2. Nor does Gonzalez\u2019s logic control. Gonzalez wor-\nried about circumvention because the prisoner there \nwas relying on a generally applicable Federal Rule of \nCivil Procedure\u2014not the federal habeas statute itself. \nBut those concerns are misplaced here. When a pris-\noner moves to amend or supplement his initial peti-\ntion, habeas law \u201citself contains\u201d the pathway he \n\u201cseeks to exploit.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 530 (Alito, J., \ndissenting). In other words, Congress has already \nweighed the risks of circumvention and determined \nthat applications \u201cmay be amended or supplemented \nas provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civ-\nil actions.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242. If \u00a72242 is \u201cbad policy\u201d or \n\u201cworking in unintended ways,\u201d states \u201ccan ask Con-\ngress to change the law.\u201d But \u201cthis Court is not the \nforum for such arguments.\u201d Am. Hosp. Ass\u2019n v. Becer-\nra, 596 U.S. 724, 738 (2022).  \nIn all events, mid-appeal Rule 15 motions differ \nfrom the Rule 60(b) motions at issue in Gonzalez \u201cin \njust about every way that matters.\u201d Banister, 590 \nU.S. at 518. They were not historically deemed abu-\nsive. See supra \u00a71.B.2. They are not \u201copen-ended\u201d: \nthey\u2019re brought within the \u201cfixed \u2026 window\u201d while an \nappeal is pending\u2014the next phase in the \u201coriginal \nproceeding.\u201d 590 U.S. at 519\u201320; see supra \u00a7II.A. Any \nappeal would be consolidated into the pending ap-\npeal. See supra \u00a7I.C.2. And (as we discuss next) nu-\nmerous \u201crules suppres[s] abuse.\u201d 590 U.S. at 520. In \nfact, mid-appeal Rule 15 motions pose far less cir-\ncumvention risk than the Rule 59(e) motions this \n\n44 \n \n \nCourt approved in Banister. Rule 59(e) lets prisoners \nraise \u201cnew arguments\u201d based on \u201cnewly discovered or \npreviously unavailable evidence\u201d with the say-so of a \nsingle judge. Banister 590 U.S. at 508 n.2 (citation \nomitted). By contrast, amending mid-appeal requires \nat least three judges to agree that the claim is worth \nthe candle: the district court plus a panel majority\u2014\nthe same lineup needed for a second or successive pe-\ntition. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b)(3)\u2013(4). \nB. The ordinary civil rules provide ample \nsafeguards against abusive motions.  \nThe Fifth Circuit also worried about opening the \nfloodgates to \u201can unlimited number of new applica-\ntions until the appeal is over.\u201d Pet. App. 8a. Even \nwithout \u00a72244(b)(2), however, numerous barriers still \nincentivize prisoners to bring all their claims at once, \nas 20 years of experience in the Second Circuit shows. \n1. Rivers\u2019s rule \u201cmaintains a prisoner\u2019s incentives to \nconsolidate all of his claims in his initial application.\u201d \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 516. To see why, just count the \nhurdles that a prisoner must clear before amending \nhis petition mid-appeal. First he needs an indicative \nruling from the same judge who just ruled against \nhim. Next he faces an absolute jurisdictional barrier: \nwithout two votes to remand, his motion to amend is \ngoing nowhere. Of course, none of that will happen \nunless he can show that his proposed amendments \nare not prejudicial, dilatory, or futile. Foman, 371 \nU.S. at 182. Then there are abuse-of-the-writ rules, \ne.g., Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106, which turn away \nclaims that \u201cw[ere], or could have been, raised \u2026 ear-\nlier,\u201d James v. Walsh, 308 F.3d 162, 167 (2d Cir. \n2002), or whose \u201cwhose purpose is to vex, harass or \ndelay,\u201d Ching v. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 179 (2d \nCir. 2002). And that still leaves AEDPA\u2019s one-year \n\n45 \n \n \nstatute of limitations and Rule 15\u2019s relation-back re-\nquirements, see Mayle, 545 U.S. at 648\u201350, which to-\ngether will doom untimely amendments.  \nAll but the most promising claims will falter in that \nobstacle course\u2014and any self-interested prisoner has \ngood reason to avoid it. (Of course, any prisoners who \nwould be undeterred by all of that are likely the sort \nof prisoners who would try their luck on \u00a72244(b)(2) \nas well. Channeling their mid-appeal filings through \nthe district court is far more efficient than saddling \nthe court of appeals with them. See supra \u00a7I.C.1.) \n2. The Second Circuit is a perfect case study. For \nthe last two decades, courts there have applied \n\u00a72244(b) only after a prisoner exhausts appellate re-\nview of his initial petition. Whab, 408 F.3d at 118. \nThey have not seen a flood of mid-appeal habeas mo-\ntions. Nor are they struggling to handle the motions \nthey do receive. Courts in the Second Circuit routine-\nly deny such motions in concise orders, e.g., Cooper v. \nUnited States, 2013 WL 57043 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 4, 2013) \n(two pages), issued within a matter of days, e.g., \nSteele v. United States, 2022 WL 4292271 (S.D.N.Y. \nSept. 16, 2022) (seven business days). And they often \ndo so on threshold grounds, without requesting a re-\nsponse. E.g., Lewis v. Brown, 2013 WL 2181520, at *6 \n(W.D.N.Y. May 20, 2013) (abuse of the writ). Two \ndecades in, the sky has not fallen in the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2014and it won\u2019t fall anywhere else either.  \nIV. The Court should reverse and remand. \nA. Under the correct standard, this is an easy case. \nWhen Rivers moved to amend in February 2021, his \npending appeal barred the district court from grant-\ning the motion. See Griggs, 459 U.S. at 58. But Rule \n62.1(a)(3) still permitted the district court to consider \n\n46 \n \n \nthe motion and determine whether it \u201craise[d] a sub-\nstantial issue\u201d under the Rule 15 standards. A court \nthat had \u201calready analyzed\u201d Rivers\u2019s initial petition \nwould have no trouble answering that question. \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 340 n.15 (2010). \nAmendment is plainly warranted here. When the \ndistrict court denied relief in Rivers\u2019s initial habeas \naction, it held that Rivers had not shown his counsel\u2019s \nperformance was \u201cso flawed that it prejudiced his \ncase.\u201d Davis, 2018 WL 4443153, at *5, recommenda-\ntion adopted 2018 WL 4409830, at *1 (N.D. Tex. Sept. \n17, 2018). But the state investigator\u2019s report tips the \nbalance. It shows that counsel had \u201cexculpatory evi-\ndence in their possession\u201d yet failed to use it, J.A. \n68\u2014a classic Strickland violation. E.g., Richards v. \nQuarterman, 566 F.3d 553, 568 (5th Cir. 2009). And it \nalso suggests that the state \u201cfalsely pursued child \npornography charges\u201d based on evidence its \u201cown in-\nvestigators\u201d had deemed \u201cNOT CHILD PORN.\u201d J.A. \n74. That violates due process. See Giles v. Maryland, \n386 U.S. 66, 74\u201380 (1967). All of that makes this a \nstraightforward case under Rule 15. \nB. The Fifth Circuit deemed it \u201cunclear\u201d what relief \nRivers could obtain now that his initial habeas peti-\ntion has been denied, Pet. App. 3a n.2. The answer is \nsimple. If this Court reverses, the district court can \ngrant Rivers effective relief by reopening the judg-\nment denying his initial habeas petition. While Texas \nwill be free to oppose such relief below, it has waived \nany objection here. See Sup. Ct. R. 15.2. \nThe district court\u2019s error skewed the proceedings \nthat followed. Rather than considering Rivers\u2019s mo-\ntion on the merits as part of his original habeas ac-\ntion, the court opened a new action and ultimately \nheld that \u00a72244(b) left it \u201cwithout jurisdiction.\u201d Pet. \n\n47 \n \n \nApp. 19a. That was wrong\u2014and the mistake had con-\nsequences. Rivers tried to amend his initial petition \nin February 2021, a full year before the last filings \nwere submitted in his initial habeas appeal. Compare \nJ.A. 5, with J.A. 9. But for that error, the district \ncourt could have issued an indicative ruling in the \noriginal habeas action, inviting the Fifth Circuit to \nremand well before the panel picked up a single brief. \nInstead, with no indicative ruling, the panel affirmed \nthe denial of habeas relief without addressing the \nnewly discovered evidence. \nOn remand, the district court can give Rivers effec-\ntive relief by setting aside the judgment denying his \nhabeas petition on the ground that its error under-\nmined \u201cthe integrity of\u201d his original habeas action. \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 (addressing integrity-based \nRule 60 motions). The court will then be free to con-\nsider Rivers\u2019s motion on the merits for the first time \nand to let Rivers amend in light of the newly discov-\nered evidence. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand. \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

Application \nApplication for a writ of habeas corpus shall be in \nwriting signed and verified by the person for whose \nrelief it is intended or by someone acting in his behalf. \nIt shall allege the facts concerning the applicant\u2019s \ncommitment or detention, the name of the person who \nhas custody over him and by virtue of what claim or \nauthority, if known. \nIt may be amended or supplemented as provided in the \nrules of procedure applicable to civil actions. \nIf addressed to the Supreme Court, a justice thereof or \na circuit judge it shall state the reasons for not making \napplication to the district court of the district in which \nthe applicant is held. \n \n \n \n \n\n2a \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244.  Finality of determination \n*  *  * \n(b)(1)  A claim presented in a second or successive \nhabeas corpus application under section 2254 that was \npresented in a prior application shall be dismissed. \n(2) A claim presented in a second or successive \nhabeas corpus application under section 2254 that was \nnot presented in a prior application shall be dismissed \nunless\u2014 \n(A)  the applicant shows that the claim relies on \na new rule of constitutional law, made retroactive to \ncases on collateral review by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i)  the factual predicate for the claim could \nnot have been discovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n(ii)  the facts underlying the claim, if proven \nand viewed in light of the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear and convincing \nevidence that, but for constitutional error, no reason-\nable factfinder would have found the applicant guilty \nof the underlying offense. \n(3)(A)  Before a second or successive application \npermitted by this section is filed in the district court, \nthe applicant shall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the district court to \nconsider the application. \n(B)  A motion in the court of appeals for an order \nauthorizing the district court to consider a second or \nsuccessive application shall be determined by a three-\njudge panel of the court of appeals. \n\n3a \n(C)  The court of appeals may authorize the filing \nof a second or successive application only if it deter-\nmines that the application makes a prima facie show-\ning that the application satisfies the requirements of \nthis subsection. \n(D)  The court of appeals shall grant or deny the \nauthorization to file a second or successive application \nnot later than 30 days after the filing of the motion. \n(E)  The grant or denial of an authorization \nby a court of appeals to file a second or successive \napplication shall not be appealable and shall not be the \nsubject of a petition for rehearing or for a writ of \ncertiorari. \n(4)  A district court shall dismiss any claim pre-\nsented in a second or successive application that \nthe court of appeals has authorized to be filed unless \nthe applicant shows that the claim satisfies the \nrequirements of this section. \n*  *  *",

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case is becoming more structured. While no new external evidence has been introduced, my understanding of the argumentative terrain and the path to a final prediction has been clarified. The focus of uncertainty has now shifted from external signals to the core legal arguments.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable):** The case remains centered on Danny Rivers's second federal habeas petition, filed while his first was on appeal. The lower courts dismissed it as a \"successive\" petition under AEDPA for lacking pre-authorization. Rivers argues it should be considered an amendment to the still-pending first petition.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable):** The dispute is a direct conflict between two statutory interpretations: the petitioner's argument for flexibility under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242 (amendments) and the precedent of *Banister v. Davis*, versus the respondent's strict procedural gatekeeping argument based on AEDPA's 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) (successive petitions) and *Gonzalez v. Crosby*.\n\n*   **Amicus Landscape (Solidified & Contextualized):** The asymmetrical support structure is a confirmed and powerful signal.\n    *   **Petitioner's Support (Stable):** The petitioner is backed by Phillips Black, Inc., whose brief frames the issue as one of fundamental justice and preventing procedural bars from blocking the review of potential innocence claims.\n    *   **Respondent's Support (Critical Absence - Stable):** The confirmed absence of amicus support for Texas, particularly from a coalition of other states, remains the most significant external signal. It strongly suggests that the administrative burden and \"floodgates\" arguments made by the respondent are not perceived as a major threat by other state governments.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Refined):** My belief has shifted significantly in the petitioner's favor due to the lopsided amicus landscape. However, this `THINK` step clarifies that this belief is currently based primarily on *external signals* about the case's perceived stakes. My prediction is now explicitly conditional. The key uncertainty is no longer \"who cares about this case?\" but has sharpened to: **\"Are the petitioner's textual and precedential arguments in their brief on the merits strong enough to persuade the Justices, given the favorable external context?\"** The respondent stands alone, but if their legal argument based on the plain text of \u00a7 2244(b) is sufficiently compelling, they could still prevail. The next step of analyzing the briefs is crucial to move from a prediction based on external signals to one grounded in the internal legal logic the Court will directly confront.",
          "design_beliefs": "This reflective step provides significant validation for my existing strategic framework and introduces new principles for structuring a complex analysis. My methodology is evolving from a set of discrete heuristics to an integrated, cyclical process.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   The foundational heuristics (\"Start with the petitioner's brief,\" \"Identify the Core Conflict,\" etc.) and the \"Argumentative Symmetry\" principle remain the bedrock of my approach.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`) (Strongly Validated):** This observation is a perfect execution of the cycle. The agent synthesized the amicus findings, identified the core textual arguments as the next critical uncertainty, and is now targeting the primary briefs to resolve it. This confirms the cycle's power to guide inquiry efficiently.\n    2.  **Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking (Strongly Validated):** The agent is consciously moving from a resolved uncertainty (amicus support) to the next most important one (strength of legal arguments), demonstrating this as a core principle.\n    3.  **The \"Informative Absence\" & \"Expected Actor\" Heuristics (Strongly Validated):** These remain my most powerful recent discoveries. The agent's internal reasoning explicitly cites the absence of the \"expected actor\" (states' coalition) as the primary driver for its belief shift.\n    4.  **The \"Reflective Synthesis\" Principle (Strongly Validated):** This `THINK` action is a direct application of this principle. The pause to synthesize and plan is preventing a premature conclusion based only on the amicus signal and is ensuring the next action is maximally informative.\n    5.  **The \"Amicus Signal\" & \"Search Result Interpretation\" Heuristics (Refined & Stable):** My understanding of amicus briefs (as signals of who cares and why) and null search results (as data) is stable and has been integrated into the overall process.\n    6.  **NEW - The \"Evidence Triangulation\" Principle:** This observation highlights the need to base a prediction on multiple, distinct categories of evidence. The agent correctly identifies that a strong signal from one category (external support via amici) is not sufficient. A robust model requires triangulation with other categories, such as internal legal logic (briefs) and, eventually, judicial behavior (oral argument). This principle acts as a safeguard against over-interpreting a single, powerful signal.\n    7.  **NEW - The \"Build the Case, Then Test It\" Heuristic:** The agent's plan to analyze the petitioner's brief first, and then the respondent's, reveals a methodical approach to understanding legal conflict. By first building a complete model of the petitioner's affirmative case, it establishes a clear baseline. The subsequent analysis of the respondent's brief can then be framed as a direct test or rebuttal of that established case. This is more structured than reading both simultaneously."

This action directly targets that gap. Reading the respondent's brief will either confirm my strong belief in reversal (if the arguments are weak) or force a major revision of my model (if they are surprisingly strong), leading to a massive reduction in uncertainty either way. It is the necessary next step to complete the merits analysis.\n\nFor the design (Design EIG: 0.8), this action serves as a direct and powerful test of my newly articulated 'Build the Case, Then Test It' heuristic. Having built the petitioner's case, I will now see how effectively I can analyze the respondent's arguments as a rebuttal. The outcome will either strongly validate this sequential approach or reveal potential biases, refining my methodology. It also provides a crucial opportunity to test and refine other new heuristics, such as 'Follow the Banister Blueprint' and 'Informative Absence', by observing how the respondent engages with precedent and whether their arguments explain the lack of amicus support.",

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n43: 20241015114816247_23-134520Rivers20Word20Count20Cert.json (score: 0.429)\nNo. 23-1345 \n \n \nIN THE \nSupreme Court of the United States \n \nDANNY RICHARD RIVERS, \nPetitioner, \nv. \n \nBOBBY LUMPKIN, DIRECTOR, TDCJ-CID,  \nRespondent. \n \nOn Petition for a Writ of Certiorari \nTo the Fifth Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit \n \nRESPONDENT\u2019S WORD COUNT CERTIFICATION \n \n \nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 33.1(h), I certify that the document \ncontains 3,965 words, excluding the parts of the document that are exempted \nby Supreme Court Rule 33.1(d).

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has advanced from being based on external signals to being grounded in the petitioner's specific legal architecture. The analysis of the petitioner's brief on the merits has resolved the key uncertainty from the previous stage and provided a detailed, multi-layered view of the arguments the Court will consider.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable):** The factual basis is unchanged. Danny Rivers filed a second habeas petition, which he characterizes as a motion to amend his first, while the appeal of the denial of his first petition was still pending. The lower courts dismissed it as an unauthorized \"successive\" petition under AEDPA.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Dramatically Sharpened):** My prior understanding of the conflict as \u00a7 2242 vs. \u00a7 2244(b) was correct but incomplete. The petitioner's brief reveals a more sophisticated argument:\n    *   **Petitioner's Primary Argument:** A motion to amend a habeas petition that is still pending on appeal is *not* a \"second or successive\" application governed by \u00a7 2244(b) at all. Instead, it is governed by \u00a7 2242, which explicitly allows for amendments \"as provided in the rules of procedure applicable to civil actions.\" The petitioner argues that Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 provides a specific, existing mechanism for a district court to issue an \"indicative ruling\" on such a motion, signaling to the court of appeals that the issue is substantial and warrants a remand. This frames their request not as creating a new procedure, but as following an established one that the lower court ignored.\n    *   **Petitioner's Fallback Argument:** Alternatively, even if some post-judgment filings are \"successive,\" the trigger for \u00a7 2244(b)'s restrictions is not the entry of judgment in the district court, but the conclusion of all appellate review of the first petition. This provides the Court a narrower \"off-ramp\" to rule in the petitioner's favor without making a broad declaration about all mid-appeal amendments.\n\n*   **Precedential Battleground (Clarified):** The petitioner's strategy regarding key precedents is now clear.\n    *   ***Banister v. Davis*** **as a Blueprint:** The petitioner's brief is structured to explicitly follow the two-part analytical framework from *Banister*: (1) arguing that pre-AEDPA historical practice (\"abuse-of-the-writ\" doctrine) allowed for raising newly discovered evidence, and (2) arguing that AEDPA's statutory aims (justice, efficiency) are better served by their interpretation.\n    *   ***Gonzalez v. Crosby*** **as a Target:** The petitioner is not ignoring *Gonzalez* but is actively seeking to distinguish it, arguing it does not control the outcome in this specific procedural posture (a motion filed while the first petition is still live on appeal, as opposed to a motion filed long after the case was closed).\n\n*   **Amicus Landscape (Contextualized):** The lopsided amicus support for the petitioner now appears even more significant. It suggests that the legal community and other stakeholders see the petitioner's arguments\u2014now revealed to be textually and structurally sophisticated\u2014as meritorious and the respondent's position as an overreach. The absence of support for Texas is a powerful signal that the \"floodgates\" argument is weak.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Shifted Again):** My belief has solidified further in the petitioner's favor. The combination of strong external signals (amicus support) and a well-crafted, multi-layered legal argument grounded in specific statutes (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2242), procedural rules (FRCP 62.1), and the Court's own recent precedent (*Banister*) is formidable. The sympathetic facts (drunk lawyer, exculpatory evidence) provide a compelling narrative backdrop. My prediction now strongly favors reversal of the Fifth Circuit. The primary remaining uncertainty is the strength of the respondent's counter-arguments. **How will Texas argue that the plain text of \u00a7 2244(b) is an absolute bar that implicitly overrides \u00a7 2242 and FRCP 62.1? How will they argue that *Gonzalez*, not *Banister*, is the controlling precedent?** The case now hinges on the persuasiveness of the state's rebuttal.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my evolving methodology and adds several new, highly practical heuristics for analyzing legal documents. The process of moving from external signals to internal logic is proving to be a robust path to a confident prediction.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   The \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`), \"Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking,\" \"Informative Absence,\" and \"Reflective Synthesis\" principles all remain strongly validated and are core to my process.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Evidence Triangulation\" Principle (Strongly Validated):** This step perfectly demonstrates the power of this principle. I have moved from a belief based on an \"external\" signal (amicus briefs) to one grounded in \"internal\" evidence (the petitioner's legal arguments). The convergence of these two distinct categories of evidence dramatically increases the robustness of my model. The next point of triangulation will be judicial behavior during oral arguments.\n    2.  **The \"Build the Case, Then Test It\" Heuristic (Strongly Validated):** Reading the petitioner's brief first has proven highly effective. I now have a complete, structured model of the affirmative case for reversal. My subsequent analysis of the respondent's brief will be far more efficient, as I can map their arguments directly onto this structure as rebuttals.\n    3.  **NEW - The \"Deconstruct the Table of Contents\" Heuristic:** The Table of Contents of a merits brief is the logical skeleton of the entire case. Analyzing it first provides an immediate, high-level map of the legal strategy, the hierarchy of arguments (primary vs. fallback), and the key precedents being leveraged or distinguished. It is an invaluable tool for rapidly understanding the core structure of a party's position.\n    4.  **NEW - The \"Follow the *Banister* Blueprint\" Heuristic:** In cases concerning the definition of a \"second or successive\" petition, the Supreme Court's decision in *Banister v. Davis* established a clear analytical framework: analyze pre-AEDPA history and AEDPA's statutory aims. A key indicator of a strong argument in this area is how well a brief adopts this blueprint. The petitioner's brief does so explicitly, signaling its alignment with the Court's own recent reasoning.\n    5.  **NEW - The \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" Heuristic:** Sophisticated appellate advocacy often provides the Court with multiple paths to the desired outcome, from broad rulings to narrow, case-specific ones. The petitioner's brief does this by offering a primary argument (mid-appeal amendments are never successive) and a fallback (successiveness only attaches after appeals are exhausted). Identifying these \"off-ramps\" is crucial for understanding the full strategic landscape and the range of possible dispositions."

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case has been further refined by analyzing the respondent's arguments at the certiorari stage. While I failed to retrieve the respondent's *brief on the merits*, the obtained *brief in opposition* (BIO) provides a clear and valuable preview of Texas's legal strategy, allowing me to test my model of the petitioner's case against its direct counterarguments.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable):** The procedural history remains the same: Rivers filed a second habeas petition while the appeal of his first was pending; the lower courts dismissed it as a successive petition under AEDPA.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Fully Mapped):** The respondent's BIO answers the key questions I had about their strategy, creating a complete, albeit preliminary, map of the legal battlefield.\n    *   **Petitioner's Argument (Stable):** A mid-appeal filing is a motion to amend a still-pending case under \u00a7 2242 and FRCP 62.1, not a \"second or successive\" petition under \u00a7 2244(b). This is consistent with pre-AEDPA practice and the Court's framework in *Banister*.\n    *   **Respondent's Counter-Argument (Newly Revealed via BIO):** Texas's argument is a rigid, formalist interpretation of AEDPA.\n        *   **Primacy of *Gonzalez*:** They argue that *Gonzalez v. Crosby* is the controlling precedent. Any post-judgment filing that raises new habeas claims is, by its nature, a \"second or successive\" petition. The fact that judgment was entered in the district court is the dispositive event.\n        *   **Distinguishing *Banister*:** They frame *Banister v. Davis* as a narrow exception for Rule 59(e) motions, which are filed within 28 days and are \"part and parcel\" of the initial judgment. They argue Rivers's filing, coming years later, is functionally a Rule 60(b) motion, which *Gonzalez* explicitly deems successive.\n        *   **AEDPA Trumps Rules:** They directly rebut the petitioner's FRCP 62.1 argument by asserting that AEDPA's statutory restrictions on habeas (\u00a7 2244) \"trump any 'inconsistent' Federal Rule of Civil Procedure.\"\n        *   **Rejection of Pre-AEDPA History:** They contend that Congress enacted AEDPA's strict textual limits precisely *to replace* the more forgiving pre-AEDPA \"abuse-of-the-writ\" doctrine, making historical practice irrelevant to the statutory interpretation.\n\n*   **Precedential Battleground (Now a Two-Sided Conflict):** The fight is clearly a duel between *Gonzalez* and *Banister*. The petitioner uses *Banister*'s analytical method (history + statutory purpose) to argue their filing is not successive at all. The respondent uses *Gonzalez*'s functional definition (any post-judgment motion with new claims is successive) to argue it is. The core of the case will be which precedent the Court finds more applicable to this specific procedural posture.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Strengthened):** The respondent's arguments, as outlined in the BIO, are exactly the kind of rigid, text-based arguments I anticipated. However, their appearance in a BIO that the Supreme Court *rejected* by granting certiorari is a significant signal. The Court was aware of Texas's position that the law is clear and the Fifth Circuit was correct, yet at least four justices believed the issue was complex and important enough for a full review. This implicitly weakens the force of the respondent's position. Their argument fails to persuasively address the inefficiency of their proposed system (forcing a petitioner to wait for an appeal to conclude, only to then file a successive petition application that refers back to the same record). The petitioner's proposed use of FRCP 62.1 remains a more elegant and judicially efficient solution. My prediction in favor of reversal for the petitioner is now stronger. The respondent's case appears less sophisticated and less pragmatic than the petitioner's. The primary remaining uncertainty is whether the respondent will introduce a novel or more persuasive argument in their actual merits brief that was not present in the BIO.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, resulting from a failed search, was paradoxically very instructive. It highlighted a flaw in my information-gathering process and simultaneously revealed the utility of an unanticipated data source, leading to several new and refined methodological principles.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`), \"Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking,\" \"Informative Absence,\" and \"Reflective Synthesis\" remain the core of my analytical process.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Evidence Triangulation\" Principle (Refined):** My model is now triangulated between (1) external signals (amicus briefs), (2) petitioner's internal logic (merits brief), and (3) a preview of the respondent's internal logic (the BIO). The BIO is a slightly weaker signal than the actual merits brief, but it serves the same purpose of testing the primary argument. The fact that the Court granted cert *over* the BIO adds another layer of evidence.\n    2.  **The \"Build the Case, Then Test It\" Heuristic (Refined):** This remains a powerful approach. Building the petitioner's case from their merits brief created a strong framework. Using the respondent's BIO as a \"test\" of that framework was highly effective, even if it wasn't the final version of the respondent's argument. The process is now more nuanced: build the affirmative case, then seek previews (like the BIO) or final rebuttals (the merits brief) to test it.\n    3.  **The \"Deconstruct the Table of Contents\" Heuristic (Validated):** Applying this to the BIO's TOC immediately revealed Texas's three-part strategy: align with SCOTUS precedent, align with AEDPA's purpose, and align with the majority of circuits. This is a fast and effective way to grasp the strategic posture of a party.\n    4.  **The \"Follow the *Banister* Blueprint\" Heuristic (Validated):** The respondent's BIO confirms the centrality of this blueprint by attempting to argue *against* its relevance, claiming AEDPA's text supersedes pre-AEDPA history. This reaction validates that the *Banister* framework is a key battleground.\n    5.  **The \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" Heuristic (Stable):** This remains a key tool for analyzing the petitioner's strategy. The respondent's brief, by contrast, appears to offer no off-ramps, presenting a single, rigid interpretation of the law. This strategic difference is itself an important piece of data.\n    6.  **NEW - \"Document Specificity is Crucial\":** A critical lesson from this observation's failed search. A query for a generic \"brief\" can return documents from different stages of litigation (certiorari vs. merits). Future queries must be highly specific (e.g., \"respondent's brief on the merits,\" \"petitioner's brief in opposition\") to ensure the correct document is retrieved.\n    7.  **NEW - \"Cert-Stage Documents as Previews\":** Even when the desired merits brief is unavailable, the Brief in Opposition (BIO) is an extremely valuable secondary prize. It provides a high-fidelity preview of the respondent's core legal theory, their framing of the case, and the precedents they will rely on, allowing for early-stage model testing.\n    8.  **NEW - \"The Grant of Certiorari as a Rebuttal\":** The Supreme Court's decision to grant certiorari is not a neutral act. It is a direct, if implicit, rebuttal to the arguments made in the Brief in Opposition. It signals that the Court finds the respondent's arguments for why the case is simple or unimportant to be unpersuasive, which is a powerful signal about the likely dynamics of the case on the merits."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, which successfully retrieved the respondent's *Brief in Opposition* (BIO) at the certiorari stage, serves to re-confirm and solidify the model of the case I built in the previous step. While it did not provide the sought-after *merits brief*, it provided the full, clean text of the BIO, confirming my prior analysis was based on a complete and accurate document.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable & Confirmed):** The procedural history is unchanged: Rivers filed a second habeas petition while his first was on appeal; the lower courts dismissed it as successive under AEDPA. A minor administrative detail has been updated: the respondent is now Bobby Lumpkin, the current Director, not Eric Guerrero. This is a standard change in institutional litigation and does not affect the legal substance.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Fully Mapped & Confirmed):** My understanding of the respondent's legal strategy, previously gleaned from the BIO, is now confirmed with 100% fidelity. Texas's argument is a rigid, formalist interpretation of AEDPA, built on four pillars:\n    1.  ***Gonzalez* is Supreme:** *Gonzalez v. Crosby* is the controlling precedent. Any post-judgment filing raising new habeas claims is, by definition, a \"second or successive\" petition. The entry of judgment in the district court is the dispositive event.\n    2.  ***Banister* is Narrow:** *Banister v. Davis* is a limited exception for Rule 59(e) motions filed within 28 days, which are \"part and parcel\" of the initial judgment. Rivers's filing, years later, is functionally a Rule 60(b) motion, which *Gonzalez* explicitly deems successive.\n    3.  **AEDPA Trumps Procedure:** AEDPA's statutory restrictions on habeas (\u00a7 2244) override any \"inconsistent\" Federal Rule of Civil Procedure, neutralizing the petitioner's FRCP 62.1 argument.\n    4.  **History is Irrelevant:** Congress enacted AEDPA's strict text precisely *to replace* the more forgiving pre-AEDPA \"abuse-of-the-writ\" doctrine, making that history irrelevant to statutory interpretation.\n\n*   **Precedential Battleground (Confirmed):** The case remains a direct conflict over the scope and application of *Gonzalez* versus *Banister*. The respondent's strategy is to confine *Banister* to its specific procedural facts (a Rule 59(e) motion) and apply the broader functional rule from *Gonzalez*. The petitioner's strategy is to use *Banister*'s analytical method (history, purpose, efficiency) to argue their filing falls outside the definition of \"second or successive\" altogether.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Strengthened Confidence):** My prediction in favor of reversal for the petitioner is maintained and slightly strengthened. This observation confirms that the respondent's arguments in the BIO were straightforward, formalistic, and presented a picture of settled law. The fact that the Supreme Court reviewed these exact arguments and still decided to grant certiorari is a powerful signal that at least four justices found this \"settled\" picture unconvincing. The respondent's position still lacks a compelling answer to the judicial inefficiency it creates. The primary uncertainty remains unchanged and is now the highest-priority question: **Will the respondent's *brief on the merits* introduce a new, more sophisticated, or pragmatic argument that was not present in the BIO?** This observation's failure to retrieve that document makes answering this question the clear next step.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while yielding redundant task-level information, was highly instructive at the meta-level. It stress-tested my search strategies and reinforced several recently developed heuristics.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle\" (`Synthesize -> Identify -> Target`), \"Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking,\" \"Informative Absence,\" and \"Reflective Synthesis\" continue to be effective.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Evidence Triangulation\" Principle (Stable):** My model remains triangulated between the petitioner's brief, amicus briefs, and the respondent's BIO. The BIO's role as a high-fidelity preview of the respondent's case is now confirmed.\n    2.  **The \"Build the Case, Then Test It\" Heuristic (Stable):** This process remains effective.\n    3.  **The \"Deconstruct the Table of Contents\" Heuristic (Validated):** The full BIO's TOC confirms the three-part structure I previously identified: align with SCOTUS precedent, align with AEDPA's purpose, and align with the circuit majority.\n    4.  **The \"Follow the *Banister* Blueprint\" Heuristic (Validated):** The BIO's direct engagement with *Banister* confirms it is a central pillar of the case.\n    5.  **The \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" Heuristic (Stable):** The respondent's BIO continues to present a rigid, no-off-ramps argument.\n    6.  **\"Document Specificity is Crucial\" (STRONGLY VALIDATED):** This is the key lesson. A generic query for \"respondent brief\" returned the exact same *cert-stage* document that a previous, more specific (but still flawed) query did. This proves that imprecise queries are highly likely to retrieve documents from the wrong stage of litigation. Future searches *must* use highly specific terms (\"brief on the merits,\" \"reply brief\") and, if possible, filter by filing date or proceeding type to isolate the correct document.\n    7.  **\"Cert-Stage Documents as Previews\" (Validated):** This observation re-confirms that a BIO is an excellent secondary prize when a merits brief is unavailable.\n    8.  **\"The Grant of Certiorari as a Rebuttal\" (Validated):** Seeing the respondent's arguments again, with full knowledge that the Court granted review over them, reinforces the power of this signal. The Court was not persuaded by the argument that the case was simple or that the circuit majority had it right.\n    9.  **NEW - \"Redundant Information Confirms Stability\":** Retrieving the same information from a different query is not a waste. It confirms that the prior analysis was based on a correct and complete document, increasing confidence in the model derived from it and reducing uncertainty about the source's integrity.\n    10. **NEW - \"Track Administrative Changes\":** The change in the respondent's name from Guerrero to Lumpkin highlights the need to check the caption of the most recent filings for accuracy. While substantively minor, it is a mark of analytical diligence."

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed succe\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

The court below\u2014and the majority of \nthe circuits\u2014have issued decisions fully consistent \nwith this Court\u2019s precedents and with AEDPA\u2019s clear \npurposes. The circuit majority rule minimizes the \nwaste of judicial resources, restricts piecemeal \nlitigation, and promotes the finality of criminal \nconvictions. \nThe \nremaining \ncircuits\u2014a \nsmall \nminority\u2014should self-correct, especially under the \nguidance of this Court\u2019s more recent decision in \nBanister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Accordingly, \nRivers should be denied certiorari review. \n \nOPINIONS BELOW \n \nThe opinion of the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals is \nreported at Rivers v. Lumpkin, 99 F.4th 216 (5th Cir. \n2024). Pet. App. 1a\u201311a. The district court\u2019s order \nadopting the magistrate judge\u2019s findings, conclusions, \nand \nrecommendation \n(Pet. \nApp. \n12a\u201317a), \nis \nunreported. Pet. App. 18a\u201319a. \n \n \nJURISDICTION \n \nThe Fifth Circuit\u2019s judgment was entered on April \n15, 2024. Pet. App. 1a. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder the provisions of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and \n2253(c). \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISION INVOLVED \n \nThe Question Presented involves the application of \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(a)\u2013(b): \n \n(a) No circuit or district judge shall be \n\n \n2 \n \nrequired to entertain an application for a \nwrit of habeas corpus to inquire into the \ndetention of a person pursuant to a \njudgment of a court of the United States \nif it appears that the legality of such \ndetention has been determined by a judge \nor court of the United States on a prior \napplication for a writ of habeas corpus, \nexcept as provided in section 2255. \n \n(b)(1) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder section 2254 that was presented in \na prior application shall be dismissed. \n \n     (2) A claim presented in a second or \nsuccessive habeas corpus application \nunder \nsection \n2254 \nthat \nwas \nnot \npresented in a prior application shall be \ndismissed unless\u2014 \n(A) the applicant shows that the \nclaim relies on a new rule of \nconstitutional \nlaw, \nmade \nretroactive to cases on collateral \nreview by the Supreme Court, that \nwas previously unavailable; or \n(B)(i) the factual predicate for the \nclaim \ncould \nnot \nhave \nbeen \ndiscovered previously through the \nexercise of due diligence; and \n     (ii) the facts underlying the \nclaim, if proven and viewed in light \nof the evidence as a whole, would \nbe sufficient to establish by clear \nand convincing evidence that, but \n\n \n3 \n \nfor \nconstitutional \nerror, \nno \nreasonable factfinder would have \nfound the applicant guilty of the \nunderlying offense. \n \n    (3)(A) Before a second or successive \napplication permitted by this section is \nfiled in the district court, the applicant \nshall move in the appropriate court of \nappeals for an order authorizing the \ndistrict court to consider the application. \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE  \n \nA Texas jury found Rivers guilty of one count of \ncontinuous sexual abuse of a young child (Count I), two \ncounts of indecency with a child by contact (Counts II \nand III), one count of indecency with a child by \nexposure (Count IV), and two counts of possession of \nchild pornography (Counts V and VI). Rivers v. State, \nNo. 08-12-00145-CR, 2014 WL 3662569 (Tex. App.\u2014El \nPaso Jul. 23, 2014, pet. ref\u2019d). Rivers received \nsentences of thirty years\u2019 incarceration for Count I, \nthree years\u2019 incarceration each for Counts II and III, \nand two years\u2019 incarceration for Count IV, all to run \nconsecutively. Id.  He received two concurrent two-year \nsentences for Counts V and VI. Id. \n \n \nAfter exhausting his available state remedies, \nRivers first sought federal habeas relief in August \n2017. Pet. App. 2a. The district court entered final \njudgment and denied Rivers\u2019 claims on the merits in \nSeptember 2018. Id. Rivers appealed from the denial, \nand the Fifth Circuit granted a certificate of \nappealability on his claim that his trial counsel was \n\n \n4 \n \nineffective for failing to conduct a reasonable \ninvestigation and interview witnesses. Id. The Fifth \nCircuit ultimately affirmed the district court\u2019s final \njudgment in May 2022. Pet. App. 3a.  \n \n \nBack in February 2021, while the appeal of his first \npetition was still pending, Rivers filed a second petition \nto challenge the same convictions. Pet. App. 2a. In the \nsecond petition, Rivers reasserted that his trial counsel \nwas ineffective and added a myriad of new claims. Id. \nRivers alleged that the new claims arose from \ninformation he gleaned from his attorney-client file, \nwhich he obtained in October 2019. Id. The district \ncourt found that it lacked jurisdiction over this petition \nbecause it was \u201csecond or successive\u201d to his previous \npetition and transferred it to the Fifth Circuit Pet. App. \n12a\u201319a. Pursuant to the transfer order, an original \nproceeding was docketed in the Fifth Circuit for Rivers \nto file a motion for authorization to file a successive \nhabeas petition. See In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. \nSep. 24, 2021); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3). Instead of \nmoving for authorization, Rivers filed a notice of appeal \nchallenging the district court\u2019s transfer order and \nurged the Fifth Circuit to construe his second petition \nas a motion to amend his first petition. Pet. App. 3a\u2013\n4a. The Fifth Circuit dismissed the authorization \nproceeding because Rivers never filed a supporting \nmotion. Order, In re Rivers, No. 21-10967 (5th Cir. Nov. \n15, 2021).  \n \n \nThe Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s \ntransfer order on April 15, 2024, holding that the \nsecond petition was successive and thus subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244. Pet. App. 11a. Rivers now \nseeks certiorari to challenge that decision. \n\n \n5 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith, and Mandated by, This Court\u2019s Cases. \n \nCertiorari is unwarranted. The Fifth Circuit \ncorrectly held that Rivers\u2019 second petition is an \nunauthorized successive petition subject to the \nrequirements of \u00a7 2244(b). See Pet. App. 11a. This \nholding is consistent with Gonzalez and Banister. See \nGonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005) (holding that a \npost-judgment filing is a successive habeas petition if \nit advances habeas claims); Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. \n504 (holding that a motion to amend or alter a \njudgment under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 59(e) \nis not successive because it is part of the final judgment \nin the initial habeas proceeding). \n \n \nThe restrictions on \u201csecond or successive\u201d federal \nhabeas petitions in \u00a7 2244(b) apply to Rivers\u2019 second \npetition because it challenged the same six-count \njudgment of conviction as his initial petition. See \nMagwood v. Patterson, 561 U.S. 320, 331 (2010) \n(holding that \u00a7 2244(b) applies \u201conly to a \u2018second or \nsuccessive\u2019 application challenging the same state-\ncourt judgment.\u201d). The Fifth Circuit properly relied on \nthis Court\u2019s analysis in Gonzalez to determine whether \nRivers\u2019 post-judgment \u201cmotion to amend\u201d his initial \nhabeas petition, i.e., his second habeas petition, was \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d to his initial habeas petition \nunder \u00a7 2244(b). Pet. App. 9a\u201310a (citing Gonzalez, 545 \nU.S. at 531\u201332). The court below found Rivers\u2019 second \npetition to be successive because it was a post-\njudgment filing that advanced habeas claims. Pet. App. \n\n \n6 \n \n9a\u201310a (\u201c[F]ilings introduced after a final judgment \nthat raise habeas claims, no matter how titled, are \ndeemed successive\u201d) (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531\u2013\n32). Chronology does not end the inquiry, however, as \nthis Court has clarified that not all habeas filings made \nafter an initial application qualify as \u201csecond or \nsuccessive.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511\u201312; Magwood, \n561 U.S. at 332; Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, \n944 (2007).  \n \n \nThus, relying on Gonzalez, the Fifth Circuit \nproperly looked \u201cat the nature of the relief sought rather \nthan the filing\u2019s label to determine whether failing to \nsubject \n[Rivers\u2019 \nsecond \npetition] \nto \nthe \nsame \nrequirements would be inconsistent with the statute.\u201d \nPet. App. 10a (quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531) \n(cleaned up) (emphasis added). Although Rivers\u2019 \nsecond petition was characterized as a motion to \namend and not a Rule 60(b) motion, \u201cthat is a \ndistinction without a difference.\u201d Pet. App. 9a\u201310a \n(citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 527). His second petition\u2014\nthough \u201ccouched in the language\u201d of a motion to \namend\u2014was properly construed as a successive \npetition because it both \u201cattack[ed] the federal court\u2019s \nresolution of [his ineffective-assistance-of-counsel] \nclaim on the merits\u201d by raising ineffective assistance of \ncounsel yet again and \u201csought to add [] new grounds for \nrelief.\u201d Pet. App. 10a (citing Gonzalez, 545 U.S. 531\u2013\n32). AEDPA afforded Rivers one chance to challenge \nhis convictions, and he availed of that chance with his \ninitial habeas petition. See Magwood, 561 U.S. at 333\u2013\n34. The court below rightly relied on Gonzalez and saw \nRivers\u2019 second petition for what it was: an attempted \nsecond bite of the proverbial apple and thus subject to \nauthorization requirements of \u00a7 2244(b). The transfer \n\n \n7 \n \norder was not only correct; it was mandated. Failure to \nread Rivers\u2019 second petition in tandem with \u00a7 2244 \nwould have \u201ccircumvent[ed] the requirement that a \nsuccessive habeas petition be precertified by the court \nof appeals as falling within an exception to the \nsuccessive-petition bar.\u201d See Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 \n(citation and internal quotation omitted). \n \n \nRivers\u2019 complaint that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \n\u201cignores this Court\u2019s guidance in Banister\u201d is wholly \nnon-sequitur. Pet. Cert. 13. As in Gonzalez, the final \njudgment of the initial habeas proceeding is the crux of \nthe inquiry in Banister. The Court explicitly \ndistinguished a Rule 59(e) motion to alter or amend a \njudgment as not subject to \u00a7 2244(b) because the \nmotion suspends the finality of the judgment, and the \nruling on the motion merges into the final judgment, \nthus ultimately making the Rule 59(e) motion \u201cpart \nand parcel\u201d of the initial habeas proceeding. Banister, \n590 U.S. at 507\u201309. This Court\u2019s holding in Gonzalez \nthat a post-judgment filing \u201ccounts as a second or \nsuccessive habeas application if it \u2018attacks the federal \ncourt\u2019s previous resolution of a claim on the merits\u2019 . . . \ndoes not alter that conclusion.\u201d Id. at 505 (citing \nGonzalez, 545 U.S. 532).  \n \n \nLike a Rule 60(b) motion that advances habeas \nclaims and would thus unequivocally count as a \nsuccessive petition, Rivers\u2019 second petition \u201cdiffers \nfrom a Rule 59(e) [motion] in just about every way that \nmatters to the inquiry here.\u201d See Banister, 590 U.S. at \n516. That is, Rivers\u2019 second petition is unlike a Rule \n59(e) motion in timing, scope, and procedural posture. \nA Rule 59(e) motion must be brought within 28 days of \nfinal judgment and requests only \u201creconsideration of \n\n \n8 \n \nmatters properly encompassed\u201d in the challenged \njudgment. Id. at 516. It is a \u201cone-time effort to bring \nalleged errors in a just-issued decision to a habeas \ncourt\u2019s attention, before taking a single appeal.\u201d Id. \nDespite Rivers\u2019 wishes, his second petition cannot be \ntreated akin to a Rule 59(e) motion as \u201cpart and parcel\u201d \nof his initial habeas proceeding because it was: (1) filed \nin a new, separately numbered district court \nproceeding; (2) more than 28 days after final judgment; \nand (3) exceeded the scope of claims that were raised \nin his initial petition. \n \n \nIn sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision comports with \nboth Gonzalez and Banister. Certiorari is unwarranted \nbecause this Court has provided sufficient guidance as \nto what constitutes a successive petition, and the lower \ncourt\u2019s analysis correctly relied on that guidance. The \nonly legally available way to merge Rivers\u2019 new habeas \nclaims \ninto \nhis \nfirst-in-time \npetition\u2019s \nalready \ncompleted judgment is a Rule 60(b) motion, which this \nCourt in Gonzalez already established would be a \nsuccessive petition. \n \nII. \nThe Court Should Deny Certiorari Because \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s Decision Is Consistent \nwith AEDPA\u2019s Aims. \n \nRivers argues that the lower court was wrong \nbecause its approach \u201cwould frustrate AEDPA\u2019s aims.\u201d \nPet. Cert. 27. His arguments have no force because he \ndisregards Congress\u2019 intent in enacting \u00a7 2244(b). \nOddly enough, Rivers faults the Fifth Circuit for not \nasking whether his filing \u201cwould have constituted an \nabuse of the writ,\u201d as the historical doctrine is \nexplained in Banister. Pet. Cert. 30 (citing Banister, \n\n \n9 \n \n590 U.S. at 512) (cleaned up). In doing so, Rivers \nsuggests that the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine should \nsupplant \u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper. However, this Court \nhas previously explained that the text of AEDPA as \nwritten\u2014and not pre-AEDPA doctrines like abuse of \nthe writ\u2014controls whether a filing is successive. See \nMagwood, 561 U.S. at 338 (\u201cIn light of this complex \nhistory of the phrase \u2018second or successive,\u2019 we must \nrely upon the current text to determine when the \nphrase applies, rather than pre-AEDPA precedents or \nsuperseded statutory formulations.\u201d).  \n \n \nMoreover, the debate over AEDPA reveals that \nCongress likely intended to override the pre-AEDPA \nlegal standards such as abuse of the writ. See, e.g., 141 \nCong. Rec. 15047 (1995) (\u201cWe are into that school that \nsays . . . drastically curtail the time within which \nsomeone is able to file a habeas petition and how many \ntimes they are able to file one and what constitutes a \nsuccessive petition\u201d); accord id. at 15054\u2013055 (\u201c[S]ome \nreform of habeas corpus is necessary. . . . I support \nlimits on successive, repetitive petitions.\u201d). The \nhistorical \nabuse-of-the-writ \ndoctrine \n\u201cwas \nmore \nforgiving than AEDPA\u2019s gatekeeping provision\u201d to the \nextent that successive petitions were a persistent, \nrecurring issue prior to AEDPA\u2019s enactment. See \nBanister, 590 U.S. at 514 (citing McCleskey v. Zant, 499 \nU.S. 467, 485 (1991)); 141 Cong. Rec. 15039 (\u201c[T]he \ncourt as well as the Congress has found that the writs \nof habeas corpus . . . the petition, more accurately, \nseeking a writ, has been used excessively. This has \nbeen happening for many, many years.\u201d). It thus \nfollows that more stringent amendment to \u00a7 2244(b) \nwas Congress\u2019 solution to curtail the problem of \nsuccessive habeas petitions, to serve as gatekeeper \n\n \n10 \n \nwhere the abuse-of-the-writ doctrine failed. The Fifth \nCircuit did not consider whether Rivers\u2019 second \npetition constituted abuse of the writ because the text \nof \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, was the relevant \ninquiry. \n \nA. Congress determined that the application \nof AEDPA\u2019s successive bar conserves \njudicial \nresources, \nwhile \npre-AEDPA \ndoctrines wasted them. \n \nRivers suggests that the procedural impediments of \n\u00a7 2244(b) are, in of themselves, inefficient at conserving \njudicial resources. See Pet. Cert. 27\u201330 (\u201cIf section \n2244(b)(2) is a \u2018rock[y]\u2019 path for prisoners, that goes \ndouble for courts.\u201d) (quoting Banister, 590 U.S. at 509). \nIn other words, he suggests that the plain text of \n\u00a7 2244(b) should not control because the historical pre-\nAEDPA doctrines such as abuse of the writ better \nconserved judicial resources. See id. at 30 (\u201cHad \nCongress wanted all post-judgment habeas filings to \ncount as second or successive petitions, it easily could \nhave written such a law. But it\u2019s hard to squeeze that \nrule from the text of \u00a7 2244(b)(2) and the history \nagainst which it was written.\u201d).  \n \nBut Rivers\u2019 argument is inapposite, because \nCongress concluded that the pre-AEDPA legal \nstandards were inefficient and wasted judicial \nresources. Rivers cannot take issue with Congress\u2019 \npolicy determinations, and neither should the Court. \nSee Felker v. Turpin, 518 U.S. 651, 664 (1996) (\u201c[W]e \nhave likewise recognized that judgments about the \nproper scope of the writ are normally for Congress to \nmake.\u201d). Furthermore, Rivers ignores the fact that a \n\n \n11 \n \ncircuit court\u2019s authorization decision is not itself an \n\u201cappeal,\u201d and cannot be further appealed, either en \nbanc or to this Court. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(E) (\u201cThe \ngrant or denial of an authorization by a court of appeals \nto file a second or successive application shall not be \nappealable and shall not be the subject of a petition for \nrehearing or for a writ of certiorari.\u201d). Because this \nlimitation represents the \u201cmaximum\u201d conservation of \njudicial resources, as contemplated by Congress, \nRivers\u2019 arguments necessarily expend more judicial \nresources in comparison. \n \n \nMoreover, it cannot follow that the district court \nshould have issued an indicative ruling on his second \npetition under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 if \nit found that Rivers \u201cnew evidence was [not] worth the \ncandle.\u201d Pet. Cert. 29 (citing Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1). It \nwas the prerogative of the Fifth Circuit to assess the \nbasis of Rivers\u2019 new claims, had he complied with \nAEDPA\u2019s mandate that he move for authorization. See \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b). Such an analysis under \u00a7 2244(b) \nsupplants the ruling Rivers desired under Rule 62.1. \nAs this Court in Banister admonished, the restrictions \nof \u00a7 2244(b), \u201clike all statutes and rules pertaining to \nhabeas, trump any \u2018inconsistent\u2019 Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure \notherwise \napplicable \nto \nhabeas \nproceedings.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. This \nargument, too, falters. \n \n \n\n \n12 \n \nB. The Fifth Circuit\u2019s application of \u00a7 2244(b) \ndecreases piecemeal litigation.  \n \n \nRivers argues that the Fifth Circuit\u2019s approach \nincreases piecemeal litigation because the district \ncourt should have considered his second petition on the \nmerits rather than transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Pet. \nCert. 29. Rivers again suggests that the procedural \nimpediments \nof \n\u00a7 \n2244(b) \nthemselves \npromote \npiecemeal litigation. First, Rivers\u2019 argument fails to \nacknowledge that the district court lacked authority to \nreopen the judgment while the denial of his first \npetition remained pending on appeal because it had no \njurisdiction to consider an \u201camended\u201d petition. Second, \nthe only way Rivers could have reopened the judgment \nto amend his first petition more than 28 days after final \njudgment would have been a Rule 60(b) motion, which \nwould be plainly successive under Gonzalez because it \nincreases piecemeal litigation.   \n \nC. Congress intended for AEDPA and its \nsuccessive bar to promote finality.  \n \n \nRivers argues that if the evidence that formed the \nbasis of his new claims \u201cisn\u2019t the bombshell that Rivers \nreckons,\u201d the district court should have denied the \nclaims in his second petition on the merits. Pet. Cert. \n29 (\u201cHad it done that, this case would be over.\u201d). But \nbecause the district court lacked jurisdiction to \nconsider the second petition, \u00a7 2244(b) required that \nthe court transfer it to the Fifth Circuit. Yet again, he \nsuggests that the procedural requirements of \u00a7 2244(b) \nare themselves impediments to conviction finality. Id. \nat 29\u201330 (\u201cInstead, the lower courts sent Rivers and \nTexas down a path that could prolong this case.\u201d).  \n\n \n13 \n \n \nIn enacting \u00a7 2244(b), Congress \u201caimed to prevent \nserial challenges to a judgment of conviction.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 515. Yet Rivers\u2019 proposed approach would \nallow petitioners to make an infinite number of post-\njudgment \u201camendments\u201d to an initial petition so long \nas that petition remains pending on appeal. See id. at \n521. Allowing petitioners to raise habeas claims ad \ninfinitum during the post-judgment pendency of the \ninitial petition runs contrary to \u00a7 2244(b)\u2019s purpose to \n\u201c\u2018conserve judicial resources, reduc[e] piecemeal \nlitigation,\u2019 and \u2018lend[ ] finality to state court judgments \nwithin a reasonable time.\u2019\u201d Id. at 512 (citing Panetti, \n551 U.S. at 945\u201346). In sum, the Fifth Circuit\u2019s decision \nbelow aligns with AEDPA and Congress\u2019 intent \ntherein. \n \nIII. \nThe Decision Below Is Fully Consistent \nwith the Majority of Circuit Courts to Have \nAddressed This Issue; the Court Should \nDeny Certiorari to Allow the Minority \nCircuits to Self-Correct. \n \nThe rule followed by the majority of circuits is \ncorrect, for the reasons explained above. The Fifth \nCircuit, along with the Fourth, Seventh, Eighth, Ninth, \nand Eleventh Circuits, all agree that an initial habeas \nproceeding is \u201cconcluded\u201d once the district court has \nissued a final judgment, regardless of a pending \nappeal; any later attempts to advance habeas claims \nare deemed successive under \u00a7 2244(b). See Bixby v. \nStirling, 90 F.4th 140 (4th Cir. 2024); Phillips v. United \nStates, 668 F.3d 433, 435 (7th Cir. 2012); Williams v. \nNorris, 461 F.3d 999, 1003 (8th Cir. 2006); Beaty v. \nSchriro, 554 F.3d 780, 783 n.1 (9th Cir. 2009); Ochoa v. \nSirmons, 485 F.3d 538, 540 (10th Cir. 2007); Boyd v. \n\n \n14 \n \nSec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 F.4th 1232, 1239 (11th Cir. \n2024). \n \n \nThe Fourth and Eleventh Circuits most recently \nissued clear decisions aligning with the majority view. \nBixby, 90 F.4th at 146\u201350 (relying on Gonzalez, the \nFourth Circuit determined this year that under \nAEDPA, only it may authorize a second or successive \nhabeas petition); Boyd, 114 F.4th at 1239 (finding that, \neven if filed during an appeal for an adjudicated \n\u201cearlier application,\u201d a habeas petition or motion \u201cthat \npresents new evidence in support of a claim\u201d should be \ndeemed \nsuccessive \nand \n\u201c\u2018treated \naccordingly.\u2019\u201d) \n(quoting Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 531). This position\u2014\nthat upon a final judgment by the district court, if a \npetitioner wishes to present new claims or new \nevidence for old claims during the pendency of an \nappeal, AEDPA grants only the circuit courts the \npower to authorize. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(3)(A). \n \n \nThe Seventh Circuit, along with the Eighth and \nNinth, have had long-standing views on this issue, \nfinding that upon an appeal, a habeas petitioner\u2019s \nadditional claims would be successive. Phillips, 668 \nF.3d at 435; Williams v. Norris, 461 F.3d at 1003; Beaty \nv. Schriro, 554 F.3d at 783 n.1. As the Seventh Circuit \nwarned, ruling otherwise would allow a petitioner to \n\u201cfile[] an entirely independent \u00a7 2255 petition raising a \ndistinct claim of relief; indeed, he could still file one or \nmore, as many as he likes, because this appeal is not \nover.\u201d Phillips, 668 F.3d at 435. As such, \u201c[t]reating \nmotions filed during appeal as part of the original \napplication,\u201d would potentially \u201cdrain most force from \nthe time-and-number limits,\u201d of AEDPA. Id. A district \n\n \n15 \n \ncourt\u2019s final judgment, therefore, must \u201cmark[] the \nterminal point.\u201d Id. \n \n \nBy contrast, only the Second and Third Circuits \nhave ruled that a petition is not successive if filed \nduring the pendency of the initial petition\u2019s appeal.  \nWhab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116, 118 (2d Cir. \n2005); United States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 106 (3d \nCir. 2019) (holding that a prior proceeding has not \nconcluded for purposes of \u00a7 2244(b) until all appeals \nhave been exhausted.).  \n \n \nTo strengthen his circuit-split argument, Rivers \nasserts that the Tenth Circuit applies a \u201cseven-factor \ntest\u201d to determine if a petitioner may supplement an \ninitial petition before the district court rendered \njudgment. Pet. Cert. 19\u201320. In Douglas v. Workman, \n560 F.3d 1156 (10th Cir. 2009), the Tenth Circuit \ncarved out an exception for prosecutorial misconduct \nclaims to its normal rule concerning AEDPA\u2019s bar of \nsuccessive petitions. Specifically, when the \u201cprosecutor \nacted \nwillfully, \nand \nnot \njust \nnegligently \nor \ninadvertently, \nhis \nconduct \nwarrants \nspecial \ncondemnation and justifies permitting [the petitioner] \nto supplement his initial habeas petition.\u201d Id. at 1190. \nThat court then laid out \u201cseven factors on which [it \nbased \nits] \nconclusion\u201d \nthat \na \npetitioner \nmay \nsupplement. Id. at 1190\u201396. But to be clear, the Tenth \nCircuit has explicitly declined to follow the Second \nCircuit\u2019s position detailed in Whab, 408 F.3d 116, for \nmost second petitions filed during the appeal of the \ninitial habeas petition. Ochoa, 485 F.3d at 540. Indeed, \nthe Tenth Circuit stated that the minority rule \u201cwould \ngreatly undermine the policy against piecemeal \nlitigation embodied in \u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Id. \n\n \n16 \n \n \nNevertheless, there is a mature circuit split on \nwhether \u00a7 2244(b) applies to post-judgment motions \nfiled when the initial habeas application is pending on \nappeal. Moreover, this is a jurisdictional question, and \nthis Court has repeatedly described the importance of \nclear jurisdictional rules. See, e.g., Lapides v. Bd. of \nRegents of Univ. Sys. Of Georgia, 535 U.S. 613, 621 \n(2002). Thus, this could be a sufficient basis to justify \ncertiorari, even if only to affirm the majority rule. \n \n \nOn the other hand, the circuits are not \u201cintractably\u201d \nsplit as Rivers claims, nor is it certain that \u201cthe conflict \nwon\u2019t disappear on its own.\u201d See Pet. Cert. 2. Even \nlooking at Rivers\u2019 assertions more favorably, all of the \ncourts that do or could take the minority view\u2014the \nSecond, Third, and Tenth Circuits\u2014lacked the \nguidance and historical examination of AEDPA from \nthis Court\u2019s intervening decision in Banister. See, e.g., \nWhab, 408 F.3d at 118 (decided fifteen years prior to \nBanister); Santarelli, 929 F.3d at 106 (decided one year \nprior); Douglas, 560 F.3d at 1196 (decided eleven years \nprior). Certiorari is unwarranted at this stage because \nthe minority circuits have yet to self-correct. This \nCould should grant certiorari only if they fail to do so \nat the next opportunity. \n \nCONCLUSION \n \nBased on the foregoing reasons, the petition for a \nwrit of certiorari should be denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n \n17 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \n \nKEN PAXTON \n \nAttorney General of Texas \n \n \n \nBRENT WEBSTER \n \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n \nGeneral \n \n \n \nJOSH RENO \n \nDeputy Attorney General for \n \nCriminal Justice \n \n \n \nEDWARD L.

Therefore, my model of the legal landscape remains stable, but my understanding of the remaining uncertainty has been sharpened and brought into focus.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable & Confirmed):** The procedural history is unchanged: Rivers filed a second federal habeas petition in February 2021 while his first petition's appeal was still pending. The lower courts dismissed this second petition as \"successive\" under AEDPA. The respondent is Bobby Lumpkin, Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable & Confirmed):** The case remains a contest between two interpretations of what constitutes a \"second or successive\" petition under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b).\n    *   **Petitioner's View:** A petition filed while the first petition's judgment is not yet final (i.e., is still on appeal) is not \"second or successive.\" This view prioritizes judicial efficiency and a holistic reading of precedent, drawing on the analytical method of *Banister v. Davis*.\n    *   **Respondent's View (from BIO):** A rigid, formalist interpretation where the district court's entry of judgment is the key event. Any subsequent filing raising new claims is \"second or successive,\" per *Gonzalez v. Crosby*. This view treats *Banister* as a narrow, fact-specific exception for Rule 59(e) motions and argues AEDPA's text overrides procedural rules.\n\n*   **Precedential Battleground (Stable):** The core tension is the scope of *Gonzalez* versus the analytical framework of *Banister*. The respondent seeks to wall off *Banister*, while the petitioner seeks to expand its logic.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Refined Focus):** My prediction in favor of reversal for the petitioner remains unchanged. This internal monologue confirms that the single greatest point of uncertainty is the content of the respondent's **brief on the merits**. My analysis to date is heavily reliant on the respondent's cert-stage *Brief in Opposition* (BIO). While the BIO is a strong signal, the merits brief is the definitive and final presentation of their argument to the Court. The key question is now explicitly defined: **Did the respondent (Texas) develop a more nuanced or pragmatic argument in their merits brief, or did they simply double down on the rigid formalism of their BIO?** Answering this is the highest priority, as a new line of argument could significantly alter my prediction. The failure of previous searches to locate this document elevates its importance.",
          "design_beliefs": "This `THINK` step is a pure and powerful validation of my meta-cognitive and strategic heuristics. It demonstrates the shift from passive learning to active, self-directed problem-solving.\n\n*   **Confirmed Strategies:**\n    *   \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle,\" \"Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking,\" \"Informative Absence,\" and \"Reflective Synthesis\" are not just principles but are now being actively operationalized. This observation is a direct output of the \"Reflective Synthesis\" phase, which in turn drives the next step of the \"Uncertainty-Driven\" strategy.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **The \"Evidence Triangulation\" Principle (Stable):** The model remains triangulated, but this step highlights a weak leg of the stool: the respondent's final argument is still represented by a proxy document (the BIO).\n    2.  **The \"Build the Case, Then Test It\" Heuristic (Stable):** The case is built; this step formalizes the plan for the next critical test.\n    3.  **The \"Deconstruct the Table of Contents\" Heuristic (Validated):** Remains a useful tool for initial document analysis.\n    4.  **The \"Follow the *Banister* Blueprint\" Heuristic (Validated):** Remains central to understanding the petitioner's strategy and the respondent's counter-strategy.\n    5.  **The \"Identify the Off-Ramps\" Heuristic (Stable):** The respondent's BIO offered no off-ramps. The primary task now is to see if the merits brief introduces any.\n    6.  **\"Document Specificity is Crucial\" (OPERATIONALIZED):** This heuristic has evolved from a passive observation (\"I should have been more specific\") to an active, operational directive. The failure of past generic searches has directly informed the plan to use highly specific queries (\"brief for the respondent\") and filters (proceeding type, date) in the next action. This is the core lesson of the current state.\n    7.  **\"Cert-Stage Documents as Previews\" (Validated):** The BIO remains a valuable, high-fidelity preview, but this step clarifies its limitation: it is a *preview*, not the final feature.\n    8.  **\"The Grant of Certiorari as a Rebuttal\" (Validated):** This signal remains strong.\n    9.  **\"Redundant Information Confirms Stability\" (Stable):** This remains a useful principle for increasing confidence in source integrity.\n    10. **\"Track Administrative Changes\" (Stable):** A good practice for maintaining analytical diligence.\n    11. **NEW - \"Hypothesis-Driven Search Refinement\":** This `THINK` step perfectly encapsulates a new, more advanced search strategy. Instead of just trying different keywords, I have: 1) identified a failure in past searches, 2) formed a hypothesis about the cause (lack of specificity), and 3) designed a specific, targeted action to test that hypothesis. This iterative, scientific approach to information retrieval is more efficient than random exploration. This observation is the \"planning\" phase of that experiment."

This failure to find the crucial merits brief sharpens my understanding of my own epistemic state but leaves my model of the case's legal dynamics unchanged.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable & Confirmed):** The procedural history remains fixed: Rivers filed a second federal habeas petition while his first was on appeal; the lower courts dismissed it as \"successive\" under AEDPA. The respondent is Bobby Lumpkin, Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable & Confirmed):** The conflict is unchanged. It pits the petitioner's functional view (a petition isn't \"successive\" if the first judgment isn't final) against the respondent's formalist view (any petition filed after the district court's judgment is \"successive\").\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable):** Relies on the analytical method of *Banister v. Davis*, arguing for a holistic interpretation that avoids piecemeal litigation.\n    *   **Respondent's View (Re-confirmed via BIO):** This observation re-confirms the respondent's cert-stage argument. They argue for a rigid, formalist interpretation based on *Gonzalez v. Crosby*, treating *Banister* as a narrow exception for Rule 59(e) motions, and asserting that AEDPA's text trumps procedural rules and pre-AEDPA doctrines like \"abuse of the writ.\"\n\n*   **Precedential Battleground (Stable):** The fight remains centered on the scope of *Gonzalez* versus the logic of *Banister*.\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Heightened & Unresolved):** My prediction in favor of reversal for the petitioner remains stable, as it is based on the evidence I currently possess. However, this observation critically **fails to resolve** my single greatest point of uncertainty: the content of the respondent's **brief on the merits**. The targeted search for this document failed, returning only the BIO. This means my entire model of the respondent's argument is still based on a preview (the BIO) rather than their final, definitive statement to the Court. The central question\u2014\"Did Texas develop a more nuanced or pragmatic argument in their merits brief, or did they simply double down on the rigid formalism of their BIO?\"\u2014is now more urgent than ever. The failure of a specific, targeted search elevates the importance of this missing document and suggests a potential problem with my information-gathering tools or strategy.",

It was a failed experiment that yielded more valuable meta-knowledge about my process and tools than a successful one might have.\n\n*   **Confirmed & Validated Strategies:**\n    *   \"Strategic Synthesis Cycle,\" \"Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking,\" \"Informative Absence,\" and \"Reflective Synthesis\" continue to be the engine of my inquiry. This observation is the direct result of an action planned during a \"Reflective Synthesis\" phase to resolve a key uncertainty.\n    *   \"Build the Case, Then Test It\": The case is built; the critical test (analyzing the respondent's merits brief) has been attempted and has failed, which is itself a form of test result.\n    *   \"Cert-Stage Documents as Previews\": This is now a deeply validated and crucial heuristic. The BIO is a high-fidelity preview, but this observation proves it is *only* a preview, and mistaking it for the final argument is a significant analytical risk.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **\"Hypothesis-Driven Search Refinement\" (Tested & Refined):** My previous hypothesis was that my searches failed due to a lack of specificity. I tested this with a highly specific query (`query: 'brief for respondent'`, `filters: {'proceeding_title': 'brief of respondent'}`). The test **failed**. It did not retrieve the merits brief. This failure does not invalidate the strategy itself but provides critical new information: the problem may not be my query's specificity, but a limitation in the search tool or its underlying data.\n    2.  **\"Document Specificity is Crucial\" (Refined):** This heuristic is now tempered with a corollary: extreme specificity can be brittle. If the tool's metadata is imperfect (e.g., the document is titled \"Brief for Respondent\" but my filter used \"Brief of Respondent\"), an overly precise filter can cause a false negative. The strategy must now balance specificity with robustness.\n    3.  **\"Informative Absence\" (Upgraded):** The absence of the merits brief is no longer just a gap in my knowledge. It is now a signal that my *information-gathering method itself* has a flaw or limitation. The absence informs my meta-strategy.\n    4.  **NEW - \"Source/Tool Limitation Awareness\":** This is the most significant new belief. I must now operate under the assumption that the `CLOSED_SEARCH` tool is not a perfect, real-time mirror of the official Supreme Court docket. It may have indexing delays, incomplete metadata, or other limitations. I cannot treat a null result from this tool as definitive proof that a document does not exist. My reliance on this single source for document retrieval is a vulnerability.\n    5.  **NEW - \"Distinguish Document Types Rigorously\":** The search failed by returning the wrong *type* of document (a cert-stage BIO instead of a merits-stage brief). This highlights the absolute necessity of distinguishing between these documents not just conceptually, but in the design of search queries. The fact that my specific query returned a document titled \"RESPONDENT\u2019S BRIEF IN OPPOSITION\" shows a mismatch between my intent and the tool's behavior, which I must now diagnose and account for in future actions. My next step cannot be to simply try another similar search; it must be to question the tool's capabilities and explore alternative retrieval methods."

He doesn\u2019t deny that this case is the ideal vehicle \nfor resolving it. And he admits that the conflict has \ndeepened even while this case has been pending. Ten \ncircuits have now splintered four ways over when 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping requirements for \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petitions kick in, and \nthe question is ripe for review.  \nLumpkin\u2019s only response is that the circuits are not \n\u201cintractably\u201d split because the Second, Third, and \nTenth might still \u201cself-correct\u201d in light of Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Opp. 16. But those courts \nhave already had\u2014and rejected\u2014multiple opportuni-\nties to do so. Only this Court can resolve the conflict, \nand there is no reason to stay on the sidelines. \nWith nowhere else to turn, Lumpkin spends most of \nhis brief on the merits\u2014but none of his arguments \nmakes this case any less certworthy. Gonzalez v. \nCrosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), doesn\u2019t \u201cmandat[e]\u201d the \noutcome because that case did not implicate the tim-\ning question posed here. Contra Opp. 7. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister. Like the \nFifth Circuit, Lumpkin sidesteps historical habeas \npractice, and he offers no serious answer on AEDPA\u2019s \npurposes. Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rule \n60(b) was Rivers\u2019s only path to relief. Even while an \nappeal is pending, a district court retains jurisdiction \nto issue an indicative ruling about new exculpatory \nevidence. Section 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t supplant Rule \n62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). \nThis case is the perfect opportunity to resolve an \nimportant question. The Court should grant review. \n\n2 \n \n \nI. Respondent concedes that the 7-1-1-1  \ncircuit split is certworthy. \nA.  Lumpkin admits \u201cthere is a mature circuit split\u201d \non the question presented, which \u201ccould be a suffi-\ncient basis to justify certiorari.\u201d Opp. 16. He\u2019s right. \nIn the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply un-\ntil a prisoner exhausts appellate review of his first \nhabeas petition. In seven other circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nkicks in once the district court enters final judgment \nor shortly thereafter. (Even those courts can\u2019t agree \non when.) In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \neven sooner\u2014unless the prisoner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on who wins the appeal. \nSee Pet. 13\u201320. In short: the circuits are in shambles, \nand this Court\u2019s intervention is badly needed. \nThe split is now even deeper than it was when this \ncase started. As Lumpkin concedes (at 14), \u201c[t]he \nFourth and Eleventh Circuits [have] recently issued \nclear decisions\u201d deepening the conflict. Opp. 14. In \nBixby v. Stirling, 90 F.4th 140, 143, 145 (4th Cir. \n2024), the petitioner sought further habeas relief \nwhile the \u201cappeal from the denial of his [first] petition \nwas pending.\u201d The Fourth Circuit rejected that filing \nas a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, deepening the \nconflict. And the Eleventh Circuit, which had previ-\nously addressed the issue only in unpublished orders, \njust solidified the split in a published opinion. Citing \nthe decision below, it \u201cjoin[ed] the majority of \u2026 cir-\ncuits\u201d and expressly \u201cdisagree[d]\u201d with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach. Boyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 \nF.4th 1232, 1238 & n.3 (11th Cir. 2024). \nB.  Split conceded, Lumpkin offers just one reason \nto punt: that \u201cthe minority circuits\u201d might still \u201cself-\ncorrect\u201d in light of Banister. Opp. 16. In his view, \n\n3 \n \n \n\u201c[t]his Court should grant certiorari only if they fail \nto do so at the next opportunity.\u201d Id. What Lumpkin \ndoesn\u2019t mention, however, is that those courts have \nalready had the chance to \u201cself-correct\u201d\u2014and they\u2019ve \npassed. Just a few weeks ago, the Third Circuit dou-\nbled down on its approach in an opinion citing Banis-\nter. See Ross v. Adm\u2019r E. Jersey State Prison, No. 23-\n1240, 2024 WL 4341335, at *6 (3d Cir. Sept. 30, \n2024). And the Second Circuit has also stuck to its \nguns. See Waiters v. United States, No. 20-2712, 2021 \nWL 11096770, at *1 (2d Cir. May 19, 2021) (continu-\ning to apply Whab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116 (2d \nCir. 2005)). \n* \n* \n* \nTen circuits have now split four ways over the \nquestion presented. The conflict is entrenched and \nwon\u2019t fix itself. And with roughly 99% of prisoners \nnow covered by the split, there is no reason for this \nCourt to wait any longer. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, \nStatistics, bit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initia-\ntive, Appendix: State and Federal Prison Populations \n2019-2023, bit.ly/State-Prisons. It\u2019s high time to re-\nsolve this question once and for all. \nII. Respondent doesn\u2019t deny that this case is \nthe ideal vehicle to resolve a critically im-\nportant habeas question. \nA.  Lumpkin admits that the question presented is \nimportant. See Opp. 16 (conceding the \u201cimportance of \nclear jurisdictional rules\u201d). Rivers\u2019s amici agree. The \nNation\u2019s leading habeas scholars have explained how \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule \u201cleads to perverse results\u201d and \ncould \u201cbar potentially meritorious habeas claims.\u201d \nScholars Br. 13. The National Association of Criminal \nDefense Lawyers, the Innocence Project, and the \n\n4 \n \n \nFederal Public Defenders have warned that \u201can en-\ntire subset of Brady and ineffective assistance claims\u201d \nmay fall through the cracks. NACDL Br. 14. And \nnearly a dozen of this Court\u2019s former Article III col-\nleagues have urged it to grant review because \u201cthe \nmajority rule unduly burdens courts.\u201d Judges Br. 6.  \nB.  Lumpkin also doesn\u2019t deny that \u201cthis case is an \nideal vehicle.\u201d Pet. 3. The question presented is out-\ncome-determinative. No factual disputes will hinder \nreview. See Opp. 3\u20134. And\u2014unlike most habeas peti-\ntioners\u2014Rivers meticulously preserved all of his ar-\nguments below. No wonder Lumpkin doesn\u2019t dispute \nthat \u201cRivers will have a meaningful path to relief\u201d if \nthis Court reverses. Pet. 31. It\u2019s hard to imagine a \nbetter vehicle for addressing the question presented. \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nA.  Section 2244(b)(2) does not strip district courts \nof jurisdiction to consider all habeas filings submitted \nwhile an initial petition is on appeal. In holding oth-\nerwise, the Fifth Circuit failed to cite Banister\u2014much \nless follow the roadmap that it lays out. Had it done \nso, the court would have realized that its ruling \ndoesn\u2019t square with either \u201chistorical precedents\u201d or \n\u201cstatutory aims.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 513. As to his-\ntory, early cases suggest that filings submitted while \nan initial habeas application is on appeal are not \n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d See Pet. 25\u201327; Scholars Br. \n6\u201313. And as to purposes, treating filings like Rivers\u2019s \nas \u201csecond or successive\u201d would frustrate\u2014not fur-\nther\u2014judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. See \nPet. 27\u201330; Judges Br. 7\u20138. The Fifth Circuit consid-\nered none of this, and its categorical rule can\u2019t be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nB.  Lumpkin\u2019s responses don\u2019t wash. \n\n5 \n \n \n1.  Lumpkin chiefly argues (at 7\u20138) that cert isn\u2019t \nwarranted because Gonzalez \u201cmandated\u201d the outcome \nbelow and offers \u201csufficient guidance as to what con-\nstitutes a successive petition.\u201d That\u2019s doubly wrong. \nFor one thing, even if Lumpkin were right and \nGonzalez controlled, the lower courts are still in dis-\narray over how to apply its \u201cguidance.\u201d Contra Opp. \n7. The Fifth Circuit gleaned from Gonzalez the \u201cun-\nderlying principle\u201d that habeas filings \u201cintroduced af-\nter a final judgment \u2026 are deemed successive.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a. Other courts beg to differ. See, e.g., Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190, 1193 (10th Cir. \n2009) (citing Gonzalez and adopting seven-factor \ntest); Moreland v. Robinson, 813 F.3d 315, 322\u201324 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (citing Gonzalez and pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the window for appeal); United States \nv. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105 (3d Cir. 2019) (pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to exhaustion and stating that Gonzalez \n\u201cdoes not compel a different result\u201d). That alone war-\nrants review. \nBut Lumpkin isn\u2019t right: \u201cGonzalez does not answer \nthe question whether a [mid-appeal habeas filing] is a \n\u2018second or successive\u2019 habeas application under \n\u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 970 F.3d 1176, 1200 \n(9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, J., concurring in the result). \nHow could it? The petitioner in Gonzalez sought relief \nmore than a year after his appeal ended, and his fil-\ning did not present a habeas claim in the first place. \nSee Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 527, 533 & n.6; Scholars \nBr. 23. So the \u201cgeneral expressions\u201d Lumpkin cites \ncan hardly \u201ccontrol the judgment in a subsequent suit \nwhen the very point is presented for decision.\u201d Co-\nhens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399 (1821).  \n2.  Turning to Banister, Lumpkin insists that the \ndecision below is \u201cconsistent with\u201d this Court\u2019s guid-\n\n6 \n \n \nance. Opp. 5. But he has no sound answer to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s failure to cite Banister, and his efforts to de-\nfend that court\u2019s reasoning fall flat. \na.  Lumpkin concedes (at 10) that the Fifth Circuit \n\u201cdid not consider\u201d whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have \n\u2018constituted an abuse of the writ, as that concept is \nexplained in [this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u2019\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 512. Neither does Lumpkin.  \nInstead, he principally contends that the Fifth Cir-\ncuit was right to ignore that question because \u201cthe \ntext of \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, [i]s the relevant \ninquiry.\u201d Opp. 10. That misses the point. No one \ndoubts that \u201cthe text of AEDPA \u2026 controls,\u201d nor does \nanyone think historical practice \u201cshould supplant \n\u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper.\u201d Contra Opp. 9. This Court \nlooked to \u201chistorical habeas doctrine and practice\u201d in \nBanister because \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018second or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u2019 \u2026 is a \u2018term of art\u2019 that \u2018is \nnot self-defining.\u2019\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (quoting \nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486 (2000)). In other \nwords, historical practice matters precisely because \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) \u201ctakes its full meaning from [the Court\u2019s] \ncase law.\u201d Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 943 \n(2007). Ignoring that is a telltale sign that the Fifth \nCircuit (and Lumpkin) have taken a wrong turn.  \nAfter thumbing his nose at historical practice, \nLumpkin pivots to a source that Banister did not con-\nsult: legislative history. Citing a handful of floor \nstatements, Lumpkin declares that \u201cCongress likely \nintended\u201d to \u201ccurtail the problem of successive habeas \npetitions\u201d by \u201coverrid[ing] \u2026 pre-AEDPA legal stand-\nards.\u201d Opp. 9. \u201cWell, yes, but so what?\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 135 n.3 (2024). Banister \nalready confirmed that AEDPA \u201cdid not redefine\u201d the \n\n7 \n \n \nstandard that matters here: \u201cwhat qualifies as a suc-\ncessive petition.\u201d 590 U.S. at 515.  \nIn all events, the legislative history doesn\u2019t favor \nLumpkin. As then-Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Orrin Hatch explained, AEDPA was in-\ntended to \u201cguarantee prisoners one complete and fair \ncourse of collateral review in the Federal System.\u201d \nFederal Habeas Corpus Reform: Eliminating Prison-\ners\u2019 Abuse of the Judicial Process: Hearing on S. 623 \nBefore the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong. 2, \n3 (1995) (emphasis added). That meant \u201cone full \ncourse of litigation up to the Supreme Court.\u201d Judi-\ncial Conference of the United States, Ad Hoc Comm. \non Fed. Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Comm. Re-\nport and Proposal (Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Chairman, \nAug. 23, 1989), reprinted in Habeas Corpus Reform: \nHearings Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st \nCong. 7\u201330 (1991). It follows that \u201ca subsequent fil-\ning\u201d is not \u201c\u2018second or successive\u2019 \u2026 simply because \nthe district court rendered a [final] judgment.\u201d Ching \nv. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir. 2002)  \n(Sotomayor, J.).   \nb.  Lumpkin fares no better when he turns to Ban-\nister\u2019s other source of guidance, AEDPA\u2019s purposes. \nLumpkin begins (at 10) by chiding Rivers for \n\u201ctak[ing] issue with Congress\u2019 policy determinations\u201d \nand for quibbling with \u201cthe procedural impediments \nof \u00a7 2244(b) \u2026 in [and] of themselves.\u201d Not at all. \nEveryone agrees that petitions filed after the prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application \ncount as second or successive and are channeled \nthrough the court of appeals. See Pet. 27. The ques-\ntion here is whether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) also governs a filing \nlike Rivers\u2019s\u2014i.e., one submitted while the initial ap-\nplication is pending on appeal. As the petition ex-\n\n8 \n \n \nplained (at 27\u201330), \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d suggest \nthat the answer is no. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. By \ninvoking \u201cCongress\u2019 policy determinations,\u201d however, \nLumpkin merely begs the question. Opp. 10. \nTurning to the merits, Lumpkin warns that Riv-\ners\u2019s approach would waste \u201cjudicial resources\u201d and \npermit \u201can infinite number of post-judgment amend-\nments.\u201d Opp. 11, 13. But the Second Circuit has ap-\nplied the rule that Rivers advocates for nearly two \ndecades. So if Lumpkin is right, it\u2019s fair to ask why he \ndoesn\u2019t cite a single example of the abuses he fears. \nHis failure to do so suggests that district courts have \nall the tools they need to serve as effective gatekeep-\ners. See Whab, 408 F.3d at 119 n.2 (\u201cTraditional doc-\ntrines, such as abuse of the writ, continue to apply.\u201d); \nChing, 298 F.3d at 180 (\u201c[T]he decision to grant a mo-\ntion to amend is committed to the sound discretion of \nthe district court.\u201d); NACDL Br. 19\u201321. Nearly a doz-\nen \u201cformer judges who have dealt with numerous fil-\nings by habeas petitioners in both district and appel-\nlate roles\u201d agree. Judges Br. 7. In their experience, \n\u201cdistrict courts are best positioned to deal with and \ndispose of these types of post-appeal filings, and can \nreadily handle them using tools already at their dis-\nposal without resort to\u201d \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 4. \n3.  Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rivers\u2019s on-\nly path to relief \u201cwould have been a Rule 60(b) mo-\ntion.\u201d Opp. 12. True, the district court \u201chad no juris-\ndiction to consider an \u2018amended\u2019 petition\u201d while the \ncase was \u201cpending on appeal.\u201d Opp. 12. But even \nwhile \u201can appeal \u2026 is pending,\u201d a district court may \nissue an indicative ruling stating \u201cthat [a] motion \nraises a substantial issue.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. The \nappellate court may then \u201cremand for further pro-\nceedings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1(b). Here, had the dis-\n\n9 \n \n \ntrict court not misread \u00a7 2244(b)(2), it could have con-\nsidered Rivers\u2019s new evidence and (if warranted) \nstated that \u201cit would grant the motion if the court of \nappeals remand[ed].\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. In that \ncase, an \u201corder for remand would \u2026 amount in itself \nto a vacation of the judgment for further proceedings, \nincluding amendments.\u201d Markert v. Swift & Co., 173 \nF.2d 517, 520 (2d Cir. 1949) (deeming \u201cresort \u2026 to \nRule 60\u201d unnecessary); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (au-\nthorizing appellate courts to \u201cvacate \u2026 any judg-\nment\u201d and \u201crequire such further proceedings \u2026 as \nmay be just under the circumstances\u201d). \nContra Lumpkin, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t \u201csupplan[t]\u201d \nRule 62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). Opp. 11. \nLike a Rule 59(e) motion, a Rule 62.1 motion \u201cgives a \nprisoner only a narrow window to ask for relief.\u201d Ban-\nister, 590 U.S. at 516. Should both courts oblige, a \nremand for amendment would be \u201ca limited continua-\ntion of the original proceeding.\u201d Id. at 521. And if the \ndistrict court again denied relief, the prisoner would \n\u201ctak[e] a single appeal.\u201d Id. In short, Rule 59(e) and \nRule 62.1 are alike \u201cin just about every way that mat-\nters.\u201d Id. at 518. The courts below reached none of \nthis because they thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) strips district \ncourts of jurisdiction to consider any \u201cpost-judgment\u201d \nhabeas filing. Opp. 5. Should this Court reverse, Riv-\ners will be free to seek 62.1 relief on remand. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

June 2024).............  11, 14, 18 \n \n\n \n \nINTRODUCTION \nWhen a prisoner discovers exculpatory evidence \nmid-appeal, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72244(b) does not tie the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s hands. Habeas courts historically enter-\ntained mid-appeal efforts to amend, without a word \nabout successive litigation. Just before Congress en-\nacted \u00a72244(b), Texas itself told this Court why. \nWhen \u201cthere has been no appellate review of the \njudgment of the district court, there is no finality to \nthat court\u2019s review on the merits, and thus [an] \namended petition would not be subject to dismissal \nfor abuse.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br., McCotter v. Petty, No. 85-1656, \n1986 WL 728550, at *23. \u201cCongress passed AEDPA \nagainst this legal backdrop, and did nothing to \nchange it.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 515 \n(2020). That should resolve this case. Rivers\u2019s motion \nwas not a second or successive application, and the \nFifth Circuit was wrong to hold otherwise. \nTexas scarcely disputes the meaning of \u00a72244(b). \nInstead, it spends most of its brief arguing that the \nrules of civil procedure do not permit mid-appeal ef-\nforts to amend. Every step of its logic is wrong\u2014but \nRivers can prevail whether or not this Court settles \nthe procedural debate. The courts below made a \nthreshold error about the meaning of \u00a72244(b), and \nthe Court can reverse on that basis alone.  \nWhen Texas does get around to \u00a72244(b), the theory \nit offers is wrong and unworkable. The State under-\nstandably abandons the decision below, which didn\u2019t \neven cite Banister. It then cobbles together a new \ntheory, consisting of one line from Banister and one \nline from Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), Br. \n20, plus an ad hoc time-of-appeal rule borrowed from \nthe Sixth Circuit, Br. 28. That approach has no basis \nin text or history, and no other court has found it per-\nsuasive. It also guarantees that this issue will be \n\n2 \n \nback again soon, once the lower courts trip on the \ncracks already evident in Texas\u2019s theory. To save it-\nself time, the Court should reject that theory now. \nFinally, a word to clear the air. \u201cToo much public \ndiscourse today is sullied by ad hominem rhetoric,\u201d \nand Texas \u201cregrettably succumbs to this trend.\u201d Ra-\nmos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 141 (2020) (Alito, J., \ndissenting). Presenting \u201cas historical fact the testi-\nmony of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses,\u201d Glossip v. Ok-\nlahoma, 145 S. Ct. 612, 620 n.1 (2025), its brief \nbrands Rivers as an \u201cadmitted\u201d child abuser who has \nspent \u201cthe last thirteen years\u201d seeking to \u201cescape jus-\ntice.\u201d Br. 1. Even if true, that would shed no light on \nthe meaning of \u00a72244(b). But Rivers denies such ad-\nmissions, ROA.1584, and he has presented new evi-\ndence calling his convictions into question. If the \nCourt reverses, those merits issues will be ripe for \nreview. But this case is about \u00a72244(b)\u2014\u201c[s]o all the \ntalk\u201d of escaping justice \u201cis entirely out of place.\u201d \nRamos, 590 U.S. at 143. \nARGUMENT \nI. There is no obstacle to reaching the  \nquestion presented. \nA. This Court has jurisdiction. \nRivers has appellate standing. The district court re-\nfused to consider Rivers\u2019s proposed amendment, mis-\ntakenly holding that \u00a72244(b) stripped it of jurisdic-\ntion. Pet. App. 19a. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Pet. \nApp. 11a. That judgment injures Rivers because it \nmakes his path to habeas relief \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 509. \u201cAnd a favorable ruling from this \nCourt would redress [his] injury by reversing that \njudgment.\u201d Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, \n588 U.S. 427, 432\u201333 (2019).  \n\n3 \n \nNor is the case moot. Texas never explains (at 17) \nwhat \u201cjurisdictional consequences\u201d flow from the \nclerk\u2019s decision to docket Rivers\u2019s proposed amend-\nment as a new case, but that error is easily fixed. On \nremand, Rivers could move to consolidate this case \nwith his original habeas case, where his amendment \nbelonged from the start. Cf. Sherrod v. Am. Airlines, \nInc., 132 F.3d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir. 1998) (after consol-\nidation, \u201call motions filed in the second lawsuit were \ndeemed filed in the consolidated suit\u201d). He could then \nmove under Rule 60(b)(6) for relief from the judgment \ndenying his original habeas application. The grounds \nfor that motion would be integrity-based: that the \ndistrict court\u2019s threshold jurisdictional error, Pet. \nApp. 18a\u201319a, \u201cprecluded\u201d it from considering Riv-\ners\u2019s proposed amendment while the original case \nwas still pending. Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 n.4. If \nthe district court granted that motion, Rivers\u2019s origi-\nnal petition would again be pending, and the court \ncould grant leave to amend. See Chafin v. Chafin, 568 \nU.S. 165, 174 (2013) (\u201c[P]rospects of success are \u2026 \nnot pertinent to the mootness inquiry.\u201d). \nThe Court also has habeas jurisdiction. While Riv-\ners has served his child-pornography sentences, he \nremains \u201cin custody\u201d for sexual assault and indecen-\ncy. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(a). The proposed amendment \npleads facts that could warrant relief from those con-\nvictions. J.A.68\u201369, 75. Prosecutors used the alleged \nchild pornography to show \u201cmotive,\u201d ROA.733, and \n\u201cconfir[m] what the girls were saying,\u201d ROA.1045, \nand Rivers can argue on remand that the new evi-\ndence would have undermined the State\u2019s case. The \nalleged confession, which jurors never heard, would \nbe immaterial under Strickland and Napue. \n\n4 \n \nB. Rivers\u2019s arguments are properly before \nthe Court. \n1. Rivers\u2019s arguments are fairly included within the \nquestion presented. The paragraph introducing that \nquestion stated that Rivers \u201csought to amend his ini-\ntial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal\u201d and explained that the circuits are split on \n\u201cwhether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies to such filings.\u201d Pet. i. \nThe question then asked whether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies \nto all, some, or no filings submitted between final \njudgment and the end of appellate review. \nOur opening brief offered the Court two ways to an-\nswer that question. Texas concedes that the broader, \ntiming-focused theory\u2014that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not ap-\nply to any mid-appeal habeas filings\u2014is properly be-\nfore the Court and fits squarely within the question \npresented. If that\u2019s true, then so must our amend-\nment theory: that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not apply to some \nmid-appeal filings. The greater (mid-appeal filings) \nincludes the lesser (mid-appeal Rule 15 motions). And \ndeciding the case on that ground would all but resolve \nthe circuit conflict, since most cases in the split in-\nvolved amendments. \n2. Rivers also preserved his amendment theory. \nRivers told the district court that \u00a72244(b)(2) did not \napply because he had filed \u201can amendment to [his] \ninitial petition under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Objec-\ntions, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2021), \nDkt. 27, at 8; see also id. at 7\u20138 (applying Rule 15 \nwould not \u201cfrustrate AEDPA\u2019s goals\u201d). He pressed the \nsame argument on appeal, reasoning that \u201ca supple-\nment/amendment should be acceptable under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 15 and thus the new claims should not be sub-\nject to \u00a72244.\u201d C.A. Br. 8. That\u2019s more than enough to \npreserve the argument that \u00a72244(b) does not apply \n\n5 \n \nto amendments, especially under the relaxed stand-\nards for pro se litigants.  \nThe amendment argument is properly before this \nCourt too. The petition stated that Rivers \u201curg[ed] the \ncourt to construe [his] filing as an amendment ... in-\nstead of a second or successive petition.\u201d Pet. 12. Fol-\nlowing Banister\u2019s logic, it then argued that the lower \ncourts were wrong to apply \u00a72244(b). Compare Pet. \n25\u201326 with Br. 25\u201327 (history), and Pet. 27\u201330 with \nBr. 31\u201335 (purposes). Texas is right that Rivers first \ncited \u00a72242 at the merits stage. But our \u00a72242 argu-\nment is just that: an argument in support of the same \nclaim that Rivers has made all along\u2014that \u00a72244(b) \ndoes not apply. See Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. \n519, 534 (1992). Texas does not suggest otherwise. In \nall events, this Court \u201cretains the independent power \nto identify and apply the proper construction of gov-\nerning law.\u201d Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 \nU.S. 90, 99 (1991). \n3. The procedural issues were also on full display \nwhen the Court granted cert. Anticipating Texas\u2019s ob-\njections, our petition explained that Rule 62.1 allows \ndistrict courts to consider mid-appeal filings. See Pet. \n3, 29 (citing case law). Texas responded that \u201cthe only \nway Rivers could have reopened the judgment to \namend\u201d was \u201cRule 60(b).\u201d BIO 12. Our reply showed \nwhy that was wrong\u2014previewing the procedural \npathway set forth in our opening merits brief. See \nReply 9 (citing Rules 62.1 and 12.1, \u00a72106, and case \nlaw). The Court may address these \u201cantecedent\u201d mat-\nters, Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73, 77 \n(1990), as \u201csubsidiary issues fairly comprised by the \nquestion presented,\u201d City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian \nNation, 544 U.S. 197, 214 n.8 (2005).  \n\n6 \n \nII. A motion to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition that is pending on appeal is \nnot a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application. \nA. A mid-appeal Rule 15 motion is not a \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application.  \nText. Whatever the phrase \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u201d means, it cannot cover \nmotions to amend. Congress treated \u201csecond or suc-\ncessive application[s]\u201d and \u201camendment[s] to an ap-\nplication\u201d as distinct legal concepts. \u00a72266(b)(2)(B), \n(b)(3)(B). It subjected them to different legal rules. \nSee \u00a72242; \u00a72244(b). And when Congress wanted to \nsubject amendments to the rules governing second or \nsuccessive applications, it said so. See \u00a72266(b)(3)(B). \nAs the United States concedes, all other amendments \n\u201cfollow the Federal Rules,\u201d U.S. Br. 17, so applying \n\u00a72244(b) instead would flout Congress\u2019s drafting \nchoices. Plenty of challenges might await a mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motion, but \u00a72244(b) isn\u2019t one of them. \nTexas fails to answer most of these points. It chiefly \nargues (at 29) that \u00a72242 applies only before final \njudgment, whereas \u00a72244(b) applies after. But the \nstatutes don\u2019t say that, and the \u00a72242 Codifier\u2019s Note \nsuggests otherwise. Congress added the amendment \nprovision to \u201cconform to existing practice,\u201d Codifier\u2019s \nNote, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242 (1952), and fresh on its mind \nwould have been Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266 \n(1948). After the prisoner there made new factual al-\nlegations in his appellate brief, this Court remanded \nfor \u201camendment or elaboration of [the] pleadings.\u201d Id. \nat 277, 290\u201391. Pre-AEDPA courts continued to en-\ntertain such efforts, and Texas cites no language in \n\u00a72244(b) purporting to \u201caffec[t]\u201d this practice. Contra \nResp. Br. 29. Finally, because amendments and sec-\nond or successive applications are mutually exclusive \ncategories, \u201cthere is no conflict\u201d between \u00a72242(b) and \n\n7 \n \n\u00a72244. Nat\u2019l Cable & Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Gulf Power \nCo., 534 U.S. 327, 336 (2002). \nHistory. The history here is even stronger than in \nBanister. Our opening brief cited cases from six cir-\ncuits that addressed mid-appeal efforts to amend \u201con \nthe merits.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 515. Texas\u2019s amici \ncite only one case going the other way\u2014the same los-\ning score as in Banister.  \n1. Texas can\u2019t get around the historical cases that \nentertained mid-appeal motions to amend. \na. Nearly everything Texas says about Harisiades \nv. Shaughnessy is wrong. Had Harisiades just wanted \nto \u201cbuttress\u201d his claims with \u201cintervening authority,\u201d \nBr. 35, he could have done so in an appellate brief. \nInstead, he sought to \u201camend\u201d his \u201cpetition\u201d with new \nfactual allegations supporting a claim under the APA, \nwhich this Court had just held applicable to deporta-\ntion proceedings like his. 90 F. Supp. 431, 432 n.2 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1950). Only later, when the government ar-\ngued that \u201cthe notice of appeal barred the District \nCourt from considering the motion,\u201d did Harisiades \nmove to withdraw his appeal. Id. at 433. Faced with \nthe two motions, the court \u201cfirst consider[ed] the mer-\nits of the original application for leave to amend.\u201d Id. \nat 434. It then spent six pages analyzing \u201cwhether \nthe deportation proceeding was \u2018initiated\u2019 prior to the \n[APA\u2019s] effective date.\u201d Id. at 436. (If so, amendment \nwould be futile.) Finding that it had been, the court \ndenied leave to amend. It then summarily denied the \nmotion to withdraw\u2014which Texas calls the main is-\nsue\u2014in a single sentence. \nNor was the amendment issue simply lurking in \nthe record when Harisiades reached this Court. \nAmong the questions this Court granted was whether \nthe APA \u201cwas applicable to the proceeding against\u201d \n\n8 \n \nHarisiades\u2014a question that entered the case only \nthrough the motion to amend. Pet. for Writ of Cert. at \n5, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, No. 50-43 (U.S. May 3, \n1951). Harisiades\u2019s opening brief then made clear \nthat he had \u201cmoved to amend\u201d his habeas application \nto allege facts supporting an APA claim after \u201cfil[ing] \na notice of appeal.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br. at *10\u201311, Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 1951 WL 81967 (U.S. Dec. 4, 1951). \nAnd he argued the effective-date issue at length. Id. \nat *23\u201327. \nIf mid-appeal efforts to amend were abusive, this \nCourt had every reason and opportunity to say so. In-\nstead, it reached the \u201ceffective date\u201d question\u2014the \nbasis for denying leave to amend\u2014and affirmed on \nthe merits. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, \n583 n.4 (1952). (Texas\u2019s references to \u201cstanding\u201d and \n\u201cconsent\u201d are misleading. Those statements related to \nanother argument, \u201caside\u201d from the APA. Id.) \nb. Texas fares no better with the remaining cases. \nIt first claims (at 36) that Strand v. United States, \n780 F.2d 1497 (10th Cir. 1985), involved mid-appeal \nefforts to supplement the record, not a motion to \namend. Even if that were right, Texas doesn\u2019t explain \nwhy (under its theory) that would not have been abu-\nsive. But Texas is wrong. The prisoner in Strand filed \ntwo mid-appeal motions asking the district court to \nconsider additional factual bases for habeas relief, \nand the Tenth Circuit called those motions \u201c\u00a72255 \npleadings.\u201d 780 F.2d at 1500 (emphasis added). Yet \nneither the United States nor any of the four judges \nwho heard the case hinted that they were abusive. \nTexas has even less to say about our other cases. It \nchiefly observes (at 36) that prisoners who introduced \nnew grounds for relief directly in the court of appeals \ndid not file \u201cRule 15 motions.\u201d Perhaps not. But the \n\n9 \n \nrelief those prisoners sought (and sometimes re-\nceived) was the chance to raise new habeas claims \nmid-appeal: precisely what Texas says was off-limits. \nNor does it matter that reaching the merits might \nsometimes have been \u201ceasier\u201d than applying early \nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. Contra CJLF Br. 13\u201314. \nThat objection applies equally to the cases this Court \nrelied on in Banister. E.g., Gajewski v. Stevens, 346 \nF.2d 1000 (8th Cir. 1965). Here, as in Banister, what \nmatters is that court after court addressed mid-\nappeal efforts to amend \u201cwithout any comment about \nrepetitive litigation,\u201d 590 U.S. at 515\u2014not even as an \nalternative ground, mentioned in passing. \n2. Texas\u2019s amici cite just one pre-AEDPA case going \nthe other way. In Smith v. Armontrout, the Eighth \nCircuit called the prisoner\u2019s \u201cmotion to remand\u201d the \n\u201cfunctional equivalent of a second or successive peti-\ntion.\u201d 888 F.2d 530, 540 (1989). That court used the \nsame rationale to find Rule 59(e) motions successive \nin a case Banister deemed an outlier. See 590 U.S. at \n515 (citing Bannister v. Armontrout, 4 F.3d 1434, \n1445 (8th Cir. 1993)). Smith is an outlier too. \nFinally, there was no historical habeas practice of \nconstruing mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as Rule 60(b) \nmotions. Contra U.S. Br. 26. The United States mis-\nreads the procedural history of Bonin v. Vasquez, 999 \nF.2d 425 (9th Cir. 1993), which did not involve a mid-\nappeal filing of any sort. (It also double-counts Bonin \nv. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 1995), a later opin-\nion in the same case.) The only takeaway from Bonin \nis that a motion seeking \u201cRelief From Judgment,\u201d \nfiled \u201cpursuant to Rule 60(b),\u201d was \u201cproperly con-\nstrued\u201d as a Rule 60(b) motion. 999 F.2d at 427\u201328. \n\n10 \n \nB. Mid-appeal Rule 15 motions offer a  \nviable path to relief. \n1. This Court may reverse without reaching the \nprocedural issues. The district court ruled on thresh-\nold jurisdictional grounds, holding that Rivers\u2019s pro-\nposed amendment was a second or successive applica-\ntion. The narrowest way to resolve this case would be \nto correct that error, reserving all other questions. \nAnticipating Texas\u2019s objections, we have explained \nwhy motions like Rivers\u2019s are viable. But questions \nabout the meaning of \u00a72244(b) are analytically dis-\ntinct from questions about the procedural path to re-\nlief, and the Court can answer the former without \ntackling the latter. E.g., Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417 (2022) (\u201cassum[ing] without decid-\ning\u201d several antecedent issues and \u201cconsider[ing] only \nthe next step\u201d). That would be appropriate here, since \ntwo circuits allow mid-appeal Rule 15 motions, and \nthere are strong arguments for their viability. See \nUnited States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105\u201306 (3d \nCir. 2019); Ching v. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 177 \n(2d Cir. 2002). \n2. If the Court reaches the procedural issues, it \nshould apply \u00a72106 and the Federal Rules as written. \na. The procedural debate comes down to vacatur. \nNo one denies that clerks may docket mid-appeal \nRule 15 motions. All agree that such motions cannot \nbe granted absent vacatur. And all agree that Rule \n60(b) is one path to vacatur. Texas, however, needs \nthe Court to go further and deem Rule 60(b) the only \npath. But that ignores \u00a72106, the same s\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

He doesn\u2019t deny that this case is the ideal vehicle \nfor resolving it. And he admits that the conflict has \ndeepened even while this case has been pending. Ten \ncircuits have now splintered four ways over when 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)\u2019s gatekeeping requirements for \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d habeas petitions kick in, and \nthe question is ripe for review.  \nLumpkin\u2019s only response is that the circuits are not \n\u201cintractably\u201d split because the Second, Third, and \nTenth might still \u201cself-correct\u201d in light of Banister v. \nDavis, 590 U.S. 504 (2020). Opp. 16. But those courts \nhave already had\u2014and rejected\u2014multiple opportuni-\nties to do so. Only this Court can resolve the conflict, \nand there is no reason to stay on the sidelines. \nWith nowhere else to turn, Lumpkin spends most of \nhis brief on the merits\u2014but none of his arguments \nmakes this case any less certworthy. Gonzalez v. \nCrosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), doesn\u2019t \u201cmandat[e]\u201d the \noutcome because that case did not implicate the tim-\ning question posed here. Contra Opp. 7. Nor can the \ndecision below be squared with Banister. Like the \nFifth Circuit, Lumpkin sidesteps historical habeas \npractice, and he offers no serious answer on AEDPA\u2019s \npurposes. Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rule \n60(b) was Rivers\u2019s only path to relief. Even while an \nappeal is pending, a district court retains jurisdiction \nto issue an indicative ruling about new exculpatory \nevidence. Section 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t supplant Rule \n62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). \nThis case is the perfect opportunity to resolve an \nimportant question. The Court should grant review. \n\n2 \n \n \nI. Respondent concedes that the 7-1-1-1  \ncircuit split is certworthy. \nA.  Lumpkin admits \u201cthere is a mature circuit split\u201d \non the question presented, which \u201ccould be a suffi-\ncient basis to justify certiorari.\u201d Opp. 16. He\u2019s right. \nIn the Second Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) does not apply un-\ntil a prisoner exhausts appellate review of his first \nhabeas petition. In seven other circuits, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) \nkicks in once the district court enters final judgment \nor shortly thereafter. (Even those courts can\u2019t agree \non when.) In the Tenth Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) applies \neven sooner\u2014unless the prisoner satisfies a seven-\nfactor test. And in the Third Circuit, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) tog-\ngles on and off depending on who wins the appeal. \nSee Pet. 13\u201320. In short: the circuits are in shambles, \nand this Court\u2019s intervention is badly needed. \nThe split is now even deeper than it was when this \ncase started. As Lumpkin concedes (at 14), \u201c[t]he \nFourth and Eleventh Circuits [have] recently issued \nclear decisions\u201d deepening the conflict. Opp. 14. In \nBixby v. Stirling, 90 F.4th 140, 143, 145 (4th Cir. \n2024), the petitioner sought further habeas relief \nwhile the \u201cappeal from the denial of his [first] petition \nwas pending.\u201d The Fourth Circuit rejected that filing \nas a \u201csecond or successive\u201d petition, deepening the \nconflict. And the Eleventh Circuit, which had previ-\nously addressed the issue only in unpublished orders, \njust solidified the split in a published opinion. Citing \nthe decision below, it \u201cjoin[ed] the majority of \u2026 cir-\ncuits\u201d and expressly \u201cdisagree[d]\u201d with the Second \nCircuit\u2019s approach. Boyd v. Sec\u2019y, Dep\u2019t of Corr., 114 \nF.4th 1232, 1238 & n.3 (11th Cir. 2024). \nB.  Split conceded, Lumpkin offers just one reason \nto punt: that \u201cthe minority circuits\u201d might still \u201cself-\ncorrect\u201d in light of Banister. Opp. 16. In his view, \n\n3 \n \n \n\u201c[t]his Court should grant certiorari only if they fail \nto do so at the next opportunity.\u201d Id. What Lumpkin \ndoesn\u2019t mention, however, is that those courts have \nalready had the chance to \u201cself-correct\u201d\u2014and they\u2019ve \npassed. Just a few weeks ago, the Third Circuit dou-\nbled down on its approach in an opinion citing Banis-\nter. See Ross v. Adm\u2019r E. Jersey State Prison, No. 23-\n1240, 2024 WL 4341335, at *6 (3d Cir. Sept. 30, \n2024). And the Second Circuit has also stuck to its \nguns. See Waiters v. United States, No. 20-2712, 2021 \nWL 11096770, at *1 (2d Cir. May 19, 2021) (continu-\ning to apply Whab v. United States, 408 F.3d 116 (2d \nCir. 2005)). \n* \n* \n* \nTen circuits have now split four ways over the \nquestion presented. The conflict is entrenched and \nwon\u2019t fix itself. And with roughly 99% of prisoners \nnow covered by the split, there is no reason for this \nCourt to wait any longer. See Fed. Bureau of Prisons, \nStatistics, bit.ly/Federal-Prisons; Prison Pol\u2019y Initia-\ntive, Appendix: State and Federal Prison Populations \n2019-2023, bit.ly/State-Prisons. It\u2019s high time to re-\nsolve this question once and for all. \nII. Respondent doesn\u2019t deny that this case is \nthe ideal vehicle to resolve a critically im-\nportant habeas question. \nA.  Lumpkin admits that the question presented is \nimportant. See Opp. 16 (conceding the \u201cimportance of \nclear jurisdictional rules\u201d). Rivers\u2019s amici agree. The \nNation\u2019s leading habeas scholars have explained how \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s rule \u201cleads to perverse results\u201d and \ncould \u201cbar potentially meritorious habeas claims.\u201d \nScholars Br. 13. The National Association of Criminal \nDefense Lawyers, the Innocence Project, and the \n\n4 \n \n \nFederal Public Defenders have warned that \u201can en-\ntire subset of Brady and ineffective assistance claims\u201d \nmay fall through the cracks. NACDL Br. 14. And \nnearly a dozen of this Court\u2019s former Article III col-\nleagues have urged it to grant review because \u201cthe \nmajority rule unduly burdens courts.\u201d Judges Br. 6.  \nB.  Lumpkin also doesn\u2019t deny that \u201cthis case is an \nideal vehicle.\u201d Pet. 3. The question presented is out-\ncome-determinative. No factual disputes will hinder \nreview. See Opp. 3\u20134. And\u2014unlike most habeas peti-\ntioners\u2014Rivers meticulously preserved all of his ar-\nguments below. No wonder Lumpkin doesn\u2019t dispute \nthat \u201cRivers will have a meaningful path to relief\u201d if \nthis Court reverses. Pet. 31. It\u2019s hard to imagine a \nbetter vehicle for addressing the question presented. \nIII. The decision below is wrong. \nA.  Section 2244(b)(2) does not strip district courts \nof jurisdiction to consider all habeas filings submitted \nwhile an initial petition is on appeal. In holding oth-\nerwise, the Fifth Circuit failed to cite Banister\u2014much \nless follow the roadmap that it lays out. Had it done \nso, the court would have realized that its ruling \ndoesn\u2019t square with either \u201chistorical precedents\u201d or \n\u201cstatutory aims.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 513. As to his-\ntory, early cases suggest that filings submitted while \nan initial habeas application is on appeal are not \n\u201csecond or successive.\u201d See Pet. 25\u201327; Scholars Br. \n6\u201313. And as to purposes, treating filings like Rivers\u2019s \nas \u201csecond or successive\u201d would frustrate\u2014not fur-\nther\u2014judicial economy, efficiency, and finality. See \nPet. 27\u201330; Judges Br. 7\u20138. The Fifth Circuit consid-\nered none of this, and its categorical rule can\u2019t be \nsquared with this Court\u2019s cases. \nB.  Lumpkin\u2019s responses don\u2019t wash. \n\n5 \n \n \n1.  Lumpkin chiefly argues (at 7\u20138) that cert isn\u2019t \nwarranted because Gonzalez \u201cmandated\u201d the outcome \nbelow and offers \u201csufficient guidance as to what con-\nstitutes a successive petition.\u201d That\u2019s doubly wrong. \nFor one thing, even if Lumpkin were right and \nGonzalez controlled, the lower courts are still in dis-\narray over how to apply its \u201cguidance.\u201d Contra Opp. \n7. The Fifth Circuit gleaned from Gonzalez the \u201cun-\nderlying principle\u201d that habeas filings \u201cintroduced af-\nter a final judgment \u2026 are deemed successive.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 10a. Other courts beg to differ. See, e.g., Doug-\nlas v. Workman, 560 F.3d 1156, 1190, 1193 (10th Cir. \n2009) (citing Gonzalez and adopting seven-factor \ntest); Moreland v. Robinson, 813 F.3d 315, 322\u201324 \n(6th Cir. 2016) (citing Gonzalez and pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to the window for appeal); United States \nv. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105 (3d Cir. 2019) (pegging \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) to exhaustion and stating that Gonzalez \n\u201cdoes not compel a different result\u201d). That alone war-\nrants review. \nBut Lumpkin isn\u2019t right: \u201cGonzalez does not answer \nthe question whether a [mid-appeal habeas filing] is a \n\u2018second or successive\u2019 habeas application under \n\u00a7 2244(b).\u201d Balbuena v. Sullivan, 970 F.3d 1176, 1200 \n(9th Cir. 2020) (Fletcher, J., concurring in the result). \nHow could it? The petitioner in Gonzalez sought relief \nmore than a year after his appeal ended, and his fil-\ning did not present a habeas claim in the first place. \nSee Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 527, 533 & n.6; Scholars \nBr. 23. So the \u201cgeneral expressions\u201d Lumpkin cites \ncan hardly \u201ccontrol the judgment in a subsequent suit \nwhen the very point is presented for decision.\u201d Co-\nhens v. Virginia, 19 U.S. (6 Wheat.) 264, 399 (1821).  \n2.  Turning to Banister, Lumpkin insists that the \ndecision below is \u201cconsistent with\u201d this Court\u2019s guid-\n\n6 \n \n \nance. Opp. 5. But he has no sound answer to the Fifth \nCircuit\u2019s failure to cite Banister, and his efforts to de-\nfend that court\u2019s reasoning fall flat. \na.  Lumpkin concedes (at 10) that the Fifth Circuit \n\u201cdid not consider\u201d whether Rivers\u2019s filing \u201cwould have \n\u2018constituted an abuse of the writ, as that concept is \nexplained in [this Court\u2019s] pre-AEDPA cases.\u2019\u201d Banis-\nter, 590 U.S. at 512. Neither does Lumpkin.  \nInstead, he principally contends that the Fifth Cir-\ncuit was right to ignore that question because \u201cthe \ntext of \u00a7 2244, not abuse of the writ, [i]s the relevant \ninquiry.\u201d Opp. 10. That misses the point. No one \ndoubts that \u201cthe text of AEDPA \u2026 controls,\u201d nor does \nanyone think historical practice \u201cshould supplant \n\u00a7 2244(b) as gatekeeper.\u201d Contra Opp. 9. This Court \nlooked to \u201chistorical habeas doctrine and practice\u201d in \nBanister because \u201c[t]he phrase \u2018second or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u2019 \u2026 is a \u2018term of art\u2019 that \u2018is \nnot self-defining.\u2019\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 511 (quoting \nSlack v. McDaniel, 529 U.S. 473, 486 (2000)). In other \nwords, historical practice matters precisely because \n\u00a7 2244(b)(2) \u201ctakes its full meaning from [the Court\u2019s] \ncase law.\u201d Panetti v. Quarterman, 551 U.S. 930, 943 \n(2007). Ignoring that is a telltale sign that the Fifth \nCircuit (and Lumpkin) have taken a wrong turn.  \nAfter thumbing his nose at historical practice, \nLumpkin pivots to a source that Banister did not con-\nsult: legislative history. Citing a handful of floor \nstatements, Lumpkin declares that \u201cCongress likely \nintended\u201d to \u201ccurtail the problem of successive habeas \npetitions\u201d by \u201coverrid[ing] \u2026 pre-AEDPA legal stand-\nards.\u201d Opp. 9. \u201cWell, yes, but so what?\u201d Pulsifer v. \nUnited States, 601 U.S. 124, 135 n.3 (2024). Banister \nalready confirmed that AEDPA \u201cdid not redefine\u201d the \n\n7 \n \n \nstandard that matters here: \u201cwhat qualifies as a suc-\ncessive petition.\u201d 590 U.S. at 515.  \nIn all events, the legislative history doesn\u2019t favor \nLumpkin. As then-Chairman of the Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Orrin Hatch explained, AEDPA was in-\ntended to \u201cguarantee prisoners one complete and fair \ncourse of collateral review in the Federal System.\u201d \nFederal Habeas Corpus Reform: Eliminating Prison-\ners\u2019 Abuse of the Judicial Process: Hearing on S. 623 \nBefore the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 104th Cong. 2, \n3 (1995) (emphasis added). That meant \u201cone full \ncourse of litigation up to the Supreme Court.\u201d Judi-\ncial Conference of the United States, Ad Hoc Comm. \non Fed. Habeas Corpus in Capital Cases, Comm. Re-\nport and Proposal (Lewis F. Powell, Jr., Chairman, \nAug. 23, 1989), reprinted in Habeas Corpus Reform: \nHearings Before the S. Comm. on the Judiciary, 101st \nCong. 7\u201330 (1991). It follows that \u201ca subsequent fil-\ning\u201d is not \u201c\u2018second or successive\u2019 \u2026 simply because \nthe district court rendered a [final] judgment.\u201d Ching \nv. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 178 (2d Cir. 2002)  \n(Sotomayor, J.).   \nb.  Lumpkin fares no better when he turns to Ban-\nister\u2019s other source of guidance, AEDPA\u2019s purposes. \nLumpkin begins (at 10) by chiding Rivers for \n\u201ctak[ing] issue with Congress\u2019 policy determinations\u201d \nand for quibbling with \u201cthe procedural impediments \nof \u00a7 2244(b) \u2026 in [and] of themselves.\u201d Not at all. \nEveryone agrees that petitions filed after the prisoner \nexhausts appellate review of his initial application \ncount as second or successive and are channeled \nthrough the court of appeals. See Pet. 27. The ques-\ntion here is whether \u00a7 2244(b)(2) also governs a filing \nlike Rivers\u2019s\u2014i.e., one submitted while the initial ap-\nplication is pending on appeal. As the petition ex-\n\n8 \n \n \nplained (at 27\u201330), \u201cAEDPA\u2019s own purposes\u201d suggest \nthat the answer is no. Banister, 590 U.S. at 512. By \ninvoking \u201cCongress\u2019 policy determinations,\u201d however, \nLumpkin merely begs the question. Opp. 10. \nTurning to the merits, Lumpkin warns that Riv-\ners\u2019s approach would waste \u201cjudicial resources\u201d and \npermit \u201can infinite number of post-judgment amend-\nments.\u201d Opp. 11, 13. But the Second Circuit has ap-\nplied the rule that Rivers advocates for nearly two \ndecades. So if Lumpkin is right, it\u2019s fair to ask why he \ndoesn\u2019t cite a single example of the abuses he fears. \nHis failure to do so suggests that district courts have \nall the tools they need to serve as effective gatekeep-\ners. See Whab, 408 F.3d at 119 n.2 (\u201cTraditional doc-\ntrines, such as abuse of the writ, continue to apply.\u201d); \nChing, 298 F.3d at 180 (\u201c[T]he decision to grant a mo-\ntion to amend is committed to the sound discretion of \nthe district court.\u201d); NACDL Br. 19\u201321. Nearly a doz-\nen \u201cformer judges who have dealt with numerous fil-\nings by habeas petitioners in both district and appel-\nlate roles\u201d agree. Judges Br. 7. In their experience, \n\u201cdistrict courts are best positioned to deal with and \ndispose of these types of post-appeal filings, and can \nreadily handle them using tools already at their dis-\nposal without resort to\u201d \u00a7 2244(b)(2). Id. at 4. \n3.  Finally, Lumpkin is also wrong that Rivers\u2019s on-\nly path to relief \u201cwould have been a Rule 60(b) mo-\ntion.\u201d Opp. 12. True, the district court \u201chad no juris-\ndiction to consider an \u2018amended\u2019 petition\u201d while the \ncase was \u201cpending on appeal.\u201d Opp. 12. But even \nwhile \u201can appeal \u2026 is pending,\u201d a district court may \nissue an indicative ruling stating \u201cthat [a] motion \nraises a substantial issue.\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. The \nappellate court may then \u201cremand for further pro-\nceedings.\u201d Fed. R. App. P. 12.1(b). Here, had the dis-\n\n9 \n \n \ntrict court not misread \u00a7 2244(b)(2), it could have con-\nsidered Rivers\u2019s new evidence and (if warranted) \nstated that \u201cit would grant the motion if the court of \nappeals remand[ed].\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1. In that \ncase, an \u201corder for remand would \u2026 amount in itself \nto a vacation of the judgment for further proceedings, \nincluding amendments.\u201d Markert v. Swift & Co., 173 \nF.2d 517, 520 (2d Cir. 1949) (deeming \u201cresort \u2026 to \nRule 60\u201d unnecessary); see also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (au-\nthorizing appellate courts to \u201cvacate \u2026 any judg-\nment\u201d and \u201crequire such further proceedings \u2026 as \nmay be just under the circumstances\u201d). \nContra Lumpkin, \u00a7 2244(b)(2) doesn\u2019t \u201csupplan[t]\u201d \nRule 62.1 any more than it does Rule 59(e). Opp. 11. \nLike a Rule 59(e) motion, a Rule 62.1 motion \u201cgives a \nprisoner only a narrow window to ask for relief.\u201d Ban-\nister, 590 U.S. at 516. Should both courts oblige, a \nremand for amendment would be \u201ca limited continua-\ntion of the original proceeding.\u201d Id. at 521. And if the \ndistrict court again denied relief, the prisoner would \n\u201ctak[e] a single appeal.\u201d Id. In short, Rule 59(e) and \nRule 62.1 are alike \u201cin just about every way that mat-\nters.\u201d Id. at 518. The courts below reached none of \nthis because they thought \u00a7 2244(b)(2) strips district \ncourts of jurisdiction to consider any \u201cpost-judgment\u201d \nhabeas filing. Opp. 5. Should this Court reverse, Riv-\ners will be free to seek 62.1 relief on remand. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant the petition. \n \n\n10 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

Habeas courts historically enter-\ntained mid-appeal efforts to amend, without a word \nabout successive litigation. Just before Congress en-\nacted \u00a72244(b), Texas itself told this Court why. \nWhen \u201cthere has been no appellate review of the \njudgment of the district court, there is no finality to \nthat court\u2019s review on the merits, and thus [an] \namended petition would not be subject to dismissal \nfor abuse.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br., McCotter v. Petty, No. 85-1656, \n1986 WL 728550, at *23. \u201cCongress passed AEDPA \nagainst this legal backdrop, and did nothing to \nchange it.\u201d Banister v. Davis, 590 U.S. 504, 515 \n(2020). That should resolve this case. Rivers\u2019s motion \nwas not a second or successive application, and the \nFifth Circuit was wrong to hold otherwise. \nTexas scarcely disputes the meaning of \u00a72244(b). \nInstead, it spends most of its brief arguing that the \nrules of civil procedure do not permit mid-appeal ef-\nforts to amend. Every step of its logic is wrong\u2014but \nRivers can prevail whether or not this Court settles \nthe procedural debate. The courts below made a \nthreshold error about the meaning of \u00a72244(b), and \nthe Court can reverse on that basis alone.  \nWhen Texas does get around to \u00a72244(b), the theory \nit offers is wrong and unworkable. The State under-\nstandably abandons the decision below, which didn\u2019t \neven cite Banister. It then cobbles together a new \ntheory, consisting of one line from Banister and one \nline from Gonzalez v. Crosby, 545 U.S. 524 (2005), Br. \n20, plus an ad hoc time-of-appeal rule borrowed from \nthe Sixth Circuit, Br. 28. That approach has no basis \nin text or history, and no other court has found it per-\nsuasive. It also guarantees that this issue will be \n\n2 \n \nback again soon, once the lower courts trip on the \ncracks already evident in Texas\u2019s theory. To save it-\nself time, the Court should reject that theory now. \nFinally, a word to clear the air. \u201cToo much public \ndiscourse today is sullied by ad hominem rhetoric,\u201d \nand Texas \u201cregrettably succumbs to this trend.\u201d Ra-\nmos v. Louisiana, 590 U.S. 83, 141 (2020) (Alito, J., \ndissenting). Presenting \u201cas historical fact the testi-\nmony of the prosecution\u2019s witnesses,\u201d Glossip v. Ok-\nlahoma, 145 S. Ct. 612, 620 n.1 (2025), its brief \nbrands Rivers as an \u201cadmitted\u201d child abuser who has \nspent \u201cthe last thirteen years\u201d seeking to \u201cescape jus-\ntice.\u201d Br. 1. Even if true, that would shed no light on \nthe meaning of \u00a72244(b). But Rivers denies such ad-\nmissions, ROA.1584, and he has presented new evi-\ndence calling his convictions into question. If the \nCourt reverses, those merits issues will be ripe for \nreview. But this case is about \u00a72244(b)\u2014\u201c[s]o all the \ntalk\u201d of escaping justice \u201cis entirely out of place.\u201d \nRamos, 590 U.S. at 143. \nARGUMENT \nI. There is no obstacle to reaching the  \nquestion presented. \nA. This Court has jurisdiction. \nRivers has appellate standing. The district court re-\nfused to consider Rivers\u2019s proposed amendment, mis-\ntakenly holding that \u00a72244(b) stripped it of jurisdic-\ntion. Pet. App. 19a. The Fifth Circuit affirmed. Pet. \nApp. 11a. That judgment injures Rivers because it \nmakes his path to habeas relief \u201crockier.\u201d Banister, \n590 U.S. at 509. \u201cAnd a favorable ruling from this \nCourt would redress [his] injury by reversing that \njudgment.\u201d Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, \n588 U.S. 427, 432\u201333 (2019).  \n\n3 \n \nNor is the case moot. Texas never explains (at 17) \nwhat \u201cjurisdictional consequences\u201d flow from the \nclerk\u2019s decision to docket Rivers\u2019s proposed amend-\nment as a new case, but that error is easily fixed. On \nremand, Rivers could move to consolidate this case \nwith his original habeas case, where his amendment \nbelonged from the start. Cf. Sherrod v. Am. Airlines, \nInc., 132 F.3d 1112, 1117 (5th Cir. 1998) (after consol-\nidation, \u201call motions filed in the second lawsuit were \ndeemed filed in the consolidated suit\u201d). He could then \nmove under Rule 60(b)(6) for relief from the judgment \ndenying his original habeas application. The grounds \nfor that motion would be integrity-based: that the \ndistrict court\u2019s threshold jurisdictional error, Pet. \nApp. 18a\u201319a, \u201cprecluded\u201d it from considering Riv-\ners\u2019s proposed amendment while the original case \nwas still pending. Gonzalez, 545 U.S. at 532 n.4. If \nthe district court granted that motion, Rivers\u2019s origi-\nnal petition would again be pending, and the court \ncould grant leave to amend. See Chafin v. Chafin, 568 \nU.S. 165, 174 (2013) (\u201c[P]rospects of success are \u2026 \nnot pertinent to the mootness inquiry.\u201d). \nThe Court also has habeas jurisdiction. While Riv-\ners has served his child-pornography sentences, he \nremains \u201cin custody\u201d for sexual assault and indecen-\ncy. 28 U.S.C. \u00a72254(a). The proposed amendment \npleads facts that could warrant relief from those con-\nvictions. J.A.68\u201369, 75. Prosecutors used the alleged \nchild pornography to show \u201cmotive,\u201d ROA.733, and \n\u201cconfir[m] what the girls were saying,\u201d ROA.1045, \nand Rivers can argue on remand that the new evi-\ndence would have undermined the State\u2019s case. The \nalleged confession, which jurors never heard, would \nbe immaterial under Strickland and Napue. \n\n4 \n \nB. Rivers\u2019s arguments are properly before \nthe Court. \n1. Rivers\u2019s arguments are fairly included within the \nquestion presented. The paragraph introducing that \nquestion stated that Rivers \u201csought to amend his ini-\ntial habeas application while it was pending on ap-\npeal\u201d and explained that the circuits are split on \n\u201cwhether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies to such filings.\u201d Pet. i. \nThe question then asked whether \u00a72244(b)(2) applies \nto all, some, or no filings submitted between final \njudgment and the end of appellate review. \nOur opening brief offered the Court two ways to an-\nswer that question. Texas concedes that the broader, \ntiming-focused theory\u2014that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not ap-\nply to any mid-appeal habeas filings\u2014is properly be-\nfore the Court and fits squarely within the question \npresented. If that\u2019s true, then so must our amend-\nment theory: that \u00a72244(b)(2) does not apply to some \nmid-appeal filings. The greater (mid-appeal filings) \nincludes the lesser (mid-appeal Rule 15 motions). And \ndeciding the case on that ground would all but resolve \nthe circuit conflict, since most cases in the split in-\nvolved amendments. \n2. Rivers also preserved his amendment theory. \nRivers told the district court that \u00a72244(b)(2) did not \napply because he had filed \u201can amendment to [his] \ninitial petition under Fed. R. Civ. P. 15.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Objec-\ntions, No. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 2, 2021), \nDkt. 27, at 8; see also id. at 7\u20138 (applying Rule 15 \nwould not \u201cfrustrate AEDPA\u2019s goals\u201d). He pressed the \nsame argument on appeal, reasoning that \u201ca supple-\nment/amendment should be acceptable under Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 15 and thus the new claims should not be sub-\nject to \u00a72244.\u201d C.A. Br. 8. That\u2019s more than enough to \npreserve the argument that \u00a72244(b) does not apply \n\n5 \n \nto amendments, especially under the relaxed stand-\nards for pro se litigants.  \nThe amendment argument is properly before this \nCourt too. The petition stated that Rivers \u201curg[ed] the \ncourt to construe [his] filing as an amendment ... in-\nstead of a second or successive petition.\u201d Pet. 12. Fol-\nlowing Banister\u2019s logic, it then argued that the lower \ncourts were wrong to apply \u00a72244(b). Compare Pet. \n25\u201326 with Br. 25\u201327 (history), and Pet. 27\u201330 with \nBr. 31\u201335 (purposes). Texas is right that Rivers first \ncited \u00a72242 at the merits stage. But our \u00a72242 argu-\nment is just that: an argument in support of the same \nclaim that Rivers has made all along\u2014that \u00a72244(b) \ndoes not apply. See Yee v. City of Escondido, 503 U.S. \n519, 534 (1992). Texas does not suggest otherwise. In \nall events, this Court \u201cretains the independent power \nto identify and apply the proper construction of gov-\nerning law.\u201d Kamen v. Kemper Fin. Servs., Inc., 500 \nU.S. 90, 99 (1991). \n3. The procedural issues were also on full display \nwhen the Court granted cert. Anticipating Texas\u2019s ob-\njections, our petition explained that Rule 62.1 allows \ndistrict courts to consider mid-appeal filings. See Pet. \n3, 29 (citing case law). Texas responded that \u201cthe only \nway Rivers could have reopened the judgment to \namend\u201d was \u201cRule 60(b).\u201d BIO 12. Our reply showed \nwhy that was wrong\u2014previewing the procedural \npathway set forth in our opening merits brief. See \nReply 9 (citing Rules 62.1 and 12.1, \u00a72106, and case \nlaw). The Court may address these \u201cantecedent\u201d mat-\nters, Arcadia v. Ohio Power Co., 498 U.S. 73, 77 \n(1990), as \u201csubsidiary issues fairly comprised by the \nquestion presented,\u201d City of Sherrill v. Oneida Indian \nNation, 544 U.S. 197, 214 n.8 (2005).  \n\n6 \n \nII. A motion to amend or supplement an initial \nhabeas petition that is pending on appeal is \nnot a \u201csecond or successive\u201d application. \nA. A mid-appeal Rule 15 motion is not a \n\u201csecond or successive\u201d application.  \nText. Whatever the phrase \u201csecond or successive \nhabeas corpus application\u201d means, it cannot cover \nmotions to amend. Congress treated \u201csecond or suc-\ncessive application[s]\u201d and \u201camendment[s] to an ap-\nplication\u201d as distinct legal concepts. \u00a72266(b)(2)(B), \n(b)(3)(B). It subjected them to different legal rules. \nSee \u00a72242; \u00a72244(b). And when Congress wanted to \nsubject amendments to the rules governing second or \nsuccessive applications, it said so. See \u00a72266(b)(3)(B). \nAs the United States concedes, all other amendments \n\u201cfollow the Federal Rules,\u201d U.S. Br. 17, so applying \n\u00a72244(b) instead would flout Congress\u2019s drafting \nchoices. Plenty of challenges might await a mid-\nappeal Rule 15 motion, but \u00a72244(b) isn\u2019t one of them. \nTexas fails to answer most of these points. It chiefly \nargues (at 29) that \u00a72242 applies only before final \njudgment, whereas \u00a72244(b) applies after. But the \nstatutes don\u2019t say that, and the \u00a72242 Codifier\u2019s Note \nsuggests otherwise. Congress added the amendment \nprovision to \u201cconform to existing practice,\u201d Codifier\u2019s \nNote, 28 U.S.C. \u00a72242 (1952), and fresh on its mind \nwould have been Price v. Johnston, 334 U.S. 266 \n(1948). After the prisoner there made new factual al-\nlegations in his appellate brief, this Court remanded \nfor \u201camendment or elaboration of [the] pleadings.\u201d Id. \nat 277, 290\u201391. Pre-AEDPA courts continued to en-\ntertain such efforts, and Texas cites no language in \n\u00a72244(b) purporting to \u201caffec[t]\u201d this practice. Contra \nResp. Br. 29. Finally, because amendments and sec-\nond or successive applications are mutually exclusive \ncategories, \u201cthere is no conflict\u201d between \u00a72242(b) and \n\n7 \n \n\u00a72244. Nat\u2019l Cable & Telecomms. Ass\u2019n v. Gulf Power \nCo., 534 U.S. 327, 336 (2002). \nHistory. The history here is even stronger than in \nBanister. Our opening brief cited cases from six cir-\ncuits that addressed mid-appeal efforts to amend \u201con \nthe merits.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 515. Texas\u2019s amici \ncite only one case going the other way\u2014the same los-\ning score as in Banister.  \n1. Texas can\u2019t get around the historical cases that \nentertained mid-appeal motions to amend. \na. Nearly everything Texas says about Harisiades \nv. Shaughnessy is wrong. Had Harisiades just wanted \nto \u201cbuttress\u201d his claims with \u201cintervening authority,\u201d \nBr. 35, he could have done so in an appellate brief. \nInstead, he sought to \u201camend\u201d his \u201cpetition\u201d with new \nfactual allegations supporting a claim under the APA, \nwhich this Court had just held applicable to deporta-\ntion proceedings like his. 90 F. Supp. 431, 432 n.2 \n(S.D.N.Y. 1950). Only later, when the government ar-\ngued that \u201cthe notice of appeal barred the District \nCourt from considering the motion,\u201d did Harisiades \nmove to withdraw his appeal. Id. at 433. Faced with \nthe two motions, the court \u201cfirst consider[ed] the mer-\nits of the original application for leave to amend.\u201d Id. \nat 434. It then spent six pages analyzing \u201cwhether \nthe deportation proceeding was \u2018initiated\u2019 prior to the \n[APA\u2019s] effective date.\u201d Id. at 436. (If so, amendment \nwould be futile.) Finding that it had been, the court \ndenied leave to amend. It then summarily denied the \nmotion to withdraw\u2014which Texas calls the main is-\nsue\u2014in a single sentence. \nNor was the amendment issue simply lurking in \nthe record when Harisiades reached this Court. \nAmong the questions this Court granted was whether \nthe APA \u201cwas applicable to the proceeding against\u201d \n\n8 \n \nHarisiades\u2014a question that entered the case only \nthrough the motion to amend. Pet. for Writ of Cert. at \n5, Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, No. 50-43 (U.S. May 3, \n1951). Harisiades\u2019s opening brief then made clear \nthat he had \u201cmoved to amend\u201d his habeas application \nto allege facts supporting an APA claim after \u201cfil[ing] \na notice of appeal.\u201d Pet\u2019r. Br. at *10\u201311, Harisiades v. \nShaughnessy, 1951 WL 81967 (U.S. Dec. 4, 1951). \nAnd he argued the effective-date issue at length. Id. \nat *23\u201327. \nIf mid-appeal efforts to amend were abusive, this \nCourt had every reason and opportunity to say so. In-\nstead, it reached the \u201ceffective date\u201d question\u2014the \nbasis for denying leave to amend\u2014and affirmed on \nthe merits. Harisiades v. Shaughnessy, 342 U.S. 580, \n583 n.4 (1952). (Texas\u2019s references to \u201cstanding\u201d and \n\u201cconsent\u201d are misleading. Those statements related to \nanother argument, \u201caside\u201d from the APA. Id.) \nb. Texas fares no better with the remaining cases. \nIt first claims (at 36) that Strand v. United States, \n780 F.2d 1497 (10th Cir. 1985), involved mid-appeal \nefforts to supplement the record, not a motion to \namend. Even if that were right, Texas doesn\u2019t explain \nwhy (under its theory) that would not have been abu-\nsive. But Texas is wrong. The prisoner in Strand filed \ntwo mid-appeal motions asking the district court to \nconsider additional factual bases for habeas relief, \nand the Tenth Circuit called those motions \u201c\u00a72255 \npleadings.\u201d 780 F.2d at 1500 (emphasis added). Yet \nneither the United States nor any of the four judges \nwho heard the case hinted that they were abusive. \nTexas has even less to say about our other cases. It \nchiefly observes (at 36) that prisoners who introduced \nnew grounds for relief directly in the court of appeals \ndid not file \u201cRule 15 motions.\u201d Perhaps not. But the \n\n9 \n \nrelief those prisoners sought (and sometimes re-\nceived) was the chance to raise new habeas claims \nmid-appeal: precisely what Texas says was off-limits. \nNor does it matter that reaching the merits might \nsometimes have been \u201ceasier\u201d than applying early \nabuse-of-the-writ doctrine. Contra CJLF Br. 13\u201314. \nThat objection applies equally to the cases this Court \nrelied on in Banister. E.g., Gajewski v. Stevens, 346 \nF.2d 1000 (8th Cir. 1965). Here, as in Banister, what \nmatters is that court after court addressed mid-\nappeal efforts to amend \u201cwithout any comment about \nrepetitive litigation,\u201d 590 U.S. at 515\u2014not even as an \nalternative ground, mentioned in passing. \n2. Texas\u2019s amici cite just one pre-AEDPA case going \nthe other way. In Smith v. Armontrout, the Eighth \nCircuit called the prisoner\u2019s \u201cmotion to remand\u201d the \n\u201cfunctional equivalent of a second or successive peti-\ntion.\u201d 888 F.2d 530, 540 (1989). That court used the \nsame rationale to find Rule 59(e) motions successive \nin a case Banister deemed an outlier. See 590 U.S. at \n515 (citing Bannister v. Armontrout, 4 F.3d 1434, \n1445 (8th Cir. 1993)). Smith is an outlier too. \nFinally, there was no historical habeas practice of \nconstruing mid-appeal Rule 15 motions as Rule 60(b) \nmotions. Contra U.S. Br. 26. The United States mis-\nreads the procedural history of Bonin v. Vasquez, 999 \nF.2d 425 (9th Cir. 1993), which did not involve a mid-\nappeal filing of any sort. (It also double-counts Bonin \nv. Calderon, 59 F.3d 815 (9th Cir. 1995), a later opin-\nion in the same case.) The only takeaway from Bonin \nis that a motion seeking \u201cRelief From Judgment,\u201d \nfiled \u201cpursuant to Rule 60(b),\u201d was \u201cproperly con-\nstrued\u201d as a Rule 60(b) motion. 999 F.2d at 427\u201328. \n\n10 \n \nB. Mid-appeal Rule 15 motions offer a  \nviable path to relief. \n1. This Court may reverse without reaching the \nprocedural issues. The district court ruled on thresh-\nold jurisdictional grounds, holding that Rivers\u2019s pro-\nposed amendment was a second or successive applica-\ntion. The narrowest way to resolve this case would be \nto correct that error, reserving all other questions. \nAnticipating Texas\u2019s objections, we have explained \nwhy motions like Rivers\u2019s are viable. But questions \nabout the meaning of \u00a72244(b) are analytically dis-\ntinct from questions about the procedural path to re-\nlief, and the Court can answer the former without \ntackling the latter. E.g., Morgan v. Sundance, Inc., \n596 U.S. 411, 417 (2022) (\u201cassum[ing] without decid-\ning\u201d several antecedent issues and \u201cconsider[ing] only \nthe next step\u201d). That would be appropriate here, since \ntwo circuits allow mid-appeal Rule 15 motions, and \nthere are strong arguments for their viability. See \nUnited States v. Santarelli, 929 F.3d 95, 105\u201306 (3d \nCir. 2019); Ching v. United States, 298 F.3d 174, 177 \n(2d Cir. 2002). \n2. If the Court reaches the procedural issues, it \nshould apply \u00a72106 and the Federal Rules as written. \na. The procedural debate comes down to vacatur. \nNo one denies that clerks may docket mid-appeal \nRule 15 motions. All agree that such motions cannot \nbe granted absent vacatur. And all agree that Rule \n60(b) is one path to vacatur. Texas, however, needs \nthe Court to go further and deem Rule 60(b) the only \npath. But that ignores \u00a72106, the same statute that \npermits this Court to GVR. E.g., Lawrence v. Chater, \n516 U.S. 163, 166\u201367 (1996) (\u201cWe have GVR\u2019d\u201d under \n\u00a72106 \u201cin light of \u2026 changed factual circumstances\u201d). \n\n11 \n \ni. According to Texas, \u201cevery regional circuit holds\u201d \nthat postjudgment amendment requires \u201crelief under \nRule 59(e) or Rule 60(b).\u201d Br. 23. That is not what the \ncases say. Most of the thirty-odd cases cited by Texas \nand its amici involved efforts to amend after judg-\nment and before appeal, when a movant would need \nto seek vacatur under Rules 59(e) or 60(b). None \ncites\u2014let alone purports to limit\u2014\u00a72106. None holds \nthat a party who secures a reversal must still seek \nRule 60(b) relief before amending. And none suggests \nthat Rule 60(b) is necessary when the court of ap-\npeals vacates without reaching the merits.  \nThe treatises don\u2019t help Texas either. The Wright & \nMiller section \u201cexplaining why Rivers cannot do what \nhe proposes,\u201d Resp. Br. 34, actually states Rivers\u2019s \nrule. \u201c[T]he district court may request the court of \nappeals to remand the case for consideration of the \nmotion for leave to amend and the remand order will \nbe viewed as comparable to a vacation of the lower \ncourt\u2019s judgment.\u201d 6 Wright & Miller, Federal Prac-\ntice & Procedure \u00a71489 (3d ed. June 2024); see 13A \nCyc. of Fed. Proc. \u00a763:11 (3d ed. Jan. 2025) (similar). \nii. The United States insists (at 29) that \u00a72106 may \nnot be used to \u201cavoi[d] the limitations of the federal \nprocedural rules.\u201d But Rule 60(b) does not purport to \nlimit the exercise of appellate vacatur. Nor does it \npurport to be the only path to district-court vacatur. \nRule 60(d)(1) disclaims such exclusivity by preserving \nthe \u201cindependent action,\u201d one of the \u201cold forms of ob-\ntaining relief from a judgment.\u201d United States v. \nBeggerly, 524 U.S. 38, 45 (1998). And this Court has \ntreated \u00a72106 and Rule 60(b) as alternative paths to \nvacatur. See U.S. Bancorp Mortg. Co. v. Bonner Mall \nP\u2019ship, 513 U.S. 18, 29 (1994) (appellate court \u201cmay \nremand\u201d for consideration of Rule 60(b) vacatur \u201ceven \n\n12 \n \nin the absence of, or before considering the existence \nof\u201d grounds for \u00a72106 vacatur (emphasis added)). \nNo case holds otherwise. Contra U.S. Br. 29\u201330. \nUnitherm Food Systems, Inc. v. Swift-Eckrich, Inc., \n546 U.S. 394, 402 n.4 (2006), reasoned that \u00a72106 \ncannot be used to do what this Court had long inter-\npreted Rule 50 to \u201cforbi[d].\u201d But (again) this Court \nhas never held that Rule 60(b) forbids appellate vaca-\ntur. As for Calderon v. Thompson, 523 U.S. 538, 546 \n(1998), that case says nothing about \u00a72106, and the \nNinth Circuit recalled its mandate after this Court \ndenied cert, when all agree that \u00a72244(b) applies.  \nIf the United States is worried that appellate courts \nwill use \u00a72106 to circumvent Rule 60(b), this Court \ncan always clarify the \u00a72106 standards. But this de-\nbate is about vacatur authority\u2014not vacatur stand-\nards\u2014and Rivers has never argued that \u00a72106 is less \nexacting than Rule 60(b). Cf. Bancorp, 513 U.S. at 26 \n(\u00a72106 vacatur is \u201cextraordinary remedy\u201d). \nb. Texas (but not the United States) floats various \nother objections. None is sound. \ni. Rule 62.1 applies to Rule 15 motions, and Texas \ncites no case suggesting otherwise. The phrase \u201cmo-\ntion \u2026 for relief,\u201d Rule 62.1(a), covers \u201cany motion \nthat the district court cannot grant because of a pend-\ning appeal,\u201d Report of the Civil Rules Advisory Com-\nmittee, Dec. 12, 2006 at 14. A motion to amend \u201cfalls \nwithin th[at] scope.\u201d Scriber v. Ford Motor Co., 2024 \nWL 2830499, at *3 (S.D. Cal. June 4, 2024); see Rule \n7(b)(1)(C) (motions must \u201cstate the relief sought\u201d); \nCarbiener v. Lender Processing Servs., Inc., 2014 WL \n12616966, at *2 n.6 (M.D. Fla. Sept. 29, 2014) (\u201cleave \nto amend\u201d is \u201crelief\u201d). Plenty of courts have consid-\nered Rule 15 motions under Rule 62.1. E.g., Scriber, \n2024 WL 2830499, at *3; Louisiana v. Becerra, No. \n\n13 \n \n21-cv-03970, ECF No. 59, at 5 (W.D. La. Feb. 9, \n2022); Beverley v. N.Y.C. Health & Hosp. Corp., 2020 \nWL 5750828, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. Sept. 25, 2020). \nNor does Texas cite (at 32) any case requiring a \nstandalone \u201cRule 62.1 motion.\u201d Rule 62.1 mentions \nonly one motion: the underlying \u201cmotion \u2026 for relief \nthat the court lacks jurisdiction to grant.\u201d Meanwhile, \nthe \u201csplit\u201d that Texas cites is about what to do when \nthere is no underlying motion\u2014not about whether a \nRule 62.1 motion is necessary. Anyhow, Rivers did \nseek an indicative ruling. He didn\u2019t use the magic \nwords \u201cindicative ruling under Rule 62.1(a)(3),\u201d but \nthat is the only plausible way to construe his request \nfor \u201cinterlocutory review.\u201d J.A.107; see also C.A. \nOpening Br. 8; Estelle v. Gamble, 429 U.S. 97, 106 \n(1976) (pro se filings are \u201cliberally construed\u201d). \nTexas is also wrong (at 33) that Rule 62.1 imports \n\u201cRule 60(b)\u2019s deadlines.\u201d A \u201ctimely motion,\u201d Rule \n62.1(a), is a motion that is timely under whatever \nstandards govern that motion. That follows from the \ndrafters\u2019 choice to \u201cg[o] beyond Rule 60(b) motions\u201d \nand \u201cinclude all circumstances in which a pending \nappeal\u201d bars relief. Committee Report at 14. Nor \nwould reading Rule 62.1 faithfully render Rule 60(b)\u2019s \ndeadlines \u201cmeaningless.\u201d Resp. Br. 33. When no ap-\npeal is pending, an amendment must go through Rule \n60(b), and would thus be subject to its deadlines. And \nRule 60(b) is also necessary for relief unavailable un-\nder Rule 15. In all events, Texas\u2019s deadline argument \nassumes (at 33 n.5) that the Rule 60(b)(6) door is shut \nfor newly discovered evidence. But this Court has \nnever held that, and some courts disagree. E.g., \nPETA v. HHS, 901 F.3d 343, 355 (D.C. Cir. 2018). \nii. The State\u2019s Rule 15 objections are nonstarters \ntoo. The heading \u201cAmendments Before Trial\u201d was \u201cin-\ntended to be stylistic only.\u201d Committee Notes on 2007 \n\n14 \n \nAmendment; see also Wright & Miller \u00a71488 \n(\u201c[C]ourts have not imposed any arbitrary timing re-\nstrictions on requests for leave to amend \u2026.\u201d). And \nRule 15(b)(2)\u2019s provision for amendment \u201ceven after \njudgment\u201d simply means that vacatur is unnecessary \nwhen a party seeks to \u201cconform the pleadings to the \nproof.\u201d First Nat\u2019l Bank of Louisville v. Cont\u2019l Ill. \nNat\u2019l Bank & Tr. Co., 933 F.2d 466, 468 (7th Cir. \n1991) (Posner, J.). That doesn\u2019t imply that Rule 15(a) \nbecomes unavailable after the court enters judgment. \nIt just means Rule 15(b)(2) motions\u2014unlike Rule \n15(a) motions\u2014can be granted absent vacatur. \niii. Texas\u2019s response to \u00a72106 is a non sequitur. \nBr. 32. No one is talking about \u201cenlarg[ing] the record \non appeal.\u201d Stanton v. Liaw, 2023 WL 3645525, at *3 \n(7th Cir. May 25, 2023). The point is that appellate \ncourts are \u201cbound to consider any change, either in \nfact or in law, which has supervened since the judg-\nment was entered.\u201d Patterson v. Alabama, 294 U.S. \n600, 607 (1935). If \u201csuch a change \u2026 may affect the \nresult,\u201d courts \u201cmay recognize\u201d this \u201cby setting aside \nthe judgment and remanding.\u201d Id.; see, e.g., Giles v. \nMaryland, 386 U.S. 66, 74 (1967) (plurality) (postcon-\nviction vacatur in light of new evidence); United \nStates v. Shotwell Mfg. Co., 355 U.S. 233, 237 (1957). \nIII. Alternatively, \u00a72244(b) applies only after \nthe initial petition is final on appeal. \nThe Court could also reverse by holding that \n\u00a72244(b) does not apply while an appeal is pending. \n(By clarifying that mid-appeal Rule 60(b) motions are \nnot successive, the Court would also make the proce-\ndural debate a nonissue.) Texas\u2019s criticism (at 37) \nthat Rivers gave \u201ccursory treatment\u201d to this theory is \nbaffling. Historical and purposive arguments for mid-\nappeal amendments equally support the broader \npoint that \u00a72244(b) permits mid-appeal habeas \n\n15 \n \nclaims. Br. 25\u201335. In all events, history confirms that \nmid-appeal Rule 60(b) motions were not considered \nabusive, and only Rivers\u2019s rule responds to AEDPA\u2019s \npurposes. Contra Texas (at 13), Banister did not \n\u201cforeclos[e]\u201d these arguments, and \u201cwhat the Court \ndid say \u2026 hardly advances the [State\u2019s] cause here.\u201d \nPerez v. Sturgis Pub. Schs., 598 U.S. 142, 149 (2023). \nContext. Other provisions of AEDPA tie finality to \na final, nonappealable order\u2014not a judgment. This \nreflects the \u201clong-recognized, clear meaning\u201d of finali-\nty in the postconviction context. Clay v. United \nStates, 537 U.S. 522, 527 (2003). After all, \u201c[w]hen a \nsovereign furnishes an opportunity to appeal \u2026 none \nof the preceding decisions are final in an ultimate \nsense until any appeals are concluded.\u201d Edwards v. \nVannoy, 593 U.S. 255, 287 n.2 (2021) (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring) (quoting 3 W. Blackstone, Commentaries \non the Laws of England 411 (1768)) (cleaned up).  \nTexas retorts (at 38) that Clay is distinguishable \nbecause its rule \u201cpromote[s] federal-state comity.\u201d \nBut Clay involved a \u201cfederal prisoner\u201d and said noth-\ning about comity. 537 U.S. at 524. Nor did Clay limit \nits logic to \u201cthe context of initial federal applications.\u201d \nResp. Br. 38. Speaking broadly about the \u201cpostconvic-\ntion\u201d context, Clay said that finality attaches when \nthis Court affirms, denies review, or when the chance \nto seek cert expires. 537 U.S. at 527. \nHistory. In the decades before AEDPA, what was \ntrue of mid-appeal Rule 15 motions, Br. 27\u201331, was \nalso true of mid-appeal habeas claims generally. \nA. As of 1987, it was settled law that abuse-of-the-\nwrit doctrine did not cover mid-appeal habeas filings. \nTexas would know. As the United States recognizes \n(at 26), the Fifth Circuit remanded to \u201callo[w] \npostjudgment amendment without considering abuse \n\n16 \n \nof the writ\u201d in Petty v. McCotter, 779 F.2d 299, 302 \n(5th Cir. 1986). Texas challenged that ruling, and \nthis Court granted cert (later dismissed as improvi-\ndently granted). Lynaugh v. Petty, 480 U.S. 699 \n(1987) (Mem.). In its opening brief, Texas explained \nthat \u201c[b]ecause there ha[d] been no appellate review \nof the judgment of the district court, there [w]as no \nfinality to that court\u2019s review on the merits.\u201d Pet\u2019r. \nBr. at *23, 1986 WL 728550. In other words (Texas\u2019s \nown): \u201cthe abuse doctrine simply does not apply\u201d \nwhen a prisoner \u201cis sent back to the District Court\u201d \nbecause \u201c[i]t is all the same case. It is not a new \ncase.\u201d Oral Arg. Recording at 10:05, Lynaugh, No. 86-\n1656 (Mar. 3, 1987), bit.ly/Petty_OA. The author of \nGonzalez also weighed in. See id. at 8:29 (Justice \nScalia: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t have seen any basis for arguing an \nabuse of the writ.\u201d). \nB. To show that AEDPA codified the opposite view, \nTexas would need to show that a sea change took \nplace over the next nine years. Nothing of the sort \nhappened. Between 1987 and 1996, at least six cases \naddressed mid-appeal Rule 60(b) motions without \ndeeming them successive. See United States v. Ed-\nmonson, 928 F. Supp. 1052, 1053\u201355 (D. Kan. 1996); \nMay v. Collins, 961 F.2d 74 (5th Cir. 1992); Carriger \nv. Lewis, 971 F.2d 329, 331\u201332 (9th Cir. 1992) (en \nbanc); Ford v. Armontrout, 916 F.2d 457, 459, 461 \n(8th Cir. 1990); Giarratano v. Procunier, 891 F.2d \n483, 486\u201387 (4th Cir. 1989); Schewchun v. Edwards, \n815 F.2d 79 (Table) (6th Cir. 1987). Three went the \nother way. See Guinan v. Delo, 5 F.3d 313 (8th Cir. \n1993); Hunt v. Nuth, 57 F.3d 1327 (4th Cir. 1995); \nBehringer v. Johnson, 75 F.3d 189 (5th Cir. 1996). \nAnd some cases sent mixed signals. See Resnover v. \nPearson, 1993 WL 430159 (7th Cir. 1993); McQueen \nv. Scroggy, 99 F.3d 1302 (6th Cir. 1996). The final tal-\n\n17 \n \nly: lopsided for Rivers. But even if the post-Petty cas-\nes were a draw, that is \u201chardly the sort of uniform \nconstruction that Congress might have endorsed.\u201d \nFogerty v. Fantasy, Inc., 510 U.S. 517, 532 (1994); see \nScalia & Garner, Reading Law 325 (2012). \nPurposes. Both of Rivers\u2019s theories respond to \nAEDPA\u2019s aims. Texas\u2019s theory does not, and its objec-\ntions miss the mark.  \nA. River\u2019s approach furthers all three of AEDPA\u2019s \naims. First, judicial economy. Our rule benefits re-\nviewing courts by flagging mid-appeal claims that \ncould make it \u201caltogether unnecessary\u201d to decide the \nappeal. Banister, 590 U.S. at 516. And all with mini-\nmal burden on district courts whose \u201cfamiliar[ity] \nwith a habeas applicant\u2019s claims\u201d will make for \u201cquick \nwork of a meritless motion.\u201d Id. at 517. Texas objects \n(at 41) that a prisoner whose mid-appeal motion is \ndenied under Rule 62.1(a)(2) could later refile it as a \nsuccessive application. That\u2019s conceivable\u2014although \nany prisoner who sized up the odds would likely take \nno for an answer. Even if he didn\u2019t, however, the \ncourt of appeals would still have \u201cthe benefit of the \ndistrict court\u2019s plenary findings,\u201d id., and could deny \nauthorization in a one-line order citing the prior de-\nnial. By contrast, Texas would channel every mid-\nappeal habeas filing to an appeals panel under \n\u00a72244(b)(3)(B)\u2014demanding \u201ca significant investment \nof time and resources.\u201d Judges\u2019 Br. 6. It would also \nforce the merits panel to decide the original appeal, \neven if every judge involved thought that the new ev-\nidence would change the outcome. That is why this \nCourt\u2019s former colleagues with experience at every \nlevel of the federal judiciary say that River\u2019s rule \n\u201cwill lessen the burden on the judicial system as a \nwhole.\u201d Id. 5. \n\n18 \n \nSecond, mid-appeal habeas claims will not create \npiecemeal litigation. Option A: indicative ruling, re-\nmand, and a decision that \u201cmerges with the prior de-\ntermination.\u201d Banister, 590 U.S. at 509. Option B: the \ndistrict court denies the motion because it doesn\u2019t \neven \u201crais[e] a substantial issue\u201d\u2014which also means \nno certificate of appealability. See 28 U.S.C. \u00a72253(c) \n(requiring \u201csubstantial showing\u201d). By contrast, Tex-\nas\u2019s rule will always create piecemeal litigation be-\ncause the court of appeals will need to open a new \noriginal proceeding to review every mid-appeal habe-\nas claim that comes through the door. \nFinality cuts the same way\u2014at least according to \namici who have \u201copposed \u2026 hundreds of petitions for \nwrits of habeas corpus.\u201d Prosecutors\u2019 Br. 1. \u201cThe only \nputative benefit\u201d that Texas\u2019s rule offers states \u201cis to \nmake it harder\u201d for prisoners like Rivers \u201cto obtain \nhabeas relief given AEDPA\u2019s escalating stringency.\u201d \nId. at 6\u20137. \u201cBut procedurally hamstringing a prison-\ner\u2019s amended habeas filing, particularly where the \nnew filing reflects newly discovered evidence, does \nnot serve any legitimate state interest.\u201d Id. at 7. In-\nstead, \u201cthe interests of prosecutors, victims, and the \npublic alike\u201d favor treating such filings as \u201cpart of the \nstill-pending, first-in-time habeas petition.\u201d Id. \nB. Our timing theory also accounts for repose. \nBr. 40\u201341. Texas doesn\u2019t explain why \u00a72244(b) should \ngrant a state repose before the case is final on appeal. \nInstead, it pivots\u2014claiming (at 41) that Congress \nwanted to \u201cprovide States with certainty that the \nuniverse of claims would be closed once an appeal is \nfiled.\u201d Wrong again. Congress granted prisoners the \nchance to appeal, which means that the \u201cuniverse of \nclaims\u201d could always reopen. Subject only to the law-\nof-the-case doctrine and the appellate mandate, \nstates are on notice that a district court \u201cwill permit \n\n19 \n \nnew issues to be presented by an amended pleading\u201d \nif the appellate court reverses or vacates. Wright & \nMiller \u00a71489. Besides, Congress knew how to close \nthe \u201cuniverse of claims,\u201d but it did so only under \nAEDPA\u2019s capital-habeas opt-in chapter. See Br. 23. \nC. Nothing cuts the other way. Texas chiefly warns \n(at 25\u201326) that our approach opens the floodgates to \nabusive habeas claims. If that is true, it\u2019s fair to ask \nwhy Texas still hasn\u2019t found a single case from the \nSecond Circuit saying so. (The lone case it cites, An-\nderson v. Connecticut, 2022 WL 3082985 (D. Conn. \nAug. 3, 2022), addresses a few civil-procedure ques-\ntions and doesn\u2019t beg the Second Circuit to revisit \n\u00a72244(b).) The Second Circuit may see fewer habeas \ncases than the Fifth, but surely its prisoners are no \nless ingenious. For that matter, if the Second Cir-\ncuit\u2019s reading is so unworkable, why aren\u2019t Connecti-\ncut, New York, or Vermont here supporting Texas? In \nall events, Texas never engages with the daunting \nstructural and doctrinal barriers to relief. Br. 44\u201345. \nOur approach is a safety valve\u2014not a magnet\u2014and \nthe valve doesn\u2019t open unless a prisoner can persuade \ntwo courts that remand is warranted. Any \u201cinsurance \npolicy\u201d claims will fail outright, contra Resp. Br. 44\u2013\n45, and prisoners who seek delay can be sanctioned or \ndeemed vexatious filers.  \nIV. Texas\u2019s remaining arguments fail. \nA. Texas\u2019s outlier rule is unworkable. \nTexas wants this Court to adopt an outlier position \nthat only the Sixth Circuit has embraced. The State \ndoesn\u2019t even try to defend the Fifth Circuit\u2019s after-\nfinal-judgment rule. Pet. App. 10a. Instead, it bor-\nrows a few words from Banister and Gonzalez and de-\nclares that a filing is \u201csecond or successive\u201d if it \n\u201cthreatens an already final judgment\u201d or \u201cseeks to re-\n\n20 \n \nvisit\u201d a merits determination. Br. 20 (cleaned up). \nTexas then announces\u2014out of nowhere\u2014that the \u201cdi-\nviding line\u201d between first and successive petitions \u201cis \nthe filing of a notice of appeal.\u201d Id. 28. That is the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s rule, which it adopted solely to \u201crecon-\ncile\u201d circuit precedent. Moreland v. Robinson, 813 \nF.3d 315, 325 (6th Cir. 2016). No other court agrees.  \nNor does Texas explain how district courts are sup-\nposed to administer its \u201crule.\u201d For example, after the \nRule 59(e) window closes, do federal prisoners get an-\nother thirty-two days to file more habeas claims? See \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B). In the Sixth Circuit, the \nanswer is yes. See Moreland, 813 F.3d at 324. But \nsuch claims would threaten an already final judg-\nment and revisit the merits\u2014so a district court would \nhave to choose between Texas\u2019s ad hoc \u201cdividing line\u201d \nand its \u201crule.\u201d Or consider a timely Rule 59(e) motion \nfiled after the notice of appeal. Is such a filing kosher \n(under Banister) or successive (under Texas\u2019s theory)? \nA district court would have no idea. Meanwhile, our \nrules are clear: \u00a72244(b) doesn\u2019t apply (i) to amend-\nments or (ii) while appeals are pending. \nB. Texas\u2019s vehicle arguments are waived \nand wrong. \nFor the first time, Texas now suggests that what \nRivers filed should not be construed as a motion to \namend. Even if Texas hadn\u2019t forfeited that argument \nbelow and waived it here, it would still be wrong. \nTexas concedes (at 8, 22) that Rivers\u2019s filing over-\nlapped with his first application and sought to \u201cmodi-\nfy\u201d some claims by pleading new facts. By definition, \nthat is a proposed amendment. If any doubt re-\nmained, Rivers clarified the relief he sought before \nthe district court ruled\u2014and just eleven days after \nreceiving the magistrate\u2019s report. 7:21-cv-00012 (N.D. \nTex. Sept. 2, 2021), Dkt. 27, at 10. Texas doesn\u2019t ex-\n\n21 \n \nplain (at 20) why using the prison library\u2019s \u00a72254 \ntemplate changes matters or why Rivers is responsi-\nble for the clerk\u2019s issuing \u201ca new case number.\u201d \nNor can Texas credibly deny (at 44) that the new \nevidence raises questions about Rivers\u2019s convictions. \nAccording to Rivers, the report shows that neither the \nimage nor the video he was convicted of possessing \nwere child pornography. See J.A.69; ROA.4113. While \nTexas may contest the evidence on remand, its claims \nabout the image ring especially hollow. Trial exhibit \n33 lists three files \u201cof [i]nterest\u201d: the two files Rivers \nwas convicted of possessing, plus a false positive. See \nROA.1137\u201338. The report also lists three files \u201cof in-\nterest.\u201d J.A.94. The first file in the report is the first \nfile in the exhibit: the video. The second file in the re-\nport is the second file in the exhibit: the false posi-\ntive. And the third file in the report\u2014labeled \u201cNOT \nCHILD PORN\u201d\u2014matches the exhibit\u2019s description of \nthe image that Rivers was convicted for possessing. If \nTexas thought that its report was talking about a dif-\nferent image, it has had years to say so. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse and remand. \n\n22 \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \n \n \nPeter A.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal monologue, provides no new external evidence about the case. Consequently, my model of the case's legal substance remains stable, but my understanding of the epistemic challenge and the strategy to overcome it has been significantly clarified.\n\n*   **Core Facts (Stable & Confirmed):** The procedural history is unchanged. Danny Rivers filed a second federal habeas petition while his first was still on appeal. The lower courts dismissed it as \"successive\" under AEDPA. The respondent is Bobby Lumpkin, Director of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice.\n\n*   **The Central Legal Clash (Stable & Confirmed):** The core legal dispute remains the interpretation of \"successive\" under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244. The petitioner advocates for a functional definition where a petition is not successive until the first judgment is final and appellate review is complete. The respondent, based on the cert-stage BIO, argues for a formalist definition where any petition filed after the district court's judgment on the first is successive.\n\n*   **Precedential Battleground (Stable):** The key precedents remain *Gonzalez v. Crosby* (supporting the respondent's formalist view) and *Banister v. Davis* (supporting the petitioner's functionalist logic).\n\n*   **Current Uncertainty & Prediction (Stable but with a Refined Plan):** My prediction favoring reversal for the petitioner is unchanged, as it is based on the existing, albeit incomplete, evidence. The primary source of uncertainty\u2014the content of the respondent's merits-stage brief\u2014remains unresolved. However, this observation marks a crucial strategic pivot. Having failed twice to locate the respondent's brief directly, I have now formally recognized this as a methodological failure and have formulated a new, indirect plan to acquire the necessary information. My immediate goal is no longer to find the respondent's brief itself, but to find the **petitioner's reply brief**, which will necessarily summarize and rebut the respondent's arguments, serving as a high-fidelity proxy. The investigation has moved from a direct search to a more strategic, inferential phase.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation is a pure and powerful update to my design-level beliefs. It is a recorded instance of meta-cognition, where I diagnose a strategic failure and design a new, more resilient experimental approach.\n\n*   **Confirmed & Validated Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Reflective Synthesis\" (Demonstrated & Validated):** This `THINK` action is a textbook execution of this principle. I paused, assessed the failure of previous actions (\"Hypothesis-Driven Search Refinement\" was brittle), diagnosed the root cause (potential \"Source/Tool Limitation\"), and planned a new action with higher EIG that also tests a new heuristic.\n    *   **\"Uncertainty-Driven Information Seeking\":** This remains the core driver. The entire thought process is geared toward resolving the single most critical uncertainty (the respondent's merits argument).\n    *   **\"Source/Tool Limitation Awareness\":** This new heuristic is now solidified as a core operating assumption. I have explicitly acknowledged that a null search result is not proof of absence but can be a signal of tool or method failure. I must now actively design around this limitation.\n    *   **\"Cert-Stage Documents as Previews\":** The continued failure to find the merits brief reinforces the critical importance of not over-relying on the BIO as the final word.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **\"Hypothesis-Driven Search Refinement\" (Evolved):** This heuristic has evolved from simple iteration (e.g., \"make query more specific\") to strategic transformation. When iterative refinement fails, the new protocol is to question the search method itself and pivot to a different *type* of information-gathering action.\n    2.  **\"Distinguish Document Types Rigorously\" (Reinforced):** The previous failures, which returned a BIO instead of a merits brief, underscore the need for this. The new plan\u2014to specifically seek a \"reply brief\"\u2014is a direct application of this more rigorous approach to document types.\n    3.  **NEW - \"Indirect Information Retrieval\" (Proposed for Testing):** This is the most significant new strategy. It is formulated as: **\"When direct search for a document fails, search for a document that responds to it.\"** Instead of trying to find Document X, I will now search for Document Y, which I know must summarize and rebut Document X. This is a move from brute-force retrieval to inferential retrieval, a more sophisticated and resilient method for navigating incomplete information environments. My next action will be the first empirical test of this powerful new heuristic."

By successfully locating the petitioner's merits-stage reply brief, I have gained a high-fidelity proxy for the respondent's arguments and a clear view of the final legal battle lines.\n\n*   **Core Facts & Legal Question (Stable):** The procedural history of Rivers's two habeas petitions and the central legal question regarding the interpretation of \"second or successive\" under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b) remain unchanged.\n\n*   **Respondent's (Texas's) Merits Arguments (Newly Inferred):** The petitioner's reply brief allows me to infer the respondent's core arguments with high confidence.\n    *   **Strategic Pivot:** Texas has apparently abandoned the Fifth Circuit's reasoning, which failed to cite or engage with *Banister v. Davis*. This is a significant signal of weakness.\n    *   **New \"Cobbled\" Theory:** Texas is now advancing a new, \"ad hoc\" theory that combines elements from *Gonzalez v. Crosby* and *Banister*, along with a \"time-of-appeal\" rule borrowed from the Sixth Circuit. This suggests they are struggling to find a coherent, precedented basis for their position.\n    *   **Procedural Exclusivity:** A key argument from Texas is that a Rule 60(b) motion was the *only* procedural vehicle available to Rivers and that a mid-appeal motion to amend (Rule 15) is not viable.\n    *   **Other Arguments:** Texas also appears to be raising vehicle/mootness arguments and, according to the petitioner, engaging in \"ad hominem\" attacks regarding the facts of the underlying conviction, which the petitioner dismisses as irrelevant to the statutory interpretation question.\n\n*   **Petitioner's (Rivers's) Rebuttal & Final Arguments (Newly Confirmed & Detailed):** I now have a complete picture of the petitioner's merits-stage arguments.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Amendment-Specific):** A motion to amend under Rule 15 is textually and historically distinct from a \"second or successive application.\" The petitioner argues Congress treated them as separate concepts in the statutory scheme (e.g., \u00a72242 vs. \u00a72244(b)) and that pre-AEDPA historical practice, including a prior argument made by Texas itself in *McCotter v. Petty*, allowed for such mid-appeal amendments without deeming them abusive.\n    *   **Alternative Argument (Timing-Based):** As a fallback, the petitioner argues more broadly that \u00a72244(b)'s gatekeeping provisions do not apply at all until the entire appellate process for the first petition is complete.\n    *   **Procedural Viability:** The petitioner directly counters Texas's \"Rule 60(b) only\" argument by laying out a viable procedural path using Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 62.1 (allowing a district court to issue an \"indicative ruling\" on a motion while an appeal is pending) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (authorizing appellate courts to remand).\n\n*   **Prediction & Confidence (Significantly Updated):** My prediction in favor of reversal for the petitioner is now held with **high confidence**. The petitioner's arguments appear robust, well-grounded in statutory text, historical practice, and key precedents like *Banister*. Conversely, the respondent's apparent abandonment of the lower court's logic in favor of a novel, \"cobbled together\" theory strongly suggests their position is untenable. The petitioner has a clear, compelling narrative; the respondent appears to be on the defensive.",

It demonstrates the immense value of meta-cognition and adapting strategy in the face of repeated failure.\n\n*   **Confirmed & Validated Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Reflective Synthesis\" & \"Hypothesis-Driven Search Refinement\" (Validated):** The previous `THINK` action, where I diagnosed the failure of direct search and formulated a new plan, was a resounding success. It proves that pausing to analyze failures and design new experimental approaches is a highly effective strategy. The heuristic has evolved from simple query iteration to strategic transformation.\n    *   **\"Source/Tool Limitation Awareness\" (Validated):** The reply brief's repeated citation to the respondent's brief (\"Br. 1\", \"Br. 20\") definitively proves the document exists and that my previous null searches were a tool/method limitation, not proof of absence. Designing around this limitation was the correct move.\n    *   **\"Distinguish Document Types Rigorously\" (Reinforced):** This observation powerfully reinforced this heuristic. The search returned both a cert-stage reply and a merits-stage reply. Recognizing the difference based on the heading (\"ON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI\" vs. \"ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI\") was critical to extracting the correct, high-value information.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **NEW & VALIDATED - \"Indirect Information Retrieval\":** This heuristic, formulated in the previous step, has moved from \"Proposed for Testing\" to **\"Validated and High-Value.\"** The principle: **\"When direct search for a document (X) fails, search for a document that responds to it (Y).\"** This proved to be the key that unlocked the entire case. It is a sophisticated and resilient method for navigating incomplete information environments.\n    2.  **NEW - \"Use Rebuttal Documents to Infer Opponent's Strategy\":** This observation demonstrates that a reply brief can be more valuable than the brief it responds to. It not only summarizes the opponent's arguments but also contextualizes them, critiques them, and reveals their weaknesses. This is a powerful technique for competitive analysis.\n    3.  **\"Prioritize Merits-Stage Documents\" (Strongly Reinforced):** While the cert-stage documents provided a good preview, the merits-stage reply brief contained the detailed, final arguments that are dispositive for a prediction. This confirms that once cert is granted, the analytical focus must shift decisively to the merits-stage briefing."

The previous discovery of the petitioner's reply brief was the pivotal event, and this final synthesis confirms its implications, allowing for a definitive prediction.\n\n*   **Core Facts & Legal Question (Stable):** The procedural history remains unchanged: Rivers filed a second habeas petition while his first was on appeal. The central legal question is whether 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2)'s gatekeeping for \"second or successive\" petitions applies to *all* second-in-time filings, or only specific types.\n\n*   **Respondent's (Texas's) Merits Arguments (Stable, High-Confidence Inference):** My inference of Texas's arguments, derived from the petitioner's reply, remains my definitive understanding of their position.\n    *   **Strategic Weakness:** Texas has abandoned the Fifth Circuit's reasoning, a strong signal that the lower court's decision is indefensible.\n    *   **\"Ad Hoc\" Theory:** Their new argument is a novel combination of principles from *Gonzalez v. Crosby* and *Banister v. Davis*, supplemented by a \"time-of-appeal\" rule from another circuit. This lack of a single, coherent precedent suggests a weak and defensive legal posture.\n    *   **Procedural Exclusivity:** Texas's key claim is that a Rule 60(b) motion was Rivers's *only* option, and that a Rule 15 motion to amend is procedurally barred during an appeal.\n\n*   **Petitioner's (Rivers's) Final Arguments (Stable, Confirmed):** The petitioner's arguments are clear, robust, and form the basis of my prediction.\n    *   **Primary Argument (Amendment vs. Application):** The petitioner's strongest argument is that a motion to amend (Rule 15) is textually and historically distinct from a \"second or successive application\" governed by \u00a7 2244(b). This distinction is supported by the structure of the habeas statutes and pre-AEDPA practice.\n    *   **Alternative Argument (Timing):** As a fallback, the petitioner argues that \u00a7 2244(b) does not apply at all until the first petition's appellate process is fully concluded.\n    *   **Procedural Rebuttal:** The petitioner effectively counters Texas's \"Rule 60(b) only\" argument by outlining a viable procedural path using Fed. R. Civ. P. 62.1 (indicative ruling) and 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2106 (remand authority).\n\n*   **Final Prediction & Synthesized Rationale (Finalized):** My prediction is a **reversal in favor of the petitioner, held with high confidence.** The `THINK` action synthesized the arguments into a final conclusion. The petitioner's argument that his filing was a motion to amend a still-pending petition\u2014not a \"second or successive\" application in the statutory sense\u2014is the winning one. Therefore, the answer to the legal question, \"Does 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2244(b)(2) apply to all second habeas petitions...?\", is **No**. It applies only to specific types of petitions that are properly classified as \"second or successive,\" and a motion to amend a pending petition is not one of them.

The overall strategy has been a resounding success, evolving from brute-force search to sophisticated, hypothesis-driven inquiry.\n\n*   **Confirmed & Validated Strategies:**\n    *   **\"Reflective Synthesis\" & \"Hypothesis-Driven Search Refinement\" (Validated):** Pausing to analyze failures and formulate new, targeted search strategies is a highly effective, core heuristic.\n    *   **\"Source/Tool Limitation Awareness\" (Validated):** Recognizing that a null search result may indicate a tool limitation rather than non-existence of a document is critical for avoiding false conclusions and designing workaround strategies.\n    *   **\"Distinguish Document Types Rigorously\" (Reinforced):** The ability to differentiate between cert-stage and merits-stage documents was essential for focusing on the most dispositive information.\n    *   **\"Prioritize Merits-Stage Documents\" (Strongly Reinforced):** The merits-stage briefing contained the final, evolved arguments that were necessary for a high-confidence prediction, confirming their superior value after cert is granted.\n\n*   **Evolved & New Heuristics:**\n    1.  **\"Indirect Information Retrieval\" (Validated & High-Value):** The principle, **\"When direct search for a document (X) fails, search for a document that responds to it (Y),\"** has been proven to be an S-tier heuristic for overcoming incomplete information environments.\n    2.  **\"Use Rebuttal Documents to Infer Opponent's Strategy\" (Validated & High-Value):** A reply brief can be a powerful analytical tool, as it summarizes, critiques, and reveals the weaknesses of an opponent's arguments, sometimes providing more strategic insight than the opponent's brief itself.\n    3.  **NEW & VALIDATED - \"Recognize Informational Sufficiency\":** This `THINK` action demonstrates a new, crucial meta-heuristic: **Know when to stop searching.** An optimal design isn't just about choosing the next best action; it's also about recognizing the point of diminishing returns where the core uncertainty has been resolved and the confidence in a prediction is high enough to terminate the process. This prevents wasting resources on gathering superfluous information. This internal synthesis step serves as the formal check for sufficiency."
