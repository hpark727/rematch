    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2023, Tennessee and Kentucky passed laws restricting certain medical treatments for transgender minors. These laws prohibited healthcare providers from administering puberty blockers, hormone therapy, and sex-transition surgeries to minors for the purpose of altering their appearance or validating their gender identity when inconsistent with their biological sex. Both laws included exceptions for certain medical conditions and provided mechanisms for enforcement, including professional discipline for healthcare providers and extended statutes of limitations for lawsuits.\n\nIn response, groups of transgender minors, their parents, and healthcare providers challenged these laws in federal court. The plaintiffs argued that the laws violated their constitutional rights to due process and equal protection. They sought preliminary injunctions to prevent the laws from taking effect. In both cases, district courts initially granted injunctions, finding that the laws likely infringed on parents\u2019 fundamental rights to direct their children's medical care and discriminated based on sex. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit stayed these injunctions, allowing the laws to go into effect pending further legal proceedings.",

My goal is to predict the Supreme Court's decision on whether a Tennessee law restricting medical treatments for transgender minors violates the Equal Protection Clause. I have two main areas of uncertainty: the specifics of this case (task parameters, \u03b8) and the general principles of SCOTUS prediction in this area (design effectiveness, D).\n\nTo address \u03b8, I need to understand the legal arguments presented by both the petitioner (United States) and the respondent (Tennessee). This includes the specific precedents they cite and how they frame the issue of sex discrimination under the Equal Protection Clause.\n\nTo address D, I need to understand how the current Supreme Court has approached Equal Protection cases, particularly those involving classifications based on sex or LGBTQ+ status. Key precedents like Bostock v. Clayton County are likely relevant, but I need to know how they are being interpreted. I also need to understand the different levels of scrutiny (rational basis, intermediate, strict) and which one is likely to be applied here.\n\nMy first step should be to gather the core arguments of the case. The most direct way to do this is to read the main briefs filed by the parties. I will start by searching for the brief of the petitioner, the United States, to understand their primary arguments against the law. This will provide a strong foundation for my analysis of \u03b8 and will also give me clues about the legal landscape (D) by showing which arguments the Solicitor General believes are most persuasive to the current Court.",

The action correctly identifies the key areas of uncertainty (task parameters \u03b8 and design parameters D) and formulates a sound plan to address them, starting with a search for the petitioner's brief. However, the action itself does not provide any new data to update beliefs about either the specifics of the case or general prediction strategies. The information gain comes from executing the plan, not from formulating it. Therefore, the Task EIG is 0.0 as no new case-specific information is acquired. The Design EIG is minimal (0.1) because articulating a structured approach to a problem is a very weak form of meta-learning, but it doesn't provide evidence to update beliefs about the effectiveness of different prediction strategies.

However, the beliefs are internally consistent and logically integrated, as the agent explicitly acknowledges its lack of knowledge and the need to gather information, which supports a relatively high coherence score (0.8).

Retrieving the petitioner's brief is the single most direct and comprehensive way to learn the United States' legal theory, the precedents they will cite, and the level of scrutiny they will argue for. It will transform my task-specific beliefs from a blank slate to a structured understanding of one half of the case, which is a fundamental prerequisite for any prediction. The Design EIG is also significant. My current design hypothesis is that starting with the Solicitor General's brief is an optimal strategy. Executing this action directly tests and allows for the refinement of this hypothesis. By analyzing the brief's structure and content, I can confirm its utility and learn generalizable patterns about how sophisticated litigants frame arguments for the current Court, thus improving my predictive methodology for future cases. The action is therefore highly valuable for both understanding the specific case and improving my general approach.",

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatients in appropriate cases.2  \n \n2 Those include (among others) the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospi-\ntal; the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital; the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hos-\npital in Columbus, Ohio; the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pitts-\nburgh; Duke Children\u2019s Hospital & Health Center; the Children\u2019s \nHospital of Philadelphia; Children\u2019s National Hospital in the \n \n\n7 \n \nB. Tennessee SB1 \n1. Puberty blockers have been used to treat gender \ndysphoria for 20 years and precocious puberty for more \nthan 30 years.  J.A. 964, 967.  And hormone therapy has \nbeen used even longer\u2014for at least 60 years to treat \ngender dysphoria in adults, and at least 20 years in ad-\nolescents.  See Pet. App. 2a, 5a, 265a. \nIn the last three years, however, state legislatures \nhave adopted a wave of bans on gender-affirming care \nfor minors based on model legislation and legislative \nfindings circulated by advocacy groups.  In 2021, Arkan-\nsas became the first state to enact a ban.  See Ark. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 20-9-1502(a).  In 2022, Alabama followed.  See \nAla. Code \u00a7 26-26-4.  And in the year and a half since, 20 \nother States have done the same.3   \n2. This case is about the ban Tennessee adopted in \nMarch 2023, the Prohibition on Medical Procedures \nPerformed on Minors Related to Sexual Identity, Sen-\nate Bill 1, Tenn.

See Utah Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 58-1-\n603, 58-1-603.1; W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20.  See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B), 68-33-103(a)(1).5  \nSB1 defines \u201c[s]ex\u201d as the \u201cimmutable characteristics of \nthe reproductive system that define the individual as \nmale or female, as determined by anatomy and genetics \nexisting at the time of birth.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-102(9).  \nBecause SB1\u2019s prohibition applies only when a cov-\nered treatment is prescribed to allow individuals to live \nin conformity with a gender identity other than their \nsex assigned at birth, the law does not restrict the \n \n4 See, e.g., Tenn. Pub. Ch. 285 (enacted Apr. 28, 2023) (Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 49-50-805) (limiting students to participating in interscholas-\ntic athletic events \u201conly in accordance with the student\u2019s sex\u201d at \nbirth); Tenn. Pub. Ch. 448 (enacted May 17, 2023) (Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 49-6-5102) (specifying that public school teachers need not refer \nto a student by pronouns inconsistent with the student\u2019s sex as-\nsigned at birth). \n5  SB1 also prohibits surgical procedures provided for the same \npurposes, but that prohibition is not at issue here.  Pet. App. 9a-10a, \n140a-142a.   \n\n9 \n \nprovision of puberty blockers or hormones for any other \npurpose.  The law also explicitly exempts those treat-\nments when they are prescribed \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s con-\ngenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical \ninjury.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  The \nterms \u201c[c]ongenital defect\u201d and \u201cdisease\u201d are defined to \ninclude an \u201cabnormality present in a minor that is in-\nconsistent with the normal development of a human be-\ning of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d but specifically exclude \u201cgender \ndysphoria, gender identity disorder, [and] gender in-\ncongruence.\u201d  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(2).   \nViolations of SB1 are punishable by civil penalties of \n$25,000 for each prohibited treatment, professional dis-\ncipline, and potential civil liability in private suits.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-105 to 68-33-107.  The law took ef-\nfect on July 1, 2023. \nC. The Present Controversy \n1. Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4.

The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v.

SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L. Stutzman, Long-term use of antidepressants, mood \nstabilizers, and antipsychotics in pediatric patients with a focus on \nappropriate deprescribing, 11 Mental Health Clinician 320, 329-330 \n(2021). \n12 See, e.g., Ankita Nanda et al., Adverse Effects of Stimulant In-\nterventions for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD): \nA Comprehensive Systematic Review, 15 Cureus, no. 9, at 9 (Sept. \n2023); Natalia M.

If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state is that I have no knowledge of the specific legal facts, precedents, or arguments in *United States v. Skrmetti*. The current observation, which is an internal reasoning step, confirms this lack of information and outlines a plan to acquire it. It does not introduce any new facts about the case itself. Therefore, my belief about the task parameters remains unchanged: I still need to gather foundational information about the arguments being presented by both the United States and Tennessee, the specific precedents they will rely upon, and how they frame the application of the Equal Protection Clause to the Tennessee law.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was a blank slate regarding effective strategies for SCOTUS prediction. This observation provides the first set of foundational beliefs about methodology. I have learned that a structured approach to this type of prediction task involves:\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** A valuable initial heuristic is to separate the problem into two distinct areas of uncertainty: task-specific parameters (\u03b8: the facts and arguments of the current case) and design-level principles (D: general patterns of judicial decision-making). This helps organize the information-gathering process.\n2.  **Source Prioritization Strategy:** Primary legal documents, specifically the briefs filed by the parties to the case, are the most direct and essential sources for understanding the core legal arguments. This suggests a general principle: begin analysis with primary source documents before moving to secondary analysis or commentary.\n3.  **Strategic Starting Point:** A specific and effective tactic is to begin by analyzing the brief of the petitioner (in this case, the United States, represented by the Solicitor General). The rationale is that the Solicitor General's Office is a sophisticated and respected litigant, and their choice of arguments provides a strong signal about which legal theories are considered most persuasive and viable before the current Supreme Court.\n4.  **Identification of Key Legal Frameworks:** For cases involving the Equal Protection Clause and LGBTQ+ status, a core set of analytical concepts must be investigated. My predictive model must account for:\n    *   The precedent set in *Bostock v. Clayton County* and how it applies to Equal Protection claims (as opposed to its original Title VII context).\n    *   The applicable level of scrutiny (rational basis, intermediate, or strict) that the Court is likely to apply, as this is often determinative of the outcome. This is a critical point of uncertainty to resolve."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has moved from a state of complete ignorance to having a detailed map of the petitioner's legal strategy. The observation of the U.S. Solicitor General's brief provides the first concrete data points for my predictive model.\n\nMy prior belief was simply that I needed to discover the core arguments. I have now learned the United States' specific arguments, which are:\n1.  **The Tennessee Law (SB1) Warrants Heightened Scrutiny:** This is the crucial first step in their argument. They propose two independent reasons for this:\n    *   **It is a classification based on sex:** The brief argues that the law is discriminatory on its face because whether a minor can receive a given medication (e.g., testosterone) depends explicitly on their sex assigned at birth. A male-assigned minor can receive testosterone to advance puberty, but a female-assigned minor cannot receive it for gender-affirming purposes. This argument directly invokes the precedent of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, attempting to port its reasoning from Title VII (statutory interpretation) to the Equal Protection Clause (constitutional law). It also relies heavily on *United States v. Virginia (VMI)*, which requires an \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" for sex-based classifications.\n    *   **It discriminates against transgender individuals:** The brief also argues that the law specifically targets transgender people as a class, which should trigger a higher level of judicial review.\n\n2.  **The Law Fails Heightened Scrutiny:** Having argued for a high bar, the U.S. then argues the law cannot meet it.\n    *   **The State's Interest is Illegitimate:** The brief attacks Tennessee's stated interest in \"encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\" as a form of animus and disapproval of transgender identity, which is not a permissible government interest under Equal Protection jurisprudence, citing cases like *Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan*.\n    *   **The Law is Poorly Tailored:** This is a critical argument that the law is illogical if its goal is truly to protect children from harm.\n        *   **Underinclusive:** The law bans puberty blockers and hormones for gender-affirming care but permits the *exact same medications* to be prescribed to minors for other conditions like precocious puberty or hypogonadism. The U.S. argues this proves the state's concern is not with the safety of the drugs themselves, but with the *purpose* for which they are used (i.e., gender transition).\n        *   **Overinclusive:** The law imposes a categorical ban, ignoring the consensus of major medical bodies (WPATH, AMA, American Academy of Pediatrics) that this care is medically necessary and beneficial in specific, individualized cases, and it usurps the role of parents and doctors.\n\nMy predictive model is now focused on several key uncertainties: how the Court will rule on the level of scrutiny, whether it will extend *Bostock*'s logic to the Equal Protection Clause, and how it will weigh the \"underinclusivity\" argument. I have a list of key precedents (*Bostock, VMI, Hogan, Sessions v. Morales-Santana*) that I must now track in the Court's jurisprudence. My next information-gathering step must be to find Tennessee's response to these specific arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial set of methodological beliefs has been tested and strongly validated, and new, more specific heuristics have been added.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of effective strategy is now:\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** The practice of separating task-level uncertainty (\u03b8) from design-level uncertainty (D) remains a core organizing principle.\n2.  **Source Prioritization Strategy:** This observation powerfully confirms that **primary legal documents are the highest-value initial source**. The petitioner's brief provided a complete, nuanced, and authoritative roadmap of the legal arguments, which is far superior to relying on secondary commentary at the outset.\n3.  **Strategic Starting Point:** The heuristic to **begin analysis with the Solicitor General's brief** has proven highly effective. The SG's office produced a sophisticated and clearly structured argument that establishes a strong baseline for the entire legal landscape of the case. This gives me the petitioner's strongest arguments first, allowing me to anticipate the respondent's necessary counter-arguments.\n4.  **Identification of Key Legal Frameworks:** My initial belief that I needed to investigate the level of scrutiny and the role of *Bostock* was correct. The brief confirms these are the central battlegrounds. I have added the following, more specific principles:\n    *   **The Scrutiny Two-Step:** A common and powerful structure for constitutional challenges is to (1) argue for the highest possible standard of review (e.g., heightened scrutiny) and then (2) demonstrate why the law fails that standard. My analysis of any Equal Protection case must now begin by identifying the level of scrutiny each party is arguing for.\n    *   **The Underinclusivity Heuristic:** A new, powerful heuristic for evaluating Equal Protection claims is to **search for underinclusivity**. The petitioner's argument\u2014that the same drugs are permitted for minors for other reasons\u2014is a potent way to reveal that the state's professed interest (e.g., \"protecting children from dangerous drugs\") may be a pretext for its actual, potentially impermissible interest (e.g., \"preventing gender transitions\"). I will now actively look for this pattern in future cases."

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet.

It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a-3a.  It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nWPATH further relaxed its guidelines in 2012 to rec-\nommend cross-sex hormones for minors under 16.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.   \nIn recent years, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered gender transitioning in mi-\nnors reversed course.  Pet. App. 28a.  Health authori-\nties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the United \nKingdom have all concluded that these interventions \npose significant risks with unproven benefits:   \n\n8 \n \n\uf0b7 Sweden: Sweden\u2019s Board of Health and Wel-\nfare found that \u201cthe evidence on treatment effi-\ncacy and safety is still insufficient and inconclu-\nsive\u201d and that \u201cthe risks\u201d of puberty blockers \nand cross-sex hormones \u201ccurrently outweigh \nthe possible benefits.\u201d  J.A. 337-40, 715-29.   \n\uf0b7 Finland: Finland\u2019s Council for Choices in \nHealth Care found that \u201cgender reassignment \nof minors is an experimental practice\u201d and that \n\u201c[t]he reliability of the existing studies\u201d is \n\u201chighly uncertain.\u201d  J.A. 583-84.  \n\uf0b7 Norway:  The Norwegian Healthcare Investi-\ngation Board concluded that the \u201cresearch-\nbased knowledge for gender-affirming treat-\nment (hormonal and surgical) ... is insufficient,\u201d \nespecially for \u201cthe teenage population.\u201d J.A. \n341-42.   \n\uf0b7 United Kingdom: The United Kingdom\u2019s \nlauded independent review found \u201cremarkably \nweak evidence\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions, emphasizing that the benefits of using \n\u201cpuberty blockers and masculinizing/feminizing \nhormones in adolescents are unproven.\u201d  Inde-\npendent Review of Gender Identity Services for \nChildren and Young People: Final Report 13, \n33, 194 (April 2024) (Cass Review); J.A. 333-35, \n364-68.    \nAcross these reviews, authorities confronted the \n\u201csuggest[ion] that hormone treatment reduces the ele-\nvated risk of death by suicide\u201d in transgender-identi-\n\n9 \n \nfying youth; as the Cass Review emphasized, \u201cthe evi-\ndence found did not support this conclusion.\u201d  Cass Re-\nview at 33; see also J.A. 660-75.  Based on the available \nevidence, these countries now consider medical gen-\nder-transition interventions experimental in minors \nand have effectively banned them outside of controlled \nresearch settings. J.A. 332-42, 409-11, 726-27. \nUndeterred, advocacy groups have doubled down \non aggressive interventions for minors.  WPATH\u2014the \n\u201cleading association,\u201d U.S. Br. 3\u2014crafted the most re-\ncent version of its guidelines \u201cto have serious effect in \nthe law and policy ... even if the wording isn\u2019t quite \ncorrect,\u201d Ex. 184 at 24, Boe v. Marshall, 2:22-cv-184 \n(M.D. Ala.), Doc. 560-34.  And indeed, \u201cideology, not \nscience\u201d drove WPATH\u2019s drafting process.  Eknes-\nTucker v. Governor of Alabama, 114 F.4th 1241, 1261 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (Lagoa, J., concurring in the denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nWPATH initially commissioned a Johns Hopkins-\nled review to provide evidence-based backing for the \nGuidelines.  But it \u201cabandoned\u201d that approach after \nthe review \u201cfound little to no evidence about children \nand adolescents\u201d benefitting from gender-transition \ninterventions.  Boe, Doc. 560-23 at 22-23; J.A. 375-76.  \nAs one contributor put it, \u201c[o]ur concerns, echoed by \nthe social justice lawyers we spoke with, is that evi-\ndence-based review reveals little or no evidence and \nputs us in an untenable position in terms of affecting \npolicy or winning lawsuits.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th \nat 1261 (Lagoa, J., concurring) (quoting Boe, Doc. 560-\n24 at 2).  Instead, the Guidelines purport to rely on a \n\u201cconsensus-based\u201d process that incorporates opinions \n\n10 \n \napproved by 75% of committee members.  WPATH-8 \nat S8, S247.  WPATH\u2019s \u201cconsensus\u201d process left the \ndoor open for prioritizing politics over science.  And \nthat is exactly what happened.   \nFederal officials intervened in the Guidelines\u2019 \ndrafting.  HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel \nLevine pressured WPATH to issue the Guidelines be-\ncause its \u201cfailure\u201d to do so was \u201cproving a barrier to \noptimal policy progress.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-34 at 54.  \nThen, after receiving a preview of the near-final \nGuidelines, Levine\u2019s staff asked WPATH to remove \nthe recommended age minimums because the \u201clistings \nof ages [would] result in devastating legislation for \ntrans care.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-36 at 28-29.  On a later \nZoom call, Levine conveyed that \u201cthe Biden admin-\nistration\u201d worried about the inclusion of age limits for \npolitical reasons and \u201casked [WPATH] to remove \nthem.\u201d  Id. at 11.  \nWPATH members questioned the \u201cethic[s]\u201d of \u201cal-\nlowing US politics to dictate\u201d the Guidelines.  Id. at 32.  \nThey \u201cexplained to\u201d Levine that WPATH \u201ccould not \njust remove\u201d all age minimums \u201cat this stage.\u201d  Id. at \n11.  After all, the \u201cexpert opinion\u201d that called for those \nlimits was the Guidelines\u2019 \u201conly evidence.\u201d  Id. at 57. \nBut the reality that the drafters\u2019 \u201cexpert opinion\u201d \n\u201cwould be influenced by politics\u201d soon set in.  Id. at 32-\n33.  The dam broke when the American Academy of \nPediatrics (AAP) indicated it would oppose the Guide-\nlines if any age minimums were included.  Boe, Doc. \n560-37 at 100-01.  One co-chair objected that accepting \nAAP\u2019s request would \u201cmake a joke of our methodol-\nogy.\u201d  Id. at 101.    \n\n11 \n \nWPATH caved anyway.  Within days of the Guide-\nlines\u2019 release, it abandoned all age minimums.  No-\nwhere do the Guidelines disclose WPATH\u2019s eleventh-\nhour departure from the \u201cconsensus-based\u201d process it \nnow touts.  WPATH-8 at S8.   \nC. Troubling Disclosures in Tennessee \nPrompt SB1. \nAround the same time, media reports disclosed \nthat Vanderbilt University Medical Center was \nproviding gender-transition procedures to minors.  \nJ.A. 161-64.  Some patients \u201cstarted gender-affirming \nhormones at 13 or 14.\u201d  Ex. 1-B, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video \nat 45:41-45:45).  Others received \u201ctop surgery\u201d\u2014i.e., \nmastectomies.  J.A. 181.  Recordings revealed one doc-\ntor stating that \u201ctop surgeries\u201d and \u201croutine hormone \ntreatment\u201d would \u201cmake a lot of money\u201d for the hospi-\ntal. Ex. 1-D, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:11-0:47). \nYet, by Vanderbilt physicians\u2019 own admissions, \nthey \u201cha[d] very, very little data to guide [the] treat-\nment\u201d and were \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Ex.1-G, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 37:29-37:32); J.A. 231.  Van-\nderbilt\u2019s gender-clinic director presented a seminar ti-\ntled \u201cCaring for the Transgender Patient: With little \nevidence, but a lot of love.\u201d  Ex. 1-H, D.Ct.Doc.113-1, \nPageID#1060.  She noted the absence of \u201creal consen-\nsus\u201d about appropriate cross-sex hormone levels.  J.A. \n231.

Still, Vanderbilt broadly offered these \n\n12 \n \nprocedures to youth.  And it warned potential \u201cconsci-\nentious\u201d objectors, \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t want to do this kind \nof \nwork, \ndon\u2019t \nwork \nat \nVanderbilt.\u201d \nEx.1-E, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:01-0:08, 1:10-1:14). \nFollowing these revelations and tracking Euro-\npean developments, a bipartisan coalition of Tennes-\nsee lawmakers passed SB1 to \u201cprotect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  \nThe legislature acknowledged gender dysphoria as a \ncondition involving \u201cdistress from a discordance be-\ntween\u201d a person\u2019s sex and asserted gender identity.  \nId. \u00a768-33-101(c).  But it detailed concerns with using \npharmaceutical and surgical interventions to address \nthis condition in minors. \nSpecifically, SB1\u2019s legislative findings recognized \nthat gender-transition interventions \u201ccan lead to [a] \nminor becoming irreversibly sterile, having increased \nrisk of disease and illness, or suffering adverse and \nsometimes fatal psychological consequences.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-\n33-101(b).  The law further observed that the harms \nassociated with these interventions \u201care [not] yet fully \nknown.\u201d  Id.  And it noted that \u201chealth authorities in \nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom \u2026 have \nfound no evidence that the benefits of these proce-\ndures outweigh the risks.\u201d Id. \u00a768-33-101(e).  At the \nsame time, the legislature found that \u201cminors lack the \nmaturity to fully understand and appreciate the life-\naltering consequences of such procedures.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n101(h).  SB1 drew attention to the \u201cmany individuals \n... express[ing] regret for medical procedures that were \nperformed ... on them ... when they were minors.\u201d  Id.  \nIndeed, the legislature heard from a detransitioner \n\n13 \n \nwho explained that she was not \u201ccapable of making in-\nformed lifelong decisions\u201d as a teenager, and yet doc-\ntors provided transition treatments that severely \ndamaged her body.  House Health Subcommittee (Jan. \n31, 2023), tinyurl.com/5n8ewdsv (59:15-1:02:22). \nSB1 regulates medical practice to address these \nconcerns.  It prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming certain \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, \nor live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the \nminor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or dis-\ntress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and \nasserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  \nRegulated procedures include \u201c[s]urgically removing, \nmodifying, altering, or entering into tissues, cavities, \nor organs\u201d and \u201c[p]rescribing, administering, or dis-\npensing any puberty blocker or hormone.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n102(5).  SB1 allows these procedures to treat different \nconditions, like congenital defects, precocious puberty, \ndisease, and physical injuries. Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  \nAnd it leaves other long-used treatments, such as psy-\nchotherapy, available to minors.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(c). \nD. The District Court Preliminarily Enjoins \nSB1, but the Sixth Circuit Reverses. \nThree minors, their parents, and a doctor brought \na pre-enforcement challenge to SB1, asserting sub-\nstantive-due-process and equal-protection theories.  \nThe federal government intervened.  Then, days be-\nfore SB1\u2019s effective date, the district court held the law \nfacially unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined \nall but the surgical prohibition.  Pet. App. 130a-218a, \n\n14 \n \n219a-221a.  The Sixth Circuit stayed that injunction. \nPet. App. 102a-124a. \nThe Sixth Circuit then reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n101a.  On the equal-protection claim, Chief Judge Sut-\nton, joined by Judge Thapar, concluded that SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions do not \u201cturn[] on sex\u201d or impose a sex classi-\nfication.  Pet. App. 32a.  Rather, SB1\u2019s \u201cclassifications \nturn on presumptively valid age and medical condi-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 36a.   And in imposing those re-\nstrictions, SB1 \u201ctreat[s] similarly situated individuals \nevenhandedly.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a.  Given SB1\u2019s presump-\ntively valid restrictions, the court held that the law \n\u201cdoes not trigger\u201d heightened review.  Pet. App. 33a.  \nApplying heightened scrutiny, the court recognized, \nwould transfer \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d and \u201cfraught \nline-drawing dilemmas\u201d from the \u201carena of public de-\nbate and legislative action\u201d to the unelected federal ju-\ndiciary.  Pet. App. 44a-45a.  That the government \u201cdis-\nagree[s] with the States\u2019 assessment of the risks and \nthe right response to those risks ... does not suffice to \ninvalidate a democratically enacted law.\u201d  Pet. App. \n50a.   \nJudge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  She \nconcluded that intermediate scrutiny applies and that \nSB1 fails that standard, largely based on her assess-\nment of the interventions\u2019 risks and efficacy.  Pet. App. \n59a, 85a-87a. \n \n \n\n15 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  Through SB1, Tennessee lawfully exercised its \npower to regulate medicine by protecting minors from \nrisky, unproven gender-transition interventions.  It is \nnot unconstitutional discrimination to say that drugs \ncan be prescribed for one reason but not another.  \nWeighing risks and benefits, States (and the federal \ngovernment) draw age- and use-based distinctions for \ndrugs all the time.   \nII. SB1 contains no sex classification that war-\nrants heightened review.  It creates two groups:  mi-\nnors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors \nseeking drugs for other medical purposes.  Each of \nthese groups \u201cincludes members of both sexes,\u201d so no \nfacial sex classification exists.  Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 \nU.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974).  Not every law that men-\ntions sex classifies based on sex.   \nThe government\u2019s newfound focus on \u201cgender con-\nformity\u201d flouts law and fact.  Repeatedly claiming that \nSB1 requires conformity does not create a sex-based \nline, and the Equal Protection Clause confers no sub-\nstantive right to non-conforming behavior.  SB1\u2019s risk-\nbenefit assessment of gender-transition interventions \ndoes not push conformity ends anyway.   \nHeightened review also does not apply because \nboys and girls are not similarly situated for purposes \nof SB1.  It defies biological reality to suggest, as the \ngovernment does, that males and females are medi-\ncally the same for purposes of receiving testosterone \nand estrogen. \n\n16 \n \nPivoting, the government seeks to overhaul this \nCourt\u2019s established equal-protection framework by \nconstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test.  Decades \nof precedent foreclose that maneuver.  Importing a \nbut-for approach to identify classifications under the \nConstitution would jettison longstanding limits on dis-\nparate-impact liability, drastically expand the appli-\ncation of heightened review, and clash with other legal \nprotections.  This Court should reject the govern-\nment\u2019s Bostock premise and the resulting doctrinal \nfallout.   \nA doctrinal sea change would be for naught be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  For \npuberty blockers, changing sex changes nothing since \nboth males and females take the same drug; medical \npurpose alone dictates the availability of the drug un-\nder SB1.  And for cross-sex hormones, the government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to reach a \ndifferent outcome.  \nIII. The challengers\u2019 transgender-discrimination \nargument does not justify heightened review.  SB1 \ndoes not classify based on transgender status.  And \neven if it did, this Court should not get back in the \nfraught \nbusiness \nof \ncreating \nsuspect \nclasses.  \nTransgender status does not uniquely warrant ex-\npanding the list of quasi-suspect classifications for the \nfirst time in nearly 50 years. \nIV.  Though rational-basis review applies, SB1 \nreadily satisfies intermediate scrutiny too.  The law \n\u201csubstantially relate[s]\u201d to Tennessee\u2019s undisputedly \n\n17 \n \ncompelling interests.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 68 \n(2001).  Even under heightened review, this Court de-\nfers to legislative factfinding and gives States \u201cwide \ndiscretion to pass legislation in areas where there is \nmedical and scientific uncertainty.\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.  That discretion makes this case easy: SB1 \ncontains specific findings and imposes restrictions in \nan area of medical uncertainty.   \nThe government convinced the district court to \nweigh the risks and benefits itself with no deference to \nlegislative findings.  That is not the proper legal stand-\nard or the judiciary\u2019s role.  Nor should this Court credit \nthe government\u2019s claim of \u201cmedical consensus\u201d given \nits credibility killing silence on the European health \nauthorities that SB1 itself references.  The govern-\nment\u2019s one-sided telling of the evidence misreports the \nmedical landscape.  And its over- and under-inclusiv-\nity arguments both ignore medical reality and fail to \nrebut SB1\u2019s substantial relation to Tennessee\u2019s com-\npelling interests. \nThe Court should affirm. \n \n \n\n18 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State \nfrom \u201cdeny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction \nthe equal protection of the laws.\u201d  That language \u201cwas \nnot designed to compel uniformity in the face of differ-\nence,\u201d Whitney v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, 309 U.S. 530, 542 \n(1940), or to \u201cforbid classifications\u201d entirely, Nord-\nlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992).  Rather, it \u201ckeeps \ngovernmental decisionmakers from treating differ-\nently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\u201d  \nId.  \nTo make out an equal-protection claim, a plaintiff \nmust first identify the classifications drawn by the \nchallenged action. A law contains a facial classifica-\ntion only when it \u201cdistinguish[es] between individu-\nals\u201d based on a particular characteristic.  Shaw v. \nReno, 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993).  For legislation \u201cneu-\ntral on its face,\u201d a plaintiff must show that a law dis-\nparately impacts a particular group and prove that the \nlegislature acted with \u201cdiscriminatory intent or pur-\npose.\u201d  Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. \nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977). \n\u201cWhen those who appear similarly situated are ... \ntreated differently,\u201d this Court looks to the govern-\nment\u2019s basis for the differential treatment.  Engquist \nv. Oregon Dep\u2019t of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 602 (2008).  It \napplies strict scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na suspect class (race, alienage, or national origin) and \nintermediate scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na quasi-suspect class (sex or illegitimacy).  City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440-41 \n(1985).  Otherwise, \u201clegislation is presumed to be valid \n\n19 \n \nand will be sustained if the classification drawn by the \nstatute is rationally related to a legitimate state inter-\nest.\u201d  Id. at 440. \nThose principles compel upholding SB1.  The law \nregulates the practice of medicine by placing age- and \nuse-based restrictions on medical procedures.  It does \nnot classify based on any protected characteristic.  \nAnd SB1\u2019s approach satisfies intermediate scrutiny \nregardless. \nI. \nSB1 Sets Age- and Use-Based Limits on \nMedical Procedures  \nStates exercise broad power over \u201chealth and \nsafety matters.\u201d  Hillsborough Cnty. v. Automated \nMed. Lab\u2019ys, 471 U.S. 707, 719 (1985).  This power in-\ncludes \u201cregulat[ing] the practice of medicine.\u201d  \nMcNaughton v. Johnson, 242 U.S. 344, 348-49 (1917).  \nIndeed, \u201c[t]here is perhaps no profession more \nproperly open to \u2026 regulation\u201d by States.  Watson v. \nMaryland, 218 U.S. 173, 176 (1910).     \nStates routinely exercise their public-health au-\nthority by regulating \u201cmedical treatments for adults \nand children.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  They prohibit or se-\nverely restrict irreversible practices like assisted sui-\ncide and euthanasia, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 719 (1997); Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 797 \n(1997), \u201cintrusive and possibly hazardous\u201d measures \nlike \u201cpsychosurgery and shock treatment,\u201d Aden v. \nYounger, 57 Cal. App. 3d 662, 668, 673 (1976), and the \ngood-faith \u201cadministration, sale, prescription, and use \nof dangerous ... drugs,\u201d Minnesota ex rel. Whipple v. \nMartinson, 256 U.S. 41, 45 (1921).  States\u2019 power over \n\n20 \n \npermissible medical practices is \u201cso manifest\u201d and \n\u201cfirmly established\u201d that it cannot \u201cbe successfully \ncalled in question.\u201d  Id. \nTennessee exercised this power when it passed \nSB1.  That law prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming specific \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either (1) \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify \nwith, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or (2) \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort \nor distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex \nand asserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n103(a)(1). And it allows these \u201cprocedures\u201d for other \nmedical uses.  Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).    \nSB1 expressly draws an age-based line between \nadults and minors.  That type of \u201cdistinguishing\u201d is \n\u201cnot unusual\u201d in medicine or the law generally.  Pet. \nApp. 31a; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a762-38-211(a) (tattoos); \nid. \u00a7\u00a736-3-105, -106 (marriage); W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a716-\n11-1 (sterilization).  And \u201cage is not a suspect classifi-\ncation.\u201d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470 (1991).   \nSB1 further distinguishes between the medical \npurpose for using certain \u201cmedical procedure[s].\u201d  It \nbars certain procedures\u2014surgery, puberty blockers, \nand cross-sex hormones\u2014\u201cfor the purpose of\u201d gender \ntransition.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  But it \nlets physicians use those surgeries and drugs to ad-\ndress distinct medical conditions\u2014e.g., precocious pu-\nberty, congenital defects, disease, and trauma.  Id. \n\u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  Put otherwise, SB1 separates the \nuse of certain surgeries and drugs to facilitate gender \ntransition from their use for different medical reasons.  \n\n21 \n \nEknes-Tucker v. Governor of Alabama, 80 F.4th 1205, \n1233 (11th Cir. 2023) (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nSound medical practice depends on such distinc-\ntions.  A procedure\u2019s risks cannot be isolated from its \nreason for use, since the medical purpose informs the \nrisk-reward calculus.  That is why FDA approves \ndrugs\u2014including those at issue here\u2014only for specific \nlabeled \u201cuse[s].\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7355(b)(1), (d); Benefit-Risk \nAssessment in Drug Regulatory Decision-Making, FDA \n(Mar. 30, 2018), https://tinyurl.com/4xzcw9br.  And it \nis why States frequently impose use-driven re-\nstrictions in medicine.  Doctors can use morphine to \ntreat a patient\u2019s pain but not to assist a patient\u2019s sui-\ncide.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-13-216; see Vacco, 521 U.S. \nat 808-09.  Doctors can perform pelvic surgery on \nwomen who have \u201cgiven birth\u201d but not on women being \nsubjected to ritualistic genital mutilation.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a739-13-110.  Doctors can perform an abortion to \naddress risks to a mother\u2019s life or health but not for \nelective purposes, in many States.  Id. \u00a739-15-213.  \nDoctors can prescribe testosterone to address hormo-\nnal imbalance but not to \u201cincrease muscle mass, \nstrength or weight without medical necessity.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a739-17-430(a)(2).  The list goes on.   \nA State may \u201creasonably\u201d deem a procedure \u201csafe \nwhen used for one purpose but risky when used for an-\nother, especially when\u201d the procedure \u201cis being put to \na relatively new use.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  Tennessee \ndid just that:  The legislature determined that the \ncost-benefit calculus warranted permitting the surger-\nies and drugs subject to SB1 for some reasons and not \n\n22 \n \nothers. That is not discrimination.  It is an even-\nhanded \u201cregulation of a medical procedure\u201d that turns \non the reason for the procedure\u2019s use.  Dobbs v. Jack-\nson Women\u2019s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236 (2022); \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1227.   \nII. SB1 Contains No Sex Classification that \nWarrants Heightened Scrutiny \nA. SB1 does not classify based on sex. \nThe government cannot point to a sex classifica-\ntion under the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork.  And its \u201cgender conformity\u201d argument cannot \nsalvage that failure.  The Sixth Circuit correctly held \nthat SB1 turns on age and use\u2014not sex.   \n1. SB1 draws no sex-based line.  \nFacial sex classification occurs when a law \u201cdistin-\nguish[es] between individuals\u201d based on sex.  Shaw, \n509 U.S. at 642.  A university excludes \u201cwomen.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 520 (1996).  A \nState imposes different rules for \u201cmales\u201d versus \u201cfe-\nmales.\u201d  Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192 (1976).  A \nlaw provides that \u201cmales must be preferred to females\u201d \nfor the handling of property.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. \n71, 73 (1971).  These are \u201cclassic sex classification[s].\u201d \nL.W. Br. 18.     \nTennessee\u2019s law draws no similar \u201csex-based \nline[].\u201d  U.S. Br. 19.   SB1 does not \u201cprefer one sex over \nthe other,\u201d \u201cinclude one sex and exclude the other,\u201d \n\u201cbestow benefits or burdens based on sex,\u201d or \u201capply \none rule for males and another for females.\u201d  Pet. App. \n\n23 \n \n32a.  It does not \u201cdraw any distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d based on sex.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 800.   \nThe government claims (at 21) that SB1 \u201cdefin[es] \nthe prohibited medical care based on the patient\u2019s \nsex.\u201d  The law references \u201csex,\u201d but it does not \u201cdiffer-\nentiate\u201d based on sex.  Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 10.  And \nthat is what matters.  \nAssessing the lines drawn by SB1 reveals the ab-\nsence of any sex classification.  The law creates two \ngroups: (1) minors seeking to use puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormones for gender transition, and (2) mi-\nnors seeking to use puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for other medical purposes.  The first group \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014neither boys nor \ngirls can use these drugs for gender transition.  \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  The second group also \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014both boys and girls \ncan use these drugs for other medical purposes.  Id.  \nUnder Geduldig, this \u201clack of identity\u201d between sex \nand the \u201cgroups\u201d created by SB1\u2019s line drawing means \nthat no facial \u201csex\u201d classification exists.  Id. \nThe government\u2019s requested remedy is telling too.  \nThe government has not sought an injunction that \nwould \u201ctreat boys and girls the same\u201d; it wants an in-\njunction to \u201callow\u201d \u201cpuberty blockers and hormones\u201d to \nbe administered for additional purposes.  Eknes-\nTucker, 80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring); see \nPet. App. 37a-38a.  That request shows that \u201cthe clas-\nsification drawn by the statute\u201d concerns the drugs\u2019 \nprescribed use, not a patient\u2019s sex.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 440. \n\n24 \n \nThe government pivots (at 21) to SB1\u2019s mere \u201cref-\nerenc[e]\u201d to sex.  But not every law that mentions sex \nclassifies based on sex.  Pet. App. 36a.  Take this hy-\npothetical statute: \u201cNeither men nor women may drive \nan automobile without a license.\u201d  It uses \u201csex-based \nterms,\u201d U.S. Br. 2, 13, but draws no sex-based lines.  \nThe mere \u201cuse of gender specific\u201d versus \u201cneutral\u201d \nterms has never controlled the sex-classification in-\nquiry.  Cf. Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 64.  Otherwise, myriad \nlaws without sex or race classifications would \u201crequire \nheightened review.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  This Court rejects \nthat approach.  See Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 232 n.14; Jam \nv. Int\u2019l Fin. Corp., 586 U.S. 199, 208 (2019) (42 U.S.C. \n\u00a71981, which mentions \u201cwhite\u201d citizens, treats all \nraces equally).  So while SB1 uses \u201cthe word \u2018sex,\u2019\u201d it \ndoes not include \u201ca sex classification\u201d within the \nmeaning of \u201cequal-protection caselaw.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nThat conclusion in no way threatens the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cindividual[s].\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 24.  Tennessee\u2019s point is not that laws like \nSB1 can classify by sex yet avoid sex-based scrutiny \nby harming boys and girls \u201cin equal degree.\u201d  L.W. Br. \n27-28; accord U.S. Br. 24.  The point is that SB1 con-\ntains no sex classification at all.  A law taxing all citi-\nzens burdens both men and women, but like SB1, it \ndoes not burden both men and women through a sex \nclassification.  The cases cited by the challengers (at \nU.S. Br. 24; L.W. Br. 27-28) drive home this distinc-\ntion:  Striking a juror because he\u2019s a man (J.E.B.) or \nbecause he\u2019s black (Powers) are actions that classify \nbased on sex or race.   No such sex classification exists \nin SB1; the law differentiates based on age and use.   \n\n25 \n \n2. The government\u2019s gender-conformity \nassertions show no sex classification. \nNor does SB1 classify based on sex by restricting \nminors from engaging in \u201cnon-conforming\u201d behavior.  \nU.S. Br. 22-23, 41; L.W. Br. 22-23, 28.   \nFor starters, not all restrictions on non-conform-\ning behavior involve a sex-based classification.  Con-\nsider a pair of contrasting examples: (1) a school dress \ncode that requires boys to wear pants and girls to wear \nskirts and (2) a school dress code that permits only \npants.  A boy wants to wear a skirt, asserting a non-\nconformity interest.  Under the first policy, a sex-\nbased line regulates the boy:  girls can wear skirts, and \nboys cannot.  Under the second policy, by contrast, no \nsex-based line exists:  no one can wear skirts.  In both \nexamples, the boy wants to engage in a \u201cnon-conform-\ning\u201d activity that is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with stereotypical \nattire.  And in both examples, the boy is prohibited \nfrom doing so.  Yet only the first policy draws a sex-\nbased line.  The second policy, like SB1, does not.   \nThe plaintiffs err (at 22, 28) by equating SB1 to \nlaws that expressly classify religions, races, or the \nsexes.  A law prohibiting \u201cpeople from working in pro-\nfessions \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 their sex\u201d creates sex-\nbased lines: for some jobs, a male can have the job and \na female cannot, and vice versa.  SB1 imposes no sim-\nilar classification. \nAnd no authority permits an equal-protection \nclaim for \u201cpeople who fail to conform\u201d absent any sex-\nbased classification.  L.W. Br. 21; see U.S. Br. 23.  In-\nstead, cases like Craig (different male-female alcohol \n\n26 \n \npurchasing rules), Virginia (different male-female ad-\nmissions rules), and Morales-Santana (different male-\nfemale immigration rules) all involved clear, facial sex \nclassifications.  Craig, 429 U.S. at 198-99; Virginia, \n518 U.S. at 532-33; Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. 47, 62-63 (2017).  Though they discussed stereo-\ntyping in applying intermediate scrutiny, they did not \nuse that concept to conjure a sex classification from a \nsex-neutral rule.   \nTo the extent the government now attempts to \nbackdoor in an Arlington Heights discriminatory-pur-\npose claim through \u201cconformity,\u201d U.S. Br. 22, that ar-\ngument likewise fails.  The government never mean-\ningfully pressed this argument below, and it points to \nno disparate impact on one sex.  More important, \nSB1\u2019s aim is not \u201c[e]nforcing conformity.\u201d  L.W. Br. 42.   \nTennessee enacted SB1 \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  In \ndetailed findings, SB1 catalogs Tennessee\u2019s interests \nin regulating early gender-transition interventions to \nprotect minors and the integrity of the medical profes-\nsion.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(b)-(m).  Along the way, SB1 men-\ntions encouraging minors \u201cto appreciate\u201d and not be \n\u201cdisdainful of their sex\u201d as they \u201cundergo puberty.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  But contra challengers\u2019 repeated \nassertions, that language is no smoking gun.  Cf. L.W. \nBr. 1, 23, 42, 52; U.S. Br. 2, 8, 16-18, 22, 27, 32-34, 49.  \nIt simply acknowledges the problems with using un-\nproven gender-transition interventions on minors.  \nGiven high desistance rates among youth and the \ntragic \u201cregret\u201d of detransitioners, it was not improper \nto conclude that kids benefit from additional time to \n\n27 \n \n\u201cappreciate their sex\u201d before embarking on body-alter-\ning paths.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  Nor \nis it improper for the State to protect minors from pro-\ncedures that \u201cencourage [them] to become disdainful of \ntheir sex\u201d\u2014and thus at risk for serious psychiatric \nconditions.  Id. (emphasis added).  Especially when re-\nsearch shows that gender-transition interventions can \nmake mental distress worse.  J.A. 400-01.  \nThe government may disagree with that research. \nBut it cannot cast SB1 as stereotype-driven by carica-\nturing legislative findings that detail a range of health \nconcerns.  Chanting a \u201cconformity\u201d mantra does not \novercome the heavy \u201cpresumption of legislative good \nfaith,\u201d Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 603 (2018), or \ndrown out the compelling concerns that drove SB1. \nAnd it is insincere because\u2014even if that language \nwere omitted\u2014the government would be here chal-\nlenging SB1\u2019s restrictions all the same. \n3. The Sixth Circuit properly applied \nthe sex-classification framework.  \nThe government\u2019s claim that Chief Judge Sutton \n\u201cfundamentally misunderstood\u201d equal-protection law \ndistorts the decision below.  U.S. Br. 16.  The Sixth \nCircuit did not spottily concede a sex classification \u201cat \ntimes.\u201d  U.S. Br. 18-19, 24-25.   It found \u201cno\u201d sex-based \nline in SB1, period.  Pet. App. 32a.  Having concluded \nthat SB1 lacks any sex classification, the court \nproperly declined to apply heightened review.  Pet. \nApp. 32a-33a.   \nThat decision in no way \u201cconflates the classifica-\ntions drawn by the law with the state\u2019s justification for \n\n28 \n \nit.\u201d  U.S. Br. 26.  The Sixth Circuit recognized that the \n\u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d or \u201crisk-reward assessment\u201d for \na procedure depends on the reason for the procedure\u2019s \nuse.  Pet. App. 34a, 37a.  It highlighted that fact to \nhelp explain that SB1 classifies by procedures\u2019 distinct \nmedical uses, not patients\u2019 sex.  Id. \nThe challengers attack the Sixth Circuit for stat-\ning that the \u201cnecessity of heightened review[] will not \nbe present every time that sex factors into a govern-\nment decision.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2 (quoting Pet. App. 39a); \nU.S. Br. 24-25.  But that\u2019s just a rejection of the gov-\nernment\u2019s attempted use of but-for causation to create \na novel class of Bostock-based equal-protection claims.  \nSee infra Part II.C.  As the Sixth Circuit recognized, \nDobbs and Geduldig reject heightened scrutiny for \nsex-adjacent restrictions that draw no sex-based lines.  \nPet. App. 39a; infra 33-34.  Whether those decisions \nare characterized as concluding that no sex classifica-\ntion exists, infra 32-35, or that heightened scrutiny \ndoes not apply to sex-adjacent claims, Pet. App. 39a, \nthe result is the same.  It is the government and plain-\ntiffs, not the Sixth Circuit, that \u201cbreak[] from a half \ncentury of this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2. \nB. Boys and girls are not similarly situated \nfor purposes of SB1.  \nThe challengers\u2019 arguments fail for the independ-\nent reason that boys and girls \u201care not similarly situ-\nated\u201d for purposes of SB1\u2019s restrictions.  Michael M. v. \nSuperior Court, 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981) (plurality). \nAs the Sixth Circuit correctly noted, the sexes\u2019 biolog-\nical differences provide yet another basis for declining \nheightened scrutiny.  Pet. App. 39a.   \n\n29 \n \nThis Court has never read the Equal Protection \nClause to \u201crequire things which are different in fact or \nopinion to be treated in law as though they were the \nsame.\u201d  Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 147 (1940).  It \nhas instead analyzed a law\u2019s justifications only after \ndetermining that \u201cthose who appear similarly situated \nare \u2026 treated differently.\u201d  Engquist, 553 U.S. at 602.  \nScores of lower-court cases agree and treat this \u201csimi-\nlarly situated\u201d question as a threshold inquiry.1   \nUnder this approach, \u201cthe absence of similarly sit-\nuated individuals treated differently is \u2026 simply a \nway of saying that the plaintiff failed at the first step \nto prove intentional discrimination\u201d\u2014a step that must \nbe satisfied \u201c[b]efore a court may get to the business of \nassessing\u201d the law\u2019s justifications.  SECSYS v. Vigil, \n666 F.3d 678, 688-89 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.).   \nNguyen\u2019s mention of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d in apply-\ning scrutiny is not to the contrary.  Cf. L.W. Br. 35-36; \nU.S. Cert. Reply 5.  That discussion came only after \nconcluding that a law treated men and women differ-\nently \u201cunder like circumstances.\u201d  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at \n60.  And whether boys are similarly situated to girls \n \n1 See, e.g., People v. Whitfield, 888 N.E.2d 1166, 1172-73 (Ill. \n2007), as modified (Apr. 23, 2008); Timberland Partners XXI v. \nIowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 757 N.W.2d 172, 175 (Iowa 2008); In re \nWeisgerber, 169 P.3d 321, 328 (Kan. 2007); Benitez v. Rasmussen, \n626 N.W.2d 209, 219 (Neb. 2001); Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 \nF.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001); Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, \n1312-13 (10th Cir. 1998); Women Prisoners v. D.C., 93 F.3d 910, \n924 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Klinger v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 31 F.3d 727, 731 \n(8th Cir. 1994). \n\n30 \n \nfor purposes of SB1 matters at the outset, even if it \nalso matters when analyzing means-ends fit. \nThe challengers\u2019 reliance on \u201cBostock\u2019s framework \nfor identifying sex discrimination\u201d supports the simi-\nlarly situated inquiry\u2019s gatekeeping role.  L.W. Br. 18; \nU.S. Br. 27.  Bostock stated that discrimination re-\nquires showing that the plaintiff was treated \u201cworse \nthan others who are similarly situated.\u201d  590 U.S. at \n657.  It just deemed that prerequisite met since \u201cho-\nmosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to \nemployment decisions.\u201d  Id. at 660.  If this Court con-\nstitutionalizes Bostock\u2019s but-for standard (it should \nnot, see infra Part II.C), then Bostock\u2019s similarly situ-\nated requirement must travel alongside. \nThe government previously proposed shoehorning \nthe similarly situated requirement into the applica-\ntion of intermediate scrutiny.  U.S. Cert. Reply 5.  But \nit never explains how the similarly situated inquiry \nfits into that analysis or why boys and girls are similar \nfor purposes of receiving cross-sex hormones.  Instead, \nit generally contests the evidentiary basis for restrict-\ning gender-transition procedures for minors. U.S. Br.  \n39-50.  That analysis ducks the similarly situated in-\nquiry altogether.   \nHere, there is no question that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 \u201cen-\nduring\u201d \u201c[p]hysical differences\u201d keep them from being \nsimilarly situated with respect to SB1\u2019s restriction on \ncross-sex hormones.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  \nProviding testosterone to a boy with delayed puberty \naddresses a distinct medical condition, whereas \nproviding it to a girl causes a physical condition (se-\nvere hyperandrogenism).  Supra 6; J.A. 500-01, 521-\n\n31 \n \n22, 769-79.  Similarly, providing estrogen to a girl with \npremature ovarian insufficiency addresses a distinct \nmedical condition, whereas providing it to a boy causes \na physical condition (hyperestrogenemia).  Supra 6; \nJ.A. 779-81; ES Guidelines at 3886. \nThe government\u2019s sex-discrimination argument \nwould compel this Court to accept that males and fe-\nmales are medically the same for SB1\u2019s purposes\u2014and \nthat providing testosterone to a female to transition is \nthe \u201csame treatment\u201d as providing it to a male with a \nphysical malady.  U.S. Br. 2, 15, 18, 28.  No equal-pro-\ntection test requires this anti-science mendacity. \nC. Bostock does not render SB1 sex based. \nFailing the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork, the government asks this Court to create a new \ncategory of sex classifications based on Bostock\u2019s but-\nfor logic.  U.S. Br. 21-23.  The briefing pitches this step \nas \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cobvious[].\u201d  L.W. Br. 16; U.S. Br. 21.  \nBut \u201cthis wolf comes as a wolf.\u201d  Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 699 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Using \nbut-for-sex reasoning to trigger heightened scrutiny \nwould make a hash of this Court\u2019s equal-protection ju-\nrisprudence.  It would conflict with Bostock\u2019s reason-\ning.  And it would drastically expand heightened re-\nview.  This Court should reject the government\u2019s mis-\nuse of Bostock.  But even under the but-for test, the \ngovernment loses.   \n\n32 \n \n1. This Court has never taken a but-for \napproach to equal-protection \nclassifications.  \nConstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for rule would \nabrogate decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.   \nCurrently, a challenger has two paths to height-\nened equal-protection review: a facial classification or \na disparate impact plus discriminatory purpose.  SB1 \ndoes not facially classify by sex.  Supra Part II.A.  So \nthat leaves only the \u201csensitive inquiry\u201d into whether \nfacially neutral laws were in fact driven by \u201cdiscrimi-\nnatory intent or purpose.\u201d  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \nat 265-66.  To make that showing, the asserted \u201cdis-\ncriminatory intent or purpose\u201d must target the suspect \ncharacteristic at issue\u2014not some other characteristic.  \nId. at 265; see Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health \nClinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993) (sex-based claim \u201cde-\nmand[s] ... at least a purpose that focuses upon women \nby reason of their sex\u201d).   \nThe government invents a third path.  It claims \nthat heightened review applies when some non-sex-\nbased classification incorporates sex as a but-for mat-\nter.  That argument contradicts scores of cases.   \nMost obviously, but-for causation conflicts with \nthis Court\u2019s sexual-orientation cases.  For decades, \nthis Court has faced claims of sexual-orientation dis-\ncrimination under equal-protection theories\u2014includ-\ning Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996); United States \nv. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013); and Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 651 (2015).  \u201cBut in those cases, \nthe Court never suggested that sexual orientation dis-\n\n33 \n \ncrimination is just a form of sex discrimination.\u201d  Bos-\ntock, 590 U.S. at 797 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  It \nis \u201cimplausible\u201d to suggest that \u201cin all of those sexual \norientation cases\u201d the Court \u201coverlook[ed] the fact that \nsexual orientation discrimination is actually a form of \nsex discrimination\u201d under the Constitution.  Id. at 798.   \nPregnancy and abortion cases also belie a but-for \napproach.  In Geduldig, this Court assessed whether \nexcluding conditions arising from pregnancy from dis-\nability benefits coverage denied women equal protec-\ntion.  417 U.S. at 489.  It said no, even though sex is a \nbut-for cause of pregnancy and despite the dissent\u2019s \ncounter that \u201c[i]n effect, one set of rules is applied to \nfemales and another to males.\u201d  Id. at 501 (Brennan, \nJ., dissenting).  The Court kept its focus on the \u201clegis-\nlative classification\u201d and the groups that classification \ncreated.  Id. at 496 n.20.  It emphasized that a preg-\nnancy-related restriction \u201cis a far cry from cases like \nReed \u2026 and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 \n(1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as \nsuch.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nBray reiterated that reasoning when rejecting an \nargument that anti-abortion demonstrations consti-\ntuted \u201cipso facto\u201d discrimination \u201cagainst women as a \nclass.\u201d  506 U.S. at 271.  Bray reached that result over \na dissent that contended that \u201c[a] classification based \non pregnancy is a sex-based classification\u201d because \n\u201cthe capacity to become pregnant is a characteristic \nnecessarily associated with one\u201d sex.  Id. at 323 n.20, \n327 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This Court has declined \nto \u201crevisit\u201d this line of precedent.  Coleman v. Ct. of \n\n34 \n \nAppeals, 566 U.S. 30, 54 (2012) (Ginsburg, J., dissent-\ning).  It remains good law.  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236.    \nMore generally, a but-for approach is incompatible \nwith the conceptual underpinning of equal-protection \njurisprudence.  Heightened review rests on the idea \nthat \u201ccertain classifications \u2026 supply a reason to infer \nantipathy\u201d on the part of lawmakers.  Pers. Adm\u2019r of \nMass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979).  The Court \nreplaces the presumption of legislative validity with \nheightened review only after a robust showing tied to \na particular characteristic.   Infra 44-45.  But in the \ngovernment\u2019s \nview, \nnon-suspect \nclasses \n(here, \ntransgender-identifying persons) could receive height-\nened protection by leveraging a different suspect char-\nacteristic (here, sex).  That approach transforms the \nobject of heightened protection and, in doing so, di-\nvorces heightened scrutiny from its justification. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 but-for argument finds no support in \ncases applying heightened scrutiny when sex is one \namong several classifications.  L.W. Br. 30.  Courts \nsometimes face laws that classify based on sex and \nsomething else.  For example, in Craig, a state law \nprohibited the sale of beer to males under 21 and fe-\nmales under 18, drawing lines based on sex and age.  \n429 U.S. at 192.  Packaging sex classifications with \nother considerations does not somehow immunize the \nsex classification from scrutiny.  But there must be a \nclassification based on sex itself to trigger heightened \nreview.  None of plaintiffs\u2019 cited cases (at 30) support \nusing but-for reasoning to transform a non-sex-based \nclassification into a sex classification.  This Court\u2019s \n\n35 \n \ntask is \u201conly to measure the basic validity of the legis-\nlative classification\u201d drawn.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 272.   \n2. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications defies \nBostock\u2019s reasoning. \nBostock disavowed any extension of its Title VII \nreasoning to other laws, like the Equal Protection \nClause.  For good reason.  \u201cThe Constitution is not a \nstatute,\u201d R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U.S. 330, \n346-47 (1935), and this Court has \u201cnever held that the \nconstitutional standard for adjudicating claims of in-\nvidious ... discrimination is identical to the standards \napplicable under Title VII,\u201d Washington v. Davis, 426 \nU.S. 229, 239 (1976).  And Bostock\u2019s reasoning refutes \nthe government\u2019s attempt to transplant Title VII\u2019s \nbut-for test. \nFirst, Bostock\u2019s analysis was driven by Title VII\u2019s \n\u201cstarkly broad\u201d text.  590 U.S. at 680.  That text makes \nit \u201cunlawful \u2026 for an employer\u201d to take certain em-\nployment actions \u201cbecause of ... race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e-2(a)(1).  \nWith that wording, it is \u201calways unlawful\u201d (absent an \nenumerated defense) to take covered actions \u201cbecause \nof\u201d sex.   Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Presi-\ndent & Fellows of Harvard Coll. (SFFA), 600 U.S. 181, \n309 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  And Bostock \nread Title VII\u2019s \u201cbecause of\u201d language to require a \u201cfo-\ncus[] on but-for discrimination.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  But \nthe Equal Protection Clause \u201ccontains none of the text \nthat the Court interpreted in Bostock.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1229.  Instead, in language adopted almost \na century earlier, the Equal Protection Clause directs \n\n36 \n \na \u201cfocus[] on the denial of equal protection.\u201d  Pet. App. \n40a.  Unlike Title VII, that constitutional requirement \n\u201caddresses all manner of distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d and has been read to \u201cimpl[y] different degrees \nof judicial scrutiny for different kinds of classifica-\ntions.\u201d  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 308 (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring).  \u201cThat such differently worded provisions should \nmean the same thing is implausible on its face.\u201d  Id.; \nsee Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP, 144 S.Ct. \n1221, 1260 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring).    \nSecond, structural considerations cut differently.  \nTitle VII incorporates a \u201csweeping\u201d but-for standard \nyet cabins liability to certain employment actions and \nemployers.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656-57.  As Bostock \nnoted, Title VII\u2019s non-discrimination rule also inter-\nacts with the statute\u2019s defenses and protections ap-\npearing in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  Id. \nat 681-82; Pet. App. 41a.  Those statutory features \ncheck the extension of broad but-for-based liability be-\nyond Title VII\u2019s limited coverage.  By contrast, the \nEqual Protection Clause governs all governmental ac-\ntion and lacks the deliberate checks that Bostock \nstressed.  Subjecting all governmental action to but-\nfor liability would collide with religious liberties and \nother constitutional rights in a manner Bostock no-\nwhere endorsed.   \nThird, Bostock\u2019s but-for standard fits with this \nCourt\u2019s \u201cthree ... leading precedents\u201d on Title VII.  590 \nU.S. at 663.  But as discussed, this Court\u2019s equal-pro-\ntection precedents cut the opposite way.  Supra 32-35.   \nFourth, congressional revisions to Title VII drive \nhome key distinctions between Title VII and the Equal \n\n37 \n \nProtection Clause.  Originally, this Court applied \nGeduldig\u2019s classification test to reject the argument \nthat Title VII\u2019s reference to \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d covers \npregnancy discrimination.  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, \n429 U.S. 125, 133-36 (1976).  Congress responded by \nspecifying that \u201cbecause of sex\u201d includes discrimina-\ntion \u201con the basis of pregnancy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e(k)\u2014\nconfirming that Title VII\u2019s causal inquiry sweeps be-\nyond the classification-focused Equal Protection \nClause.   \n3. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications would \nsubvert sex-based review.   \nConstitutionalizing a but-for approach would re-\nmove important guardrails on heightened review. \nAdopting the government\u2019s logic would open the \ndoor to disparate-impact liability under the Constitu-\ntion.  Laws relating to sex-specific medical proce-\ndures\u2014whether prostate cancer treatments, circumci-\nsions, erectile-dysfunction medications, or breast-\nfeeding therapies\u2014may have to \u201crun[] the gauntlet of \nskeptical judicial review\u201d under the theory that sex is \na but-for cause.  Pet. App. 35a-36a.  The same would \ngo for pregnancy-related restrictions, contra Geduldig, \nand for abortion regulations, contra Dobbs.   \nThe heightened-scrutiny fallout would spiral be-\nyond sex.  Are government employers\u2019 no-visa-spon-\nsorship policies unconstitutional because national \norigin is a but-for cause of needing a visa?  Is race a \nbut-for cause when a university credits an applicant\u2019s \nessay about how racial discrimination \u201caffected his or \n\n38 \n \nher life\u201d?  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 230.  Is racial lineage a \nbut-for cause of any law regulating tribal members?  \nSee 25 U.S.C. \u00a71915(a); 1 Navajo Nation Code \u00a7701.  \nAccepting the government\u2019s theory would leave courts \npuzzling through these and whatever other but-for co-\nnundrums creative lawyers concoct. \nA but-for approach would also allow new classes to \nwield heightened scrutiny in a way that harms \nwomen.  Women\u2019s heightened legal protections reflect \ntheir history of being targeted with \u201cpervasive\u201d dis-\ncrimination and disadvantage.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n273.  But if the government\u2019s theory holds, men who \nidentify as women could claim constitutionally based \naccess to women\u2019s bathrooms,2 women\u2019s locker rooms,3 \nand women\u2019s sports.4  Accepting that theory would \nperversely erode women\u2019s rights and jeopardize land-\nmark statutes protecting women\u2019s equal access to \nschools, winners\u2019 podiums, and beyond.    \nOn top of all that, the but-for causation test would \nset the Equal Protection Clause on a collision course \nwith the Free Exercise Clause.  Conflicting rights will \narise for doctors at State-run hospitals with conscien-\ntious objections, students whose religious convictions \nprevent the sharing of intimate spaces with the oppo-\nsite sex, and so on.  Unlike Congress in the statutory \n \n2 U.S. Br., Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. John\u2019s Cnty., No. 18-13592, \n(11th Cir.), Doc. 254. \n3 U.S. Statement, Roe v. Critchfield, No. 1:23-cv-00315-DCN (D. \nIdaho), Doc. 41. \n4 U.S. Br., B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 23-1078 (4th \nCir.), Doc. 68. \n\n39 \n \ncontext, this Court could not carve the government\u2019s \nproposed but-for-sex mandates out of the Constitution \nto protect \u201csincere[]\u201d religious views.  Religious Sisters \nof Mercy v. Becerra, 55 F.4th 583, 598 (8th Cir. 2022).  \nNor would \u201cfederal conscience laws\u201d be an out, since \nthe Constitution would trump.  FDA v. All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 387 (2024).  The impossible \ntask of measuring the relative import of conflicting re-\nligion and equal-protection claims is yet another prob-\nlem attending the government\u2019s but-for test.   \n4. Regardless, sex is not a but-for cause \nin SB1.  \nThis Court should reject the but-for test outright. \nBut the government loses even under its own test be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  \nChanging a person\u2019s \u201csex\u201d does not change the availa-\nbility of the drugs regulated by SB1.    \nPuberty Blockers:  The government\u2019s argument \nbarely mentions puberty blockers.  Fitting, because \n\u201cpuberty blockers involve the same drug used equally \nby gender-transitioning boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 38a \n(emphasis added).  If a boy seeks puberty blockers to \ntransition, he cannot have them.  If a girl seeks pu-\nberty blockers to transition, she cannot have them.  So \n\u201cholding other things constant but changing the mi-\nnor\u2019s sex\u201d does not, in fact, \u201cyield a different outcome.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  Sex does not dictate SB1\u2019s \nlimits on puberty blockers, even as a but-for matter.   \n\n40 \n \nCross-Sex Hormones:  The same goes for cross-sex \nhormones.  No boy can receive hormones to transition; \nlikewise, no girl can receive hormones to transition. \nBut either can receive hormones to treat physical ab-\nnormalities. Medical purpose, not sex, dictates availa-\nbility under SB1.  Cf. Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, \n181-82 (4th Cir. 2024) (Richardson, J., dissenting) \n(finding no sex-discrimination while applying Bos-\ntock\u2019s but-for test).    \nThe government\u2019s counter changes both sex and \nmedical purpose.  It claims (at 21-22) that a female \n\u201ccannot receive \u2026 testosterone to live and present as \na male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.\u201d  \nBut the provision of testosterone to boys \u201cto treat a mi-\nnor\u2019s congenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or \nphysical injury,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A), \ndoes not serve the same medical purpose as the provi-\nsion of testosterone to a girl who wants to transition.  \nThe same drug is at issue.  But it is used at different \ndosages and for different medical purposes.  See J.A. \n769-70.  Just like administering morphine to \u201cease [a] \npatient\u2019s pain\u201d is not the same as using morphine to \nassist a patient\u2019s suicide.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 802.  The \ngovernment\u2019s argument conflates \u201cdistinct uses of tes-\ntosterone and estrogen.\u201d  Pet. App. 34a.   \nSeparately, biological realities mean that only \nboys use estrogen for the purpose of transitioning to \nan \u201cidentity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1)(A).  So too with girls and \ntestosterone.  But laws regulating treatments \u201c\u2018that \nonly one sex can undergo\u2019 ordinarily do not \u2018trigger \n\n41 \n \nheightened constitutional scrutiny.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 33a \n(quoting Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236); supra 32-35.   \nThe upshot: \u201c[H]olding other things constant but \nchanging the minor\u2019s sex\u201d does not change the outcome \nunder SB1.  U.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  The government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to show \nany differential outcome.  It fails its own but-for-sex \ntest. \nIII. SB1 Contains No Transgender Classification \nthat Warrants Heightened Scrutiny \nThe government\u2019s transgender-discrimination ar-\ngument likewise gets it nowhere.  SB1 contains no \ntransgender-based classification.  And heightened \nscrutiny would not apply in any event. \nA. SB1 does not classify based on \ntransgender status. \nThe government assumes (at 16, 28-29) that SB1 \ncontains facial transgender classifications, even in the \nface of a circuit split on the issue.  But SB1 regulates \nbased on medical use, not transgender status.  \nTransgender-identifying minors are in both \u201cgroups\u201d \ncreated by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  A \ntransgender-identifying minor can receive puberty \nblockers for some purposes (e.g., to treat precocious \npuberty); a transgender-identifying minor cannot re-\nceive puberty blockers for other purposes (e.g., to tran-\nsition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  The same \ngoes for cross-sex hormones.  Transgender-identifying \npersons fall on both sides of the line.  There is thus a \n\u201clack of identity\u201d between transgender status and the \n\n42 \n \ngroups created by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 \nn.20. \nAny disparate impact on transgender-identifying \npersons does not create a classification under the \nEqual Protection Clause.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-78.  \nAgain, heightened scrutiny does not apply to \u201c[t]he \nregulation of a medical procedure that only one sex \ncan undergo\u201d unless \u201cthe regulation is a \u2018mere pretext \ndesigned to effect an invidious discrimination.\u2019\u201d \nDobbs, 597 U.S. at 236 (cleaned up) (quoting Geduldig, \n417 U.S. at 496 n.20); see Bray, 506 U.S. at 271 (simi-\nlar).  So too with a transgender-discrimination claim:  \nThe government must show that SB1 is a \u201cpretext for \ninvidious discrimination\u201d against transgender-identi-\nfying individuals.  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th 1229-30; see \nKadel, 100 F.4th at 174 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  \nThe government has not \u201cmade the case that ani-\nmus toward transgender individuals as a class drives \nthis law.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a-47a.  Again, the parties did \nnot meaningfully press this argument below.  And this \nCourt \u201chas long disfavored arguments based on al-\nleged legislative motives.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 253.  Ju-\ndicial attempts to ascertain these \u201cmotivation[s]\u201d nec-\nessarily \u201crepresent a substantial intrusion into the \nworkings of other branches of government.\u201d  Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 268 n.18.  Courts are even more \n\u201creluctan[t] to attribute unconstitutional motives to \nthe states,\u201d Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394 (1983), \ngiven the federalism stakes.  Here, the government \nflippantly suggests that Tennessee, 23 \u201cother States,\u201d \nand apparently much of Europe have followed \u201cfar-\n\n43 \n \nright interest groups\u201d to \u201ctarget[] transgender individ-\nuals.\u201d  U.S. Br. 7 n.3, 8; see L.W. Br. 53.  But charges \nof discriminatory purpose demand more than tired \ntalking points.   \nNor could the government clear the Arlington \nHeights bar if it tried.  SB1 arose from a publicized \ncontroversy about ill-supported medical practices at a \nmajor Tennessee hospital.  It contains substantial fac-\ntual findings exhibiting the legislature\u2019s sincere con-\ncern with protecting kids.  And it leaves open gender-\ntransition interventions for transgender-identifying \nadults.  Although the government tries (at 8) to situate \nSB1 in a \u201cseries\u201d of Tennessee laws \u201ctargeting\u201d \ntransgender-identifying people, that narrative ignores \nthat many such measures countered federal efforts to \nimpose unprecedented gender-identity mandates gov-\nerning pronouns, bathroom and sports access, and \nmore.  See, e.g., Tennessee v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 104 F.4th \n577, 586 (6th Cir. 2024).  None of the government\u2019s \nsideswipes surmount the heavy \u201cpresumption of legis-\nlative good faith.\u201d  Abbott, 585 U.S. at 603. \nThat leaves the argument that the Court should \npresume animus under a \u201cproxy\u201d-discrimination the-\nory.  But winning that argument requires showing \nthat \u201cno rational, nondiscriminatory explanation ex-\nists for the law\u2019s classification.\u201d Kadel, 100 F.4th at \n170 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  The restricted activ-\nity must be \u201csuch an irrational object of disfavor that \n\u2026 an intent to disfavor [a] class can readily be pre-\nsumed\u201d\u2014in the same way a \u201ctax on wearing yarmul-\nkes\u201d would be considered a \u201ctax on Jews.\u201d  Bray, 506 \n\n44 \n \nU.S. at 270.  Regulating yarmulkes is an \u201cirrational \nsurrogate.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nHere, though, rational explanations beyond bare \n\u201chostility\u201d abound.  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, \n374 (1886).  SB1 could (and did) spring from the \u201ccom-\nmon and respectable\u201d impetus to protect minors from \nunproven procedures that can permanently alter their \nlives.  Bray, 506 U.S. at 270; see Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n274-75 (declining to presume animus when \u201clegitimate \nand worthy purposes\u201d supported the Act).  That these \ntreatments are sought primarily by transgender-iden-\ntifying persons cannot alone support a presumption of \nanimus, lest this Court\u2019s restrictions on disparate-im-\npact claims disappear.  See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-75; \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20; Bray, 506 U.S. at 270.5   \nB. Heightened scrutiny does not apply to \ntransgender-related classifications.  \nIntermediate scrutiny would not follow anyway.  \nThis Court has never recognized transgender-identify-\ning persons as a suspect class, Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n440-41 (listing five protected classes), and it should \nnot add to the short list of protected characteristics. \n \n5 Notably, the government is not equating gender dysphoria with \ntransgender status.  It knows that \u201cnot all transgender persons \nhave gender dysphoria.\u201d  J.A. 61.  And like transgender-identify-\ning persons, gender-dysphoric persons can be in both groups cre-\nated by SB1.  Moreover, this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses the ap-\nplication of heightened scrutiny based on disability, infra 47, and \nthe federal government has elsewhere designated gender dyspho-\nria as \u201ca disability,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 40,066, 40,068-69 (May 9, 2024). \n\n45 \n \nThis Court long ago \u201clost interest\u201d in creating new \nquasi-suspect classes beyond the few already recog-\nnized.  Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 318-\n19 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Over the past \nhalf-century, it has declined repeated requests to ex-\npand its list of protected characteristics\u2014declining \nheightened review to homosexual individuals, Wind-\nsor, 570 U.S. at 770; close relatives, Lyng v. Castillo, \n477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); the mentally disabled, \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 441-46; and the aged, Murgia, \n427 U.S. at 313.  Rightfully so.  Both assessing puta-\ntive \u201csuspectness\u201d and applying means-end scrutiny \nverge on a \u201cjudge-empowering interest-balancing in-\nquiry\u201d beyond the judicial ken.  N.Y. State Rifle & Pis-\ntol Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1, 22 (2022) (quotations \nomitted).  This Court should not reopen that door.   \nAnd it certainly should not recognize a new quasi-\nsuspect class here.  To justify heightened scrutiny, this \nCourt has asked whether a \u201cdiscrete group\u201d warrants \nspecial protection in light of its \u201cimmutable\u201d charac-\nteristics, \u201cpolitical[] powerless[ness],\u201d and history of \ndiscriminatory treatment.  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  The \ngovernment falls short on each.   \nFirst, transgender-identifying persons do not \u201cex-\nhibit obvious, immutable, or distinguishing character-\nistics that define them as a discrete group.\u201d  Pet. App. \n45a (quoting Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 \n(1987)).  No one argues that transgender status is an \n\u201cimmutable\u201d characteristic.  U.S. Br. 30; L.W. Br. 38. \nNor is there a credible claim that transgender status \nis \u201cobvious,\u201d since gender identity turns on each per-\nson\u2019s internal and often fluid \u201csense of belonging to a \n\n46 \n \nparticular gender.\u201d  J.A. 9; see WPATH-8 at S41.  And \nfar from being a \u201cdiscrete group,\u201d U.S. Br. 30, \n\u201ctransgender\u201d can describe \u201ca huge variety of gender \nidentities and expressions,\u201d WPATH-8 at S15.  Accord-\ning to WPATH, a transgender-identifying person can \nbe \u201cmore than one gender identity simultaneously or \nat different times (e.g., bigender),\u201d \u201cnot have a gender \nidentity or have a neutral gender identity (e.g., \nagender or neutrois),\u201d \u201chave gender identities that en-\ncompass or blend elements of other genders (e.g., pol-\nygender, demiboy, demigirl),\u201d or \u201chave a gender that \nchanges over time (e.g., genderfluid).\u201d  Id. at S80, S88, \nS252.  As the government\u2019s amici put it, \u201ctransgender\u201d \nis an \u201cumbrella term\u201d that covers \u201cvaried groups.\u201d Br. \nof American Psychological Association as Amicus Cu-\nriae 6 n.7.  \nSecond, \nit \nblinks \nreality \nto \nassert \nthat \ntransgender-identifying persons do not \u201cwield political \npower.\u201d  U.S. Br. 30.  The current Administration has \nprioritized \u201cPreventing and Combating Discrimina-\ntion on the Basis of Gender Identity\u201d across Executive \nBranch functions.  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. \nReg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).  The current President has \n\u201cappointed a record number of openly LGBTQI+ lead-\ners.\u201d  White House, A Proclamation on Transgender \nDay of Visibility (Mar. 30, 2023), perma.cc/VZN6-\n4ATC.  And federal agencies have written gender-\nidentity directives into every nook and cranny of fed-\neral law, creating new transgender-specific regula-\ntions \nfor \nthe \nworkplace, \neducational \nsystem, \nhealthcare \nfield, \nand \nfoster-care \nprograms.  \nTransgender-identifying persons have flexed their po-\n\n47 \n \nlitical muscle at the state level, too, persuading legis-\nlatures to provide enhanced statutory rights.  E.g., \nCal. Educ. Code \u00a7221.5(f); Va. Code Ann. \u00a738.2-3449.1; \nWash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a728A.642.080.  Against this \nbackdrop (and with more than a third of the U.S. \nHouse in support, see Br. of 164 Members of Congress \nas Amicus Curiae), it is impossible to argue that \ntransgender-identifying persons are \u201cpolitically pow-\nerless in the sense that they have no ability to attract \nthe attention of lawmakers.\u201d  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n445.  That they have not found success on every issue \nin every State does not prove powerlessness.  Pet. App. \n46a. \nThird, the government and plaintiffs cannot rest \ntheir case for heightened scrutiny on a \u201chistory of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  L.W. Br. 38.  In Cleburne, the Court de-\nclined to hold that the mentally disabled constituted a \nquasi-suspect class \u201cdespite a history of compulsory \nsterilization, exclusion from public schools, and a sys-\ntem of \u2018state-mandated segregation and degradation\u2019 \n\u2018that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed \nparalleled, the worst excesses of Jim Crow.\u2019\u201d  Eknes-\nTucker, 114 F.4th at 1266 (Lagoa, J., concurring) \n(quoting Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 462-63 (Marshall, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part)).  The answer to \nfurther instances of \u201cinvidious\u201d discrimination, the \nCourt explained, was to analyze animus case by case, \n\u201cnot to create a new quasi-suspect classification and \nsubject all governmental action based on that classifi-\ncation to more searching evaluation.\u201d Cleburne, 473 \nU.S. at 446.  Likewise, laws regulating the physically \ndisabled fall under rational-basis review despite the \nhistory of discrimination against that group.  Board of \n\n48 \n \nTrustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365-68 (2001).  The \nchallengers nowhere explain why transgender-identi-\nfying persons warrant more favorable treatment. \nAt bottom, creating a new quasi-suspect class will \nremove \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d from the \u201carena of pub-\nlic debate and legislative action\u201d and vest them in the \nfederal judiciary.  Pet. App. 45a.  \u201cBathrooms and \nlocker rooms.  Sports teams and sports competitions.  \nOthers are sure to follow.\u201d  Pet. App. 45a.  And this \nCourt, rather than the democratic process, would have \nto resolve every last issue through open-ended interest \nbalancing.  It should not start down that path.    \nIV. SB1 Survives Constitutional Scrutiny \nSB1 passes constitutional review under any stand-\nard.  \u201c[L]ike other health and welfare laws,\u201d it war-\nrants only rational-basis scrutiny, Dobbs, 597 U.S. at \n301, and easily satisfies that test, Pet. App. 48a-50a.  \nEven under intermediate scrutiny, SB1 poses no con-\nstitutional problem.  Its age- and use-based limits per-\nmissibly serve \u201cimportant\u201d ends through \u201csubstan-\ntially related\u201d means, Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, par-\nticularly given lawmakers\u2019 \u201cwide discretion\u201d in areas \nof \u201cmedical and scientific uncertainty,\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.   \nA. Tennessee has compelling governmental \ninterests. \nAll agree that Tennessee\u2019s \u201cinterest in safeguard-\ning the physical and psychological well-being of a mi-\nnor is compelling.\u201d  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, \n756-57 (1982) (quotations omitted).  Tennessee has \n\u201cauthority, in truth a responsibility, to look after the \n\n49 \n \nhealth and safety\u201d of minors in the State.  Pet. App. \n115a.  And \u201cprotecting minors from dangerous and \nrisky treatments\u201d is part and parcel of that duty.  L.W. \nBr. 41; U.S. Br. 19.   \nTennessee has an independent interest \u201cin pro-\ntecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profes-\nsion.\u201d  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 731.  History is punctu-\nated with shocking stories of medical \u201cabuse [and] ne-\nglect,\u201d id.\u2014with many questionable practices (like lo-\nbotomies and eugenics) initially finding support from \nthe medical establishment.  States thus have an im-\nportant interest in ensuring the integrity and ethics of \nmedical practice within their borders.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a768-33-101(m). \nB. SB1 substantially relates to Tennessee\u2019s \ninterests. \nSB1\u2019s restrictions are in \u201csubstantial furtherance\u201d \nof Tennessee\u2019s interests.  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70.  The \ngovernment second-guesses elected lawmakers\u2019 judg-\nment and asks this Court to do the same.  But this \nCourt should not snuff out legislative developments in \nan evolving area by enshrining the government\u2019s \nskewed science into the Constitution. \nSB1 reflects lawmakers\u2019 resolution of a genuine \nmedical debate.  In circumstances like these, \u201clegisla-\ntive options must be especially broad and courts \nshould be cautious not to rewrite legislation.\u201d  Kansas \nv. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 360 n.3 (1997) (quotations \nomitted). \u201cIt is not a part of [the courts\u2019] functions to \nconduct investigations of facts entering into questions \nof public policy.\u201d  Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678, \n\n50 \n \n685 (1888); Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. \n180, 195 (1997).  Federal judges are no more equipped \nto resolve such issues than \u201cpeople picked at random \nfrom the ... telephone directory.\u201d  Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. \nDep\u2019t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 293 (1990) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring).   \nRecognizing as much, the Court has repeatedly \nstressed that lawmakers have \u201cwide discretion to pass \nlegislation in areas where there is medical and scien-\ntific uncertainty.\u201d  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 163; see, e.g., \nDobbs 597 U.S. at 274; Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 360 n.3; \nJones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 364 n.13, 370 \n(1983); Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 \n(1974); Williamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483, 488-\n89 (1955).  Such deference is appropriate even when \nheightened scrutiny applies.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n163-64 (undue-burden standard).  Any other approach \nwould raise the problem of setting \u201cjudicially manage-\nable standards for ascertaining whether a treatment \nis \u2018established\u2019 or \u2018necessary.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation \nomitted).   \nThis deferential framework for assessing legisla-\ntive judgments on unsettled health questions makes \nupholding SB1 straightforward.  SB1\u2019s age- and use-\nbased restrictions reflect lawmakers\u2019 well-informed \njudgment about the rise, risks, and disputed benefits \nof gender-transition procedures.  Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a768-33-101.  After receiving evidence and holding \nhearings, the legislature made specific findings \nsourced in its assessment of the regulated interven-\ntions\u2019 serious \u201crisks and harms\u201d and concerns over mi-\nnors\u2019 ability to provide informed consent.  Id.; see J.A. \n\n51 \n \n893-97, 905.  Against those risks, the legislature con-\ncluded that the putative benefits of such procedures \nremain unproven.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(b), (g).  \nSo it determined that deferring certain gender-transi-\ntion procedures until adulthood was the best course.  \nThat approach substantially furthers lawmakers\u2019 in-\nterest in protecting minors and medical ethics.   \nTennessee\u2019s view of the science is well founded, \nbut the State unquestionably legislated in an area of \nscientific uncertainty.  Many authorities, from leading \nEuropean agencies to courts, have recognized the un-\ncertainty surrounding gender-dysphoria treatments.  \nSee supra 8; Pet. App. 47a-48a; Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th \nat 1225; Gibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212, 221 (5th Cir. \n2019); State v. Loe, 692 S.W.3d 215, 222 (Tex. 2024).  \nSo have pro-intervention advocacy groups like \nWPATH and the Endocrine Society.  WPATH-8 at S33 \n(citing need for \u201cfuture research\u201d); ES Guidelines at \n3874 (emphasizing need for \u201cmore rigorous evalua-\ntions of the effectiveness and safety of endocrine and \nsurgical protocols\u201d).  And SB1 arose after a leading \nprovider of gender-transition procedures for Tennes-\nsee minors admitted she was \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Su-\npra 11.  The uncertainty surrounding minors\u2019 gender-\ntransition treatments provides a \u201csufficient basis\u201d to \nuphold SB1.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 164.   \nThe government, by contrast, would have this \nCourt choose a side in this contested medical debate.  \nU.S. Br. 33-49.  But its arguments for displacing Ten-\nnessee\u2019s legislative judgment fail. \nClear error.  The government says (at 36) that the \nclear-error standard requires upholding the district \n\n52 \n \ncourt\u2019s \u201cfindings.\u201d  But the district court failed to re-\nview Tennessee\u2019s legislative \u201cfactfinding under a def-\nerential standard,\u201d as required.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n165; Turner, 520 U.S. at 195.  And this Court does not \ngive clear-error weight to findings made under an \u201cer-\nroneous standard.\u201d  Inwood Laboratories v. Ives La-\nboratories, 456 U.S. 844, 855, n.15 (1982); Abbott, 585 \nU.S. at 607 (same, when failed to presume good faith).  \nRegardless, the district court did clearly err in \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence in light of the prevailing \nstandards of care and conclusions contained in the \nWPATH and Endocrine Society guidelines.\u201d  Pet. App. \n181a. \nRisks and benefits.  The government\u2019s one-sided \ntelling of the risk-benefit evidence misstates (at 34-44) \nthe legislative record and medical landscape.  Tennes-\nsee did not \u201cignore[]\u201d the \u201cmedical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.\u201d  U.S. Br. 34-36 (capitali-\nzation altered).  In fact, SB1\u2019s findings specifically ref-\nerence the potential \u201cbenefits\u201d of gender-transition \nsurgeries; the legislature just found\u2014relying on Euro-\npean health authorities\u2014a dearth of \u201cevidence that \nthe benefits of these procedures outweigh the risks.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e).  Tennessee\u2019s consider-\nation of evidence was \u201cmeaningful,\u201d even if the govern-\nment would have preferred a different result.     \nThe government\u2019s assertion that SB1 bucks \u201cmed-\nical consensus\u201d (at 36) is hard to take seriously.  Half \nof the States have restricted access to pharmaceutical \nand surgical gender-transition procedures for mi-\nnors\u2014each making their own good-faith findings.  \nDoctors have publicly questioned the propriety of \n\n53 \n \nproviding these interventions to minors.6  And many \nof the European countries that pioneered these treat-\nments have pulled back on their use because of the un-\ncertainty surrounding efficacy and safety.  Supra 8; \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e) (citing shift).  The gov-\nernment cannot manufacture \u201cconsensus\u201d by ignoring \nEuropean health authorities that SB1 references.  \nU.S. Br. 36; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e). \nNor does citing a \u201cmajority\u201d view of \u201cmedical or-\nganization[s]\u201d negate the legislature\u2019s prerogative.  \nU.S. Br. 35.  Organizational say-so does not \u201cshed light \non the meaning of the Constitution.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. \nat 273.  Any other approach \u201cwould mean that the \nstate and federal legislatures would lose authority to \nregulate the healthcare industry whenever the subject \nof regulation\u2014the medical profession and drug com-\npanies\u2014found such regulation unnecessary\u201d or mis-\nguided.  Pet. App. 28a.  And what if these organiza-\ntions \u201cchange course in the future? Would the States\u2019 \nauthority reappear at that point?\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.  \nShifting deference from legislative findings to organi-\nzations only redirects power from accountable officials \nto interest groups.   \nThis case highlights the dangers of medical organ-\nizations driving constitutional law.  Below, the chal-\nlengers argued that WPATH\u2019s Guidelines reflect \u201c[t]he \nbest evidence of the correct standard of care.\u201d  Pet. \nApp.  29a.  And they convinced the district court to rely \n \n6 Kaltiala et al., Youth Gender Transition Is Pushed Without Ev-\nidence, Wall St. J. (July 13, 2023), perma.cc/P9GM-MHF7. \n\n54 \n \non WPATH\u2019s Guidelines as the framework for \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 181a.  Now, \nwith WPATH\u2019s credibility shot, the government turns \n(at 35) to other organizations\u2014the AAP and the Amer-\nican Medical Association\u2014that push the same poli-\ncies.  But AAP\u2019s positions have been debunked too.  \nJ.A. 448-49; Appendix 2, D.Ct.Doc. 113-3 at 184-91.  \nThe Constitution does not require States to play \nwhack-a-mole with whatever advocacy organization\u2019s \nstance suits challengers\u2019 needs.   \nThe government invokes the oft-repeated claim \nthat laws like SB1 increase suicide risk and mental-\nhealth problems.  U.S. Br. 36-38; L.W. Br. 44-45.  But \n\u201creal, hard science\u201d for this position is lacking.  Florida \nv. HHS, 2024 WL 3537510, at *16 (M.D. Fla. July 3, \n2024).  No studies document a reduction in suicide \nrates due to gender-transition interventions\u2014as the \nlauded Cass Review noted.  J.A. 398-401, 671-75; Cass \nReview at 33.  And the evidence supporting mitigated \nsuicidality is inconclusive and conflicts with other \nstudies\u2014including one showing that hormonal inter-\nventions increased mental distress.  J.A. 400-01, 452-\n55, 462-67, 664-70; Florida, 2024 WL 3537510, at *19 \nn.17. \nThe government cannot dodge the countervailing \nrisks posed by gender-transition interventions.  The \ngovernment downplays desistence (at 41) with expert \ntestimony asserting that adolescent desistence is \n\u201crare[].\u201d  But desistence is not theoretical.  Minors can \nand do grow up to regret the life-long results transi-\ntion treatments produce.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n\n55 \n \n101(h).  Apparently, even though \u201cmany detransition-\ners\u201d are telling their tragic stories, \u201c[a]cknowledge-\nment that de-transition exists to even a minor extent \nis considered off limits\u201d for the government.  See \nEknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th at 1269 (Lagoa, J., concur-\nring) (quotations omitted).  The Constitution does not \ncompel lawmakers to shield their eyes from detransi-\ntioners\u2019 experiences.  \nAnd no amount of rose-colored ink overwrites the \ndocumented downsides of puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormones.  Supra 5-6; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n101(b).  The government\u2019s portrayal of the risks con-\ntradicts even the advocacy organizations on which it \nrelies.  Compare U.S. Br. at 3, 42-44, with ES Guide-\nlines at 3874, 3882, 3886-87. \nTailoring.  The government claims (at 44-49) that \nSB1 is both too narrow and too broad.  The govern-\nment\u2019s underinclusiveness argument presumes that \nprescribing these drugs always poses the same \u201crisks.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 44-47; L.W. Br. 19, 42-43.  That premise fails:  \nThe medical risks differ because of biological differ-\nences between boys and girls, supra 30-31, and the \nrisk of desistance is not present in other circumstances \nof medical need.  Moreover, medical risk doesn\u2019t arise \nin a vacuum; it instead must be measured against the \nbenefits of the procedure.  A double mastectomy might \ncarry the same risk when performed on a woman with \nbreast cancer and on a 17-year-old girl who wants to \nidentify as a man.  But the measurable benefits differ.  \nThe contrary view recycles the government\u2019s incorrect \n\n56 \n \nattempt to equate giving minors drugs for gender tran-\nsition with employing the same drugs to treat physical \ndeficiencies or abnormalities.   \nNor do claims of \u201csevere overinclusiv[ity]\u201d work.  \nU.S. Br. 47-49; L.W. Br. 48-50.  SB1 does not \u201cpro-\nhibit[] all treatment for all transgender adolescents.\u201d  \nL.W. Br. 49.  It leaves open \u201cless invasive approaches \nthat are likely to result in better outcomes for the mi-\nnor,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(c)\u2014the watchful-\nwaiting and psychotherapy methods that predomi-\nnated until the past decade, supra 4-5; Pet. App. 29a. \nEven the government seems to accept that provid-\ners should not use \u201cany medical intervention to treat \ngender dysphoria before the onset of puberty.\u201d  U.S. \nBr. 41.  And it has (at least at times) agreed that sur-\ngeries should be off-limits for all minors.  So its tailor-\ning disagreement boils down to disputing SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions on medications from the onset of puberty to \nadulthood.  That argument, though, does not turn on \ndifferential treatment based on sex; it turns on the age \nat which SB1 drew its line.  And so long as \u201cthe age \nclassification in question is rationally related to a le-\ngitimate state interest,\u201d States may draw lines with-\nout \u201cmatch[ing] age distinctions\u201d to the \u201cinterests they \nserve with razorlike precision.\u201d  Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of \nRegents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000).   \nThe remaining tailoring arguments also fail.  Even \nif \u201cat least some transgender adolescents would bene-\nfit from the banned treatments,\u201d L.W. Br. 48, that ig-\nnores doctors\u2019 inability to \u201cpredict\u201d which minors will \nlater regret these interventions, J.A. 643.  The govern-\n\n57 \n \nment\u2019s preferred policies\u2014like \u201cgatekeeping,\u201d \u201clicens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements\u201d\u2014like-\nwise fail to account for detransitioners.  U.S. Br. 48.  \nIn any event, intermediate scrutiny does not require \nSB1 to \u201cbe capable of achieving its ultimate objective \nin every instance,\u201d Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70, or mandate \nthat Tennessee allow experimental research on kids, \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1235-36 (Brasher, J., con-\ncurring). \n*** \nMany doctors, States, and countries share Tennes-\nsee\u2019s view on gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors; the federal government and others do not.  This \n\u201cearnest and profound debate about the morality, le-\ngality, and practicality\u201d of controversial medical prac-\ntices can continue only if this Court refrains from con-\nstitutionalizing one side\u2019s position.  Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. at 735.  The question is not whose assessment of \nthe medical dispute is best, but whether the States in \n1868 ceded their power to enact age- and use-based \nlimits on pharmaceutical interventions like SB1\u2019s.  \nThey did not. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \n \n \n\n58 \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nAdam K.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has evolved from knowing the petitioner's arguments to having a structured framework of the central legal conflicts that the respondent must address. My knowledge base is cumulative, built upon the initial analysis of the U.S. Solicitor General's brief.\n\nMy current model of the case is as follows:\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument:** The U.S. argues that Tennessee's law (SB1) is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause. Their argument is structured as a two-step attack:\n    *   **Step 1: The Law Demands Heightened Scrutiny.** They provide two independent justifications for this higher standard of review:\n        *   **Sex-Based Classification:** The law is discriminatory on its face because access to medication (e.g., testosterone) is explicitly determined by a minor's sex assigned at birth. This argument seeks to extend the logic of *Bostock v. Clayton County* from Title VII to the Equal Protection Clause and invokes the \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" standard from *United States v. Virginia (VMI)*.\n        *   **Discrimination Against Transgender Status:** The law is also framed as targeting transgender individuals as a class, which they argue should also trigger heightened scrutiny.\n    *   **Step 2: The Law Fails Heightened Scrutiny.** The U.S. contends that Tennessee cannot provide a sufficient justification for the law.\n        *   **Illegitimate State Interest:** The stated goal of \"encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\" is characterized as animus, which is not a permissible government interest (*Mississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan*).\n        *   **Poor Fit (Lack of Tailoring):** This is a critical line of attack. The brief argues the state's professed interest in child safety is a pretext, demonstrated by the law's internal contradictions.\n            *   **Underinclusive:** The law is not concerned with the drugs themselves, as it permits the *exact same medications* for minors for other conditions (e.g., precocious puberty).\n            *   **Overinclusive:** The law's categorical ban disregards the consensus of major medical organizations (WPATH, AMA) and usurps the role of parents and doctors in making individualized medical decisions.\n\n2.  **Refinement of Key Uncertainties:** My analysis of the petitioner's brief has allowed me to move beyond general uncertainty and formulate the precise questions that the respondent's (Tennessee's) brief must answer. My predictive model is now focused on how Tennessee will counter these specific points. The central uncertainties are:\n    *   **The Scrutiny Standard:** How will Tennessee argue that SB1 is *not* a sex-based classification and that only rational basis review should apply? This is the most critical threshold question.\n    *   **The *Bostock* Question:** How will Tennessee argue against extending *Bostock*'s reasoning (that discrimination against transgender people is a form of sex discrimination) from a statutory context (Title VII) to a constitutional one (Equal Protection)?\n    *   **The Underinclusivity Paradox:** How will Tennessee justify permitting the use of puberty blockers and hormones for conditions like precocious puberty while banning them for gender-affirming care? This is the core of the petitioner's \"pretext\" argument, and Tennessee's response will be highly informative.\n    *   **The \"Exceedingly Persuasive Justification\":** If Tennessee anticipates that heightened scrutiny might apply, what justification will they offer? What evidence will they present to counter the medical consensus cited by the petitioner?\n\nMy next information-gathering step is now clearly defined: I must acquire and analyze the respondent's brief to get answers to these specific questions.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has been tested and refined. The latest observation, an internal reasoning step, strongly validates the current strategy and adds a new layer of sophistication regarding the sequencing of information gathering.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of effective strategy is now:\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** The core practice of separating task-level uncertainty (\u03b8) from design-level uncertainty (D) remains fundamental to organizing my analysis and planning.\n2.  **Sequential Analysis of Primary Sources:** My initial heuristic to prioritize primary legal documents has been refined. The most effective approach is a *sequential* one:\n    *   **Step A: Analyze the Petitioner's Brief First.** Starting with the petitioner (or the Solicitor General, when they are the petitioner) provides a comprehensive and structured map of the legal claims. This establishes the \"offense\" and defines the terms of the debate.\n    *   **Step B: Analyze the Respondent's Brief Second.** This action is most valuable *after* understanding the petitioner's claims, as it directly addresses the arguments and reveals the core points of legal conflict. This dialectical approach (thesis -> antithesis) is more efficient than analyzing sources randomly.\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection:** An effective agent does not just gather information; it gathers the *right* information at the *right* time. The most valuable next action is the one that addresses the largest and most critical area of current uncertainty. Having analyzed the petitioner's brief, the single action that provides the most information gain is to acquire the respondent's direct counter-arguments. This principle should guide all future information-gathering choices.\n4.  **Identification of Key Legal Frameworks & Heuristics:** My toolbox of analytical heuristics for Equal Protection cases has been validated and is growing.\n    *   **The Scrutiny Two-Step:** The pattern of (1) arguing for a specific standard of review and (2) arguing the law fails/passes it is a fundamental structure for constitutional litigation. My analysis must always identify the level of scrutiny each party advocates for.\n    *   **The Underinclusivity Heuristic:** Searching for ways a law is underinclusive remains a powerful tool. The argument that a state permits the very thing it claims is dangerous, but only for a different purpose or group, is a potent signal that the state's professed interest may be a pretext for an impermissible one. I will actively apply this heuristic to future Equal Protection cases."

Its value is not in acquiring new external data, but in processing the current state to make subsequent actions far more efficient and targeted.\n\nTask EIG (0.6): The action significantly reduces uncertainty about *what to do next* to resolve the core predictive question (\u03b8). It correctly identifies the two pivotal legal questions (the Bostock extension and the 'scientific uncertainty' defense) and formulates a precise plan to gather evidence on how the Court might resolve them by examining amicus briefs and the reply brief. This moves the agent from a general state of 'what's next?' to a specific, high-yield research plan, which is a substantial gain in resolving task uncertainty.\n\nDesign EIG (0.7): This action is highly valuable for refining the agent's general strategy (D). It explicitly codifies a key step in the dialectical analysis workflow: after analyzing the thesis (petitioner) and antithesis (respondent), the next logical step is to examine the synthesis and supporting arguments (reply and amicus briefs). By articulating this, the agent reinforces a generalizable, multi-stage research methodology for complex legal cases. It also reflects on the new heuristics learned, integrating them into its strategic model.\n\nJoint EIG (1.3): The action serves as a crucial bridge between past learning and future inquiry. It synthesizes the insights gained from the respondent's brief to update the agent's strategic model (high Design EIG) and then uses that updated model to formulate a highly targeted plan to resolve the remaining predictive questions (high Task EIG). This intelligent planning, driven by a clear understanding of the remaining uncertainty, is the core of an effective DBOED process.",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now progressed from analyzing the petitioner's claims to having a complete, dialectical model of the central legal conflict. The acquisition of the respondent's brief has resolved my key uncertainties and provided the direct counter-arguments to the petitioner's framework.\n\nMy current, more complete model of the case is as follows:\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis):** The U.S. argues Tennessee's law (SB1) is unconstitutional because it constitutes sex discrimination, demanding and failing heightened scrutiny.\n    *   **Scrutiny Standard:** The law is a sex-based classification, both on its face (access to testosterone depends on birth sex) and by targeting transgender status. This argument seeks to import the logic of *Bostock v. Clayton County* into the Equal Protection Clause.\n    *   **Failure of Scrutiny:** The state's professed interest in safety is a pretext, proven by the law's underinclusivity (it allows the same drugs for other conditions like precocious puberty) and overinclusivity (it ignores a \"medical consensus\" and parental rights).\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis):** I have now learned Tennessee's complete defensive strategy, which directly counters the petitioner's claims at every step.\n    *   **Reframing the Law:** Tennessee's primary move is to reframe SB1 not as a classification based on identity (sex or transgender status), but as a regulation of *specific procedures* (hormones/surgery) for a *specific purpose* (gender transition) in a *specific population* (minors). They argue this is a routine exercise of the state's police power to protect public health amid scientific uncertainty.\n    *   **Countering the Scrutiny Standard:** This is their main line of defense.\n        *   **Not a Sex-Based Classification:** They argue the law is facially neutral regarding sex because it applies equally to both sexes: a boy cannot get estrogen for transition, and a girl cannot get testosterone for transition. The line is drawn based on the *purpose* of the intervention, not the sex of the patient.\n        *   **Rejecting the *Bostock* Extension:** They argue forcefully that *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test from Title VII should not be constitutionalized. They cite precedents like *Geduldig v. Aiello* (pregnancy discrimination) and *Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. v. Feeney* (veteran's preference) where the Court declined to find sex discrimination despite a clear but-for link or disparate impact. They characterize this extension as a \"doctrinal revolution\" that would have unintended consequences.\n        *   **Not a Transgender Classification:** They argue the law regulates procedures, not status, citing *Bray v. Alexandria Women's Health Clinic*. They also argue that transgender status is not a suspect or quasi-suspect class, and the Court should not create one, citing *City of Cleburne*.\n    *   **Answering the \"Poor Fit\" / Underinclusivity Argument:** Tennessee directly addresses the petitioner's strongest \"pretext\" argument. They claim the groups are **not similarly situated**. A minor receiving hormones for precocious puberty is different from a minor receiving them for gender transition because the state's interest is in regulating an area of high *scientific uncertainty*. The medical justification for the former is settled, while the latter is part of a \"live medical dispute.\"\n    *   **Arguing in the Alternative (Passing Heightened Scrutiny):** Even if heightened scrutiny were to apply, Tennessee argues the law is constitutional.\n        *   **Compelling Interest:** The state has a compelling interest in protecting children from \"life-altering\" and irreversible procedures with unknown long-term effects.\n        *   **Substantial Relation:** The law is substantially related to this interest. They directly attack the petitioner's \"medical consensus\" by citing systematic reviews from European health authorities (like the UK's Cass Review) that have urged caution and restricted these same treatments. This reframes the issue from \"state vs. medical consensus\" to \"state siding with one faction in an ongoing international scientific debate.\" They anchor this argument in *Gonzales v. Carhart*, where the Court gave legislatures \"wide discretion\" in the face of \"medical and scientific uncertainty.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Refined Uncertainties:** My predictive focus has shifted. The question is no longer *what* the parties will argue, but *which legal framework* the Court will adopt. The central pivot of the case is the *Bostock* question.\n    *   If the Court rejects the extension of *Bostock* to Equal Protection and accepts Tennessee's *Geduldig*/*Feeney* framework, the law will be subject to rational basis review and will almost certainly be upheld.\n    *   If the Court accepts the extension of *Bostock*, the case will turn on whether Tennessee's justification (protecting children amid scientific uncertainty, supported by European evidence) is \"exceedingly persuasive.\" The *Gonzales v. Carhart* precedent provides a potential path for the Court to uphold the law even under this higher standard.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework has been significantly strengthened. The successful acquisition and analysis of the respondent's brief validates my sequential, uncertainty-driven approach and has yielded new, generalizable heuristics for legal analysis.\n\nMy cumulative understanding of effective strategy is now:\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** The practice of separating task-level (\u03b8) and design-level (D) uncertainty remains the bedrock of my analytical process.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Validated & Refined):** The strategy of analyzing the petitioner's brief first to build a \"thesis\" and then analyzing the respondent's brief as the \"antithesis\" is highly effective. This observation confirms that it transforms information gathering from a broad search into a targeted inquiry for specific counter-arguments, dramatically increasing efficiency. The respondent's brief was structured as an almost perfect point-by-point rebuttal to the very questions I had formulated.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection:** This principle is strongly validated. My previous belief state correctly identified that the respondent's brief was the single most valuable piece of information to acquire. This confirms that the most effective action is the one that resolves the largest, most clearly defined area of uncertainty.\n\n4.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics:** My toolbox for analyzing constitutional cases has grown more sophisticated.\n    *   **The Scrutiny Two-Step:** This remains a fundamental framework. I now have a detailed model of how both sides approach it in this specific context.\n    *   **The Underinclusivity Heuristic & Its Counter:** I had previously identified the power of the underinclusivity argument. I have now learned its standard rebuttal: the **\"not similarly situated\" defense**. When analyzing future Equal Protection cases, if I identify a law that appears underinclusive, I must immediately search for the state's argument that the included and excluded groups are not similarly situated with respect to the specific government interest being asserted.\n    *   **New Heuristic - The \"Statutory vs. Constitutional\" Firewall:** The respondent's argument against extending *Bostock* highlights a critical distinction. Legal reasoning from a statutory interpretation case (like Title VII) does not automatically port to a constitutional one (like the 14th Amendment). I will now actively watch for this divide. Arguments to \"constitutionalize\" a statutory test are often met with resistance based on precedent, original meaning, and concerns about unforeseen consequences.\n    *   **New Heuristic - The \"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference:** In cases at the intersection of law and science/medicine, a state's most powerful defensive argument is to claim legislative deference due to \"medical and scientific uncertainty.\" The key tactic is to fracture the narrative of a \"consensus\" by introducing credible dissenting sources (e.g., foreign government reports, competing studies). *Gonzales v. Carhart* is the key precedent to cite for this principle. I will apply this heuristic to any future case involving regulation of a contested scientific or medical practice."

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n194: 20241015102831480_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.438)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n7: 20241015102823960_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.438)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \non social media and, while in hospital, to con-\ntact likeminded people and ask when they will \nbe admitted to the clinic. \nMy view is that gender dysphoria in children \nand young adults is largely explained as a so-\ncial contagion. A slight increase in prevalence \nstarted in 2007, when the first smartphone was \nlaunched. However, it took a few years before \nthe majority of teenagers had a smartphone, \nand this coincides quite well with the sharp in-\ncrease in the diagnosis of gender dysphoria in \nyoung people. American journalist Abigail \nSchrier's book Irreversible Damage: The \nTransgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters \n(2020) provides a vivid and detailed account of \nthe social contagion of gender dysphoria. \n4.CR.1630\u201331. \n\n14 \n \n6. Treatment of adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is a developing field. The \nprohibited treatments are experimental, \nand no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits. \nDr. Cantor, expert for Texas, testified that although \n\u201cwe have outcome studies on the childhood onset type \nand we have outcome studies on the adult onset type, we \nhave absolutely no data, we have no outcome studies on \nthis -- what I\u2019ll call the adolescent onset type even though \nthey are now suddenly the large majority of people com-\ning into clinics.\u201d 3.RR.108. \nHe also testified that there are \u201cvarious levels of evi-\ndence going from low-quality evidence that are relatively \nuncertain or ambiguous up through high-quality evi-\ndence that is highly reliable and worth generalizing to \nother people.\u201d 3.RR.83. \u201c[L]ow-quality studies are very \nnumerous in the research literature exactly because or \nas a side effect of their being easy to perform, but they're \nless reliable. The more systematic and the more reliable \nstudies are harder to perform, take more time to per-\nform, and take much more thorough analysis, so there \nare fewer of them.\u201d 3.RR.86. The highest-quality studies \nare \u201csystematic reviews which review all the other stud-\nies beneath it assessing them according to their relative \nqualities.\u201d Id. \nDr. Cantor testified that the \u201cgreat majority of the \nstudies [relied on by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts] were sur-\nveys.\u201d Surveys \u201care very, very common because it\u2019s so \neasy to conduct a survey, for example, on the Internet. \nSurveys can, you know, help us give, you know -- help us \nproduce hypotheses, can help give us ideas, but they \ndon't represent evidence at all\u2026. [T]hey can give us a \ngood idea of questions to look at, but they don't represent \n\n15 \n \nany kind of outcomes evidence.\u201d 3.RR.95. Surveys \u201cdon\u2019t \ncount as medical evidence, they don't count as outcome \nevidence, but the conclusions of the [plaintiffs\u2019] experts \ndepended largely on what doesn't count as evidence.\u201d \n3.RR.96. \nThe lowest-quality evidence comes from \u201ccase stud-\nies and reports,\u201d which \u201care generally retrospective \nstudies where somebody would go through hospital rec-\nords, for example, pull out cases of specific diagnoses and \nsee what happened amongst those people. It gives -- it \ncan give some idea of what to expect if nothing is done, \nbut because these are not systematic, they're not yet \nready for any kind of generalization to other cases.\u201d \n3.RR.90. \u201c[T]here have been a handful [of case studies \nabout the prohibited procedures on minors] published \nover the years. But again, they generally came out with \nambiguous -- with ambiguous results but results that, \nagain, suggested that it was at least worth looking at \nmore systematically.\u201d 3.RR.97\u201398. \nHigher quality evidence comes from \u201ccase-controlled \nstudies,\u201d which are \u201clooking for patterns of what hap-\npens in different groups of people or what makes differ-\nent groups of people different from each other.\u201d \n3.RR.90\u201391. Dr. Cantor is only aware of one such study, \nwhich was \u201ca particularly low-quality study because we \ncan\u2019t tell, you know, what changes, you know, what im-\nprovements and, you know, what got worse amongst \nthese people\u201d and \u201c[t]hey were in a poor mental health \nstatus to begin with.\u201d 3.RR.98. \nThe next highest-quality evidence is \u201ccohort studies,\u201d \nin which \u201cwe\u2019re now checking on a single group of people \nbut over time. We\u2019re looking to see what happened, for \nexample, before or after they were exposed to a treat-\nment or exposed to some not just substance. So instead \n\n16 \n \nof just taking a look at them at one point in time, we\u2019re \ntaking the same group of people and looking at them over \nseveral groups of time.\u201d 3.RR.91. \u201cThere have been ex-\nactly 13 [cohort studies], and these are the 13 that I sum-\nmarize in my own report. This is the highest level study \nthat so far has been conducted at all for the medical tran-\nsition of minors.\u201d 3.RR.99. \n\u201c[F]our of [the cohort studies] showed essentially no \nimprovement at all.\u201d 3.RR.100. In \u201croughly six of them, \nthere were some improvements in some mental health \nparameters, but we can\u2019t conclude that it was the inter-\nvention, that it was the medical interventions itself that \ncaused the improvement because the people were get-\nting psychotherapy at the same time.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]here were \ntwo studies which were designed in a way that allowed \nmore direct comparison trying to allocate how much of \nthe improvement was due to the medical interventions \nversus how much of the improvement was due to the \nmental health interventions. And both of those demon-\nstrate -- and both of those failed to demonstrate that the \nmedical interventions produced any more benefit than \ndid the mental health -- the psychotherapeutic interven-\ntions.\u201d 3.RR.100-01. \u201cAnd there was one other very re-\ncent study that just did not indicate whether the people \nwere in psychotherapy at the same time, so the results -\n- we can\u2019t assess whether the medical interventions were \nsuperior because we don't know how many were getting \npsychotherapy at the same time.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nThe next highest level of evidence comes from \u201cran-\ndomized controlled trials[, which] are the ones where we \ntake a group of people, randomly assign which ones are \ngoing to receive the experimental treatment and which \nones are going to receive either no treatment or some \nother comparison treatment such as treatment as usual, \n\n17 \n \na placebo treatment, or some other -- some other inter-\nvention.\u201d 3.RR.92. There have not been any randomized \ncontrol studies of the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.101. \nThe highest-level evidence comes from systematic re-\nviews, which \u201canalyze all of the studies and all of the lay-\ners that were beneath it. Again, especially in large fields \nwith many people, there are many, many studies, and es-\npecially for very busy clinicians, it\u2019s not possible to read \nand integrate every single one. So the purpose of system-\natic reviews is to get the big picture of what all of the \nother studies have shown, but as I say, to do it in a sys-\ntematic way that removes the potential for bias. The big-\ngest bias, as I mentioned, was cherry-picking where peo-\nple pick out the positive studies but don't mention the \nstudies where the experiment failed.\u201d 3.R.93\u201394. \u201cThere \nhave now been several systematic reviews, none con-\nducted in the U.S. They've all been conducted by the na-\ntional public healthcare systems in Europe.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nEach of them concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to sug-\ngest that medicalized interventions provides any benefits \nsuperior to the mental health interventions.\u201d 3.RR.102. \n\u201cEach of the systematic reviews came to the same con-\nclusion, that the evidence for benefits are outweighed by \nthe evidence of the risks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. Those \nharms include, sterilization, permanent loss of capacity \nto breast-feed, inability to orgasm and loss of sexual \nfunction, interference with neurological and cognitive de-\nvelopment, elevated risk of Parkinsonism, and reduced \nbone density. 4.CR.1220\u201325. \nIn short, there is no evidence that the prohibited pro-\ncedures are safe and effective to treat minors with gen-\nder dysphoria. The prohibited procedures have \u201cnot yet \nbeen tested with experimental studies, so it\u2019s necessarily \nstill within the experimental status.\u201d 3.RR.116. \n\n18 \n \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \nDr. Cantor\u2019s testimony is consistent with the Cass \nReport, 5 a study recently commissioned by the National \nHealth Service in the United Kingdom to evaluate the \nsafety and efficacy of puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \nThe authors of Cass Report spent four years reviewing \nclinical data, interviewing patients and providers, and \nconducting six systematic reviews. It concluded, among \nother things, the following:  \n\u2022 Gender Dysphoria: a diagnosis of gender dyspho-\nria is \u201cnot reliably predictive of whether that \nyoung person will have longstanding gender in-\ncongruence in the future, or whether medical in-\ntervention will be the best option for them.\u201d Cass \nReport at 29. \n\u2022 Social Transition: there is \u201cno clear evidence \nthat social transition in childhood has any positive \nor negative mental health outcomes, and rela-\ntively weak evidence for any effect in adoles-\ncence.\u201d Id. at 31. \n\u2022 Puberty Blockers: the use of puberty blockers \nresulted in \u201cno changes in gender dysphoria or \nbody satisfaction\u201d and there is \u201cinsufficient/incon-\nsistent evidence about the effects of puberty sup-\npression on psychological or psychosocial wellbe-\ning, cognitive development, cardio-metabolic risk \nor fertility \u2026 there is no evidence that puberty \nblockers buy time to think, and some concern that \n \n5 Hilary Cass, M.D., Independent Review of Gender Identity \nServices for Children and Young Adults, National Health Services \nEngland (Apr. 2024) (the \u201cCass Report\u201d), available at https://ti-\nnyurl.com/mw4s3arn. \n\n19 \n \nthey may change the trajectory of psychosexual \nand gender identity development.\u201d Id. at 32. \n\u2022 Cross-Sex Hormones: \u201c[t]here is a lack of high-\nquality research assessing the outcomes of hor-\nmone interventions in adolescents with gender \ndysphoria/incongruence, and few studies that un-\ndertake long-term follow-up. No conclusions can \nbe drawn about the effect on gender dysphoria, \nbody satisfaction, psychosocial health, cognitive \ndevelopment, or fertility [from the use of cross-\nsex hormones]. Uncertainty remains about the \noutcomes for height/growth, cardiometabolic and \nbone health.\u201d Id. at 33. \n\u2022 Suicides: \u201cIt has been suggested that hormone \ntreatment reduces the elevated risk of death by \nsuicide in this population, but the evidence found \ndid not support this conclusion.\u201d Id. \n7. The risks of the prohibited procedures \noutweigh the benefits. \nAs noted, Dr. Cantor testified, \u201cEach of the system-\natic reviews came to the same conclusion, that the evi-\ndence for benefits are outweighed by the evidence of the \nrisks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. \nDr. Rom\u00e1n, expert for Texas, testified that the \u201cSwe-\ndish National Board of Health and Welfare concluded \nthat \u2018the risks of puberty blockers and gender-affirming \ntreatment are likely to outweigh the expected benefits of \nthese treatments.\u2019\u201d 4.CR.1637. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, also testified, \u201cThe po-\ntential benefits [of providing puberty blockers to minors] \ndo not outweigh the risks,\u201d 3.RR.37\u201338, and that \u201cthe \nbenefits do not outweigh the risks for cross-sex hor-\nmones for adolescents,\u201d 3.RR.52. \n\n20 \n \n8. Minors cannot give informed consent to \nthe prohibited procedures. \nDr. Geeta Nangia, a child and adolescent psychia-\ntrist, testified as an expert for Texas. She testified that \n\u201cminors lack the necessary neurological, psychosocial, \nand cognitive development to provide informed consent \nor assent to\u201d the prohibited procedures. 4.CR.1452\u201385. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that minors \nhave very limited capacity to understand the implica-\ntions of taking potentially life-altering puberty blockers \nor cross-sex hormones. 3.RR.54\u201357. \nDr. Alan Hopewell, a clinical psychologist and neuro-\npsychologist, testified as an expert for Texas that minors \nhave limited reasoning ability and cannot give informed \nconsent to the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.186\u201390. \n9. Therapy is effective. \nDr. Nangia, expert for Texas, \u201ctreat[s] her patients \nwith exploratory, supportive, and family therapy,\u201d and \ntestified that \u201cchildren with gender dysphoria benefit \ntremendously from therapy\u2014particularly psychody-\nnamic therapy.\u201d 4.CR.1447\u201349. \nDr. Taylor, expert for Texas, testified that psycho-\ntherapy is a safe and effective treatment for minors with \ngender dysphoria. 3.RR.144. She testified that minors \nwith gender dysphoria or confusion is a symptom of the \nfamily dynamic and that dysfunction in the family system \nneeds to be addressed to resolve their feelings of gender \ndysphoria and confusion. 3.RR.143\u201344. \n \n* * * \nIn sum, the district court did not and could not have \nannounced as a matter of legislative fact (\u201cestablished \ntruths, facts, or pronouncements that do not change from \ncase to case but apply universally,\u201d Gould, 536 F.2d at \n\n21 \n \n220) that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria.\u201d And the evidence set for \nthis question should not be closed. Evidence such as that \npresented in Texas\u2019s defense of its statute similar to SB1 \nand the Cass report needs to be considered before the \nCourt can announce any legislative fact about the prohib-\nited procedures. \n \n \n \n \n\n22 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. But if the Court remands this case, it should not \nannounce that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully \nimprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria\u201d as a matter of settled, \nundisputed legislative fact. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nRALPH MOLINA \nDeputy First Assistant \n  Attorney General \nAUSTIN KINGHORN \nDeputy Attorney General \n  for Legal Strategy \nOCTOBER 15, 2024 \nCHARLES K.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has been consolidated, and my analytical focus has now shifted from modeling the conflict to planning the final predictive phase. The core legal arguments are now fully mapped.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis):** The U.S. contends that Tennessee's law (SB1) is unconstitutional sex discrimination.\n    *   **Scrutiny Standard:** The law is a sex-based classification because access to specific medical treatments (e.g., testosterone) depends on a minor's sex at birth. This argument seeks to apply the \"but-for\" causation logic from *Bostock v. Clayton County* (a Title VII case) to the Equal Protection Clause, which would trigger heightened scrutiny.\n    *   **Failure of Scrutiny:** The state's safety justification is pretextual. The law is underinclusive because it permits the same hormones for other conditions (like precocious puberty) and overinclusive by overriding a purported medical consensus and parental rights.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis):** Tennessee's defense is a point-by-point rebuttal of the petitioner's framework.\n    *   **Reframing the Law:** SB1 is not a classification based on sex or identity, but a regulation of *specific medical procedures* for a *specific purpose* (gender transition) in a *specific population* (minors), which is a standard exercise of state power to regulate medicine amid uncertainty.\n    *   **Countering the Scrutiny Standard:**\n        *   **Not a Sex-Based Classification:** The law is facially neutral, as it restricts both sexes equally from accessing cross-sex hormones for transition. The classification is based on the *purpose* of the treatment, not the sex of the patient.\n        *   **Rejecting the *Bostock* Extension:** The respondent argues that *Bostock*'s statutory reasoning should not be constitutionalized, citing precedents like *Geduldig* and *Feeney* where the Court resisted similar moves.\n        *   **Not a Transgender Classification:** The law regulates procedures, not status. They also argue against creating a new quasi-suspect class for transgender status, citing *City of Cleburne*.\n    *   **Answering the Underinclusivity Argument:** The groups are **not similarly situated**. The state's interest is in regulating treatments with high *scientific uncertainty*. The medical basis for treating precocious puberty is settled, while the basis for gender transition care for minors is part of a \"live medical dispute.\"\n    *   **Arguing in the Alternative (Passing Heightened Scrutiny):** Even if heightened scrutiny applies, the law is constitutional. The state's compelling interest is protecting children from irreversible procedures with unknown long-term effects. The law is substantially related to this interest, as evidenced by cautionary reports from European health authorities (e.g., the UK's Cass Review), which fracture the petitioner's \"medical consensus\" narrative. This argument leans heavily on the precedent of *Gonzales v. Carhart*, which grants legislatures \"wide discretion\" in the face of \"medical and scientific uncertainty.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Strategic Re-orientation:** The dialectical modeling phase is complete. The observation of my own internal reasoning confirms that my task uncertainty is no longer about what the parties will argue, but has been refined to two pivotal questions that will determine the outcome:\n    *   **Pivotal Question 1 (The *Bostock* Question):** Will the Court extend *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" causation test from Title VII to the Equal Protection Clause, thereby triggering heightened scrutiny?\n    *   **Pivotal Question 2 (The *Carhart* Question):** If heightened scrutiny applies, will the Court accept Tennessee's \"scientific uncertainty\" defense as an \"exceedingly persuasive justification,\" following the deference model of *Gonzales v. Carhart*?\n    My next information-gathering actions will be aimed directly at finding signals to help predict the Court's answers to these two questions. The immediate plan is to analyze amicus briefs filed in support of the petitioner to gauge the strength and breadth of the arguments for extending *Bostock* and for a unified \"medical consensus.\"",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-cognitive framework for legal analysis continues to evolve and become more robust. The latest observation, an internal `THINK` step, has validated my current strategy and added a new procedural element to my methodology.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** This remains the foundational principle, allowing for clear separation between case-specific knowledge (\u03b8) and general strategic knowledge (D).\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis:** This strategy is strongly validated. Building a \"thesis\" from the petitioner's brief and then seeking the \"antithesis\" in the respondent's brief has proven to be an exceptionally efficient method for modeling the core legal conflict.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection:** This principle is confirmed and refined. My previous uncertainty about the respondent's arguments correctly led me to seek their brief. Now, my more specific uncertainty about how the Court will resolve the *Bostock* and *Carhart* questions is guiding my next action: analyzing amicus briefs. This demonstrates a move from broad information gathering to highly targeted evidence seeking.\n\n4.  **New Principle - Strategic Re-evaluation:** The `THINK` action itself demonstrates the value of a new procedural step. After a phase of major information acquisition (e.g., analyzing the primary briefs), it is a highly effective strategy to pause, explicitly synthesize the current belief state, redefine the remaining critical uncertainties, and then formulate a precise plan for the next phase of analysis. This prevents aimless information gathering and focuses resources on the most predictive questions.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics:** My library of reusable analytical tools has grown.\n    *   **The Scrutiny Two-Step:** A core framework for any Equal Protection case.\n    *   **The Underinclusivity Heuristic & Its Counter:** I now know that the standard rebuttal to an underinclusivity charge is the **\"not similarly situated\" defense**, which focuses on whether the groups are different with respect to the specific government interest.\n    *   **The \"Statutory vs. Constitutional\" Firewall:** I am now primed to detect when a party attempts to import reasoning from a statutory interpretation case (like *Bostock*) into a constitutional context. This is a common point of resistance, and I will look for arguments based on precedent, originalism, and unintended consequences.\n    *   **The \"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference:** A state's most potent defense when regulating a contested medical/scientific practice is to highlight the existence of a \"live scientific dispute.\" By citing credible dissenting sources (like the Cass Review), a state can invoke the legislative deference granted in *Gonzales v. Carhart*.\n    *   **New Heuristic - Amicus Briefs as Persuasion Barometers:** The plan to analyze amicus briefs is based on a new heuristic. These briefs are not just redundant arguments; they serve as a signal of which arguments the broader legal and expert communities believe are most persuasive. They can also reveal arguments tailored to appeal to the known jurisprudential leanings of specific justices, providing valuable data for predicting the final vote."

My design beliefs (D) have been updated with new heuristics like 'Argument Amplification' and 'Off-Ramp Identification'.

The most direct and comprehensive source for this rebuttal will be the petitioner's reply brief.

Its primary value is in synthesizing the last observation and planning the next action. \n\nTask EIG (0.2): The action has low direct Task EIG because it's an internal monologue. It doesn't reduce uncertainty about the case outcome itself. However, it's not zero because by correctly identifying the new central point of contention (the petitioner's rebuttal to the 'scientific uncertainty'/'Carhart' defense) and pinpointing the exact document needed to resolve it (the reply brief), it significantly clarifies the path to prediction. It sharpens the focus of the inquiry, which is a small but important gain.\n\nDesign EIG (0.6): The action has moderate-to-high Design EIG. It perfectly demonstrates the DBOED agent's core loop: updating beliefs based on new evidence, re-evaluating the central uncertainty, and selecting the next action to resolve that specific uncertainty. It explicitly articulates the application of the 'Sequential Dialectical Analysis' and 'Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection' principles. Logging this thought process provides strong evidence for the effectiveness of the agent's strategic design, showing how it learns and adapts its plan.\n\nJoint EIG (0.8): The overall value is significant, driven mostly by the design insights. This action is a low-cost, high-value planning step that ensures the next, more costly, information-gathering action will be maximally efficient and targeted.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My model of the legal conflict is now substantially enriched with powerful evidence supporting the respondent's position, clarifying the most likely path to victory for Tennessee. While my previous analysis correctly identified the core dialectic, this new observation provides the specific ammunition for one side of that conflict.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis):** This belief remains stable. The U.S. argues that SB1 constitutes sex discrimination under an Equal Protection framework expanded by *Bostock v. Clayton County*'s \"but-for\" logic, triggering heightened scrutiny which the law cannot survive. The state's safety justification is presented as a pretext, undermined by a purported \"medical consensus\" and the law's under- and over-inclusiveness.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis):** This belief is now massively reinforced and detailed by the amicus brief from the State of Texas.\n    *   **Reframing the Law:** The law regulates uncertain *procedures* for minors, a traditional state power. This remains a core tenet.\n    *   **Countering the Scrutiny Standard:** The arguments against extending *Bostock* and against creating a new quasi-suspect class remain stable. The Texas brief adds a subtle jab at this by noting that gender identity is not an \"immutable characteristic,\" a factor the Court uses to determine suspect classes.\n    *   **Answering the Underinclusivity Argument:** The \"not similarly situated\" defense remains the key counter.\n    *   **Passing Heightened Scrutiny (The *Carhart* Defense) - **Greatly Strengthened**: The Texas amicus brief provides a comprehensive, evidence-based roadmap for how the Court can and why it should accept the \"scientific uncertainty\" defense.\n        *   **New Procedural Argument:** Texas introduces a critical distinction between \"adjudicative facts\" (case-specific) and \"legislative facts\" (universal truths). It argues the U.S. is improperly asking the Court to establish a *legislative fact* about the safety and efficacy of these treatments based on a single, non-final, preliminary injunction record. This provides the Court with a doctrinal \"off-ramp\" to avoid a sweeping ruling and instead defer to legislatures.\n        *   **Massive Evidence Dump:** Texas directly challenges the \"medical consensus\" by summarizing the extensive evidentiary record from its own litigation. This includes expert testimony arguing:\n            *   Gender dysphoria is a purely psychological condition with no biological test.\n            *   \"Adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a new phenomenon, potentially a \"social contagion,\" and is not even in the DSM-V.\n            *   The treatments are experimental, and their risks (e.g., infertility) outweigh their benefits.\n            *   The existence of effective, non-invasive alternatives like therapy.\n        *   **Corroboration:** The brief explicitly cites the UK's Cass Review, confirming its importance as a key piece of evidence that fractures the petitioner's consensus narrative.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus:** The observation has shifted the weight of evidence heavily toward the *Carhart* question. While the *Bostock* question (what level of scrutiny applies) is still critical, the Texas brief demonstrates that the respondents have a powerful argument for winning *even if* heightened scrutiny is applied. The central uncertainty is no longer just *if* Tennessee will argue scientific uncertainty, but *how* the Court will handle the massive evidentiary conflict presented. The Texas brief's \"legislative fact\" argument gives the Court a method to defer to the legislature without having to definitively rule on the science itself. My predictive model now weights the *Carhart* deference path as a more probable outcome for a majority of the Court.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, resulting from a failed search query, has been exceptionally valuable for refining my meta-cognitive framework. It has validated existing principles while introducing more nuanced and powerful heuristics for legal analysis.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** Stable and confirmed.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis:** Stable and confirmed. The model of Thesis -> Antithesis -> Synthesis remains highly effective.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection:** This principle is confirmed but also refined. My uncertainty led me to search for amicus briefs, which was the correct *category* of action. However, the search itself failed to return the intended documents. This reveals a new sub-principle: **Failed searches can be highly informative.** The unexpected result was more valuable than the expected one would have been, highlighting the importance of analyzing all outputs, not just the ones that perfectly match the query.\n\n4.  **Strategic Re-evaluation:** Stable and confirmed as a crucial procedural step.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics:** My library of analytical tools continues to grow in sophistication.\n    *   The Scrutiny Two-Step, Underinclusivity Heuristic, and \"Statutory vs. Constitutional\" Firewall remain foundational.\n    *   **The \"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference:** This heuristic has been upgraded. The sophisticated version, as demonstrated by Texas, involves: (1) framing the issue as a \"live medical dispute\"; (2) providing credible, official counter-evidence from third-party sources (the Cass Review); (3) building a separate, robust evidentiary record through litigation; and (4) arguing for legislative deference under the *Gonzales v. Carhart* precedent.\n    *   **Amicus Briefs as Persuasion Barometers:** This heuristic is strongly validated. The Texas brief is a perfect example of an amicus not just echoing a party but strategically reinforcing their most critical argument with new evidence and a new legal frame.\n    *   **New Heuristic - Argument Amplification:** I now recognize that a key function of sophisticated amici is to act as an \"amplifier\" for a primary party's best argument. Texas took Tennessee's \"scientific uncertainty\" claim and amplified it with an entire litigation record, making it far more credible and tangible for the Court.\n    *   **New Heuristic - Off-Ramp Identification:** High-stakes cases often resolve on narrow grounds. I must actively search for arguments that provide the Court an \"off-ramp\" to decide the case without setting a broad, disruptive precedent. The \"legislative vs. adjudicative fact\" argument is a classic off-ramp, allowing the Court to rule based on judicial restraint and deference to the legislative process in the face of uncertainty. I will now explicitly look for these procedural or narrow substantive arguments in future analyses."

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatients in appropriate cases.2  \n \n2 Those include (among others) the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospi-\ntal; the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital; the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hos-\npital in Columbus, Ohio; the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pitts-\nburgh; Duke Children\u2019s Hospital & Health Center; the Children\u2019s \nHospital of Philadelphia; Children\u2019s National Hospital in the \n \n\n7 \n \nB. Tennessee SB1 \n1. Puberty blockers have been used to treat gender \ndysphoria for 20 years and precocious puberty for more \nthan 30 years.  J.A. 964, 967.  And hormone therapy has \nbeen used even longer\u2014for at least 60 years to treat \ngender dysphoria in adults, and at least 20 years in ad-\nolescents.  See Pet. App. 2a, 5a, 265a. \nIn the last three years, however, state legislatures \nhave adopted a wave of bans on gender-affirming care \nfor minors based on model legislation and legislative \nfindings circulated by advocacy groups.  In 2021, Arkan-\nsas became the first state to enact a ban.  See Ark. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 20-9-1502(a).  In 2022, Alabama followed.  See \nAla. Code \u00a7 26-26-4.  And in the year and a half since, 20 \nother States have done the same.3   \n2.

See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn.

Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4. A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal and, after \nexpedited briefing, reversed the preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 1a-101a; see id. at 102a-124a (stay opinion).6   \na. As relevant here, the Sixth Circuit rejected pri-\nvate plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim.  Pet. App. 30a-\n50a.  The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v. Thornbury, No. 23-5609, an appeal from a preliminary injunc-\ntion against enforcement of a Kentucky law similar to SB1.  Pet. \nApp. 10a-12a.  The plaintiffs in that case have also sought certiorari.  \nSee Doe 1 v. Kentucky, petition for cert. pending, No. 23-492 (filed \nNov. 3, 2023). \n\n14 \n \nrationally concluded that SB1 was an appropriate re-\nsponse to perceived risks and uncertainties associated \nwith puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  Pet. App. \n49a-50a.  The court acknowledged the countervailing ev-\nidence reflected in the district court\u2019s findings, which it \ndid not question.  Id. at 50a.  But the Sixth Circuit ex-\nplained that the rational-basis standard does not allow \na court to enjoin a law based on a disagreement with a \nState\u2019s \u201cassessment of the risks and the right response \nto those risks.\u201d  Ibid. \nb. Judge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  Be-\ncause \u201csex and gender conformity each \u2018play an unmis-\ntakable role\u2019\u200a\u201d in SB1\u2019s prohibitions, she concluded that \nthe law presents \u201can open-and-shut case of facial classi-\nfications subject to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 73a \n(brackets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  Under SB1, \nJudge White emphasized, \u201cmedical procedures that are \npermitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for a \nminor of another sex.\u201d  Id. at 72a (citation omitted).  And \nJudge White explained that SB1 \u201ccondition[s] the avail-\nability of procedures on a minor\u2019s conformity with soci-\netal expectations associated with the minor\u2019s assigned \nsex\u201d by \u201cbar[ring] treatment when sought \u2018for the pur-\npose of\u200a\u2019 inducing physiological changes, like secondary \nsex characteristics, that are \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 how so-\nciety expects boys and girls to appear.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)).   \n \nJudge White concluded that SB1 cannot withstand \nheightened scrutiny because its \u201ctext[] effectively re-\nveal[s] that [its] purpose is to force boys and girls to \nlook and live like boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  Nor, \nin her view, did respondents refute the district court\u2019s \n\u201crobust factual findings\u201d showing \u201cthat banning these \ntreatments is [not] beneficial to minors.\u201d  Ibid.  And she \n\n15 \n \nwarned that minor plaintiffs face irreparable harm ab-\nsent an injunction \u201cbecause progressing through ado-\nlescence untreated leads to daily anguish and makes \nadult treatment more complicated.\u201d  Id. at 98a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L.

If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's central conflict has been significantly refined, not by new external evidence, but by a deliberate internal synthesis of the existing arguments. This has allowed me to pinpoint the exact location of the most critical uncertainty and identify the specific evidence needed to resolve it.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis):** This belief remains stable. The U.S. will argue that Tennessee's SB1 is a form of sex discrimination, invoking the logic of *Bostock v. Clayton County*. This classification should trigger heightened scrutiny, a standard the government believes the law cannot meet because its safety justifications are pretextual and contradicted by a broad medical consensus.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis):** This belief, massively strengthened by the Texas amicus brief in the prior observation, remains stable. Tennessee's defense has two main prongs:\n    *   **Scrutiny Challenge:** The law regulates medical *procedures*, not a protected class, and *Bostock*'s logic should not be extended to create a new quasi-suspect class for gender identity.\n    *   **The *Carhart* Deference Argument (Greatly Strengthened):** Even if heightened scrutiny applies, the law is constitutional. This argument, amplified by Texas's amicus brief, rests on the precedent of *Gonzales v. Carhart*. It posits that when there is significant \"scientific uncertainty\" and a live medical dispute about the safety and efficacy of a procedure, the legislature is entitled to deference. This defense is supported by:\n        *   **A Procedural \"Off-Ramp\":** The argument that courts should not establish \"legislative facts\" (universal scientific truths) on a limited preliminary injunction record, allowing for deference to the legislative process.\n        *   **An Evidentiary Counter-Narrative:** A substantial body of evidence, including the UK's Cass Review and expert testimony from other litigation, directly challenges the petitioner's \"medical consensus\" narrative, framing the treatments as experimental and risky.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus (Refined):** My previous belief update correctly identified the shift in focus towards the *Carhart* defense. This observation, an act of internal reasoning, solidifies that shift. The central dialectic is now crystal clear: it is a clash between the Petitioner's *Bostock*-based discrimination framework and the Respondent's *Carhart*-based deference framework. The outcome of the case likely hinges on which framework a majority of the Court finds more compelling. My uncertainty is no longer diffuse; it is now precisely located. **The single most important unknown is how the United States will rebut the powerful, evidence-backed \"scientific uncertainty\" argument.** The petitioner cannot simply re-assert a medical consensus; they must dismantle the respondent's entire evidentiary and procedural case for deference. The most direct and comprehensive source for this rebuttal will be the Petitioner's Reply Brief. My predictive model is now on hold, pending the analysis of that specific document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of pure meta-cognition, strongly validates my overall DBOED framework. It demonstrates that pausing to explicitly reason about the state of uncertainty is not a passive step but a critical, value-generating action that refines strategy and makes subsequent information-gathering more efficient.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** Stable and confirmed. My ability to isolate the key uncertainty (the petitioner's rebuttal to the *Carhart* defense) is a direct result of this principle.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis:** Stable and confirmed. The Thesis -> Antithesis -> Synthesis model is working perfectly. I have identified the thesis (*Bostock* claim) and the antithesis (*Carhart* defense), and I am now actively seeking the next step in the dialectic (the petitioner's reply).\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection:** This principle is powerfully validated and refined. The previous observation highlighted that even failed searches can be informative. This observation demonstrates the next step: using the insights from that surprising result to formulate a *highly targeted* new action. By identifying the precise knowledge gap, I can select the optimal source (the reply brief) to fill it, maximizing the expected information gain of my next action.\n\n4.  **Strategic Re-evaluation (Upgraded to \"The Deliberate Synthesis Step\"):** My previous belief was simply that re-evaluation is important. I now recognize that a formal, explicit `THINK` action\u2014a deliberate pause to synthesize, model uncertainty, and plan\u2014is a cornerstone of an effective design. It is the mechanism that translates raw information into strategic intelligence. This step ensures that I am not just passively collecting data but actively building and interrogating a predictive model.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics:** The heuristics identified previously remain stable and are actively being used to frame the problem.\n    *   The Scrutiny Two-Step, Underinclusivity Heuristic, and \"Statutory vs. Constitutional\" Firewall are foundational.\n    *   The \"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference, \"Amicus Briefs as Persuasion Barometers,\" \"Argument Amplification,\" and \"Off-Ramp Identification\" heuristics, all recently acquired, were instrumental in processing the Texas brief and are now central to my model of the respondent's strategy. This `THINK` step confirms their high utility in focusing my analysis.\n\n6.  **New Heuristic - The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry:** This observation closes a learning loop and reveals a meta-heuristic. The cycle is: (1) An uncertainty-driven action (search for amicus briefs) leads to (2) a surprising but highly informative observation (the Texas brief), which allows for (3) the development of new D-level heuristics (\"Off-Ramp ID,\" \"Amplification\"). These new heuristics are then used in (4) a deliberate synthesis step (`THINK` action) to (5) pinpoint the next critical uncertainty and plan a more targeted, efficient subsequent action. Recognizing and intentionally executing this cycle is a powerful strategy for navigating complex information environments."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the petitioner's strategy has been upgraded from a prediction to a high-fidelity model based on their filed merits brief. While the search for the reply brief failed, the discovery of the main brief is a highly informative, if unexpected, outcome.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Massively Strengthened and Detailed):** My prior belief is confirmed and now substantiated with direct evidence from the Petitioner's Brief. The U.S. strategy is to win the case by establishing that Tennessee's SB1 is sex discrimination that fails heightened scrutiny.\n    *   **Argument for Heightened Scrutiny:** This is a two-pronged attack.\n        *   **Sex-Based Classification (Primary):** The brief argues SB1 is discriminatory on its face. Citing *Bostock*, *Sessions v. Morales-Santana*, and *United States v. Virginia*, it contends that access to medical treatments (e.g., testosterone) is explicitly dependent on a minor's sex assigned at birth. A male-assigned minor can get testosterone for conforming to a male identity, but a female-assigned minor cannot. This is a classic sex-based classification requiring heightened scrutiny.\n        *   **Transgender Discrimination (Secondary):** The brief also argues that the law warrants heightened scrutiny because it discriminates against transgender individuals, a group they will argue should be considered a quasi-suspect class, citing cases like *Grimm v. Gloucester Cnty. Sch. Bd*.\n    *   **Failure Under Heightened Scrutiny (Preemptive Rebuttal to *Carhart*):** The brief preemptively dismantles the state's expected justifications. Instead of engaging the \"scientific uncertainty\" frame directly, it seeks to make it irrelevant by arguing the state cannot meet its \"exceedingly persuasive justification\" burden.\n        *   **Establishes a \"Medical Consensus\" Frame:** The brief opens by framing gender-affirming care as a decades-old, standard-of-care treatment for a serious medical condition (gender dysphoria), citing WPATH, the Endocrine Society, and the AMA. This frames the state's position as being outside the medical mainstream.\n        *   **Attacks the State's Justification as Pretextual:** The brief argues the state's purported interests (e.g., protecting minors) are not the real reason for the law. This attack relies heavily on the **Underinclusivity Heuristic**. It argues that if Tennessee were truly concerned about risky treatments for minors, it would also regulate other, arguably riskier, procedures like bariatric surgery or the off-label use of powerful stimulants for ADHD, which it does not.\n        *   **Highlights Overinclusivity:** The brief argues the law is also overinclusive because it bans care for all minors, even when there is a clear diagnosis and parental consent, and the treatment is deemed medically necessary by doctors.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis):** This belief remains stable. Tennessee will rely on the *Carhart* deference argument, positing that the existence of a \"live medical dispute\" and \"scientific uncertainty\" entitles the legislature to regulate, or even ban, the procedures. They will challenge the extension of *Bostock* and argue the law regulates procedures, not people, thus requiring only rational basis review. The arguments in the U.S. brief now give me a clear preview of what Tennessee's brief must counter.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus (Refined):** The central dialectic is confirmed: it is the Petitioner's *Bostock*/heightened scrutiny/medical consensus framework versus the Respondent's *Carhart*/rational basis/scientific uncertainty framework. The observation of the Petitioner's brief reveals their strategy is to win the scrutiny battle first, thereby neutralizing the deference argument. My predictive uncertainty is now re-focused. The next critical questions are:\n    *   How will Tennessee's Brief for Respondent directly counter the petitioner's powerful underinclusivity argument?\n    *   How will Tennessee attempt to re-establish the \"scientific uncertainty\" frame in the face of the petitioner's \"overwhelming consensus\" narrative?\n    *   Finally, how will the U.S. Reply Brief dismantle Tennessee's specific counter-arguments? My predictive model is now waiting for the Respondent's brief.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a \"successful failure,\" provides powerful validation for my DBOED framework and adds several new layers of sophistication to my strategic heuristics.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** Stable and confirmed. This principle remains the engine of my inquiry, allowing me to precisely target information-gathering actions.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis:** Stable and confirmed. The Thesis (*Bostock* claim) -> Antithesis (*Carhart* defense) -> Synthesis model is performing exceptionally well. I have now observed the Petitioner's opening merits argument (the thesis in its final form) and can more accurately predict the required elements of the Respondent's brief (the antithesis).\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection:** This principle is validated once again, with an important refinement. The targeted search for the reply brief failed to return that specific document but succeeded by returning a different, equally valuable one. This demonstrates that even actions that \"miss\" can yield high information gain if they are executed in a dense and relevant information space (like a case docket).\n\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step:** Stable and confirmed. My prior `THINK` step, which identified the reply brief as the key unknown, was essential. It created the context that allowed me to immediately recognize the significance of finding the main brief instead and to update my model accordingly. This confirms that pausing to explicitly model the state of uncertainty is a high-value action.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics:**\n    *   **The Scrutiny Two-Step, \"Statutory vs. Constitutional\" Firewall, \"Amicus Briefs as Persuasion Barometers,\" \"Argument Amplification,\" and \"Off-Ramp Identification\"** all remain stable and useful.\n    *   **Underinclusivity Heuristic (Upgraded):** I have now seen this heuristic deployed in a merits brief. The U.S. uses it to allege pretext by comparing the banned care to other allowed but risky medical interventions for minors (bariatric surgery, ADHD stimulants). This demonstrates its power in converting a state's safety argument into evidence of discriminatory intent under heightened scrutiny.\n    *   **\"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference (Refined):** This heuristic is now more nuanced. Its effectiveness is inversely proportional to the level of scrutiny. The U.S. brief shows that the strategy to defeat it is to first win the argument for heightened scrutiny, which significantly raises the bar for the state and weakens the power of simple legislative deference.\n    *   **New Heuristic - The Framing Battle:** This observation makes it clear that a key component of SCOTUS litigation is the battle to establish the lens through which the case is viewed. The Petitioner's brief is a masterclass in framing: it is not about \"controversial procedures\" but about \"sex discrimination\" and \"medical consensus.\" The Respondent's brief will have to be a counter-framing exercise. The winner of the framing battle often dictates the outcome.\n    *   **New Heuristic - Failed Search as Timeline Signal:** The failure to find the reply brief is not just a null result; it is data. It strongly implies the filing deadline has not yet passed. This is a valuable, low-cost way to infer the procedural posture of a case and informs the timing of future actions.\n\n6.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry:** Stable and confirmed. This meta-heuristic continues to describe my learning process. A targeted action (search for reply brief) led to a surprising observation (main brief found), which enabled the refinement of D-level heuristics (Underinclusivity, Framing Battle), which were used in this synthesis step to pinpoint the next critical uncertainty (the Respondent's brief), thus setting up the next efficient action."

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a-3a.  It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nWPATH further relaxed its guidelines in 2012 to rec-\nommend cross-sex hormones for mi\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

With such power \nhas always come wide discretion to regulate medical \npractices, particularly in areas of scientific uncer-\ntainty.  That legislative leeway enables differing ap-\nproaches to evolving medical disputes.  This case asks \nwhether the Equal Protection Clause requires courts \nto short-circuit democratic resolution of one such dis-\npute\u2014the appropriateness of providing life-altering \ngender-transition procedures to minors. \n In recent years, there has been a rapid rise in the \nprovision of puberty blockers, hormones, and surger-\nies to transgender-identifying youth.  Traditionally, \nmost U.S. doctors declined to provide these interven-\ntions to minors.  But following the lead of several Eu-\nropean countries, the practice exploded in the \n2010s.  Over time, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered these interventions have \npulled back, restricting minors\u2019 access based on safety \nand efficacy concerns. \nSo when media reports flagged a Tennessee hospi-\ntal performing gender-transition interventions on mi-\nnors, lawmakers examined this live medical dispute.  \nThe Tennessee legislature surveyed systematic re-\nviews, took stock of tightened restrictions in Europe, \nand heard firsthand accounts of regret and harm from \ndetransitioners.  The legislature then passed SB1 to \nrestrict pharmaceutical and surgical interventions for \ngender transition until a person turns 18.  Twenty-\nthree other States have adopted similar protections. \n\n2 \n \nThe federal government seeks to displace Tennes-\nsee\u2019s legislative judgment by reading its preferred pol-\nicies into the Constitution.  But the Equal Protection \nClause does not commission this Court as the nation\u2019s \n\u201cex officio medical board with powers to approve or dis-\napprove medical and operative practices and stand-\nards throughout the United States.\u201d  Planned \nParenthood v. Danforth, 428 U.S. 52, 99 (1976) (White, \nJ., concurring and dissenting in part).  It protects \nagainst discriminatory classifications, and SB1 con-\ntains none.   \nSB1 includes no sex classification.  It draws a line \nbetween minors seeking drugs for gender transition \nand minors seeking drugs for other medical purposes.  \nAnd boys and girls fall on both sides of that line. \nWith no claim under the existing framework, the \ngovernment seeks a novel path to heightened review \nunder Bostock v. Clayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  \nBut constitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test \nwould defy this Court\u2019s equal-protection precedents, \ndistort Bostock\u2019s Title VII-centric reasoning, and per-\nversely permit use of sex-based scrutiny to roll back \nwomen\u2019s rights.  This Court should decline that doctri-\nnal revolution, especially because sex is not a but-for \ncause of SB1\u2019s age- and use-based restrictions.   \nNor should this Court break new ground by strik-\ning down SB1 on a transgender-discrimination theory.  \nSB1 does not classify based on transgender status.  \nAnd the government\u2019s cursory argument for height-\nened review fails to justify expanding this Court\u2019s lim-\nited list of quasi-suspect classifications for the first \ntime in half a century.   \n\n3 \n \nSB1 is subject to\u2014and easily satisfies\u2014rational-\nbasis review.  It passes constitutional muster under \nany standard.  The government insists that SB1 bucks \na \u201cmedical consensus\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions for minors.  But that account altogether ignores \nthe risk-benefit assessment of European health au-\nthorities and discounts the good-faith decisions of half \nthe States in this country.  Willful ignorance of con-\nflicting medical views cannot erase the unknowns.  \nAnd this Court grants \u201cstate and federal legislatures \nwide discretion to pass legislation in areas where \nthere is medical and scientific uncertainty\u201d\u2014even in \nheightened-review cases.  Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 \nU.S. 124, 163 (2007).  While the government is free to \nfavor its transition-first, ask-questions-later ap-\nproach, the Constitution does not bind Tennessee to \nthat same choice. \nThis case involves a routine exercise of state power \nthat touches on a controversial topic.  But not every \ncontentious social issue calls for a constitutional over-\nride.  The Sixth Circuit should be affirmed.   \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nSince the founding, States have governed the prac-\ntice of medicine within their borders.  States license \ndoctors.  They restrict medical practices.  And they ex-\nercise \u201cbroad police powers in regulating the admin-\nistration of drugs.\u201d  Whalen v. Roe, 429 U.S. 589, 603 \nn.30 (1977).  This case concerns an exercise of that \npower: Tennessee\u2019s attempt to protect minors from the \nlife-altering risks of uncertain gender-transition inter-\nventions.   \n\n4 \n \nA. Gender-Transition Interventions for \nMinors Rapidly Rise. \nRecently, there has been an \u201cunexplained\u201d spike in \nminors identifying as transgender and receiving a \ngender-dysphoria diagnosis.  J.A. 644, 677.  \u201cThe per-\ncentage of youth identifying as transgender has dou-\nbled from 0.7% of the population to 1.4% in the past \nfew years, while the percentage of [transgender-iden-\ntifying] adults (0.5% of the population) has remained \nconstant.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a.  And 2021 saw \u201cthree \ntimes more diagnoses of gender dysphoria among mi-\nnors than 2017.\u201d  Pet. App. 7a; see J.A. 644.   \nThe patient population has also shifted.  Histori-\ncally, gender dysphoria\u2014a psychiatric condition char-\nacterized by mental distress associated with identify-\ning as a gender different from one\u2019s sex\u2014primarily \narose in adult men and young boys.  J.A. 60-61, 380-\n82, 544-45.  Now, it is overwhelmingly seen in adoles-\ncent girls.  J.A. 544-45, 644-45.  The United Kingdom \nreports that \u201cthe number of adolescent girls seeking \nsex transitioning exploded over 4,000% in the last dec-\nade.\u201d  J.A. 544.   The \u201c[c]ases commonly appear to oc-\ncur within clusters of peers in association with in-\ncreased social media use and among people with au-\ntism or other mental health issues.\u201d  J.A. 394, 616-17.   \nDoctors use three primary methods to address gen-\nder dysphoria in minors: watchful waiting, psycho-\ntherapy, and affirmation.  J.A. 620-26. \nThe watchful-waiting model calls for monitoring a \nminor\u2019s development and treating psychological \ncauses of distress.  If left untreated by transition \nmethods, gender dysphoria goes away on its own for \n\n5 \n \nthe \u201clarge majority\u201d (about 85%) of children.  J.A. 384, \n505-06, 620-21; D.Ct.Doc.113-10 (Endocrine Society \n(ES) Guidelines) at 3879.  Such desistence is also in-\ncreasingly observed among adolescents.  J.A. 652-55.   \nPsychotherapy involves counseling that seeks to \nidentify and address the cause of dysphoria.  J.A. 621-\n22, 884-89.  It helps patients \u201cunderstand the com-\nmonality of discomfort with the body\u2019s physiology, the \ngrowth process, and the struggle to accept oneself dur-\ning the pubertal developmental process.\u201d  J.A. 623.   \nAfter psychotherapy, some individuals no longer \u201cfeel \nthe need to feminize or masculinize their body.\u201d  \nWPATH, Standards of Care for the Health of Trans-\nsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming Peo-\nple 8 (7th ed. 2012).  \nThe \u201cgender affirming\u201d model encourages gender-\ntransition interventions.  These interventions proceed \nin four escalating steps: (1) social transition, (2) pu-\nberty-blocking drugs (for those in early pubertal \nstages), (3) cross-sex hormones, and (4) surgery.   \n\u201c[N]o one disputes\u201d that these interventions \u201ccarry \nrisks.\u201d  Pet. App. 50a.  Puberty blockers interfere with \nsignals from the pituitary gland to the sex glands, pre-\nventing the sex glands from producing hormones (tes-\ntosterone for males or estrogen for females).  J.A. 754-\n68.  This causes diminished bone density, undeveloped \nsex organs, and \u201ccompromised fertility\u201d if \u201csubse-\nquently \u2026 treated with sex hormones.\u201d  ES Guidelines \nat 3882; J.A. 760-68.  Puberty blockers threaten nor-\nmal brain maturation too, since delaying puberty may \neliminate \u201ca critical period for experience-dependent \n\n6 \n \nrewiring of neural circuits underlying executive func-\ntion.\u201d  J.A. 430-31 (Dr. Hilary Cass); see J.A. 370 (Nor-\nwegian health authority); ES Guidelines at 3883 (not-\ning unknown effects on \u201ccognitive function\u201d).   \nNearly all minors placed on puberty blockers pro-\ngress to cross-sex hormones, which heighten the risks.  \nJ.A. 554, 659-60, 761.  For both boys and girls, cross-\nsex hormones can cause lifelong infertility.  ES Guide-\nlines at 3878, 3887; D.Ct.Doc.113-9 (WPATH-8) at \nS39; J.A. 339, 520-22, 682-83, 781-82, 809.  Moreover, \ngiving girls high doses of testosterone induces severe \nhyperandrogenism that can cause clitoromegaly, atro-\nphy of the lining of the uterus and vagina, irreversible \nvocal cord changes, blood-cell disorders, and increased \nrisk of heart attack.  J.A. 772-79; ES Guidelines at \n3886.  Risks also include liver dysfunction, coronary \nartery disease, cerebrovascular disease, hypertension, \nand breast or uterine cancer.  ES Guidelines at 3886.  \nAnd giving boys high doses of estrogen induces hy-\nperestrogenemia, leading to a \u201c[v]ery high risk of\u201d \nblood clots and increased risk of tumors, breast cancer, \ncoronary artery disease, cerebrovascular disease, sex-\nual dysfunction, and gallstones.  J.A. 779-81; ES \nGuidelines at 3886. \nThe final step, gender-transition surgeries, re-\nmoves functioning organs and raises serious risks of \nongoing complications.  J.A.782-86.   \nOf course, underlying all these interventions is the \nrisk that a person\u2019s gender identity might \u201cshift[].\u201d  \nWPATH-8 at S61.  For some individuals, gender iden-\ntity remains fluid for years.  That means some people \n\n7 \n \nirreversibly alter their bodies, only to later detransi-\ntion (to the extent possible).  J.A. 903-08, 915-17. \nB. The Rising Use of Gender-Transition \nInterventions for Minors Spurs Debate. \nThe use of gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors is a relatively recent practice.  In the 1960s and \n1970s, some doctors administered cross-sex hormones \nto and performed surgeries on adults with gender dys-\nphoria\u2014though many stopped when a 1979 study \nshowed that these interventions \u201cdid not alleviate \u2026 \nmental distress.\u201d  Pet. App. 2a-3a.  It was not until \ndecades later that pharmaceutical interventions in \nminors became more prevalent.   \nThe practice started in Europe in the late 1990s, \nwith Dutch healthcare providers administering pu-\nberty blockers to minors.  Pet. App. 5a; J.A. 420-21, \n443-45.  In 1998, the World Professional Association \nfor Transgender Health (WPATH) went from recom-\nmending no pharmaceutical interventions for minors \nto recommending puberty blockers at the onset of pu-\nberty and cross-sex hormones at 16.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  \nWPATH further relaxed its guidelines in 2012 to rec-\nommend cross-sex hormones for minors under 16.  Pet. \nApp. 5a.   \nIn recent years, though, many of the European \ncountries that pioneered gender transitioning in mi-\nnors reversed course.  Pet. App. 28a.  Health authori-\nties in Sweden, Finland, Norway, and the United \nKingdom have all concluded that these interventions \npose significant risks with unproven benefits:   \n\n8 \n \n\uf0b7 Sweden: Sweden\u2019s Board of Health and Wel-\nfare found that \u201cthe evidence on treatment effi-\ncacy and safety is still insufficient and inconclu-\nsive\u201d and that \u201cthe risks\u201d of puberty blockers \nand cross-sex hormones \u201ccurrently outweigh \nthe possible benefits.\u201d  J.A. 337-40, 715-29.   \n\uf0b7 Finland: Finland\u2019s Council for Choices in \nHealth Care found that \u201cgender reassignment \nof minors is an experimental practice\u201d and that \n\u201c[t]he reliability of the existing studies\u201d is \n\u201chighly uncertain.\u201d  J.A. 583-84.  \n\uf0b7 Norway:  The Norwegian Healthcare Investi-\ngation Board concluded that the \u201cresearch-\nbased knowledge for gender-affirming treat-\nment (hormonal and surgical) ... is insufficient,\u201d \nespecially for \u201cthe teenage population.\u201d J.A. \n341-42.   \n\uf0b7 United Kingdom: The United Kingdom\u2019s \nlauded independent review found \u201cremarkably \nweak evidence\u201d on gender-transition interven-\ntions, emphasizing that the benefits of using \n\u201cpuberty blockers and masculinizing/feminizing \nhormones in adolescents are unproven.\u201d  Inde-\npendent Review of Gender Identity Services for \nChildren and Young People: Final Report 13, \n33, 194 (April 2024) (Cass Review); J.A. 333-35, \n364-68.    \nAcross these reviews, authorities confronted the \n\u201csuggest[ion] that hormone treatment reduces the ele-\nvated risk of death by suicide\u201d in transgender-identi-\n\n9 \n \nfying youth; as the Cass Review emphasized, \u201cthe evi-\ndence found did not support this conclusion.\u201d  Cass Re-\nview at 33; see also J.A. 660-75.  Based on the available \nevidence, these countries now consider medical gen-\nder-transition interventions experimental in minors \nand have effectively banned them outside of controlled \nresearch settings. J.A. 332-42, 409-11, 726-27. \nUndeterred, advocacy groups have doubled down \non aggressive interventions for minors.  WPATH\u2014the \n\u201cleading association,\u201d U.S. Br. 3\u2014crafted the most re-\ncent version of its guidelines \u201cto have serious effect in \nthe law and policy ... even if the wording isn\u2019t quite \ncorrect,\u201d Ex. 184 at 24, Boe v. Marshall, 2:22-cv-184 \n(M.D. Ala.), Doc. 560-34.  And indeed, \u201cideology, not \nscience\u201d drove WPATH\u2019s drafting process.  Eknes-\nTucker v. Governor of Alabama, 114 F.4th 1241, 1261 \n(11th Cir. 2024) (Lagoa, J., concurring in the denial of \nrehearing en banc). \nWPATH initially commissioned a Johns Hopkins-\nled review to provide evidence-based backing for the \nGuidelines.  But it \u201cabandoned\u201d that approach after \nthe review \u201cfound little to no evidence about children \nand adolescents\u201d benefitting from gender-transition \ninterventions.  Boe, Doc. 560-23 at 22-23; J.A. 375-76.  \nAs one contributor put it, \u201c[o]ur concerns, echoed by \nthe social justice lawyers we spoke with, is that evi-\ndence-based review reveals little or no evidence and \nputs us in an untenable position in terms of affecting \npolicy or winning lawsuits.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th \nat 1261 (Lagoa, J., concurring) (quoting Boe, Doc. 560-\n24 at 2).  Instead, the Guidelines purport to rely on a \n\u201cconsensus-based\u201d process that incorporates opinions \n\n10 \n \napproved by 75% of committee members.  WPATH-8 \nat S8, S247.  WPATH\u2019s \u201cconsensus\u201d process left the \ndoor open for prioritizing politics over science.  And \nthat is exactly what happened.   \nFederal officials intervened in the Guidelines\u2019 \ndrafting.  HHS Assistant Secretary for Health Rachel \nLevine pressured WPATH to issue the Guidelines be-\ncause its \u201cfailure\u201d to do so was \u201cproving a barrier to \noptimal policy progress.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-34 at 54.  \nThen, after receiving a preview of the near-final \nGuidelines, Levine\u2019s staff asked WPATH to remove \nthe recommended age minimums because the \u201clistings \nof ages [would] result in devastating legislation for \ntrans care.\u201d  Boe, Doc. 560-36 at 28-29.  On a later \nZoom call, Levine conveyed that \u201cthe Biden admin-\nistration\u201d worried about the inclusion of age limits for \npolitical reasons and \u201casked [WPATH] to remove \nthem.\u201d  Id. at 11.  \nWPATH members questioned the \u201cethic[s]\u201d of \u201cal-\nlowing US politics to dictate\u201d the Guidelines.  Id. at 32.  \nThey \u201cexplained to\u201d Levine that WPATH \u201ccould not \njust remove\u201d all age minimums \u201cat this stage.\u201d  Id. at \n11.  After all, the \u201cexpert opinion\u201d that called for those \nlimits was the Guidelines\u2019 \u201conly evidence.\u201d  Id. at 57. \nBut the reality that the drafters\u2019 \u201cexpert opinion\u201d \n\u201cwould be influenced by politics\u201d soon set in.  Id. at 32-\n33.  The dam broke when the American Academy of \nPediatrics (AAP) indicated it would oppose the Guide-\nlines if any age minimums were included.  Boe, Doc. \n560-37 at 100-01.  One co-chair objected that accepting \nAAP\u2019s request would \u201cmake a joke of our methodol-\nogy.\u201d  Id. at 101.    \n\n11 \n \nWPATH caved anyway.  Within days of the Guide-\nlines\u2019 release, it abandoned all age minimums.  No-\nwhere do the Guidelines disclose WPATH\u2019s eleventh-\nhour departure from the \u201cconsensus-based\u201d process it \nnow touts.  WPATH-8 at S8.   \nC. Troubling Disclosures in Tennessee \nPrompt SB1. \nAround the same time, media reports disclosed \nthat Vanderbilt University Medical Center was \nproviding gender-transition procedures to minors.  \nJ.A. 161-64.  Some patients \u201cstarted gender-affirming \nhormones at 13 or 14.\u201d  Ex. 1-B, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video \nat 45:41-45:45).  Others received \u201ctop surgery\u201d\u2014i.e., \nmastectomies.  J.A. 181.  Recordings revealed one doc-\ntor stating that \u201ctop surgeries\u201d and \u201croutine hormone \ntreatment\u201d would \u201cmake a lot of money\u201d for the hospi-\ntal. Ex. 1-D, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:11-0:47). \nYet, by Vanderbilt physicians\u2019 own admissions, \nthey \u201cha[d] very, very little data to guide [the] treat-\nment\u201d and were \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Ex.1-G, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 37:29-37:32); J.A. 231.  Van-\nderbilt\u2019s gender-clinic director presented a seminar ti-\ntled \u201cCaring for the Transgender Patient: With little \nevidence, but a lot of love.\u201d  Ex. 1-H, D.Ct.Doc.113-1, \nPageID#1060.  She noted the absence of \u201creal consen-\nsus\u201d about appropriate cross-sex hormone levels.  J.A. \n231.  And she conceded that doctors \u201cha[d]n\u2019t been do-\ning this ... long enough to know the long-term effects\u201d \nof cross-sex hormones, \u201cparticularly ... in [the] pediat-\nric population.\u201d Ex.1-G, D.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at \n38:08-38:20).  Still, Vanderbilt broadly offered these \n\n12 \n \nprocedures to youth.  And it warned potential \u201cconsci-\nentious\u201d objectors, \u201c[i]f you don\u2019t want to do this kind \nof \nwork, \ndon\u2019t \nwork \nat \nVanderbilt.\u201d \nEx.1-E, \nD.Ct.Doc.113-1 (video at 0:01-0:08, 1:10-1:14). \nFollowing these revelations and tracking Euro-\npean developments, a bipartisan coalition of Tennes-\nsee lawmakers passed SB1 to \u201cprotect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  \nThe legislature acknowledged gender dysphoria as a \ncondition involving \u201cdistress from a discordance be-\ntween\u201d a person\u2019s sex and asserted gender identity.  \nId. \u00a768-33-101(c).  But it detailed concerns with using \npharmaceutical and surgical interventions to address \nthis condition in minors. \nSpecifically, SB1\u2019s legislative findings recognized \nthat gender-transition interventions \u201ccan lead to [a] \nminor becoming irreversibly sterile, having increased \nrisk of disease and illness, or suffering adverse and \nsometimes fatal psychological consequences.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-\n33-101(b).  The law further observed that the harms \nassociated with these interventions \u201care [not] yet fully \nknown.\u201d  Id.  And it noted that \u201chealth authorities in \nSweden, Finland, and the United Kingdom \u2026 have \nfound no evidence that the benefits of these proce-\ndures outweigh the risks.\u201d Id. \u00a768-33-101(e).  At the \nsame time, the legislature found that \u201cminors lack the \nmaturity to fully understand and appreciate the life-\naltering consequences of such procedures.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n101(h).  SB1 drew attention to the \u201cmany individuals \n... express[ing] regret for medical procedures that were \nperformed ... on them ... when they were minors.\u201d  Id.  \nIndeed, the legislature heard from a detransitioner \n\n13 \n \nwho explained that she was not \u201ccapable of making in-\nformed lifelong decisions\u201d as a teenager, and yet doc-\ntors provided transition treatments that severely \ndamaged her body.  House Health Subcommittee (Jan. \n31, 2023), tinyurl.com/5n8ewdsv (59:15-1:02:22). \nSB1 regulates medical practice to address these \nconcerns.  It prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming certain \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, \nor live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the \nminor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or dis-\ntress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex and \nasserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  \nRegulated procedures include \u201c[s]urgically removing, \nmodifying, altering, or entering into tissues, cavities, \nor organs\u201d and \u201c[p]rescribing, administering, or dis-\npensing any puberty blocker or hormone.\u201d  Id. \u00a768-33-\n102(5).  SB1 allows these procedures to treat different \nconditions, like congenital defects, precocious puberty, \ndisease, and physical injuries. Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  \nAnd it leaves other long-used treatments, such as psy-\nchotherapy, available to minors.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(c). \nD. The District Court Preliminarily Enjoins \nSB1, but the Sixth Circuit Reverses. \nThree minors, their parents, and a doctor brought \na pre-enforcement challenge to SB1, asserting sub-\nstantive-due-process and equal-protection theories.  \nThe federal government intervened.  Then, days be-\nfore SB1\u2019s effective date, the district court held the law \nfacially unconstitutional and preliminarily enjoined \nall but the surgical prohibition.  Pet. App. 130a-218a, \n\n14 \n \n219a-221a.  The Sixth Circuit stayed that injunction. \nPet. App. 102a-124a. \nThe Sixth Circuit then reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-\n101a.  On the equal-protection claim, Chief Judge Sut-\nton, joined by Judge Thapar, concluded that SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions do not \u201cturn[] on sex\u201d or impose a sex classi-\nfication.  Pet. App. 32a.  Rather, SB1\u2019s \u201cclassifications \nturn on presumptively valid age and medical condi-\ntions.\u201d  Pet. App. 36a.   And in imposing those re-\nstrictions, SB1 \u201ctreat[s] similarly situated individuals \nevenhandedly.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a.  Given SB1\u2019s presump-\ntively valid restrictions, the court held that the law \n\u201cdoes not trigger\u201d heightened review.  Pet. App. 33a.  \nApplying heightened scrutiny, the court recognized, \nwould transfer \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d and \u201cfraught \nline-drawing dilemmas\u201d from the \u201carena of public de-\nbate and legislative action\u201d to the unelected federal ju-\ndiciary.  Pet. App. 44a-45a.  That the government \u201cdis-\nagree[s] with the States\u2019 assessment of the risks and \nthe right response to those risks ... does not suffice to \ninvalidate a democratically enacted law.\u201d  Pet. App. \n50a.   \nJudge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  She \nconcluded that intermediate scrutiny applies and that \nSB1 fails that standard, largely based on her assess-\nment of the interventions\u2019 risks and efficacy.  Pet. App. \n59a, 85a-87a. \n \n \n\n15 \n \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI.  Through SB1, Tennessee lawfully exercised its \npower to regulate medicine by protecting minors from \nrisky, unproven gender-transition interventions.  It is \nnot unconstitutional discrimination to say that drugs \ncan be prescribed for one reason but not another.  \nWeighing risks and benefits, States (and the federal \ngovernment) draw age- and use-based distinctions for \ndrugs all the time.   \nII. SB1 contains no sex classification that war-\nrants heightened review.  It creates two groups:  mi-\nnors seeking drugs for gender transition and minors \nseeking drugs for other medical purposes.  Each of \nthese groups \u201cincludes members of both sexes,\u201d so no \nfacial sex classification exists.  Geduldig v. Aiello, 417 \nU.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974).  Not every law that men-\ntions sex classifies based on sex.   \nThe government\u2019s newfound focus on \u201cgender con-\nformity\u201d flouts law and fact.  Repeatedly claiming that \nSB1 requires conformity does not create a sex-based \nline, and the Equal Protection Clause confers no sub-\nstantive right to non-conforming behavior.  SB1\u2019s risk-\nbenefit assessment of gender-transition interventions \ndoes not push conformity ends anyway.   \nHeightened review also does not apply because \nboys and girls are not similarly situated for purposes \nof SB1.  It defies biological reality to suggest, as the \ngovernment does, that males and females are medi-\ncally the same for purposes of receiving testosterone \nand estrogen. \n\n16 \n \nPivoting, the government seeks to overhaul this \nCourt\u2019s established equal-protection framework by \nconstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for-sex test.  Decades \nof precedent foreclose that maneuver.  Importing a \nbut-for approach to identify classifications under the \nConstitution would jettison longstanding limits on dis-\nparate-impact liability, drastically expand the appli-\ncation of heightened review, and clash with other legal \nprotections.  This Court should reject the govern-\nment\u2019s Bostock premise and the resulting doctrinal \nfallout.   \nA doctrinal sea change would be for naught be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  For \npuberty blockers, changing sex changes nothing since \nboth males and females take the same drug; medical \npurpose alone dictates the availability of the drug un-\nder SB1.  And for cross-sex hormones, the government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to reach a \ndifferent outcome.  \nIII. The challengers\u2019 transgender-discrimination \nargument does not justify heightened review.  SB1 \ndoes not classify based on transgender status.  And \neven if it did, this Court should not get back in the \nfraught \nbusiness \nof \ncreating \nsuspect \nclasses.  \nTransgender status does not uniquely warrant ex-\npanding the list of quasi-suspect classifications for the \nfirst time in nearly 50 years. \nIV.  Though rational-basis review applies, SB1 \nreadily satisfies intermediate scrutiny too.  The law \n\u201csubstantially relate[s]\u201d to Tennessee\u2019s undisputedly \n\n17 \n \ncompelling interests.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 68 \n(2001).  Even under heightened review, this Court de-\nfers to legislative factfinding and gives States \u201cwide \ndiscretion to pass legislation in areas where there is \nmedical and scientific uncertainty.\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.  That discretion makes this case easy: SB1 \ncontains specific findings and imposes restrictions in \nan area of medical uncertainty.   \nThe government convinced the district court to \nweigh the risks and benefits itself with no deference to \nlegislative findings.  That is not the proper legal stand-\nard or the judiciary\u2019s role.  Nor should this Court credit \nthe government\u2019s claim of \u201cmedical consensus\u201d given \nits credibility killing silence on the European health \nauthorities that SB1 itself references.  The govern-\nment\u2019s one-sided telling of the evidence misreports the \nmedical landscape.  And its over- and under-inclusiv-\nity arguments both ignore medical reality and fail to \nrebut SB1\u2019s substantial relation to Tennessee\u2019s com-\npelling interests. \nThe Court should affirm. \n \n \n\n18 \n \nARGUMENT \nThe Equal Protection Clause prohibits a State \nfrom \u201cdeny[ing] to any person within its jurisdiction \nthe equal protection of the laws.\u201d  That language \u201cwas \nnot designed to compel uniformity in the face of differ-\nence,\u201d Whitney v. State Tax Comm\u2019n, 309 U.S. 530, 542 \n(1940), or to \u201cforbid classifications\u201d entirely, Nord-\nlinger v. Hahn, 505 U.S. 1, 10 (1992).  Rather, it \u201ckeeps \ngovernmental decisionmakers from treating differ-\nently persons who are in all relevant respects alike.\u201d  \nId.  \nTo make out an equal-protection claim, a plaintiff \nmust first identify the classifications drawn by the \nchallenged action. A law contains a facial classifica-\ntion only when it \u201cdistinguish[es] between individu-\nals\u201d based on a particular characteristic.  Shaw v. \nReno, 509 U.S. 630, 642 (1993).  For legislation \u201cneu-\ntral on its face,\u201d a plaintiff must show that a law dis-\nparately impacts a particular group and prove that the \nlegislature acted with \u201cdiscriminatory intent or pur-\npose.\u201d  Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev. \nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 265-66 (1977). \n\u201cWhen those who appear similarly situated are ... \ntreated differently,\u201d this Court looks to the govern-\nment\u2019s basis for the differential treatment.  Engquist \nv. Oregon Dep\u2019t of Agric., 553 U.S. 591, 602 (2008).  It \napplies strict scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na suspect class (race, alienage, or national origin) and \nintermediate scrutiny when a law classifies based on \na quasi-suspect class (sex or illegitimacy).  City of \nCleburne v. Cleburne Living Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440-41 \n(1985).  Otherwise, \u201clegislation is presumed to be valid \n\n19 \n \nand will be sustained if the classification drawn by the \nstatute is rationally related to a legitimate state inter-\nest.\u201d  Id. at 440. \nThose principles compel upholding SB1.  The law \nregulates the practice of medicine by placing age- and \nuse-based restrictions on medical procedures.  It does \nnot classify based on any protected characteristic.  \nAnd SB1\u2019s approach satisfies intermediate scrutiny \nregardless. \nI. \nSB1 Sets Age- and Use-Based Limits on \nMedical Procedures  \nStates exercise broad power over \u201chealth and \nsafety matters.\u201d  Hillsborough Cnty. v. Automated \nMed. Lab\u2019ys, 471 U.S. 707, 719 (1985).  This power in-\ncludes \u201cregulat[ing] the practice of medicine.\u201d  \nMcNaughton v. Johnson, 242 U.S. 344, 348-49 (1917).  \nIndeed, \u201c[t]here is perhaps no profession more \nproperly open to \u2026 regulation\u201d by States.  Watson v. \nMaryland, 218 U.S. 173, 176 (1910).     \nStates routinely exercise their public-health au-\nthority by regulating \u201cmedical treatments for adults \nand children.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a.  They prohibit or se-\nverely restrict irreversible practices like assisted sui-\ncide and euthanasia, Washington v. Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. 702, 719 (1997); Vacco v. Quill, 521 U.S. 793, 797 \n(1997), \u201cintrusive and possibly hazardous\u201d measures \nlike \u201cpsychosurgery and shock treatment,\u201d Aden v. \nYounger, 57 Cal. App. 3d 662, 668, 673 (1976), and the \ngood-faith \u201cadministration, sale, prescription, and use \nof dangerous ... drugs,\u201d Minnesota ex rel. Whipple v. \nMartinson, 256 U.S. 41, 45 (1921).  States\u2019 power over \n\n20 \n \npermissible medical practices is \u201cso manifest\u201d and \n\u201cfirmly established\u201d that it cannot \u201cbe successfully \ncalled in question.\u201d  Id. \nTennessee exercised this power when it passed \nSB1.  That law prohibits \u201chealthcare provider[s]\u201d from \nperforming specific \u201cmedical procedure[s]\u201d \u201cfor the \npurpose of\u201d either (1) \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify \nwith, or live as, a purported identity inconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or (2) \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort \nor distress from a discordance between the minor\u2019s sex \nand asserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n103(a)(1). And it allows these \u201cprocedures\u201d for other \nmedical uses.  Id. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).    \nSB1 expressly draws an age-based line between \nadults and minors.  That type of \u201cdistinguishing\u201d is \n\u201cnot unusual\u201d in medicine or the law generally.  Pet. \nApp. 31a; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a762-38-211(a) (tattoos); \nid. \u00a7\u00a736-3-105, -106 (marriage); W. Va. Code Ann. \u00a716-\n11-1 (sterilization).  And \u201cage is not a suspect classifi-\ncation.\u201d  Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452, 470 (1991).   \nSB1 further distinguishes between the medical \npurpose for using certain \u201cmedical procedure[s].\u201d  It \nbars certain procedures\u2014surgery, puberty blockers, \nand cross-sex hormones\u2014\u201cfor the purpose of\u201d gender \ntransition.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  But it \nlets physicians use those surgeries and drugs to ad-\ndress distinct medical conditions\u2014e.g., precocious pu-\nberty, congenital defects, disease, and trauma.  Id. \n\u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A).  Put otherwise, SB1 separates the \nuse of certain surgeries and drugs to facilitate gender \ntransition from their use for different medical reasons.  \n\n21 \n \nEknes-Tucker v. Governor of Alabama, 80 F.4th 1205, \n1233 (11th Cir. 2023) (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nSound medical practice depends on such distinc-\ntions.  A procedure\u2019s risks cannot be isolated from its \nreason for use, since the medical purpose informs the \nrisk-reward calculus.  That is why FDA approves \ndrugs\u2014including those at issue here\u2014only for specific \nlabeled \u201cuse[s].\u201d  21 U.S.C. \u00a7355(b)(1), (d); Benefit-Risk \nAssessment in Drug Regulatory Decision-Making, FDA \n(Mar. 30, 2018), https://tinyurl.com/4xzcw9br.  And it \nis why States frequently impose use-driven re-\nstrictions in medicine.  Doctors can use morphine to \ntreat a patient\u2019s pain but not to assist a patient\u2019s sui-\ncide.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a739-13-216; see Vacco, 521 U.S. \nat 808-09.  Doctors can perform pelvic surgery on \nwomen who have \u201cgiven birth\u201d but not on women being \nsubjected to ritualistic genital mutilation.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a739-13-110.  Doctors can perform an abortion to \naddress risks to a mother\u2019s life or health but not for \nelective purposes, in many States.  Id. \u00a739-15-213.  \nDoctors can prescribe testosterone to address hormo-\nnal imbalance but not to \u201cincrease muscle mass, \nstrength or weight without medical necessity.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a739-17-430(a)(2).  The list goes on.   \nA State may \u201creasonably\u201d deem a procedure \u201csafe \nwhen used for one purpose but risky when used for an-\nother, especially when\u201d the procedure \u201cis being put to \na relatively new use.\u201d  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  Tennessee \ndid just that:  The legislature determined that the \ncost-benefit calculus warranted permitting the surger-\nies and drugs subject to SB1 for some reasons and not \n\n22 \n \nothers. That is not discrimination.  It is an even-\nhanded \u201cregulation of a medical procedure\u201d that turns \non the reason for the procedure\u2019s use.  Dobbs v. Jack-\nson Women\u2019s Health Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236 (2022); \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1227.   \nII. SB1 Contains No Sex Classification that \nWarrants Heightened Scrutiny \nA. SB1 does not classify based on sex. \nThe government cannot point to a sex classifica-\ntion under the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork.  And its \u201cgender conformity\u201d argument cannot \nsalvage that failure.  The Sixth Circuit correctly held \nthat SB1 turns on age and use\u2014not sex.   \n1. SB1 draws no sex-based line.  \nFacial sex classification occurs when a law \u201cdistin-\nguish[es] between individuals\u201d based on sex.  Shaw, \n509 U.S. at 642.  A university excludes \u201cwomen.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 520 (1996).  A \nState imposes different rules for \u201cmales\u201d versus \u201cfe-\nmales.\u201d  Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 192 (1976).  A \nlaw provides that \u201cmales must be preferred to females\u201d \nfor the handling of property.  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. \n71, 73 (1971).  These are \u201cclassic sex classification[s].\u201d \nL.W. Br. 18.     \nTennessee\u2019s law draws no similar \u201csex-based \nline[].\u201d  U.S. Br. 19.   SB1 does not \u201cprefer one sex over \nthe other,\u201d \u201cinclude one sex and exclude the other,\u201d \n\u201cbestow benefits or burdens based on sex,\u201d or \u201capply \none rule for males and another for females.\u201d  Pet. App. \n\n23 \n \n32a.  It does not \u201cdraw any distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d based on sex.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 800.   \nThe government claims (at 21) that SB1 \u201cdefin[es] \nthe prohibited medical care based on the patient\u2019s \nsex.\u201d  The law references \u201csex,\u201d but it does not \u201cdiffer-\nentiate\u201d based on sex.  Nordlinger, 505 U.S. at 10.  And \nthat is what matters.  \nAssessing the lines drawn by SB1 reveals the ab-\nsence of any sex classification.  The law creates two \ngroups: (1) minors seeking to use puberty blockers and \ncross-sex hormones for gender transition, and (2) mi-\nnors seeking to use puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for other medical purposes.  The first group \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014neither boys nor \ngirls can use these drugs for gender transition.  \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  The second group also \n\u201cincludes members of both sexes\u201d\u2014both boys and girls \ncan use these drugs for other medical purposes.  Id.  \nUnder Geduldig, this \u201clack of identity\u201d between sex \nand the \u201cgroups\u201d created by SB1\u2019s line drawing means \nthat no facial \u201csex\u201d classification exists.  Id. \nThe government\u2019s requested remedy is telling too.  \nThe government has not sought an injunction that \nwould \u201ctreat boys and girls the same\u201d; it wants an in-\njunction to \u201callow\u201d \u201cpuberty blockers and hormones\u201d to \nbe administered for additional purposes.  Eknes-\nTucker, 80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring); see \nPet. App. 37a-38a.  That request shows that \u201cthe clas-\nsification drawn by the statute\u201d concerns the drugs\u2019 \nprescribed use, not a patient\u2019s sex.  Cleburne, 473 U.S. \nat 440. \n\n24 \n \nThe government pivots (at 21) to SB1\u2019s mere \u201cref-\nerenc[e]\u201d to sex.  But not every law that mentions sex \nclassifies based on sex.  Pet. App. 36a.  Take this hy-\npothetical statute: \u201cNeither men nor women may drive \nan automobile without a license.\u201d  It uses \u201csex-based \nterms,\u201d U.S. Br. 2, 13, but draws no sex-based lines.  \nThe mere \u201cuse of gender specific\u201d versus \u201cneutral\u201d \nterms has never controlled the sex-classification in-\nquiry.  Cf. Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 64.  Otherwise, myriad \nlaws without sex or race classifications would \u201crequire \nheightened review.\u201d  Pet. App. 35a.  This Court rejects \nthat approach.  See Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 232 n.14; Jam \nv. Int\u2019l Fin. Corp., 586 U.S. 199, 208 (2019) (42 U.S.C. \n\u00a71981, which mentions \u201cwhite\u201d citizens, treats all \nraces equally).  So while SB1 uses \u201cthe word \u2018sex,\u2019\u201d it \ndoes not include \u201ca sex classification\u201d within the \nmeaning of \u201cequal-protection caselaw.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1233 (Brasher, J., concurring).   \nThat conclusion in no way threatens the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s protection of \u201cindividual[s].\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 24.  Tennessee\u2019s point is not that laws like \nSB1 can classify by sex yet avoid sex-based scrutiny \nby harming boys and girls \u201cin equal degree.\u201d  L.W. Br. \n27-28; accord U.S. Br. 24.  The point is that SB1 con-\ntains no sex classification at all.  A law taxing all citi-\nzens burdens both men and women, but like SB1, it \ndoes not burden both men and women through a sex \nclassification.  The cases cited by the challengers (at \nU.S. Br. 24; L.W. Br. 27-28) drive home this distinc-\ntion:  Striking a juror because he\u2019s a man (J.E.B.) or \nbecause he\u2019s black (Powers) are actions that classify \nbased on sex or race.   No such sex classification exists \nin SB1; the law differentiates based on age and use.   \n\n25 \n \n2. The government\u2019s gender-conformity \nassertions show no sex classification. \nNor does SB1 classify based on sex by restricting \nminors from engaging in \u201cnon-conforming\u201d behavior.  \nU.S. Br. 22-23, 41; L.W. Br. 22-23, 28.   \nFor starters, not all restrictions on non-conform-\ning behavior involve a sex-based classification.  Con-\nsider a pair of contrasting examples: (1) a school dress \ncode that requires boys to wear pants and girls to wear \nskirts and (2) a school dress code that permits only \npants.  A boy wants to wear a skirt, asserting a non-\nconformity interest.  Under the first policy, a sex-\nbased line regulates the boy:  girls can wear skirts, and \nboys cannot.  Under the second policy, by contrast, no \nsex-based line exists:  no one can wear skirts.  In both \nexamples, the boy wants to engage in a \u201cnon-conform-\ning\u201d activity that is \u201cinconsistent\u201d with stereotypical \nattire.  And in both examples, the boy is prohibited \nfrom doing so.  Yet only the first policy draws a sex-\nbased line.  The second policy, like SB1, does not.   \nThe plaintiffs err (at 22, 28) by equating SB1 to \nlaws that expressly classify religions, races, or the \nsexes.  A law prohibiting \u201cpeople from working in pro-\nfessions \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 their sex\u201d creates sex-\nbased lines: for some jobs, a male can have the job and \na female cannot, and vice versa.  SB1 imposes no sim-\nilar classification. \nAnd no authority permits an equal-protection \nclaim for \u201cpeople who fail to conform\u201d absent any sex-\nbased classification.  L.W. Br. 21; see U.S. Br. 23.  In-\nstead, cases like Craig (different male-female alcohol \n\n26 \n \npurchasing rules), Virginia (different male-female ad-\nmissions rules), and Morales-Santana (different male-\nfemale immigration rules) all involved clear, facial sex \nclassifications.  Craig, 429 U.S. at 198-99; Virginia, \n518 U.S. at 532-33; Sessions v. Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. 47, 62-63 (2017).  Though they discussed stereo-\ntyping in applying intermediate scrutiny, they did not \nuse that concept to conjure a sex classification from a \nsex-neutral rule.   \nTo the extent the government now attempts to \nbackdoor in an Arlington Heights discriminatory-pur-\npose claim through \u201cconformity,\u201d U.S. Br. 22, that ar-\ngument likewise fails.  The government never mean-\ningfully pressed this argument below, and it points to \nno disparate impact on one sex.  More important, \nSB1\u2019s aim is not \u201c[e]nforcing conformity.\u201d  L.W. Br. 42.   \nTennessee enacted SB1 \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(a).  In \ndetailed findings, SB1 catalogs Tennessee\u2019s interests \nin regulating early gender-transition interventions to \nprotect minors and the integrity of the medical profes-\nsion.  Id. \u00a768-33-101(b)-(m).  Along the way, SB1 men-\ntions encouraging minors \u201cto appreciate\u201d and not be \n\u201cdisdainful of their sex\u201d as they \u201cundergo puberty.\u201d  Id. \n\u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  But contra challengers\u2019 repeated \nassertions, that language is no smoking gun.  Cf. L.W. \nBr. 1, 23, 42, 52; U.S. Br. 2, 8, 16-18, 22, 27, 32-34, 49.  \nIt simply acknowledges the problems with using un-\nproven gender-transition interventions on minors.  \nGiven high desistance rates among youth and the \ntragic \u201cregret\u201d of detransitioners, it was not improper \nto conclude that kids benefit from additional time to \n\n27 \n \n\u201cappreciate their sex\u201d before embarking on body-alter-\ning paths.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(h), (m).  Nor \nis it improper for the State to protect minors from pro-\ncedures that \u201cencourage [them] to become disdainful of \ntheir sex\u201d\u2014and thus at risk for serious psychiatric \nconditions.  Id. (emphasis added).  Especially when re-\nsearch shows that gender-transition interventions can \nmake mental distress worse.  J.A. 400-01.  \nThe government may disagree with that research. \nBut it cannot cast SB1 as stereotype-driven by carica-\nturing legislative findings that detail a range of health \nconcerns.  Chanting a \u201cconformity\u201d mantra does not \novercome the heavy \u201cpresumption of legislative good \nfaith,\u201d Abbott v. Perez, 585 U.S. 579, 603 (2018), or \ndrown out the compelling concerns that drove SB1. \nAnd it is insincere because\u2014even if that language \nwere omitted\u2014the government would be here chal-\nlenging SB1\u2019s restrictions all the same. \n3. The Sixth Circuit properly applied \nthe sex-classification framework.  \nThe government\u2019s claim that Chief Judge Sutton \n\u201cfundamentally misunderstood\u201d equal-protection law \ndistorts the decision below.  U.S. Br. 16.  The Sixth \nCircuit did not spottily concede a sex classification \u201cat \ntimes.\u201d  U.S. Br. 18-19, 24-25.   It found \u201cno\u201d sex-based \nline in SB1, period.  Pet. App. 32a.  Having concluded \nthat SB1 lacks any sex classification, the court \nproperly declined to apply heightened review.  Pet. \nApp. 32a-33a.   \nThat decision in no way \u201cconflates the classifica-\ntions drawn by the law with the state\u2019s justification for \n\n28 \n \nit.\u201d  U.S. Br. 26.  The Sixth Circuit recognized that the \n\u201ccost-benefit analysis\u201d or \u201crisk-reward assessment\u201d for \na procedure depends on the reason for the procedure\u2019s \nuse.  Pet. App. 34a, 37a.  It highlighted that fact to \nhelp explain that SB1 classifies by procedures\u2019 distinct \nmedical uses, not patients\u2019 sex.  Id. \nThe challengers attack the Sixth Circuit for stat-\ning that the \u201cnecessity of heightened review[] will not \nbe present every time that sex factors into a govern-\nment decision.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2 (quoting Pet. App. 39a); \nU.S. Br. 24-25.  But that\u2019s just a rejection of the gov-\nernment\u2019s attempted use of but-for causation to create \na novel class of Bostock-based equal-protection claims.  \nSee infra Part II.C.  As the Sixth Circuit recognized, \nDobbs and Geduldig reject heightened scrutiny for \nsex-adjacent restrictions that draw no sex-based lines.  \nPet. App. 39a; infra 33-34.  Whether those decisions \nare characterized as concluding that no sex classifica-\ntion exists, infra 32-35, or that heightened scrutiny \ndoes not apply to sex-adjacent claims, Pet. App. 39a, \nthe result is the same.  It is the government and plain-\ntiffs, not the Sixth Circuit, that \u201cbreak[] from a half \ncentury of this Court\u2019s precedents.\u201d  L.W. Br. 2. \nB. Boys and girls are not similarly situated \nfor purposes of SB1.  \nThe challengers\u2019 arguments fail for the independ-\nent reason that boys and girls \u201care not similarly situ-\nated\u201d for purposes of SB1\u2019s restrictions.  Michael M. v. \nSuperior Court, 450 U.S. 464, 469 (1981) (plurality). \nAs the Sixth Circuit correctly noted, the sexes\u2019 biolog-\nical differences provide yet another basis for declining \nheightened scrutiny.  Pet. App. 39a.   \n\n29 \n \nThis Court has never read the Equal Protection \nClause to \u201crequire things which are different in fact or \nopinion to be treated in law as though they were the \nsame.\u201d  Tigner v. Texas, 310 U.S. 141, 147 (1940).  It \nhas instead analyzed a law\u2019s justifications only after \ndetermining that \u201cthose who appear similarly situated \nare \u2026 treated differently.\u201d  Engquist, 553 U.S. at 602.  \nScores of lower-court cases agree and treat this \u201csimi-\nlarly situated\u201d question as a threshold inquiry.1   \nUnder this approach, \u201cthe absence of similarly sit-\nuated individuals treated differently is \u2026 simply a \nway of saying that the plaintiff failed at the first step \nto prove intentional discrimination\u201d\u2014a step that must \nbe satisfied \u201c[b]efore a court may get to the business of \nassessing\u201d the law\u2019s justifications.  SECSYS v. Vigil, \n666 F.3d 678, 688-89 (10th Cir. 2012) (Gorsuch, J.).   \nNguyen\u2019s mention of \u201csimilarly situated\u201d in apply-\ning scrutiny is not to the contrary.  Cf. L.W. Br. 35-36; \nU.S. Cert. Reply 5.  That discussion came only after \nconcluding that a law treated men and women differ-\nently \u201cunder like circumstances.\u201d  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at \n60.  And whether boys are similarly situated to girls \n \n1 See, e.g., People v. Whitfield, 888 N.E.2d 1166, 1172-73 (Ill. \n2007), as modified (Apr. 23, 2008); Timberland Partners XXI v. \nIowa Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 757 N.W.2d 172, 175 (Iowa 2008); In re \nWeisgerber, 169 P.3d 321, 328 (Kan. 2007); Benitez v. Rasmussen, \n626 N.W.2d 209, 219 (Neb. 2001); Morrison v. Garraghty, 239 \nF.3d 648, 654 (4th Cir. 2001); Barney v. Pulsipher, 143 F.3d 1299, \n1312-13 (10th Cir. 1998); Women Prisoners v. D.C., 93 F.3d 910, \n924 (D.C. Cir. 1996); Klinger v. Dep\u2019t of Corr., 31 F.3d 727, 731 \n(8th Cir. 1994). \n\n30 \n \nfor purposes of SB1 matters at the outset, even if it \nalso matters when analyzing means-ends fit. \nThe challengers\u2019 reliance on \u201cBostock\u2019s framework \nfor identifying sex discrimination\u201d supports the simi-\nlarly situated inquiry\u2019s gatekeeping role.  L.W. Br. 18; \nU.S. Br. 27.  Bostock stated that discrimination re-\nquires showing that the plaintiff was treated \u201cworse \nthan others who are similarly situated.\u201d  590 U.S. at \n657.  It just deemed that prerequisite met since \u201cho-\nmosexuality or transgender status is not relevant to \nemployment decisions.\u201d  Id. at 660.  If this Court con-\nstitutionalizes Bostock\u2019s but-for standard (it should \nnot, see infra Part II.C), then Bostock\u2019s similarly situ-\nated requirement must travel alongside. \nThe government previously proposed shoehorning \nthe similarly situated requirement into the applica-\ntion of intermediate scrutiny.  U.S. Cert. Reply 5.  But \nit never explains how the similarly situated inquiry \nfits into that analysis or why boys and girls are similar \nfor purposes of receiving cross-sex hormones.  Instead, \nit generally contests the evidentiary basis for restrict-\ning gender-transition procedures for minors. U.S. Br.  \n39-50.  That analysis ducks the similarly situated in-\nquiry altogether.   \nHere, there is no question that boys\u2019 and girls\u2019 \u201cen-\nduring\u201d \u201c[p]hysical differences\u201d keep them from being \nsimilarly situated with respect to SB1\u2019s restriction on \ncross-sex hormones.  Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533.  \nProviding testosterone to a boy with delayed puberty \naddresses a distinct medical condition, whereas \nproviding it to a girl causes a physical condition (se-\nvere hyperandrogenism).  Supra 6; J.A. 500-01, 521-\n\n31 \n \n22, 769-79.  Similarly, providing estrogen to a girl with \npremature ovarian insufficiency addresses a distinct \nmedical condition, whereas providing it to a boy causes \na physical condition (hyperestrogenemia).  Supra 6; \nJ.A. 779-81; ES Guidelines at 3886. \nThe government\u2019s sex-discrimination argument \nwould compel this Court to accept that males and fe-\nmales are medically the same for SB1\u2019s purposes\u2014and \nthat providing testosterone to a female to transition is \nthe \u201csame treatment\u201d as providing it to a male with a \nphysical malady.  U.S. Br. 2, 15, 18, 28.  No equal-pro-\ntection test requires this anti-science mendacity. \nC. Bostock does not render SB1 sex based. \nFailing the traditional equal-protection frame-\nwork, the government asks this Court to create a new \ncategory of sex classifications based on Bostock\u2019s but-\nfor logic.  U.S. Br. 21-23.  The briefing pitches this step \nas \u201csimple\u201d and \u201cobvious[].\u201d  L.W. Br. 16; U.S. Br. 21.  \nBut \u201cthis wolf comes as a wolf.\u201d  Morrison v. Olson, 487 \nU.S. 654, 699 (1988) (Scalia, J., dissenting).  Using \nbut-for-sex reasoning to trigger heightened scrutiny \nwould make a hash of this Court\u2019s equal-protection ju-\nrisprudence.  It would conflict with Bostock\u2019s reason-\ning.  And it would drastically expand heightened re-\nview.  This Court should reject the government\u2019s mis-\nuse of Bostock.  But even under the but-for test, the \ngovernment loses.   \n\n32 \n \n1. This Court has never taken a but-for \napproach to equal-protection \nclassifications.  \nConstitutionalizing Bostock\u2019s but-for rule would \nabrogate decades of equal-protection jurisprudence.   \nCurrently, a challenger has two paths to height-\nened equal-protection review: a facial classification or \na disparate impact plus discriminatory purpose.  SB1 \ndoes not facially classify by sex.  Supra Part II.A.  So \nthat leaves only the \u201csensitive inquiry\u201d into whether \nfacially neutral laws were in fact driven by \u201cdiscrimi-\nnatory intent or purpose.\u201d  Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. \nat 265-66.  To make that showing, the asserted \u201cdis-\ncriminatory intent or purpose\u201d must target the suspect \ncharacteristic at issue\u2014not some other characteristic.  \nId. at 265; see Bray v. Alexandria Women\u2019s Health \nClinic, 506 U.S. 263, 270 (1993) (sex-based claim \u201cde-\nmand[s] ... at least a purpose that focuses upon women \nby reason of their sex\u201d).   \nThe government invents a third path.  It claims \nthat heightened review applies when some non-sex-\nbased classification incorporates sex as a but-for mat-\nter.  That argument contradicts scores of cases.   \nMost obviously, but-for causation conflicts with \nthis Court\u2019s sexual-orientation cases.  For decades, \nthis Court has faced claims of sexual-orientation dis-\ncrimination under equal-protection theories\u2014includ-\ning Romer v. Evans, 517 U.S. 620 (1996); United States \nv. Windsor, 570 U.S. 744 (2013); and Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 651 (2015).  \u201cBut in those cases, \nthe Court never suggested that sexual orientation dis-\n\n33 \n \ncrimination is just a form of sex discrimination.\u201d  Bos-\ntock, 590 U.S. at 797 (Kavanaugh, J., dissenting).  It \nis \u201cimplausible\u201d to suggest that \u201cin all of those sexual \norientation cases\u201d the Court \u201coverlook[ed] the fact that \nsexual orientation discrimination is actually a form of \nsex discrimination\u201d under the Constitution.  Id. at 798.   \nPregnancy and abortion cases also belie a but-for \napproach.  In Geduldig, this Court assessed whether \nexcluding conditions arising from pregnancy from dis-\nability benefits coverage denied women equal protec-\ntion.  417 U.S. at 489.  It said no, even though sex is a \nbut-for cause of pregnancy and despite the dissent\u2019s \ncounter that \u201c[i]n effect, one set of rules is applied to \nfemales and another to males.\u201d  Id. at 501 (Brennan, \nJ., dissenting).  The Court kept its focus on the \u201clegis-\nlative classification\u201d and the groups that classification \ncreated.  Id. at 496 n.20.  It emphasized that a preg-\nnancy-related restriction \u201cis a far cry from cases like \nReed \u2026 and Frontiero v. Richardson, 411 U.S. 677 \n(1973), involving discrimination based upon gender as \nsuch.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nBray reiterated that reasoning when rejecting an \nargument that anti-abortion demonstrations consti-\ntuted \u201cipso facto\u201d discrimination \u201cagainst women as a \nclass.\u201d  506 U.S. at 271.  Bray reached that result over \na dissent that contended that \u201c[a] classification based \non pregnancy is a sex-based classification\u201d because \n\u201cthe capacity to become pregnant is a characteristic \nnecessarily associated with one\u201d sex.  Id. at 323 n.20, \n327 (Stevens, J., dissenting).  This Court has declined \nto \u201crevisit\u201d this line of precedent.  Coleman v. Ct. of \n\n34 \n \nAppeals, 566 U.S. 30, 54 (2012) (Ginsburg, J., dissent-\ning).  It remains good law.  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236.    \nMore generally, a but-for approach is incompatible \nwith the conceptual underpinning of equal-protection \njurisprudence.  Heightened review rests on the idea \nthat \u201ccertain classifications \u2026 supply a reason to infer \nantipathy\u201d on the part of lawmakers.  Pers. Adm\u2019r of \nMass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 272 (1979).  The Court \nreplaces the presumption of legislative validity with \nheightened review only after a robust showing tied to \na particular characteristic.   Infra 44-45.  But in the \ngovernment\u2019s \nview, \nnon-suspect \nclasses \n(here, \ntransgender-identifying persons) could receive height-\nened protection by leveraging a different suspect char-\nacteristic (here, sex).  That approach transforms the \nobject of heightened protection and, in doing so, di-\nvorces heightened scrutiny from its justification. \nPlaintiffs\u2019 but-for argument finds no support in \ncases applying heightened scrutiny when sex is one \namong several classifications.  L.W. Br. 30.  Courts \nsometimes face laws that classify based on sex and \nsomething else.  For example, in Craig, a state law \nprohibited the sale of beer to males under 21 and fe-\nmales under 18, drawing lines based on sex and age.  \n429 U.S. at 192.  Packaging sex classifications with \nother considerations does not somehow immunize the \nsex classification from scrutiny.  But there must be a \nclassification based on sex itself to trigger heightened \nreview.  None of plaintiffs\u2019 cited cases (at 30) support \nusing but-for reasoning to transform a non-sex-based \nclassification into a sex classification.  This Court\u2019s \n\n35 \n \ntask is \u201conly to measure the basic validity of the legis-\nlative classification\u201d drawn.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 272.   \n2. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications defies \nBostock\u2019s reasoning. \nBostock disavowed any extension of its Title VII \nreasoning to other laws, like the Equal Protection \nClause.  For good reason.  \u201cThe Constitution is not a \nstatute,\u201d R.R. Ret. Bd. v. Alton R. Co., 295 U.S. 330, \n346-47 (1935), and this Court has \u201cnever held that the \nconstitutional standard for adjudicating claims of in-\nvidious ... discrimination is identical to the standards \napplicable under Title VII,\u201d Washington v. Davis, 426 \nU.S. 229, 239 (1976).  And Bostock\u2019s reasoning refutes \nthe government\u2019s attempt to transplant Title VII\u2019s \nbut-for test. \nFirst, Bostock\u2019s analysis was driven by Title VII\u2019s \n\u201cstarkly broad\u201d text.  590 U.S. at 680.  That text makes \nit \u201cunlawful \u2026 for an employer\u201d to take certain em-\nployment actions \u201cbecause of ... race, color, religion, \nsex, or national origin.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e-2(a)(1).  \nWith that wording, it is \u201calways unlawful\u201d (absent an \nenumerated defense) to take covered actions \u201cbecause \nof\u201d sex.   Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. Presi-\ndent & Fellows of Harvard Coll. (SFFA), 600 U.S. 181, \n309 (2023) (Gorsuch, J., concurring).  And Bostock \nread Title VII\u2019s \u201cbecause of\u201d language to require a \u201cfo-\ncus[] on but-for discrimination.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  But \nthe Equal Protection Clause \u201ccontains none of the text \nthat the Court interpreted in Bostock.\u201d  Eknes-Tucker, \n80 F.4th at 1229.  Instead, in language adopted almost \na century earlier, the Equal Protection Clause directs \n\n36 \n \na \u201cfocus[] on the denial of equal protection.\u201d  Pet. App. \n40a.  Unlike Title VII, that constitutional requirement \n\u201caddresses all manner of distinctions between per-\nsons\u201d and has been read to \u201cimpl[y] different degrees \nof judicial scrutiny for different kinds of classifica-\ntions.\u201d  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 308 (Gorsuch, J., concur-\nring).  \u201cThat such differently worded provisions should \nmean the same thing is implausible on its face.\u201d  Id.; \nsee Alexander v. South Carolina NAACP, 144 S.Ct. \n1221, 1260 (2024) (Thomas, J., concurring).    \nSecond, structural considerations cut differently.  \nTitle VII incorporates a \u201csweeping\u201d but-for standard \nyet cabins liability to certain employment actions and \nemployers.  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656-57.  As Bostock \nnoted, Title VII\u2019s non-discrimination rule also inter-\nacts with the statute\u2019s defenses and protections ap-\npearing in the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.  Id. \nat 681-82; Pet. App. 41a.  Those statutory features \ncheck the extension of broad but-for-based liability be-\nyond Title VII\u2019s limited coverage.  By contrast, the \nEqual Protection Clause governs all governmental ac-\ntion and lacks the deliberate checks that Bostock \nstressed.  Subjecting all governmental action to but-\nfor liability would collide with religious liberties and \nother constitutional rights in a manner Bostock no-\nwhere endorsed.   \nThird, Bostock\u2019s but-for standard fits with this \nCourt\u2019s \u201cthree ... leading precedents\u201d on Title VII.  590 \nU.S. at 663.  But as discussed, this Court\u2019s equal-pro-\ntection precedents cut the opposite way.  Supra 32-35.   \nFourth, congressional revisions to Title VII drive \nhome key distinctions between Title VII and the Equal \n\n37 \n \nProtection Clause.  Originally, this Court applied \nGeduldig\u2019s classification test to reject the argument \nthat Title VII\u2019s reference to \u201cbecause of \u2026 sex\u201d covers \npregnancy discrimination.  Gen. Elec. Co. v. Gilbert, \n429 U.S. 125, 133-36 (1976).  Congress responded by \nspecifying that \u201cbecause of sex\u201d includes discrimina-\ntion \u201con the basis of pregnancy,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a72000e(k)\u2014\nconfirming that Title VII\u2019s causal inquiry sweeps be-\nyond the classification-focused Equal Protection \nClause.   \n3. A but-for approach to equal-\nprotection classifications would \nsubvert sex-based review.   \nConstitutionalizing a but-for approach would re-\nmove important guardrails on heightened review. \nAdopting the government\u2019s logic would open the \ndoor to disparate-impact liability under the Constitu-\ntion.  Laws relating to sex-specific medical proce-\ndures\u2014whether prostate cancer treatments, circumci-\nsions, erectile-dysfunction medications, or breast-\nfeeding therapies\u2014may have to \u201crun[] the gauntlet of \nskeptical judicial review\u201d under the theory that sex is \na but-for cause.  Pet. App. 35a-36a.  The same would \ngo for pregnancy-related restrictions, contra Geduldig, \nand for abortion regulations, contra Dobbs.   \nThe heightened-scrutiny fallout would spiral be-\nyond sex.  Are government employers\u2019 no-visa-spon-\nsorship policies unconstitutional because national \norigin is a but-for cause of needing a visa?  Is race a \nbut-for cause when a university credits an applicant\u2019s \nessay about how racial discrimination \u201caffected his or \n\n38 \n \nher life\u201d?  SFFA, 600 U.S. at 230.  Is racial lineage a \nbut-for cause of any law regulating tribal members?  \nSee 25 U.S.C. \u00a71915(a); 1 Navajo Nation Code \u00a7701.  \nAccepting the government\u2019s theory would leave courts \npuzzling through these and whatever other but-for co-\nnundrums creative lawyers concoct. \nA but-for approach would also allow new classes to \nwield heightened scrutiny in a way that harms \nwomen.  Women\u2019s heightened legal protections reflect \ntheir history of being targeted with \u201cpervasive\u201d dis-\ncrimination and disadvantage.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n273.  But if the government\u2019s theory holds, men who \nidentify as women could claim constitutionally based \naccess to women\u2019s bathrooms,2 women\u2019s locker rooms,3 \nand women\u2019s sports.4  Accepting that theory would \nperversely erode women\u2019s rights and jeopardize land-\nmark statutes protecting women\u2019s equal access to \nschools, winners\u2019 podiums, and beyond.    \nOn top of all that, the but-for causation test would \nset the Equal Protection Clause on a collision course \nwith the Free Exercise Clause.  Conflicting rights will \narise for doctors at State-run hospitals with conscien-\ntious objections, students whose religious convictions \nprevent the sharing of intimate spaces with the oppo-\nsite sex, and so on.  Unlike Congress in the statutory \n \n2 U.S. Br., Adams v. Sch. Bd. of St. John\u2019s Cnty., No. 18-13592, \n(11th Cir.), Doc. 254. \n3 U.S. Statement, Roe v. Critchfield, No. 1:23-cv-00315-DCN (D. \nIdaho), Doc. 41. \n4 U.S. Br., B.P.J. v. W. Va. State Bd. of Educ., No. 23-1078 (4th \nCir.), Doc. 68. \n\n39 \n \ncontext, this Court could not carve the government\u2019s \nproposed but-for-sex mandates out of the Constitution \nto protect \u201csincere[]\u201d religious views.  Religious Sisters \nof Mercy v. Becerra, 55 F.4th 583, 598 (8th Cir. 2022).  \nNor would \u201cfederal conscience laws\u201d be an out, since \nthe Constitution would trump.  FDA v. All. for Hippo-\ncratic Med., 602 U.S. 367, 387 (2024).  The impossible \ntask of measuring the relative import of conflicting re-\nligion and equal-protection claims is yet another prob-\nlem attending the government\u2019s but-for test.   \n4. Regardless, sex is not a but-for cause \nin SB1.  \nThis Court should reject the but-for test outright. \nBut the government loses even under its own test be-\ncause sex is not a but-for cause in SB1.  Under the but-\nfor test, courts \u201cchange one thing at a time and see if \nthe outcome changes.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656.  \nChanging a person\u2019s \u201csex\u201d does not change the availa-\nbility of the drugs regulated by SB1.    \nPuberty Blockers:  The government\u2019s argument \nbarely mentions puberty blockers.  Fitting, because \n\u201cpuberty blockers involve the same drug used equally \nby gender-transitioning boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 38a \n(emphasis added).  If a boy seeks puberty blockers to \ntransition, he cannot have them.  If a girl seeks pu-\nberty blockers to transition, she cannot have them.  So \n\u201cholding other things constant but changing the mi-\nnor\u2019s sex\u201d does not, in fact, \u201cyield a different outcome.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  Sex does not dictate SB1\u2019s \nlimits on puberty blockers, even as a but-for matter.   \n\n40 \n \nCross-Sex Hormones:  The same goes for cross-sex \nhormones.  No boy can receive hormones to transition; \nlikewise, no girl can receive hormones to transition. \nBut either can receive hormones to treat physical ab-\nnormalities. Medical purpose, not sex, dictates availa-\nbility under SB1.  Cf. Kadel v. Folwell, 100 F.4th 122, \n181-82 (4th Cir. 2024) (Richardson, J., dissenting) \n(finding no sex-discrimination while applying Bos-\ntock\u2019s but-for test).    \nThe government\u2019s counter changes both sex and \nmedical purpose.  It claims (at 21-22) that a female \n\u201ccannot receive \u2026 testosterone to live and present as \na male, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.\u201d  \nBut the provision of testosterone to boys \u201cto treat a mi-\nnor\u2019s congenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or \nphysical injury,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(b)(1)(A), \ndoes not serve the same medical purpose as the provi-\nsion of testosterone to a girl who wants to transition.  \nThe same drug is at issue.  But it is used at different \ndosages and for different medical purposes.  See J.A. \n769-70.  Just like administering morphine to \u201cease [a] \npatient\u2019s pain\u201d is not the same as using morphine to \nassist a patient\u2019s suicide.  Vacco, 521 U.S. at 802.  The \ngovernment\u2019s argument conflates \u201cdistinct uses of tes-\ntosterone and estrogen.\u201d  Pet. App. 34a.   \nSeparately, biological realities mean that only \nboys use estrogen for the purpose of transitioning to \nan \u201cidentity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1)(A).  So too with girls and \ntestosterone.  But laws regulating treatments \u201c\u2018that \nonly one sex can undergo\u2019 ordinarily do not \u2018trigger \n\n41 \n \nheightened constitutional scrutiny.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 33a \n(quoting Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 236); supra 32-35.   \nThe upshot: \u201c[H]olding other things constant but \nchanging the minor\u2019s sex\u201d does not change the outcome \nunder SB1.  U.S. Br. 22 (cleaned up).  The government \nmust change both sex and medical purpose to show \nany differential outcome.  It fails its own but-for-sex \ntest. \nIII. SB1 Contains No Transgender Classification \nthat Warrants Heightened Scrutiny \nThe government\u2019s transgender-discrimination ar-\ngument likewise gets it nowhere.  SB1 contains no \ntransgender-based classification.  And heightened \nscrutiny would not apply in any event. \nA. SB1 does not classify based on \ntransgender status. \nThe government assumes (at 16, 28-29) that SB1 \ncontains facial transgender classifications, even in the \nface of a circuit split on the issue.  But SB1 regulates \nbased on medical use, not transgender status.  \nTransgender-identifying minors are in both \u201cgroups\u201d \ncreated by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20.  A \ntransgender-identifying minor can receive puberty \nblockers for some purposes (e.g., to treat precocious \npuberty); a transgender-identifying minor cannot re-\nceive puberty blockers for other purposes (e.g., to tran-\nsition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-103(a)(1).  The same \ngoes for cross-sex hormones.  Transgender-identifying \npersons fall on both sides of the line.  There is thus a \n\u201clack of identity\u201d between transgender status and the \n\n42 \n \ngroups created by SB1.  Geduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 \nn.20. \nAny disparate impact on transgender-identifying \npersons does not create a classification under the \nEqual Protection Clause.  Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-78.  \nAgain, heightened scrutiny does not apply to \u201c[t]he \nregulation of a medical procedure that only one sex \ncan undergo\u201d unless \u201cthe regulation is a \u2018mere pretext \ndesigned to effect an invidious discrimination.\u2019\u201d \nDobbs, 597 U.S. at 236 (cleaned up) (quoting Geduldig, \n417 U.S. at 496 n.20); see Bray, 506 U.S. at 271 (simi-\nlar).  So too with a transgender-discrimination claim:  \nThe government must show that SB1 is a \u201cpretext for \ninvidious discrimination\u201d against transgender-identi-\nfying individuals.  Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th 1229-30; see \nKadel, 100 F.4th at 174 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  \nThe government has not \u201cmade the case that ani-\nmus toward transgender individuals as a class drives \nthis law.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a-47a.  Again, the parties did \nnot meaningfully press this argument below.  And this \nCourt \u201chas long disfavored arguments based on al-\nleged legislative motives.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. at 253.  Ju-\ndicial attempts to ascertain these \u201cmotivation[s]\u201d nec-\nessarily \u201crepresent a substantial intrusion into the \nworkings of other branches of government.\u201d  Arlington \nHeights, 429 U.S. at 268 n.18.  Courts are even more \n\u201creluctan[t] to attribute unconstitutional motives to \nthe states,\u201d Mueller v. Allen, 463 U.S. 388, 394 (1983), \ngiven the federalism stakes.  Here, the government \nflippantly suggests that Tennessee, 23 \u201cother States,\u201d \nand apparently much of Europe have followed \u201cfar-\n\n43 \n \nright interest groups\u201d to \u201ctarget[] transgender individ-\nuals.\u201d  U.S. Br. 7 n.3, 8; see L.W. Br. 53.  But charges \nof discriminatory purpose demand more than tired \ntalking points.   \nNor could the government clear the Arlington \nHeights bar if it tried.  SB1 arose from a publicized \ncontroversy about ill-supported medical practices at a \nmajor Tennessee hospital.  It contains substantial fac-\ntual findings exhibiting the legislature\u2019s sincere con-\ncern with protecting kids.  And it leaves open gender-\ntransition interventions for transgender-identifying \nadults.  Although the government tries (at 8) to situate \nSB1 in a \u201cseries\u201d of Tennessee laws \u201ctargeting\u201d \ntransgender-identifying people, that narrative ignores \nthat many such measures countered federal efforts to \nimpose unprecedented gender-identity mandates gov-\nerning pronouns, bathroom and sports access, and \nmore.  See, e.g., Tennessee v. Dep\u2019t of Educ., 104 F.4th \n577, 586 (6th Cir. 2024).  None of the government\u2019s \nsideswipes surmount the heavy \u201cpresumption of legis-\nlative good faith.\u201d  Abbott, 585 U.S. at 603. \nThat leaves the argument that the Court should \npresume animus under a \u201cproxy\u201d-discrimination the-\nory.  But winning that argument requires showing \nthat \u201cno rational, nondiscriminatory explanation ex-\nists for the law\u2019s classification.\u201d Kadel, 100 F.4th at \n170 (Richardson, J., dissenting).  The restricted activ-\nity must be \u201csuch an irrational object of disfavor that \n\u2026 an intent to disfavor [a] class can readily be pre-\nsumed\u201d\u2014in the same way a \u201ctax on wearing yarmul-\nkes\u201d would be considered a \u201ctax on Jews.\u201d  Bray, 506 \n\n44 \n \nU.S. at 270.  Regulating yarmulkes is an \u201cirrational \nsurrogate.\u201d  Id. (emphasis added). \nHere, though, rational explanations beyond bare \n\u201chostility\u201d abound.  Yick Wo v. Hopkins, 118 U.S. 356, \n374 (1886).  SB1 could (and did) spring from the \u201ccom-\nmon and respectable\u201d impetus to protect minors from \nunproven procedures that can permanently alter their \nlives.  Bray, 506 U.S. at 270; see Feeney, 442 U.S. at \n274-75 (declining to presume animus when \u201clegitimate \nand worthy purposes\u201d supported the Act).  That these \ntreatments are sought primarily by transgender-iden-\ntifying persons cannot alone support a presumption of \nanimus, lest this Court\u2019s restrictions on disparate-im-\npact claims disappear.  See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 274-75; \nGeduldig, 417 U.S. at 496 n.20; Bray, 506 U.S. at 270.5   \nB. Heightened scrutiny does not apply to \ntransgender-related classifications.  \nIntermediate scrutiny would not follow anyway.  \nThis Court has never recognized transgender-identify-\ning persons as a suspect class, Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n440-41 (listing five protected classes), and it should \nnot add to the short list of protected characteristics. \n \n5 Notably, the government is not equating gender dysphoria with \ntransgender status.  It knows that \u201cnot all transgender persons \nhave gender dysphoria.\u201d  J.A. 61.  And like transgender-identify-\ning persons, gender-dysphoric persons can be in both groups cre-\nated by SB1.  Moreover, this Court\u2019s precedent forecloses the ap-\nplication of heightened scrutiny based on disability, infra 47, and \nthe federal government has elsewhere designated gender dyspho-\nria as \u201ca disability,\u201d 89 Fed. Reg. 40,066, 40,068-69 (May 9, 2024). \n\n45 \n \nThis Court long ago \u201clost interest\u201d in creating new \nquasi-suspect classes beyond the few already recog-\nnized.  Mass. Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 318-\n19 (1976) (Marshall, J., dissenting).  Over the past \nhalf-century, it has declined repeated requests to ex-\npand its list of protected characteristics\u2014declining \nheightened review to homosexual individuals, Wind-\nsor, 570 U.S. at 770; close relatives, Lyng v. Castillo, \n477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); the mentally disabled, \nCleburne, 473 U.S. at 441-46; and the aged, Murgia, \n427 U.S. at 313.  Rightfully so.  Both assessing puta-\ntive \u201csuspectness\u201d and applying means-end scrutiny \nverge on a \u201cjudge-empowering interest-balancing in-\nquiry\u201d beyond the judicial ken.  N.Y. State Rifle & Pis-\ntol Ass\u2019n v. Bruen, 597 U.S. 1, 22 (2022) (quotations \nomitted).  This Court should not reopen that door.   \nAnd it certainly should not recognize a new quasi-\nsuspect class here.  To justify heightened scrutiny, this \nCourt has asked whether a \u201cdiscrete group\u201d warrants \nspecial protection in light of its \u201cimmutable\u201d charac-\nteristics, \u201cpolitical[] powerless[ness],\u201d and history of \ndiscriminatory treatment.  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  The \ngovernment falls short on each.   \nFirst, transgender-identifying persons do not \u201cex-\nhibit obvious, immutable, or distinguishing character-\nistics that define them as a discrete group.\u201d  Pet. App. \n45a (quoting Bowen v. Gilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 \n(1987)).  No one argues that transgender status is an \n\u201cimmutable\u201d characteristic.  U.S. Br. 30; L.W. Br. 38. \nNor is there a credible claim that transgender status \nis \u201cobvious,\u201d since gender identity turns on each per-\nson\u2019s internal and often fluid \u201csense of belonging to a \n\n46 \n \nparticular gender.\u201d  J.A. 9; see WPATH-8 at S41.  And \nfar from being a \u201cdiscrete group,\u201d U.S. Br. 30, \n\u201ctransgender\u201d can describe \u201ca huge variety of gender \nidentities and expressions,\u201d WPATH-8 at S15.  Accord-\ning to WPATH, a transgender-identifying person can \nbe \u201cmore than one gender identity simultaneously or \nat different times (e.g., bigender),\u201d \u201cnot have a gender \nidentity or have a neutral gender identity (e.g., \nagender or neutrois),\u201d \u201chave gender identities that en-\ncompass or blend elements of other genders (e.g., pol-\nygender, demiboy, demigirl),\u201d or \u201chave a gender that \nchanges over time (e.g., genderfluid).\u201d  Id. at S80, S88, \nS252.  As the government\u2019s amici put it, \u201ctransgender\u201d \nis an \u201cumbrella term\u201d that covers \u201cvaried groups.\u201d Br. \nof American Psychological Association as Amicus Cu-\nriae 6 n.7.  \nSecond, \nit \nblinks \nreality \nto \nassert \nthat \ntransgender-identifying persons do not \u201cwield political \npower.\u201d  U.S. Br. 30.  The current Administration has \nprioritized \u201cPreventing and Combating Discrimina-\ntion on the Basis of Gender Identity\u201d across Executive \nBranch functions.  Exec. Order No. 13,988, 86 Fed. \nReg. 7,023 (Jan. 20, 2021).  The current President has \n\u201cappointed a record number of openly LGBTQI+ lead-\ners.\u201d  White House, A Proclamation on Transgender \nDay of Visibility (Mar. 30, 2023), perma.cc/VZN6-\n4ATC.  And federal agencies have written gender-\nidentity directives into every nook and cranny of fed-\neral law, creating new transgender-specific regula-\ntions \nfor \nthe \nworkplace, \neducational \nsystem, \nhealthcare \nfield, \nand \nfoster-care \nprograms.  \nTransgender-identifying persons have flexed their po-\n\n47 \n \nlitical muscle at the state level, too, persuading legis-\nlatures to provide enhanced statutory rights.  E.g., \nCal. Educ. Code \u00a7221.5(f); Va. Code Ann. \u00a738.2-3449.1; \nWash. Rev. Code Ann. \u00a728A.642.080.  Against this \nbackdrop (and with more than a third of the U.S. \nHouse in support, see Br. of 164 Members of Congress \nas Amicus Curiae), it is impossible to argue that \ntransgender-identifying persons are \u201cpolitically pow-\nerless in the sense that they have no ability to attract \nthe attention of lawmakers.\u201d  Cleburne, 473 U.S. at \n445.  That they have not found success on every issue \nin every State does not prove powerlessness.  Pet. App. \n46a. \nThird, the government and plaintiffs cannot rest \ntheir case for heightened scrutiny on a \u201chistory of dis-\ncrimination.\u201d  L.W. Br. 38.  In Cleburne, the Court de-\nclined to hold that the mentally disabled constituted a \nquasi-suspect class \u201cdespite a history of compulsory \nsterilization, exclusion from public schools, and a sys-\ntem of \u2018state-mandated segregation and degradation\u2019 \n\u2018that in its virulence and bigotry rivaled, and indeed \nparalleled, the worst excesses of Jim Crow.\u2019\u201d  Eknes-\nTucker, 114 F.4th at 1266 (Lagoa, J., concurring) \n(quoting Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 462-63 (Marshall, J., \nconcurring and dissenting in part)).  The answer to \nfurther instances of \u201cinvidious\u201d discrimination, the \nCourt explained, was to analyze animus case by case, \n\u201cnot to create a new quasi-suspect classification and \nsubject all governmental action based on that classifi-\ncation to more searching evaluation.\u201d Cleburne, 473 \nU.S. at 446.  Likewise, laws regulating the physically \ndisabled fall under rational-basis review despite the \nhistory of discrimination against that group.  Board of \n\n48 \n \nTrustees v. Garrett, 531 U.S. 356, 365-68 (2001).  The \nchallengers nowhere explain why transgender-identi-\nfying persons warrant more favorable treatment. \nAt bottom, creating a new quasi-suspect class will \nremove \u201ctrying policy choices\u201d from the \u201carena of pub-\nlic debate and legislative action\u201d and vest them in the \nfederal judiciary.  Pet. App. 45a.  \u201cBathrooms and \nlocker rooms.  Sports teams and sports competitions.  \nOthers are sure to follow.\u201d  Pet. App. 45a.  And this \nCourt, rather than the democratic process, would have \nto resolve every last issue through open-ended interest \nbalancing.  It should not start down that path.    \nIV. SB1 Survives Constitutional Scrutiny \nSB1 passes constitutional review under any stand-\nard.  \u201c[L]ike other health and welfare laws,\u201d it war-\nrants only rational-basis scrutiny, Dobbs, 597 U.S. at \n301, and easily satisfies that test, Pet. App. 48a-50a.  \nEven under intermediate scrutiny, SB1 poses no con-\nstitutional problem.  Its age- and use-based limits per-\nmissibly serve \u201cimportant\u201d ends through \u201csubstan-\ntially related\u201d means, Virginia, 518 U.S. at 533, par-\nticularly given lawmakers\u2019 \u201cwide discretion\u201d in areas \nof \u201cmedical and scientific uncertainty,\u201d Gonzales, 550 \nU.S. at 163.   \nA. Tennessee has compelling governmental \ninterests. \nAll agree that Tennessee\u2019s \u201cinterest in safeguard-\ning the physical and psychological well-being of a mi-\nnor is compelling.\u201d  New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747, \n756-57 (1982) (quotations omitted).  Tennessee has \n\u201cauthority, in truth a responsibility, to look after the \n\n49 \n \nhealth and safety\u201d of minors in the State.  Pet. App. \n115a.  And \u201cprotecting minors from dangerous and \nrisky treatments\u201d is part and parcel of that duty.  L.W. \nBr. 41; U.S. Br. 19.   \nTennessee has an independent interest \u201cin pro-\ntecting the integrity and ethics of the medical profes-\nsion.\u201d  Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 731.  History is punctu-\nated with shocking stories of medical \u201cabuse [and] ne-\nglect,\u201d id.\u2014with many questionable practices (like lo-\nbotomies and eugenics) initially finding support from \nthe medical establishment.  States thus have an im-\nportant interest in ensuring the integrity and ethics of \nmedical practice within their borders.  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a768-33-101(m). \nB. SB1 substantially relates to Tennessee\u2019s \ninterests. \nSB1\u2019s restrictions are in \u201csubstantial furtherance\u201d \nof Tennessee\u2019s interests.  Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70.  The \ngovernment second-guesses elected lawmakers\u2019 judg-\nment and asks this Court to do the same.  But this \nCourt should not snuff out legislative developments in \nan evolving area by enshrining the government\u2019s \nskewed science into the Constitution. \nSB1 reflects lawmakers\u2019 resolution of a genuine \nmedical debate.  In circumstances like these, \u201clegisla-\ntive options must be especially broad and courts \nshould be cautious not to rewrite legislation.\u201d  Kansas \nv. Hendricks, 521 U.S. 346, 360 n.3 (1997) (quotations \nomitted). \u201cIt is not a part of [the courts\u2019] functions to \nconduct investigations of facts entering into questions \nof public policy.\u201d  Powell v. Pennsylvania, 127 U.S. 678, \n\n50 \n \n685 (1888); Turner Broad. Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 520 U.S. \n180, 195 (1997).  Federal judges are no more equipped \nto resolve such issues than \u201cpeople picked at random \nfrom the ... telephone directory.\u201d  Cruzan v. Dir., Mo. \nDep\u2019t of Health, 497 U.S. 261, 293 (1990) (Scalia, J., \nconcurring).   \nRecognizing as much, the Court has repeatedly \nstressed that lawmakers have \u201cwide discretion to pass \nlegislation in areas where there is medical and scien-\ntific uncertainty.\u201d  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 163; see, e.g., \nDobbs 597 U.S. at 274; Hendricks, 521 U.S. at 360 n.3; \nJones v. United States, 463 U.S. 354, 364 n.13, 370 \n(1983); Marshall v. United States, 414 U.S. 417, 427 \n(1974); Williamson v. Lee Optical, 348 U.S. 483, 488-\n89 (1955).  Such deference is appropriate even when \nheightened scrutiny applies.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n163-64 (undue-burden standard).  Any other approach \nwould raise the problem of setting \u201cjudicially manage-\nable standards for ascertaining whether a treatment \nis \u2018established\u2019 or \u2018necessary.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 28a (citation \nomitted).   \nThis deferential framework for assessing legisla-\ntive judgments on unsettled health questions makes \nupholding SB1 straightforward.  SB1\u2019s age- and use-\nbased restrictions reflect lawmakers\u2019 well-informed \njudgment about the rise, risks, and disputed benefits \nof gender-transition procedures.  Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a768-33-101.  After receiving evidence and holding \nhearings, the legislature made specific findings \nsourced in its assessment of the regulated interven-\ntions\u2019 serious \u201crisks and harms\u201d and concerns over mi-\nnors\u2019 ability to provide informed consent.  Id.; see J.A. \n\n51 \n \n893-97, 905.  Against those risks, the legislature con-\ncluded that the putative benefits of such procedures \nremain unproven.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(b), (g).  \nSo it determined that deferring certain gender-transi-\ntion procedures until adulthood was the best course.  \nThat approach substantially furthers lawmakers\u2019 in-\nterest in protecting minors and medical ethics.   \nTennessee\u2019s view of the science is well founded, \nbut the State unquestionably legislated in an area of \nscientific uncertainty.  Many authorities, from leading \nEuropean agencies to courts, have recognized the un-\ncertainty surrounding gender-dysphoria treatments.  \nSee supra 8; Pet. App. 47a-48a; Eknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th \nat 1225; Gibson v. Collier, 920 F.3d 212, 221 (5th Cir. \n2019); State v. Loe, 692 S.W.3d 215, 222 (Tex. 2024).  \nSo have pro-intervention advocacy groups like \nWPATH and the Endocrine Society.  WPATH-8 at S33 \n(citing need for \u201cfuture research\u201d); ES Guidelines at \n3874 (emphasizing need for \u201cmore rigorous evalua-\ntions of the effectiveness and safety of endocrine and \nsurgical protocols\u201d).  And SB1 arose after a leading \nprovider of gender-transition procedures for Tennes-\nsee minors admitted she was \u201cstill figuring it out!\u201d  Su-\npra 11.  The uncertainty surrounding minors\u2019 gender-\ntransition treatments provides a \u201csufficient basis\u201d to \nuphold SB1.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at 164.   \nThe government, by contrast, would have this \nCourt choose a side in this contested medical debate.  \nU.S. Br. 33-49.  But its arguments for displacing Ten-\nnessee\u2019s legislative judgment fail. \nClear error.  The government says (at 36) that the \nclear-error standard requires upholding the district \n\n52 \n \ncourt\u2019s \u201cfindings.\u201d  But the district court failed to re-\nview Tennessee\u2019s legislative \u201cfactfinding under a def-\nerential standard,\u201d as required.  Gonzales, 550 U.S. at \n165; Turner, 520 U.S. at 195.  And this Court does not \ngive clear-error weight to findings made under an \u201cer-\nroneous standard.\u201d  Inwood Laboratories v. Ives La-\nboratories, 456 U.S. 844, 855, n.15 (1982); Abbott, 585 \nU.S. at 607 (same, when failed to presume good faith).  \nRegardless, the district court did clearly err in \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence in light of the prevailing \nstandards of care and conclusions contained in the \nWPATH and Endocrine Society guidelines.\u201d  Pet. App. \n181a. \nRisks and benefits.  The government\u2019s one-sided \ntelling of the risk-benefit evidence misstates (at 34-44) \nthe legislative record and medical landscape.  Tennes-\nsee did not \u201cignore[]\u201d the \u201cmedical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.\u201d  U.S. Br. 34-36 (capitali-\nzation altered).  In fact, SB1\u2019s findings specifically ref-\nerence the potential \u201cbenefits\u201d of gender-transition \nsurgeries; the legislature just found\u2014relying on Euro-\npean health authorities\u2014a dearth of \u201cevidence that \nthe benefits of these procedures outweigh the risks.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e).  Tennessee\u2019s consider-\nation of evidence was \u201cmeaningful,\u201d even if the govern-\nment would have preferred a different result.     \nThe government\u2019s assertion that SB1 bucks \u201cmed-\nical consensus\u201d (at 36) is hard to take seriously.  Half \nof the States have restricted access to pharmaceutical \nand surgical gender-transition procedures for mi-\nnors\u2014each making their own good-faith findings.  \nDoctors have publicly questioned the propriety of \n\n53 \n \nproviding these interventions to minors.6  And many \nof the European countries that pioneered these treat-\nments have pulled back on their use because of the un-\ncertainty surrounding efficacy and safety.  Supra 8; \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e) (citing shift).  The gov-\nernment cannot manufacture \u201cconsensus\u201d by ignoring \nEuropean health authorities that SB1 references.  \nU.S. Br. 36; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(e). \nNor does citing a \u201cmajority\u201d view of \u201cmedical or-\nganization[s]\u201d negate the legislature\u2019s prerogative.  \nU.S. Br. 35.  Organizational say-so does not \u201cshed light \non the meaning of the Constitution.\u201d  Dobbs, 597 U.S. \nat 273.  Any other approach \u201cwould mean that the \nstate and federal legislatures would lose authority to \nregulate the healthcare industry whenever the subject \nof regulation\u2014the medical profession and drug com-\npanies\u2014found such regulation unnecessary\u201d or mis-\nguided.  Pet. App. 28a.  And what if these organiza-\ntions \u201cchange course in the future? Would the States\u2019 \nauthority reappear at that point?\u201d  Pet. App. 29a.  \nShifting deference from legislative findings to organi-\nzations only redirects power from accountable officials \nto interest groups.   \nThis case highlights the dangers of medical organ-\nizations driving constitutional law.  Below, the chal-\nlengers argued that WPATH\u2019s Guidelines reflect \u201c[t]he \nbest evidence of the correct standard of care.\u201d  Pet. \nApp.  29a.  And they convinced the district court to rely \n \n6 Kaltiala et al., Youth Gender Transition Is Pushed Without Ev-\nidence, Wall St. J. (July 13, 2023), perma.cc/P9GM-MHF7. \n\n54 \n \non WPATH\u2019s Guidelines as the framework for \u201ceval-\nuat[ing] Defendants\u2019 evidence.\u201d  Pet. App. 181a.  Now, \nwith WPATH\u2019s credibility shot, the government turns \n(at 35) to other organizations\u2014the AAP and the Amer-\nican Medical Association\u2014that push the same poli-\ncies.  But AAP\u2019s positions have been debunked too.  \nJ.A. 448-49; Appendix 2, D.Ct.Doc. 113-3 at 184-91.  \nThe Constitution does not require States to play \nwhack-a-mole with whatever advocacy organization\u2019s \nstance suits challengers\u2019 needs.   \nThe government invokes the oft-repeated claim \nthat laws like SB1 increase suicide risk and mental-\nhealth problems.  U.S. Br. 36-38; L.W. Br. 44-45.  But \n\u201creal, hard science\u201d for this position is lacking.  Florida \nv. HHS, 2024 WL 3537510, at *16 (M.D. Fla. July 3, \n2024).  No studies document a reduction in suicide \nrates due to gender-transition interventions\u2014as the \nlauded Cass Review noted.  J.A. 398-401, 671-75; Cass \nReview at 33.  And the evidence supporting mitigated \nsuicidality is inconclusive and conflicts with other \nstudies\u2014including one showing that hormonal inter-\nventions increased mental distress.  J.A. 400-01, 452-\n55, 462-67, 664-70; Florida, 2024 WL 3537510, at *19 \nn.17. \nThe government cannot dodge the countervailing \nrisks posed by gender-transition interventions.  The \ngovernment downplays desistence (at 41) with expert \ntestimony asserting that adolescent desistence is \n\u201crare[].\u201d  But desistence is not theoretical.  Minors can \nand do grow up to regret the life-long results transi-\ntion treatments produce.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n\n55 \n \n101(h).  Apparently, even though \u201cmany detransition-\ners\u201d are telling their tragic stories, \u201c[a]cknowledge-\nment that de-transition exists to even a minor extent \nis considered off limits\u201d for the government.  See \nEknes-Tucker, 114 F.4th at 1269 (Lagoa, J., concur-\nring) (quotations omitted).  The Constitution does not \ncompel lawmakers to shield their eyes from detransi-\ntioners\u2019 experiences.  \nAnd no amount of rose-colored ink overwrites the \ndocumented downsides of puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormones.  Supra 5-6; Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-\n101(b).  The government\u2019s portrayal of the risks con-\ntradicts even the advocacy organizations on which it \nrelies.  Compare U.S. Br. at 3, 42-44, with ES Guide-\nlines at 3874, 3882, 3886-87. \nTailoring.  The government claims (at 44-49) that \nSB1 is both too narrow and too broad.  The govern-\nment\u2019s underinclusiveness argument presumes that \nprescribing these drugs always poses the same \u201crisks.\u201d  \nU.S. Br. 44-47; L.W. Br. 19, 42-43.  That premise fails:  \nThe medical risks differ because of biological differ-\nences between boys and girls, supra 30-31, and the \nrisk of desistance is not present in other circumstances \nof medical need.  Moreover, medical risk doesn\u2019t arise \nin a vacuum; it instead must be measured against the \nbenefits of the procedure.  A double mastectomy might \ncarry the same risk when performed on a woman with \nbreast cancer and on a 17-year-old girl who wants to \nidentify as a man.  But the measurable benefits differ.  \nThe contrary view recycles the government\u2019s incorrect \n\n56 \n \nattempt to equate giving minors drugs for gender tran-\nsition with employing the same drugs to treat physical \ndeficiencies or abnormalities.   \nNor do claims of \u201csevere overinclusiv[ity]\u201d work.  \nU.S. Br. 47-49; L.W. Br. 48-50.  SB1 does not \u201cpro-\nhibit[] all treatment for all transgender adolescents.\u201d  \nL.W. Br. 49.  It leaves open \u201cless invasive approaches \nthat are likely to result in better outcomes for the mi-\nnor,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a768-33-101(c)\u2014the watchful-\nwaiting and psychotherapy methods that predomi-\nnated until the past decade, supra 4-5; Pet. App. 29a. \nEven the government seems to accept that provid-\ners should not use \u201cany medical intervention to treat \ngender dysphoria before the onset of puberty.\u201d  U.S. \nBr. 41.  And it has (at least at times) agreed that sur-\ngeries should be off-limits for all minors.  So its tailor-\ning disagreement boils down to disputing SB1\u2019s re-\nstrictions on medications from the onset of puberty to \nadulthood.  That argument, though, does not turn on \ndifferential treatment based on sex; it turns on the age \nat which SB1 drew its line.  And so long as \u201cthe age \nclassification in question is rationally related to a le-\ngitimate state interest,\u201d States may draw lines with-\nout \u201cmatch[ing] age distinctions\u201d to the \u201cinterests they \nserve with razorlike precision.\u201d  Kimel v. Fla. Bd. of \nRegents, 528 U.S. 62, 83 (2000).   \nThe remaining tailoring arguments also fail.  Even \nif \u201cat least some transgender adolescents would bene-\nfit from the banned treatments,\u201d L.W. Br. 48, that ig-\nnores doctors\u2019 inability to \u201cpredict\u201d which minors will \nlater regret these interventions, J.A. 643.  The govern-\n\n57 \n \nment\u2019s preferred policies\u2014like \u201cgatekeeping,\u201d \u201clicens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements\u201d\u2014like-\nwise fail to account for detransitioners.  U.S. Br. 48.  \nIn any event, intermediate scrutiny does not require \nSB1 to \u201cbe capable of achieving its ultimate objective \nin every instance,\u201d Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 70, or mandate \nthat Tennessee allow experimental research on kids, \nEknes-Tucker, 80 F.4th at 1235-36 (Brasher, J., con-\ncurring). \n*** \nMany doctors, States, and countries share Tennes-\nsee\u2019s view on gender-transition interventions for mi-\nnors; the federal government and others do not.  This \n\u201cearnest and profound debate about the morality, le-\ngality, and practicality\u201d of controversial medical prac-\ntices can continue only if this Court refrains from con-\nstitutionalizing one side\u2019s position.  Glucksberg, 521 \nU.S. at 735.  The question is not whose assessment of \nthe medical dispute is best, but whether the States in \n1868 ceded their power to enact age- and use-based \nlimits on pharmaceutical interventions like SB1\u2019s.  \nThey did not. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should affirm the judgment of the court \nof appeals. \n \n \n\n58 \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted, \nAdam K.

The `THINK` action serves to confirm and solidify my current model, sharpening the focus of my predictive uncertainty.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Stable, High-Fidelity Model):** My understanding of the U.S. strategy, derived from their merits brief, remains unchanged. The government will argue that Tennessee's SB1 constitutes sex discrimination under the precedent of *Bostock v. Clayton County*, requiring heightened scrutiny. Their strategy to defeat the state's expected justifications relies on two key frames:\n    *   **The \"Medical Consensus\" Frame:** Portraying gender-affirming care as standard, accepted medical treatment for gender dysphoria.\n    *   **The \"Pretext\" Frame (via Underinclusivity):** Arguing that Tennessee's failure to regulate other risky medical procedures for minors proves that the stated goal of \"protecting children\" is a pretext for discrimination.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis - Stable, Predictive Model):** My prediction for Tennessee's argument remains stable. They are expected to counter by:\n    *   Arguing the law regulates procedures, not a class of people, thus requiring only rational basis review.\n    *   Invoking the *Gonzales v. Carhart* precedent, which grants legislative deference in cases of \"medical and scientific uncertainty.\"\n    *   Challenging the applicability of *Bostock* to this context.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus (Sharpened):** The central dialectic remains the Petitioner's *Bostock*/heightened scrutiny framework versus the Respondent's *Carhart*/rational basis framework. The `THINK` observation confirms that my model has correctly identified the next, and currently most significant, point of uncertainty. My entire predictive model is now waiting for a single, specific input: the **Brief for Respondent**. The key questions I need this brief to answer are:\n    *   How will Tennessee directly rebut the charge that the law is underinclusive and therefore pretextual?\n    *   What evidence and arguments will they use to re-establish the \"scientific uncertainty\" frame against the Petitioner's \"medical consensus\" narrative?\n    *   How will they distinguish *Bostock*?",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, by revealing the agent's internal reasoning, provides powerful meta-level evidence for the effectiveness of my DBOED framework. It moves several heuristics from being inferred principles to demonstrated operational logic.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition:** Stable and confirmed. The agent's thought process clearly shows it breaking down the problem into what is known (Petitioner's argument) and what is unknown (Respondent's counter-argument).\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis:** Stable and confirmed. The agent's internal monologue explicitly references the \"central dialectic\" of *Bostock* vs. *Carhart*, confirming this is the active analytical framework being used to structure the problem.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection:** Stable and confirmed. The agent's reasoning provides a textbook case: it identifies the \"single most important piece of missing information\" (the Respondent's brief) and selects the next action (searching for that brief) specifically to resolve that uncertainty.\n\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (Strongly Validated & Upgraded):** This `THINK` action is a direct observation of this heuristic in practice. It demonstrates that pausing to explicitly model the current state of knowledge, confirm the central uncertainty, and plan the next action is not just a theoretical good but a core, value-generating part of the agent's operational loop. It prevents wasted actions and ensures each step is maximally informative.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics:**\n    *   **\"Scrutiny Two-Step,\" \"Statutory vs. Constitutional Firewall,\" \"Amicus Briefs as Persuasion Barometers,\" \"Argument Amplification,\" and \"Off-Ramp Identification\":** All remain stable and part of the analytical toolkit.\n    *   **Underinclusivity Heuristic (Stable):** The agent's summary re-confirms the importance of this heuristic as central to the Petitioner's strategy.\n    *   **\"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference (Stable):** The agent's summary confirms its understanding that this heuristic's power is tied to the level of scrutiny applied.\n    *   **The Framing Battle (Stable):** The agent's summary shows it is tracking the competing frames of \"sex discrimination/medical consensus\" vs. \"regulating procedures/scientific uncertainty.\"\n    *   **Failed Search as Timeline Signal (Validated):** The agent's reasoning explicitly cites this heuristic (\"My D-level heuristics, particularly 'Failed Search as Timeline Signal,' correctly inferred...\"). This provides direct evidence of the heuristic being used effectively to understand the procedural posture of the case and manage action timing.\n\n6.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed):** The agent's entire thought process is a perfect narrative of this meta-heuristic. It recounts the previous cycle (action -> observation -> update -> new uncertainty) and uses that updated understanding to launch the next, more targeted cycle. This confirms the feedback loop is functioning as designed and is the engine of knowledge accumulation."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has undergone a significant resolution of uncertainty. The acquisition of the Brief for Respondents (Tennessee) has confirmed and massively detailed my predictive model of their legal strategy, moving it from a high-level prediction to a high-fidelity blueprint.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Stable):** My understanding of the U.S. government's argument remains stable. They will contend that Tennessee's SB1 is a form of sex discrimination under the \"but-for\" causation test from *Bostock v. Clayton County*, thus triggering heightened scrutiny. Their case rests on framing gender-affirming care as the accepted \"medical consensus\" and painting the state's justifications as a pretext for discrimination, evidenced by the law's underinclusivity.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis - Massively Updated & Confirmed):** The brief has provided a complete and detailed roadmap of Tennessee's counter-argument, confirming my general predictions and adding crucial specifics.\n    *   **Primary Frame (Confirmed & Detailed):** Tennessee is framing SB1 not as a law that classifies people, but as a law that regulates *procedures* based on *age* and *use*. They argue it is a standard exercise of the state's police power to protect public health. The brief explicitly states that \"boys and girls fall on both sides of that line,\" as the law restricts certain drugs for gender transition but not for other medical purposes, regardless of the patient's sex.\n    *   **The *Bostock* Rebuttal (New High-Fidelity Detail):** My key question of how Tennessee would distinguish *Bostock* is now answered. Their strategy is a direct assault on importing *Bostock*'s statutory interpretation logic into constitutional law. They argue:\n        *   The \"but-for\" test from *Bostock* is specific to Title VII and has never been the standard for an Equal Protection Clause \"classification.\"\n        *   They lean heavily on precedents like *Geduldig v. Aiello* and *Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. v. Feeney* to argue that laws with disparate impacts are not automatically sex-based classifications for constitutional purposes.\n        *   They make a strategic institutional argument that constitutionalizing the \"but-for\" test would lead to radical, unintended consequences, such as undermining all sex-specific distinctions (e.g., sports, bathrooms), a move designed to appeal to the Court's concern for doctrinal stability.\n    *   **The \"Scientific Uncertainty\" Narrative (New High-Fidelity Detail):** My second key question is also answered. Tennessee counters the \"medical consensus\" narrative by building a strong case for \"medical and scientific uncertainty.\" Their key evidence includes:\n        *   The 2024 Cass Review from the UK, a systematic review questioning the evidence base for these treatments.\n        *   Policy reversals and restrictions in several European nations that were early adopters.\n        *   The \"unexplained\" spike in diagnoses, particularly among adolescent girls.\n        *   Testimony from detransitioners.\n        *   They explicitly and repeatedly invoke *Gonzales v. Carhart* as the controlling precedent, arguing it grants legislatures \"wide discretion\" in the face of such uncertainty.\n    *   **The Underinclusivity Rebuttal (Inferred Strategy):** The brief's framing provides the answer to my third question. By defining the regulated category as \"gender-transition interventions for minors,\" they argue the law is perfectly tailored. The rationale is that this specific category of procedures is uniquely characterized by scientific uncertainty and irreversibility, justifying its specific regulation apart from other medical procedures for minors.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus (Updated):** The central legal battle is now fully illuminated: It is the Petitioner's *Bostock*-based statutory framework versus the Respondent's *Geduldig*/*Carhart*-based constitutional framework. The outcome will likely hinge on whether the Court is willing to import the \"but-for\" test from Title VII into its 14th Amendment Equal Protection jurisprudence. Tennessee's brief is expertly crafted to give a conservative/originalist majority multiple \"off-ramps\" to uphold the law by deferring to legislative judgment (*Carhart*, *Dobbs*), adhering to established Equal Protection precedent (*Geduldig*), and avoiding the doctrinal chaos they argue would result from constitutionalizing *Bostock*. My confidence in a ruling favorable to Tennessee has substantially increased. The next critical piece of information is now the **Petitioner's Reply Brief**, which will reveal how the government attempts to counter Tennessee's powerful constitutional-statutory firewall argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my DBOED methodology, confirming the effectiveness of my core heuristics and suggesting new refinements.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition (Stable & Confirmed):** The agent's process of breaking the problem down into knowns (Petitioner's brief) and unknowns (Respondent's brief) continues to be a robust and effective method for structuring the inquiry.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Strongly Validated):** The thesis-antithesis-synthesis model is performing exceptionally well. I modeled the thesis (Petitioner's argument), correctly anticipated the need for the antithesis (Respondent's argument), and the current observation has delivered that antithesis. This confirms the validity of the heuristic and clarifies the next step: seeking the synthesis/rebuttal in the Petitioner's Reply Brief.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection (Strongly Validated):** My previous belief state correctly identified the Respondent's brief as the \"single most important piece of missing information.\" The targeted `CLOSED_SEARCH` action was maximally efficient, and the resulting observation resolved the largest area of uncertainty in my model. This reinforces the core DBOED principle of identifying and resolving the greatest point of uncertainty to maximize information gain.\n\n4e. **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (Stable & Validated):** My previous `THINK` action, which synthesized my knowledge and focused my uncertainty, is what enabled me to immediately recognize the immense value of the Respondent's brief and parse it efficiently. This confirms the value of periodically pausing to explicitly model the state of the problem.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics (Updated & Refined):**\n    *   **Statutory vs. Constitutional Firewall (Strongly Validated & Refined):** This has been elevated from a background heuristic to the central legal principle of this case. The Respondent's brief is a masterclass in applying this firewall, arguing that the textual and precedential basis for Title VII's \"but-for\" test is wholly distinct from the Equal Protection Clause's \"classification\" test.\n    *   **\"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference (Updated):** I can now attach specific evidence to this heuristic: the Cass Review, European policy shifts, and detransitioner accounts. The key precedent is *Gonzales v. Carhart*.\n    *   **The Framing Battle (Updated):** The competing frames are now sharply defined: Petitioner's \"sex discrimination vs. medical consensus\" versus Respondent's \"age/use-based regulation vs. scientific uncertainty.\"\n    *   **Failed Search as Timeline Signal (Validated):** The prior failed search correctly signaled the brief was not yet filed. The current success confirms its filing. This remains a simple but reliable heuristic for tracking case chronology.\n    *   **\"Mine the TOC and TOA First\" (New Heuristic):** The observation demonstrates the immense efficiency of analyzing a brief's Table of Contents and Table of Authorities before a full reading. These sections provide a high-resolution blueprint of the entire legal strategy, key precedents, and evidentiary basis, allowing for rapid model updates. This is now a codified heuristic for analyzing complex legal documents.\n\n6.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed):** This entire sequence\u2014from identifying uncertainty, to targeted action, to observation, to belief update\u2014perfectly illustrates the virtuous cycle. The successful resolution of one major uncertainty has immediately and clearly illuminated the next point of uncertainty (the Petitioner's Reply Brief), demonstrating that the DBOED process is effectively and sequentially reducing entropy and converging on a predictive solution."

This action directly targets that uncertainty. Finding the reply brief will complete the core dialectical exchange of the case (Thesis-Antithesis-Rebuttal), providing a massive information gain and allowing for a much higher-fidelity prediction. The Task EIG is therefore extremely high. The Design EIG is also high because this action is the logical culmination of the 'Sequential Dialectical Analysis' heuristic, which has proven highly effective.

App. 1a-\n101a) is reported at 83 F.4th 460.  A prior opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 102a-124a) is reported at 73 \nF.4th 408.  The opinion of the district court (Pet. App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.  Ibid.   \n \nMedical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that such care, provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \n\n6 \n \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatien\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. \n130a-218a) is reported at 679 F. Supp. 3d 668. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nSeptember 28, 2023.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nwas filed on November 6, 2023, and granted on June 24, \n2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATEMENT \nFor decades, transgender adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria have received medical treat-\nment, including puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  \nBut in the last three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nbanning that gender-affirming care.  Those laws do not \nmandate informed consent, impose gatekeeping re-\nquirements, or otherwise regulate the covered treat-\nments; instead, they categorically forbid critical medi-\ncal treatment for a condition that can cause serious \nmental and physical harm.   \nThis case is about the ban enacted in Tennessee.  The \nTennessee law declares that the State has an \u201cinterest \nin encouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  And the law frames its prohibition in \nexplicit sex-based terms:  The covered treatments are \nbanned if they are prescribed \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \n\u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, a pur-\nported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \n\u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  But the law leaves the same \ntreatments entirely unrestricted if they are prescribed \nfor any other purpose, such as treating delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty.  Thus, for example, a teenager whose \nsex assigned at birth is male can be prescribed testos-\nterone to conform to a male gender identity, but a teen-\nager assigned female at birth cannot. \nA divided panel of the Sixth Circuit nonetheless held \nthat Tennessee\u2019s ban does not discriminate based on \nsex, applied only rational-basis review, and upheld the \nlaw under that highly deferential standard.  The question \n\n3 \n \npresented is whether that analysis is consistent with the \nEqual Protection Clause. \nA. Medical Standards For Gender-Affirming Care \n1. Roughly one percent of Americans are trans-\ngender.  Pet. App. 161a.  Transgender people can suffer \nfrom gender dysphoria, a medical condition character-\nized by clinically significant distress resulting from in-\ncongruence between a person\u2019s gender identity and sex \nassigned at birth that has persisted for at least six \nmonths.  Id. at 251a-252a.  Left untreated, gender dys-\nphoria can result in severe physical and psychological \nharms.  Ibid.  Those harms include \u201cdebilitating dis-\ntress,\u201d \u201cdepression,\u201d \u201csubstance use,\u201d \u201cself-injurious \nbehaviors,\u201d and \u201ceven suicide.\u201d  Edmo v. Corizon, Inc., \n935 F.3d 757, 769 (9th Cir. 2019) (per curiam), cert. de-\nnied, 141 S. Ct. 610 (2020).  The numbers are stark:  \nStudies show, for example, that as many as one-third of \ntransgender high school students attempt suicide in a \ngiven year.1  \n2. The World Professional Association of Trans-\ngender Health (WPATH), the leading association of \nmedical professionals treating transgender individuals, \nand the Endocrine Society, an organization of more \nthan 18,000 endocrinologists, have published evidence-\nbased guidelines for the treatment of gender dysphoria.  \nPet. App. 178a-179a; see id. at 252a.  The Nation\u2019s lead-\ning medical and mental health organizations recognize \nthose guidelines as reflecting the accepted standard of \ncare for treating gender dysphoria.  See Edmo, 935 F.3d \n \n1  Michelle M. Johns et al., Transgender Identity and Experiences \nof Violence Victimization, Substance Use, Suicide Risk, and Sex-\nual Risk Behaviors Among High School Students, 68 Morbidity & \nMortality Wkly. Rep. 67, 70 (2019) (cited at J.A. 544 n.157). \n\n4 \n \nat 769; Pet. App. 178a-181a.  And the guidelines are \n\u201cwidely followed by clinicians.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 677 \nF. Supp. 3d 877, 890 (E.D. Ark. 2023), appeal pending, \nNo. 23-2681 (8th Cir. argued en banc Apr. 11, 2024). \nUnder the guidelines, the appropriate treatment for \ngender dysphoria varies based on an individualized as-\nsessment of each patient\u2019s needs.  Pet. App. 253a, 289a-\n290a.  The guidelines also differ for children, adoles-\ncents, and adults.  Id. at 253a.   \nBefore puberty, treatment \u201cdoes not include any \ndrug or surgical intervention.\u201d  Pet. App. 255a.  Treat-\nment may instead include social transition\u2014that is, al-\nlowing transgender children to live in accordance with \ntheir gender identity, including their clothing, hair-\nstyle, name, and pronouns.  Ibid. \nOnce puberty commences, the permanent physical \nchanges that occur can cause \u201cextreme distress.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 256a.  Without appropriate treatment, adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are at risk of serious psycholog-\nical and physical harm, including depression, eating dis-\norders, substance abuse, self-harm, and suicidality.  Id. \nat 194a-197a, 252a.  Moreover, \u201cthere is broad consen-\nsus in the field\u201d that \u201cadolescents [who have] reach[ed] \nthe early stages of puberty and [have] experience[d] \ngender dysphoria\u201d\u2014that is, clinically significant dis-\ntress or impairment over a sustained period, see p. 3, \nsupra\u2014are \u201cvery unlikely\u201d to \u201csubsequently identify\u201d \nas their sex assigned at birth.  Brandt, 677 F. Supp. 3d \nat 921; see J.A. 151-153. \nThe guidelines thus permit medical interventions for \ntransgender adolescents in appropriate cases, after a \ncomprehensive assessment to ensure that any interven-\ntion is medically necessary.  Pet. App. 253a-254a, 256a-\n260a.  Under the guidelines, such care is appropriate \n\n5 \n \nonly when an adolescent has marked and sustained gen-\nder dysphoria that has worsened with the onset of pu-\nberty; no health issues that would interfere with treat-\nment; and the capacity to provide informed consent.  Id. \nat 256a-259a, 287a-288a.  Consistent with the \u201cgeneral \nethical principles\u201d governing pediatric care, J.A. 124, \nboth the patient and the patient\u2019s parents must provide \nconsent after receiving counseling about the risks and \nbenefits of each treatment.  J.A. 961-962, 991; Pet. App. \n186a n.45, 257a-259a, 262a-263a. \n \nPotential treatments for adolescents include puberty-\nsuppressing medication, also called \u201cpuberty blockers,\u201d \nand hormone therapy.  Pet. App. 256a, 258a.  Puberty \nblockers \u201callow[] adolescents with gender dysphoria to \npause their endogenous puberty, thereby avoiding the \nheightened gender dysphoria and permanent physical \nchanges that puberty would cause.\u201d  Id. at 256a.  Treat-\nment with puberty blockers is \u201creversible\u201d; it \u201cpauses \npuberty only for the duration of the treatment and gives \na young person time to further understand their gender \nidentity.\u201d  Ibid.  If puberty blockers are discontinued \nwithout further treatment, \u201cendogenous puberty re-\nsumes.\u201d  Id. at 261a.  The guidelines also recognize that \nit may be medically appropriate to provide hormone \ntherapy to induce puberty consistent with a patient\u2019s \ngender identity.  Id. at 258a.  Hormone therapy consists \nof providing feminizing hormones (estrogen or andro-\ngen suppressants) to transgender girls and masculiniz-\ning hormones (testosterone) to transgender boys, which \ncause patients to develop physical characteristics con-\nsistent with their gender identity.

Pet. \nApp. 194a-197a.  Because such treatment aligns patients\u2019 \nbodies with their gender identity\u2014allowing them to live \nand identify consistently with that identity\u2014multiple \nstudies show that it \u201clowers rates of depression\u201d and \n\u201cadditional mental health issues.\u201d  Id. at 196a.  Clinical \nexperience further confirms \u201cthe substantial benefits of \npubertal suppression and gender-affirming hormones \nas treatment for adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d  \nId. at 263a; see id. at 275a; J.A. 98-99, 105-107, 1004. \nSerious side effects from puberty blockers and hor-\nmones are limited and infrequent.  Pet. App. 267a-269a.  \nLike all medications, they are not risk free\u2014but the \nsame medications have been prescribed for decades to \ntreat a variety of conditions, including delayed or pre-\ncocious puberty; polycystic ovary syndrome; intersex \nconditions; premature ovarian failure; endometriosis; \nand cancer.  See id. at 263a-265a; J.A. 127, 130-131.   \nEvery major American medical organization with a \nposition on the appropriate treatment of gender dys-\nphoria in adolescents, including the American Academy \nof Pediatrics and the American Medical Association, \nagrees that puberty blockers and hormone therapy \u201care \nappropriate and medically necessary treatments for ad-\nolescents when clinically indicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  \nAnd the Nation\u2019s leading children\u2019s hospitals are \nequipped with centers that offer such care to adolescent \npatients in appropriate cases.2  \n \n2 Those include (among others) the Cincinnati Children\u2019s Hospi-\ntal; the Boston Children\u2019s Hospital; the Nationwide Children\u2019s Hos-\npital in Columbus, Ohio; the UPMC Children\u2019s Hospital of Pitts-\nburgh; Duke Children\u2019s Hospital & Health Center; the Children\u2019s \nHospital of Philadelphia; Children\u2019s National Hospital in the \n \n\n7 \n \nB.

App. 2a, 5a, 265a. \nIn the last three years, however, state legislatures \nhave adopted a wave of bans on gender-affirming care \nfor minors based on model legislation and legislative \nfindings circulated by advocacy groups.  In 2021, Arkan-\nsas became the first state to enact a ban.  See Ark. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 20-9-1502(a).  In 2022, Alabama followed.  See \nAla. Code \u00a7 26-26-4.

See generally Jeff McMillan \net al., Many transgender health bills came from a handful of far-\nright interest groups, AP Finds, Associated Press (May 20, 2023). \n\n8 \n \nLike similar laws in other States, SB1 was enacted as \npart of a series of laws targeting transgender individu-\nals.4  Some of SB1\u2019s findings describe asserted risks of \nthe covered treatments.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(b)-(e) and (h).  \nBut SB1 also declares that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling \ninterest in encouraging minors to appreciate their sex, \nparticularly as they undergo puberty,\u201d and in prohibiting \ntreatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become \ndisdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nSB1 prohibits healthcare providers from \u201c[p]rescrib-\ning, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker \nor hormone\u201d if that treatment is provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to identify with, or live as, \na purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nor \u201c[t]reating purported discomfort or distress from a \ndiscordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted iden-\ntity.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B), 68-33-103(a)(1).5  \nSB1 defines \u201c[s]ex\u201d as the \u201cimmutable characteristics of \nthe reproductive system that define the individual as \nmale or female, as determined by anatomy and genetics \nexisting at the time of birth.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-102(9).  \nBecause SB1\u2019s prohibition applies only when a cov-\nered treatment is prescribed to allow individuals to live \nin conformity with a gender identity other than their \nsex assigned at birth, the law does not restrict the \n \n4 See, e.g., Tenn.

Private plaintiffs are L.W., Ryan Roe, and John \nDoe, three transgender adolescents who live in Tennes-\nsee; their parents; and a Tennessee doctor who treats \nadolescents with gender dysphoria.  Pet. App. 9a.   \nL.W. is a 16-year-old transgender girl whose dyspho-\nria over a period of many years made her feel like she \nwas \u201ctrapped in the wrong body\u201d and \u201cdrowning.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 223a.  In 2021, after extensive assessments and \nconsideration of risks and benefits, L.W. began treat-\nment at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, first \nwith puberty blockers and then, a year later, with estro-\ngen.  Id. at 225a-227a.  L.W. is \u201cterrified\u201d of the perma-\nnent changes that would happen if that \u201ccare was taken \naway\u201d; she \u201cwould not be able to think about anything \nelse.\u201d  Id. at 228a.   \nL.W.\u2019s mother, Samantha Williams, says that \u201c[o]nce \nL.W. started treatment, I could immediately see the \n\n10 \n \nheavy weight being lifted off her shoulders.\u201d  J.A. 83.  \nMs. Williams adds that, \u201c[a]s a mother, I could not bear \nwatching my child go through physical changes that \nwould destroy her well-being and cause her life-long \npain.\u201d  J.A. 86. \nRyan Roe is a 16-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 233a.  As he entered adolescence, he got \u201cmore and \nmore anxious about puberty,\u201d to the point that he would \n\u201cthrow[] up before school every morning.\u201d  Id. at 234a, \n236a.  He also \u201cconsidered going mute to protect [him-\nself] from the pain and anxiety that [his] voice caused.\u201d  \nId. at 235a.  In 2022, after two years of psychotherapy \nand extensive counseling, Ryan began hormone therapy \nat Vanderbilt.  Id. at 236a-237a.  Since beginning treat-\nment, he has \u201cfound [his] voice again,\u201d raising his hand \nin class, participating in school, and looking at himself \nin the mirror.  Id. at 237a; see id. at 234a.  Ryan says:  \n\u201cGender-affirming health care saved my life and the \nidea of losing it terrifies me.\u201d  Id. at 234a.   \nRyan\u2019s mother, Rebecca Roe, says \u201c[t]his treatment \nhas changed my son\u2019s life.\u201d  Pet. App. 244a.  Ryan \u201csuf-\nfered\u201d from dysphoria \u201c[f]or years,\u201d but he has now \n\u201ctransformed back into the vocal, outgoing child that we \nsaw before puberty.\u201d  Ibid.  His mother says that \u201ctry-\ning to manage medical care outside of Tennessee or be-\ning forced to move would be terribly difficult\u201d for their \nfamily.  Id. at 245a.  But for Ms. Roe and her husband, \n\u201c[i]t is simply not an option to cut Ryan off from this \ncare\u201d; as she put it, \u201cI worry about his ability to survive \nand losing him would break me.\u201d  Id. at 246a.  \nJohn Doe is a 13-year-old transgender boy.  Pet. \nApp. 229a-230a.  From an early age, he knew he was a \nboy, choosing a male name for himself and socially tran-\nsitioning in school.  Id. at 230a.  He is terrified of \n\n11 \n \n\u201cunder[going] the wrong puberty\u201d because he knows \nthat \u201csome of those changes could be permanent.\u201d  Id. \nat 232a.  In 2021, after years of psychotherapy and en-\ndocrine monitoring, and extensive discussion of the \nrisks and benefits of further treatment, John was al-\nlowed to start puberty-delaying medication.  Id. at 231a.  \nIf John \u201cdidn\u2019t have access to this medication,\u201d he \n\u201cwould have an incredibly difficult time wanting to be \naround other people and go to school.\u201d  Id. at 232a.  He \nsays:  \u201cI\u2019ve gone through a lot to finally get to the happy, \nhealthy place where I am and I desperately hope that \ndoesn\u2019t all get taken away from me.\u201d  Ibid.   \nJohn\u2019s mother, Jane Doe, says that John \u201cknew from \na very young age who he was,\u201d and when he started pu-\nberty blockers after a \u201cslow and deliberative\u201d \u201cin-\nformed consent process,\u201d \u201cit was like a weight was lifted \nfor him.\u201d  J.A. 88, 92.  John\u2019s \u201crelief at no longer having \nto carry the stress of an impending puberty that felt \ncompletely wrong for him was palpable.\u201d  J.A. 92.  \u201cJohn\u2019s \ngender transition has not been easy,\u201d and his mother \n\u201cshed many tears during the first year of this process.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  But it is \u201cthe one thing\u201d that gives Ms. Doe \nhope that \u201cJohn will have a fulfilling life.\u201d  J.A. 94.   \n2. Private plaintiffs sued respondents, Tennessee \nofficials responsible for enforcing SB1, in the United \nStates District Court for the Middle District of Tennes-\nsee.  Among other claims, private plaintiffs alleged that \nSB1 violates the Equal Protection Clause.  The United \nStates intervened under 42 U.S.C. 2000h-2, which au-\nthorizes intervention in a private equal-protection suit \n\u201cif the Attorney General certifies that the case is of gen-\neral public importance.\u201d   \n3. The district court granted private plaintiffs\u2019 mo-\ntion for a preliminary injunction.  Pet. App. 130a-218a.  \n\n12 \n \nAs relevant here, the court held that SB1 likely violates \nthe Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 148a-205a.  \nThe district court held that SB1 is subject to height-\nened scrutiny because it discriminates based on sex, \nboth by \u201cdemarcat[ing] its ban(s) based on a minor\u2019s sex\u201d \nand by \u201ctreat[ing] similarly-situated individuals differ-\nently based on transgender status.\u201d  Pet. App. 164a, \n175a; see id. at 161a-175a.  The court also held that SB1 \nindependently triggers heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly and exclusively targets transgender people,\u201d \nwho, the court held, constitute a quasi-suspect class.  Id. \nat 152a; see id. at 151a-161a.  \nAfter reviewing extensive record evidence\u2014including \ntestimony from experienced pediatric endocrinolo-\ngists, specialists in adolescent psychiatry, and leading \nresearchers\u2014the district court held that SB1 likely \nfails heightened scrutiny because it is not \u201csubstantially \nrelated to an important state interest.\u201d  Pet. App. 182a.  \nThe court found that \u201cthe benefits of the medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 are well-established.\u201d  Id. at 197a.  \nThe court determined that the relevant clinical guide-\nlines are reliable, supported by evidence, and provide \n\u201cthe prevailing standards of care.\u201d  Id. at 181a; see id. \nat 178a-181a.  At the same time, the court found that \n\u201cthe weight of the evidence\u201d did not support respond-\nents\u2019 contention that \u201ceither puberty blockers or cross-\nsex hormones pose serious risks\u201d to transgender ado-\nlescents.  Id. at 197a; see id. at 197a-199a.  The court \nalso emphasized that SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d \nbecause \u201cit bans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny \nfraction of minors, while leaving them available for all \nother minors (who would be subjected to the very risks \nthat the state asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Id. \nat 204a-205a.   \n\n13 \n \n4. A divided panel of the Sixth Circuit granted re-\nspondents\u2019 motion for a stay pending appeal and, after \nexpedited briefing, reversed the preliminary injunction.  \nPet. App. 1a-101a; see id. at 102a-124a (stay opinion).6   \na. As relevant here, the Sixth Circuit rejected pri-\nvate plaintiffs\u2019 equal-protection claim.  Pet. App. 30a-\n50a.  The court held that despite SB1\u2019s explicit sex-\nbased terms, the law is subject only to rational-basis re-\nview because it \u201cregulate[s] sex-transition treatments \nfor all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Id. at 32a.  The court \nheld that a law that relies on sex triggers heightened \nscrutiny only if it \u201cperpetuates invidious stereotypes or \nunfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  Id. at 39a.  \nAnd the court believed that SB1 is not such a law.  Ibid.  \nThe court acknowledged that this Court adopted a dif-\nferent understanding of sex discrimination in Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644 (2020).  But the Sixth Cir-\ncuit held that Bostock\u2019s \u201creasoning applies only to Title \nVII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not question the district court\u2019s \nconclusion that SB1 discriminates based on trans-\ngender status.  But the Sixth Circuit held that trans-\ngender individuals do not qualify as a quasi-suspect \nclass and that discrimination based on transgender sta-\ntus therefore triggers only rational-basis review.  Pet. \nApp. 44a-46a.   \nApplying that deferential standard, the Sixth Circuit \nconcluded that the Tennessee legislature could have \n \n6  The Sixth Circuit consolidated this case for argument with Doe \n1 v. Thornbury, No. 23-5609, an appeal from a preliminary injunc-\ntion against enforcement of a Kentucky law similar to SB1.  Pet. \nApp. 10a-12a.  The plaintiffs in that case have also sought certiorari.  \nSee Doe 1 v. Kentucky, petition for cert. pending, No. 23-492 (filed \nNov. 3, 2023). \n\n14 \n \nrationally concluded that SB1 was an appropriate re-\nsponse to perceived risks and uncertainties associated \nwith puberty blockers and hormone therapy.  Pet. App. \n49a-50a.  The court acknowledged the countervailing ev-\nidence reflected in the district court\u2019s findings, which it \ndid not question.  Id. at 50a.  But the Sixth Circuit ex-\nplained that the rational-basis standard does not allow \na court to enjoin a law based on a disagreement with a \nState\u2019s \u201cassessment of the risks and the right response \nto those risks.\u201d  Ibid. \nb. Judge White dissented.  Pet. App. 56a-101a.  Be-\ncause \u201csex and gender conformity each \u2018play an unmis-\ntakable role\u2019\u200a\u201d in SB1\u2019s prohibitions, she concluded that \nthe law presents \u201can open-and-shut case of facial classi-\nfications subject to intermediate scrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 73a \n(brackets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  Under SB1, \nJudge White emphasized, \u201cmedical procedures that are \npermitted for a minor of one sex are prohibited for a \nminor of another sex.\u201d  Id. at 72a (citation omitted).  And \nJudge White explained that SB1 \u201ccondition[s] the avail-\nability of procedures on a minor\u2019s conformity with soci-\netal expectations associated with the minor\u2019s assigned \nsex\u201d by \u201cbar[ring] treatment when sought \u2018for the pur-\npose of\u200a\u2019 inducing physiological changes, like secondary \nsex characteristics, that are \u2018inconsistent with\u2019 how so-\nciety expects boys and girls to appear.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)).   \n \nJudge White concluded that SB1 cannot withstand \nheightened scrutiny because its \u201ctext[] effectively re-\nveal[s] that [its] purpose is to force boys and girls to \nlook and live like boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a.  Nor, \nin her view, did respondents refute the district court\u2019s \n\u201crobust factual findings\u201d showing \u201cthat banning these \ntreatments is [not] beneficial to minors.\u201d  Ibid.  And she \n\n15 \n \nwarned that minor plaintiffs face irreparable harm ab-\nsent an injunction \u201cbecause progressing through ado-\nlescence untreated leads to daily anguish and makes \nadult treatment more complicated.\u201d  Id. at 98a.   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny twice over:  It \nexplicitly classifies based on sex and it discriminates \nbased on transgender status.  Indeed, one of its de-\nclared purposes is to enforce gender conformity and dis-\ncourage adolescents from identifying as transgender.  \nThe Sixth Circuit erred in holding that such a law is sub-\nject to no greater scrutiny than mundane economic reg-\nulation. \nA. This Court has consistently held that all sex-\nbased classifications are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes about how men and women should look or act.  \nHeightened scrutiny allows States to draw sex-based \nlines when necessary to serve important interests, but \nit guards against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment poli-\ncies that professedly are based on reasonable consider-\nations in fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and over-\nbroad\u2019 generalizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Ala-\nbama, 511 U.S. 127, 135 (1994) (citation omitted).   \nBy its terms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments \nintended to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a \npurported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \nto treat \u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d \n\u2014while permitting the exact same treatments when \nprescribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Put simply, an adolescent assigned \nfemale at birth cannot receive puberty blockers or tes-\ntosterone to live as a male, but an adolescent assigned \n\n16 \n \nmale at birth can.  And that focus on sex and gender \nconformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \nThat is sex discrimination. \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit contradicted \nthis Court\u2019s precedent and fundamentally misunder-\nstood the role of heightened scrutiny.  Most strikingly, \nthe Sixth Circuit asserted the authority to dispense with \nheightened scrutiny altogether for sex-based classifica-\ntions it deemed benign or justified.  But heightened \nscrutiny applies even when a legislature asserts that it \nhad good reason to classify based on sex; indeed, the \nwhole point of the inquiry is to give courts a principled \nyardstick for measuring such justifications.  The Sixth \nCircuit seriously erred in refusing to apply heightened \nscrutiny based on considerations that are relevant only \nin determining whether a sex-based classification with-\nstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require.   \nB. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus by restricting care only for transgender individuals \nbased on an avowed interest in discouraging adoles-\ncents from identifying as transgender.  Such discrimi-\nnation independently warrants heightened scrutiny be-\ncause transgender individuals satisfy all of the hall-\nmarks of a quasi-suspect class:  Transgender individu-\nals have historically been and continue to be subject to \ndiscrimination; transgender status bears no relation to \na person\u2019s ability to contribute to society; transgender \nindividuals are a discrete and identifiable minority; and \ntransgender individuals have not been able to meaning-\nfully vindicate their rights through the political process \nin much of the country\u2014as evidenced by the recent \n\n17 \n \nwave of laws targeting transgender individuals in Ten-\nnessee and other States.  \nII. Because the Sixth Circuit held that SB1 was sub-\nject only to rational-basis review, it never asked wheth-\ner SB1 could survive heightened scrutiny.  This Court \nshould adhere to its usual practice and remand to allow \nthe Sixth Circuit to address that record-intensive ques-\ntion in the first instance.  But if the Court considers the \nissue, it should hold that SB1 cannot survive heightened \nscrutiny.  Although heightened scrutiny certainly does \nnot foreclose regulation of gender-affirming care, SB1\u2019s \ncategorical ban is not substantially related to an im-\nportant government interest.   \nSB1 has two declared purposes.  One is to encourage \nminors to \u201cappreciate their sex\u201d by prohibiting treat-\nments \u201cthat might encourage minors to become disdain-\nful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nother is \u201cto protect the health and welfare of minors,\u201d \nid. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting medical treatments \nthat carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  SB1 is \na near-perfect fit for the first interest\u2014i.e., for a legis-\nlature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might encourage \nminors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  But the State has never tried to argue that an \ninterest in discouraging people from identifying as \ntransgender or encouraging them to present consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth is an important govern-\nmental objective.  For good reason:  This Court has rec-\nognized that a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cste-\nreotypic notions\u201d about gender is itself \u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982).    \nThe State thus must justify SB1 based on its other \nasserted interest\u2014protecting the health and welfare of \n\n18 \n \nadolescents.  But as a medical regulation, SB1 suffers \nfrom glaring defects:  The legislature ignored the bene-\nfits of gender-affirming care, substantially overstated \nthe risks of that care, and adopted a categorical prohi-\nbition that is both severely overinclusive and severely \nunderinclusive when viewed in light of those risks.  Ten-\nnessee\u2019s invocation of health and welfare thus cannot \njustify its complete ban on medical treatments that of-\nfer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nARGUMENT \nIn the past three years, 22 States have enacted laws \nthat categorically prohibit transgender adolescents \nfrom receiving evidence-based medical care to treat \ngender dysphoria\u2014while imposing no restrictions when \nthe same treatments are provided for any other pur-\npose.  By their terms, operation, and design, those laws \nclassify based on sex and discriminate against trans-\ngender individuals.  And the laws are inflicting profound \nharms on transgender adolescents and their families by \ndenying medical treatments that the affected adoles-\ncents, their parents, their doctors, and medical experts \nhave all concluded are appropriate and necessary to \ntreat a serious medical condition. \nThe Sixth Circuit did not suggest that SB1 could sur-\nvive heightened scrutiny.  Instead, it held that some \nsex-based lines do not trigger heightened scrutiny at \nall\u2014and that laws discriminating based on transgender \nstatus never warrant anything more than rational-basis \nreview.  Those holdings are wrong.  And those errors \nresulted in the court applying the most deferential \nstandard in constitutional law to a statute premised on \na State\u2019s declared \u201cinterest in encouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  \n\n19 \n \nNo one doubts that States have a compelling interest \nin protecting minors and ample authority to regulate \nthe practice of medicine.  So long as a State does not \nlegislate based on sex or transgender status, its regula-\ntions receive only deferential rational-basis review.  \nAnd even when a State draws lines based on sex or \ntransgender status, intermediate scrutiny leaves room \nfor appropriately tailored regulations.  But SB1\u2019s cate-\ngorical ban on a widely accepted treatment for a serious \nmedical condition cannot survive the more searching re-\nview that this Court\u2019s precedents demand. \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nSB1 warrants heightened scrutiny both because it \nrelies on sex-based classifications and because it dis-\ncriminates based on transgender status.   \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \nThis Court has repeatedly held that all laws that \nclassify based on sex are subject to heightened scrutiny \nbecause such classifications too often reflect stereo-\ntypes or overbroad generalizations about men and \nwomen.  SB1 is just such a law:  It draws explicit sex-\nbased lines, and it does so in service of a declared state \ninterest in ensuring that adolescents live in accordance \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit\u2019s con-\ntrary conclusion contradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  \n1. SB1 relies on sex-based classifications \na. The Equal Protection Clause provides that a \nState may not \u201cdeny to any person within its jurisdic-\ntion the equal protection of the laws.\u201d  U.S. Const. \nAmend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Although the ratification of the Four-\nteenth Amendment wrote that enduring principle of \nequality into the Constitution, it did not immediately \n\n20 \n \nend our Nation\u2019s \u201clong and unfortunate history of sex \ndiscrimination.\u201d  J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 U.S. 127, 136 \n(1994) (citation omitted).  To the contrary, laws discrim-\ninating based on sex remained common into the 20th \ncentury, and until the 1970s this Court reviewed sex-\nbased classifications deferentially.  See United States v. \nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 531-532 (1996) (VMI\u200a).   \nBut in 1971, \u201cfor the first time in our Nation\u2019s his-\ntory, this Court ruled in favor of a woman who com-\nplained that her State had denied her the equal protec-\ntion of its laws.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 532; see Reed v. Reed, \n404 U.S. 71, 73 (1971).  And just a few years later, the \nCourt \u201cannounced that \u2018[t]o withstand constitutional \nchallenge,  . . .  classifications by gender must serve im-\nportant governmental objectives and must be substan-\ntially related to achievement of those objectives.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nVMI, 518 U.S. at 558 (Rehnquist, C.J., concurring in the \njudgment) (quoting Craig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197 \n(1976)).  This Court has \u201cadhered to that standard of \nscrutiny ever since.\u201d  Ibid. (collecting cases).  It is thus \nfirmly established that courts must apply \u201ca heightened \nstandard of review\u201d to \u201c[l]egislative classifications \nbased on gender.\u201d  City of Cleburne v. Cleburne Living \nCtr., Inc., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985).   \nThis Court has explained that sex-based classifica-\ntions warrant heightened scrutiny because sex \u201cgener-\nally provides no sensible ground for differential treat-\nment,\u201d City of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 440, and because \nsex-based lines all too often reflect stereotypes or \n\u201coverbroad generalizations about the different talents, \ncapacities, or preferences of males and females,\u201d VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  In the centuries before Craig, \u201cthe law-\nbooks of our Nation were rife with overbroad generali-\nzations about the way men and women are.\u201d  Sessions \n\n21 \n \nv. Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. 47, 57, (2017).  Such gen-\neralizations, \u201cdescriptive though they may be of the way \nmany people still order their lives,\u201d \u201chave a constrain-\ning impact,\u201d id. at 63\u2014an impact that can be particu-\nlarly harmful to individuals who fall \u201coutside the aver-\nage description,\u201d VMI, 518 U.S. at 550.  Accordingly, \u201call \ngender-based classifications\u201d must satisfy \u201cheightened \nscrutiny.\u201d  Id. at 555 (citation omitted); accord Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. at 57. \nb. SB1 classifies based on sex, through and through.  \nMost obviously, the law \u201ccreates a sex-based classifica-\ntion on its face\u201d by defining the prohibited medical care \nbased on the patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  Pet. App. \n164a.  Specifically, SB1 bans puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014those treatments are pro-\nvided \u201cfor the purpose\u200a\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \n\u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with \nthe minor\u2019s sex\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender identity.  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Because SB1\u2019s prohibitions \n\u201ccannot be stated without referencing sex,\u201d they are \u201cin-\nherently based upon a sex-classification.\u201d  Whitaker v. \nKenosha Unified Sch. Dist. No. 1 Bd. of Educ., 858 F.3d \n1034, 1051 (7th Cir. 2017), cert. dismissed, 583 U.S. 1165 \n(2018). \n \nIn operation, as mandated by its text, SB1 restricts \ncare only when it would induce physiological effects in-\nconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  An \nadolescent assigned female at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live and present as a \nmale, but an adolescent assigned male at birth can.  See \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a) and (b).  And vice versa, \nan adolescent assigned male at birth cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or estrogen to live and present as a \n\n22 \n \nfemale, but an adolescent assigned female at birth can.  \nSee ibid.; Pet. App. 165a.   \n \nThat is sex discrimination.  As this Court has ex-\nplained, when a law or policy \u201cpenalizes a person iden-\ntified as male at birth for traits or actions that it toler-\nates in [a person] identified as female at birth,\u201d the per-\nson\u2019s \u201csex plays an unmistakable\u201d role.  Bostock v. Clay-\nton County, 590 U.S. 644, 660 (2020).  And because hold-\ning other things constant but \u201cchanging the [minor]\u2019s sex  \n* * *  yield[s] a different\u201d outcome, id. at 659\u2014that is, \n\u201c[b]ecause [a] minor\u2019s sex at birth determines whether \nor not the minor can receive certain types of medical \ncare\u201d\u2014a ban on gender-affirming care necessarily \u201cdis-\ncriminates on the basis of sex.\u201d  Brandt v. Rutledge, 47 \nF.4th 661, 669 (8th Cir. 2022).  Put differently, there is \nno way to determine whether these treatments must be \nwithheld from any particular minor \u201cwithout consider-\ning [the minor\u2019s] sex.\u201d  Bostock, 590 U.S. at 668. \nThat sex-based line-drawing is not an incidental ef-\nfect of SB1\u2014it is the law\u2019s very purpose.  By its own \naccount, SB1 is designed to enforce conformity with sex \nassigned at birth.  The statutory findings candidly de-\nclare that Tennessee has a \u201ccompelling interest in en-\ncouraging minors to appreciate their sex\u201d and in prohib-\niting medical care \u201cthat might encourage minors to be-\ncome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(m).  And SB1 bars medical treatments only when \nsought \u201cfor the purpose of\u200a\u201d inducing physiological \nchanges, like secondary sex characteristics, that are \n\u201cinconsistent with\u201d how society expects boys and girls \nto appear.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).   \nIndeed, SB1 specifically excludes medical interven-\ntions for those with a \u201cdisorder of sex development,\u201d \nmeaning \u201ca physical or chemical abnormality present in \n\n23 \n \na minor that is inconsistent with the normal develop-\nment of a human being of the minor\u2019s sex\u201d (sometimes \ncalled an intersex condition).  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7\u00a7 68-\n33-102(1), 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).  In other words, SB1 ex-\npressly permits the very same medical interventions \nwhen provided to assist minors in physically conform-\ning to their sex assigned at birth.  For example, hy-\npogonadotropic hypogonadism (the inability to produce \nsex hormones) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with estrogen to bring on female pu-\nberty, Pet. App. 266a, and complete androgen insensi-\ntivity (a condition that prevents the body from respond-\ning to androgen) in patients assigned female at birth is \ncommonly treated with hormone replacement therapy, \nJ.A. 131.   \n\u201cFor close to a half century,\u201d the Court has \u201cviewed \nwith suspicion laws that rely on \u2018overbroad generaliza-\ntions about the different talents, capacities, or prefer-\nences of males and females.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 62 (citation omitted).  SB1 shares that same de-\nsign:  It seeks to enforce conformity with characteristics \nthat are \u201ctypically male or typically female.\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 541.  Indeed, its \u201ctext[] effectively reveal[s] that \n[its] purpose is to force boys and girls to look and live \nlike boys and girls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissent-\ning).  SB1 is thus subject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. The Sixth Circuit failed to justify its contrary hold-\ning \n \nThe Sixth Circuit failed to justify its refusal to apply \nheightened scrutiny.  Indeed, the court\u2019s shifting ra-\ntionales underscore its departure from the fundamental \nequal-protection principles reflected in this Court\u2019s prec-\nedents. \n\n24 \n \na. The Sixth Circuit at times appeared to deny that \nSB1 relies on sex-based classifications, asserting that \nthe law regulates \u201cevenhandedly\u201d by prohibiting \u201csex-\ntransition treatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  \nPet. App. 31a-32a.  But whether a treatment is a prohib-\nited \u201csex-transition treatment\u201d for any given individual \ndepends, of course, on the individual\u2019s sex assigned at \nbirth.  See pp. 21-23, supra.  Prescribing estrogen to a \nminor identified at birth as female is permitted\u2014but \nprescribing the same hormone to a minor identified at \nbirth as male is a prohibited \u201csex-transition treatment.\u201d   \nAnd this Court has rejected the argument that a law \nthat classifies based on a protected characteristic such \nas race or sex is insulated from heightened review \nsimply because it applies to members of all races or to \nboth sexes.  \u201cIt is axiomatic,\u201d for example, \u201cthat racial \nclassifications do not become legitimate on the assump-\ntion that all persons suffer them in equal degree.\u201d  Pow-\ners v. Ohio, 499 U.S. 400, 410 (1991); see Flowers v. Mis-\nsissippi, 588 U.S. 284, 299 (2019). \nThe Sixth Circuit recognized that race-based classi-\nfications trigger strict scrutiny \u201ceven when they may be \nsaid to burden or benefit the races equally.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (citation omitted).  And the court acknowledged this \nCourt\u2019s admonition \u201cthat \u2018all\u2019 sex-based classifications \nreceive heightened review.\u201d  Id. at 38a (quoting VMI, \n518 U.S. at 555).  But the Sixth Circuit nonetheless \nmaintained that sex-based lines do not invariably war-\nrant heightened scrutiny, asserting that this Court\u2019s de-\ncisions \u201cshow only that the government cannot classify \nindividuals by sex when doing so perpetuates invidious \nstereotypes or unfairly allocates benefits and burdens.\u201d  \nId. at 39a.  The Sixth Circuit thus held that sex-based \nclassifications that reflect \u201c\u200a\u2018enduring\u2019 differences \n\n25 \n \nbetween men and women do not trigger heightened re-\nview.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 533). \nThe Sixth Circuit\u2019s assertion that courts can dis-\npense with heightened scrutiny for an ill-defined set of \nsex-based classifications they regard as benign directly \ncontradicts this Court\u2019s precedent.  The Court has re-\npeatedly instructed that heightened scrutiny applies to \n\u201call\u201d sex-based classifications, not just some of them.  \nIndeed, the Court has applied heightened scrutiny to \nstatutes that classified in \u201cgender specific terms\u201d even \nwhen it ultimately upheld those sex-based classifica-\ntions as legitimate responses to \u201cbiological differ-\nence[s]\u201d between men and women.  Nguyen v. INS, 533 \nU.S. 53, 64 (2001); see id. at 60-61; see also, e.g., Miller \nv. Albright, 523 U.S. 420, 436, 444-445 (1998) (plurality \nopinion); Michael M. v. Superior Ct., 450 U.S. 464, 471-\n473 (1981) (plurality opinion). \nThe Sixth Circuit emphasized this Court\u2019s statement \nthat it has not \u201cequated gender classifications, for all \npurposes, to classifications based on race.\u201d  Pet. App. \n37a (quoting VMI, 518 U.S. at 532) (brackets omitted).  \nBut the VMI Court was simply noting that sex-based \nclassifications are subject to heightened scrutiny rather \nthan the strict scrutiny that applies to race-based clas-\nsifications.  See 518 U.S. at 532 n.6 (\u201cThe Court has thus \nfar reserved most stringent judicial scrutiny for classi-\nfications based on race or national origin.\u201d).  And the \nCourt has explained that a more forgiving standard ap-\nplies in this context precisely because \u201c[p]hysical differ-\nences between men and women\u201d may sometimes justify \nlegislative reliance on sex.  Id. at 533.  In other words, \nthe very purpose of heightened scrutiny is to identify \nthose sex-based classifications that reflect legitimate \nand appropriately tailored efforts to further important \n\n26 \n \nstate interests rather than reliance on stereotypes or \ngeneralizations.  Ibid.; see Nguyen, 533 U.S. at 60-70.  \nThe Sixth Circuit seriously erred in refusing to apply \nheightened scrutiny at all based on considerations that \nare instead relevant only to whether SB1 survives the \nscrutiny this Court\u2019s precedents require. \nb. The Sixth Circuit asserted that its approach was \nsupported by this Court\u2019s decisions holding that \u201cheight-\nened review does not apply in the context of laws that \nregulate medical procedures unique to one sex or the \nother.\u201d  Pet. App. 39a (citing Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s \nHealth Org., 597 U.S. 215, 236-237 (2022), and Geduldig \nv. Aiello, 417 U.S. 484, 496 n.20 (1974)); see id. at 33a-\n34a.  But SB1 fundamentally differs from the laws at \nissue in those cases because it regulates medical treat-\nments that all individuals can receive, regardless of \ntheir sex:  Healthcare providers can \u201c[p]rescrib[e], ad-\nminister[], or dispens[e]  * * *  puberty blocker[s] or \nhormone[s]\u201d to any person regardless of the person\u2019s \nsex assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).   \nThe Sixth Circuit suggested that prescribing those \ntreatments for gender dysphoria is not the same as pre-\nscribing them for any other condition because the \u201ccost-\nbenefit analysis,\u201d Pet. App. 34a\u2014or \u201crisk-reward as-\nsessment,\u201d id. at 37a\u2014differs.  But once again, that \n\u201cconflates the classifications drawn by the law with the \nstate\u2019s justification for it.\u201d  Brandt, 47 F.4th at 670.  The \nstrength of the State\u2019s justification\u2014including the risks \nand benefits of gender-affirming care\u2014may be highly \nrelevant to determining whether SB1 survives height-\nened scrutiny.  See pp. 34-49, infra.  But it provides no \nbasis for refusing to subject the law\u2019s facially sex-based \nclassification to heightened scrutiny at all. \n\n27 \n \nRelatedly, the Sixth Circuit posited that SB1 classi-\nfies based only on \u201cmedical condition,\u201d not sex.  Pet. \nApp. 31a.  SB1\u2019s plain text shows otherwise.  Again, \nSB1\u2019s declared goals include \u201cencouraging minors to \nappreciate their sex\u201d and banning treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  SB1 achieves \nthat goal by drawing sex-based lines, prohibiting the \ncovered treatments if they are provided \u201cfor the pur-\npose of\u201d inducing physiological changes \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1)(A).  Refram-\ning SB1 as a ban on certain treatments for gender dys-\nphoria does not eliminate the sex-based classifications \ninherent in its terms and operation.  See pp. 21-23, supra.   \nc. Finally, the Sixth Circuit held that Bostock is in-\napposite because the \u201ctext-driven reasoning\u201d in that de-\ncision \u201capplies only to Title VII.\u201d  Pet. App. 40a.  Of \ncourse, \u201cTitle VII and the Equal Protection Clause are \nnot identical.\u201d  Id. at 79a (White, J., dissenting).  But \nthe Sixth Circuit did \u201cnot explain why or how any dif-\nference in language\u201d would \u201crequire[] different stand-\nards for determining whether a facial classification ex-\nists in the first instance,\u201d such that a restriction can \nsimultaneously be sex-based under Title VII yet sex-\nneutral under the Equal Protection Clause.  Id. at 80a.  \nThat inconsistency would make no sense\u2014as the \nFourth, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have already recog-\nnized in holding that Bostock\u2019s fundamental insight \nabout the nature of sex discrimination applies in the \nequal-protection context.  See Kadel v. Folwell, 100 \nF.4th 122, 153-154 (4th Cir. 2024) (en banc), petition for \ncert. pending, No. 24-90 (filed July 25, 2024), and petition \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-99 (filed July 26, 2024); Hecox \nv. Little, 104 F.4th 1061, 1080 (9th Cir. 2024), petition \n\n28 \n \nfor cert. pending, No. 24-38 (filed July 11, 2024); Fowler \nv. Stitt, 104 F.4th 770, 793-794 (10th Cir. 2024). \nIn Bostock, the Court considered Title VII\u2019s prohibi-\ntion on discrimination \u201cagainst any individual  * * *  be-\ncause of such individual\u2019s  * * *  sex.\u201d  590 U.S. at 655 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. 2000e-2(a)(1)).  In interpreting that \nlanguage, this Court explained that Title VII \u201cincorpo-\nrates the \u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 standard of but-for \ncausation.\u201d  Id. at 656 (citation omitted).  The Court con-\ncluded that \u201csex is necessarily a but-for cause\u201d of dis-\ncrimination on the basis of gender identity \u201cbecause it \nis impossible to discriminate against a person for being  \n* * *  transgender without discriminating against that in-\ndividual based on sex.\u201d  Id. at 660, 661 (emphasis omitted). \nSo too here.  As Bostock explained, if an employer \n\u201cfires a transgender person who was identified as a \nmale at birth\u201d because the employee \u201cnow identifies as \na female\u201d yet \u201ctolerate[s] the same trait\u201d in \u201can em-\nployee identified as female at birth,\u201d the employer has \nengaged in discrimination based on sex because it has \n\u201cintentionally penalize[d] a person identified as male at \nbirth for traits or actions that it tolerates in an em-\nployee identified as female at birth.\u201d  590 U.S. at 660.  \nExactly the same thing is true under the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause:  If, for example, a State prohibits an ado-\nlescent assigned female at birth from receiving testos-\nterone to live as a male, but allows an adolescent as-\nsigned male at birth to receive the same treatment, the \nState has relied on a sex-based classification\u2014and thus \nmust justify its law under heightened scrutiny. \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \nSB1 is also subject to heightened scrutiny because it \n\u201cexpressly \nand \nexclusively \ntargets\u201d \ntransgender  \n\n29 \n \nindividuals, who satisfy all of the hallmarks of a quasi-\nsuspect class.  Pet. App. 152a.  In determining whether \nto recognize a quasi-suspect class, this Court has con-\nsidered four factors:  (1) whether the class has histori-\ncally \u201cbeen subjected to discrimination,\u201d Lyng v. Cas-\ntillo, 477 U.S. 635, 638 (1986); (2) whether the class has \na defining characteristic that \u201cfrequently bears no rela-\ntion to [the] ability to perform or contribute to society,\u201d \nCity of Cleburne, 473 U.S. at 441 (citation omitted); \n(3) whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, immu-\ntable, or distinguishing characteristics that define them \nas a discrete group,\u201d Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638; and \n(4) whether the class lacks political power, see Bowen v. \nGilliard, 483 U.S. 587, 602 (1987).   \nTransgender individuals readily satisfy each of those \nrequirements.  First, it is undeniable that transgender \nindividuals, as a class, have \u201chistorically been subject to \ndiscrimination including in education, employment, \nhousing, and access to healthcare.\u201d  Pet. App. 159a (ci-\ntation omitted).  Second, whether individuals are trans-\ngender plainly bears no relation to their ability to con-\ntribute to society.  Id. at 160a.  Third, transgender indi-\nviduals are a minority accounting for roughly one per-\ncent of the population that shares \u201cobvious, immutable, \nor distinguishing characteristics that define them as a \ndiscrete group,\u201d Gilliard, 483 U.S. at 602 (citation omit-\nted):  their gender identities do not align with their re-\nspective sexes assigned at birth.  Pet. App. 160a.  Fi-\nnally, transgender individuals have not \u201cyet been able \nto meaningfully vindicate their rights through the polit-\nical process\u201d in much of the Nation.  Grimm v. Glouces-\nter Cnty. Sch. Bd., 972 F.3d 586, 613 (4th Cir. 2020), \ncert. denied, 141 S. Ct. 2878 (2021).  They are \u201cun-\nderrepresented in every branch of government.\u201d  Ibid.  \n\n30 \n \nAnd in recent years, States across the country have en-\nacted a host of laws targeting transgender individuals.  \nSee pp. 7-8 & nn. 3-4, supra.  Many courts have thus \nrecognized transgender status as a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification.  See Hecox, 104 F.4th at 1079; Grimm, 972 \nF.3d at 610 (collecting cases). \nIn holding otherwise, the Sixth Circuit appeared to \nrely primarily on its view that lower courts should not \nrecognize a quasi-suspect class that this Court had not \nalready recognized.  Pet. App. 44a.  Even if that view \nhad merit, it has no bearing on this Court\u2019s considera-\ntion of the issue.  The Sixth Circuit also asserted that \ntransgender status \u201cis not necessarily immutable.\u201d  Id. \nat 46a.  But even assuming that is correct, immutability \nis not required; it is sufficient that transgender individ-\nuals share \u201cdistinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group.\u201d  Lyng, 477 U.S. at 638.  \u201c[C]las-\nsifications based on alienage,\u201d for example, \u201care inher-\nently suspect\u201d even though alienage\u2014i.e., the status of \nbeing a noncitizen\u2014is not immutable.  Graham v. Rich-\nardson, 403 U.S. 365, 372 (1971).   \nThe Sixth Circuit further asserted that transgender \nindividuals are not subject to \u201ca skewed or unfair polit-\nical process.\u201d  Pet. App. 46a.  But the fact that the posi-\ntion of some transgender individuals in society \u201chas im-\nproved markedly in recent decades,\u201d Frontiero v. Rich-\nardson, 411 U.S. 677, 685 (1973) (plurality opinion), does \nnot suggest that transgender individuals as a class \nwield political power; the same was true of women when \nthis Court recognized that sex-based classifications are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny.  Id. at 685-686.  And the \nrecent wave of legislation targeting transgender indi-\nviduals across different areas of life decisively refutes \n\n31 \n \nany suggestion that they have no need for the protection \nof the courts. \n* * * * * \nIt is worth underscoring the implications of the Sixth \nCircuit\u2019s holding that laws like SB1 receive only the \nmost deferential review.  Most immediately, SB1 pro-\nhibits transgender adolescents, their parents, and their \ndoctors from making critically important and intensely \npersonal decisions about the appropriate medical treat-\nment for what everyone agrees is a serious medical con-\ndition.  For many parents, questions about how best to \nraise transgender adolescents\u2014including whether and \nhow to take steps to enable them to live in accordance \nwith their gender identity\u2014are extraordinarily chal-\nlenging.  John Doe\u2019s mother put the point in plain \nterms:  \u201cThis is what I think many people don\u2019t under-\nstand:  no parent would choose to make their child dif-\nferent, or choose a harder path in life for their child.\u201d  \nJ.A. 95.  \u201cAs parents, we\u2019re supposed to pave the path \nso that our children\u2019s lives can be easier and better.\u201d  \nIbid.  For parents of transgender children, however, \nthere is no \u201ceasy\u201d path in \u201ca world full of hostility to-\nwards transgender people.\u201d  Ibid.  So \u201cyou don\u2019t put \nyourself and your child through this unless you know it \nis the right thing to do\u201d\u2014the necessary action to keep \nyour child \u201chappy,\u201d \u201chealthy,\u201d and \u201csafe[].\u201d  J.A.  94-96.  \nSB1 prevents parents from making that deeply per-\nsonal and consequential choice by drawing explicit sex-\nbased lines\u2014yet the Sixth Circuit held that it is subject \nto no more scrutiny than run-of-the-mill economic reg-\nulations. \nNor are the consequences of the Sixth Circuit\u2019s deci-\nsion limited to this particular context.  The necessary \nimplication of the court\u2019s holding that SB1\u2019s sex-based \n\n32 \n \nline-drawing does not trigger heightened scrutiny is \nthat a law categorically banning gender-affirming care \nfor adults would likewise receive only rational-basis re-\nview.  The same would be true for any number of laws \nthat a State might enact to further an asserted interest \nin encouraging individuals to \u201cappreciate their sex,\u201d \nTenn Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m)\u2014including laws requir-\ning transgender adolescents or adults to identify, dress, \nor otherwise present themselves in a manner consistent \nwith their sex assigned at birth.  The Sixth Circuit pro-\nfoundly erred in holding that such laws are subject to \nno greater judicial scrutiny than a law banning com-\npounded milk, regulating optometrists, or expelling \nhotdog pushcarts from New Orleans\u2019 French Quarter.     \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nTo satisfy heightened scrutiny, Tennessee must \nshow that SB1 serves \u201cimportant governmental objec-\ntives,\u201d and that \u201cthe discriminatory means employed\u201d is \n\u201csubstantially related to the achievement of those ob-\njectives.\u201d  VMI, 518 U.S. at 533 (citation omitted).  The \nState\u2019s justification \u201cmust be genuine, not hypothesized \nor invented post hoc in response to litigation.\u201d  Ibid.   \nThe Sixth Circuit never considered whether the \nState had carried that burden because it concluded that \nSB1 was subject only to rational-basis review.  Because \nthis Court is \u201ca court of review, not of first view,\u201d its \ntypical practice in such a case is to remand to allow the \nlower courts to apply the correct legal standard in the \nfirst instance.  Moody v. NetChoice, LLC, 144 S. Ct. \n2383, 2399 (2024) (citation omitted).  That usual course \nis especially appropriate here, where the record evi-\ndence is extensive, disputed, and technically complex. \n \nIf, however, this Court considers the issue, it should \nhold that a categorical ban like SB1 cannot survive \n\n33 \n \nheightened scrutiny, as every other court to consider \nthe question has recognized.  Pet. App. 181a-205a.7  \nHeightened \nscrutiny \n\u201cdoes \nnot \nmake \nsex\u201d\u2014or \ntransgender status\u2014\u201ca proscribed classification.\u201d  VMI, \n518 U.S. at 533.  And a decision holding that SB1 is in-\nvalid would not foreclose other, more tailored regula-\ntions of the use of puberty blockers or hormone therapy \nto treat gender dysphoria.  But Tennessee has failed to \njustify its categorical ban on medical treatments that \noffer critical benefits to adolescents and their families. \nA. Tennessee\u2019s Interest In Discouraging Minors From Be-\ncoming \u201cDisdainful Of Their Sex\u201d Cannot Justify SB1 \nSB1 declares that it has two distinct purposes.  One \nis to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d by \nprohibiting treatments \u201cthat might encourage minors  \nto become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The other is \u201cto protect the health and \nwelfare of minors,\u201d id. \u00a7 68-33-101(a), by prohibiting \nmedical procedures that carry \u201crisks and harms,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(d); see id. at 68-33-101(b)-(e).   \nSB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the first interest\u2014\nbut the State has never tried to argue that an interest \nin discouraging people from being transgender or en-\ncouraging them to present as their sex assigned at birth \nis an \u201cimportant governmental objective[].\u201d  VMI, 518 \nU.S. at 533; see Pet. App. 193a n.52.  Nor could the State \nmake that showing, because this Court has recognized \nthat a \u201cstatutory objective\u201d that rests on \u201cstereotypic \nnotions\u201d \nabout \ngender \nis \nitself \n\u201cillegitimate.\u201d  \n \n7 See Pet. 28 & n.7 (collecting cases); see also Doe v. Ladapo, No. \n23-cv-114, 2024 WL 2947123, at *28, *39 (N.D. Fla. June 11, 2024), \nappeal pending, No. 24-11996 (11th Cir. filed June 18, 2024), and ap-\npeal pending, No. 24-12100 (11th Cir. filed June 27, 2024). \n\n34 \n \nMississippi Univ. for Women v. Hogan, 458 U.S. 718, \n725 (1982); accord, e.g., VMI, 518 U.S. at 533; see pp. 19-\n21, supra.  A law aimed at encouraging \u201cboys and girls \nto look and live like boys and girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a \n(White, J., dissenting), rests on just such notions.  Alt-\nhough most people live their lives physically conform-\ning to the usual expectations for their sex assigned at \nbirth, some\u2014including people who are transgender\u2014\ndo not.  Measures aimed at enforcing such conformity \nthus necessarily rest on \u201coverbroad generalizations about \nthe way men and women are.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 \nU.S. at 57.   \nBecause one of SB1\u2019s two declared objectives is ille-\ngitimate, the State must justify SB1 based on its as-\nserted interest in protecting the health and safety of ad-\nolescents.  The State cannot do so.  The State ignored \nthe benefits of gender-affirming care, exaggerated the \nrisks of that care, and adopted a sweeping categorical \nban that it made no attempt to tailor to its asserted in-\nterest in protecting transgender adolescents\u2019 health.   \nAll of those features of SB1 make perfect sense for a \nlegislature seeking to ban treatments \u201cthat might en-\ncourage minors to become disdainful of their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  But they are fatal to \nany argument that the law is substantially related to the \nState\u2019s asserted interest in protecting adolescent \nhealth. \nB. SB1 Ignores The Benefits Of Gender-Affirming Care \n\u201cFew if any drugs are completely safe in the sense \nthat they may be taken by all persons in all circum-\nstances without risk.\u201d  United States v. Rutherford, 442 \nU.S. 544, 555 (1979).  States that regulate medicine in \norder to protect their citizens\u2019 health and safety thus \nnecessarily consider not just the risks associated with a \n\n35 \n \ngiven treatment, but also the benefits.  And that princi-\nple applies with special force where, as here, the medi-\ncal community and the nation\u2019s leading hospitals over-\nwhelmingly agree that the relevant care is necessary in \nappropriate cases.  But Tennessee largely ignored the \nevidence demonstrating the medical benefits of gender-\naffirming care in enacting SB1.  And the State\u2019s litiga-\ntion efforts to plug that gap in the legislative record by \nminimizing the benefits of gender-affirming care are \nunpersuasive.  \n1. Tennessee failed to meaningfully consider the medi-\ncal benefits associated with the banned treatments \nSB1 purports to be premised on the \u201crisks and \nharms\u201d associated with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(d).  As explained \nmore fully below\u2014and as the district court found\u2014\nthose risks were exaggerated by Tennessee\u2019s experts, \ncan be mitigated, and in any event are comparable to \nthe risks associated with permitted uses of these treat-\nments and a wide range of other pediatric treatments.  \nSee pp. 41-49, infra.  Notably absent from the Tennes-\nsee legislature\u2019s findings, however, was any meaningful \nconsideration of any of the medical benefits associated \nwith gender-affirming care.  That silence is striking.  As \nthe district court found, \u201cevery major medical organiza-\ntion to take a position on the issue,\u201d including the Amer-\nican Academy of Pediatrics and the American Medical \nAssociation, \u201cagrees that puberty blockers and cross-\nsex hormone therapy are appropriate and medically \nnecessary treatments for adolescents when clinically in-\ndicated.\u201d  Pet. App. 198a.  And the Nation\u2019s leading chil-\ndren\u2019s hospitals have centers that provide such care in \nappropriate cases.  See p. 6 & n.2, supra.   \n\n36 \n \n \nOf course, state legislatures are not bound to follow \nthe views of the medical community uncritically.  But \nhere, Tennessee rejected the medical consensus without \nengaging with the basis for that consensus or attempt-\ning to conduct its own weighing of the perceived risks \nagainst the countervailing benefits.  Instead, the law \nmisrepresents the state of medical opinion, asserting \nwithout citation that the prohibited treatments \u201care not \nconsistent with professional medical standards.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(c).  \n2. Extensive studies and clinical experience establish \nthat treatment with puberty blockers and hormone \ntherapy has critical benefits in appropriate cases \n \nTennessee\u2019s approach is all the more problematic be-\ncause the medical consensus is grounded in a wealth of \nstudies and clinical experience demonstrating that pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy have critical bene-\nfits for adolescents in need of such care.  As the district \ncourt determined in detailed findings reviewable only \nfor clear error, \u201cthe benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established by the existing rec-\nord.\u201d  Pet. App. 197a; see Brnovich v. Democratic Nat\u2019l \nComm., 594 U.S. 647, 687 (2021).  \n \na. Most urgently, gender dysphoria is associated \nwith strikingly high risks of suicide.  A survey of more \nthan 2,800 transgender high school students, for exam-\nple, found that 34.6% reported attempting suicide in the \nlast 12 months.  See p. 3 & n.1, supra.  For parents of \nadolescents suffering from gender dysphoria, that risk \nis \u201cterrif[ying].\u201d  Pet. App. 245a.  To take just one fam-\nily\u2019s experience, before Ryan received appropriate care, \nhis mother was frightened by \u201chow much Ryan was suf-\nfering,\u201d including by \u201cengag[ing] in self-harm.\u201d  Id. at \n\n37 \n \n242a.  And she is \u201cworr[ied] about his ability to survive\u201d \nabsent care.  Id. at 246a.    \nCritically, as the district court found, Pet. App. 196a, \nthe available data show that treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality among individuals suffering from \ngender dysphoria.  See, e.g., id. at 264a, 290a & n.14, \n293a (collecting studies); J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5-8, 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12 (same).  For example, a 2020 study \u201cpub-\nlished in Pediatrics, the official journal of the American \nAcademy of Pediatrics,\u201d concluded that \u201c[t]reatment \nwith pubertal suppression  * * *  was associated with \nlower odds of lifetime suicidal ideation.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a, \n264a (brackets omitted).  Studies focused on the effects \nof hormone therapy show similar results.  J.A. 145-146 \n& nn. 9-12.     \n \nThe district court also found that \u201c[t]he weight of ev-\nidence in the record suggests\u201d that \u201ctreatment for gen-\nder dysphoria lowers rates of depression\u201d and \u201caddi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a.  \u201cStudies have repeatedly doc-\numented that puberty-delaying medication and gender \naffirming hormone therapy are associated with mental \nhealth benefits in both the short and long term.\u201d  Id. at \n290a; see id. at 290a n.14 (citing studies).  Among other \nthings, \u201c[p]eer-reviewed cross-sectional and longitudi-\nnal studies have found that pubertal suppression is as-\nsociated with a range of improved mental health out-\ncomes for adolescents with gender dysphoria,\u201d includ-\ning \u201cstatistically significant improvements\u201d in anxiety, \ndepression, disruptive behaviors, and global function-\ning.  J.A. 143-144 & nn. 5, 7-8 (collecting studies).  Stud-\nies focused on the effects of hormone therapy likewise \nshow \u201cimproved mental health outcomes,\u201d including \n\n38 \n \nwith respect to anxiety and depression, for adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria.  J.A. 145-146 & nn. 9-11.  \n \nClinical experience bears that out.  See Pet. App. \n194a-197a.  One expert clinician, for example, explained \nthat puberty blockers \u201ccompletely resolved\u201d suicidal \nideation for many of his patients and that hormone ther-\napy rendered psychiatric medications \u201cno longer neces-\nsary\u201d for others.  Id. at 294a.  Because of such mental \nhealth improvements, \u201cschool performance often im-\nproves as well.\u201d  J.A. 966.  The plaintiffs\u2019 own experi-\nences further reinforce the point.  Ryan Roe says that \naccess to such care \u201cgave [him] hope and a positive out-\nlook on the world that [he] had lost.\u201d  Pet. App. 237a.  \nAnd L.W.\u2019s mother says that \u201cthere [would] be devas-\ntating harm to L.W.\u2019s mental health from the loss of ac-\ncess to her medication and healthcare.\u201d  J.A. 85.  \n \nFinally, treatment with puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy \u201ccan eliminate or reduce the need for\u201d \nmore invasive procedures, including \u201csurgical treat-\nment\u201d later in life.  Pet. App. 263a.  As discussed below, \nsee pp. 40-41, infra, the evidence shows that individuals \nwho experience sustained gender dysphoria as adoles-\ncents are highly likely to persist in their transgender \nidentity in adulthood.  For such individuals, postponing \ngender-affirming care will likely be more painful, more \ncostly, and less effective\u2014and the individual will suffer \ncontinued distress from gender dysphoria all the while.  \nAs a leading pediatric endocrinologist explains, \u201c[d]eny-\ning pubertal suppression treatment and gender-affirm-\ning hormones to a transgender adolescent who needs \nthe treatment will not cause the adolescent to stop be-\ning transgender\u201d\u2014but it will cause the adolescent \u201cto \nexperience distress\u201d in the meantime.  Pet. App. 270a.  \nL.W.\u2019s mother warned, for example, that loss of access \n\n39 \n \nto gender-affirming care would cause \u201cirreversible phys-\nical harm as [L.W.] would experience a puberty com-\npletely foreign to her and inconsistent with her gender.\u201d  \nJ.A. 85-86.     \nb.  As the district court found, Tennessee\u2019s various \nlitigation efforts to undermine that body of evidence are \nunpersuasive.   \nTennessee principally criticizes as \u201clow quality\u201d the \nmany studies, including long-term observational stud-\nies, supporting the use of puberty blockers and hor-\nmone therapy to treat gender dysphoria.  E.g., Br. in \nOpp. 9-10, 36 (citations omitted).  But all observational \nstudies\u2014as contrasted with randomized or placebo-\ncontrolled studies\u2014are generally labeled \u201clow quality\u201d \nunder the relevant nomenclature.  J.A. 110-114.  Yet it \nis \u201ccommonplace\u201d for clinical care to be provided based \non such evidence\u2014particularly in the pediatric context.  \nPet. App. 180a (citation omitted).  Indeed, because of \n\u201cthe low prevalence of childhood disease,\u201d the \u201csmall \nmarket share for therapeutic agents in children,\u201d low \nfunding levels, and challenges enrolling minors in re-\nsearch, \u201c[r]ecommendations for pediatric care made by \nprofessional associations in guidelines are seldom \nbased\u201d on \u201crandomized controlled trials.\u201d  J.A. 113-114.  \nFor example, less than one percent of the American \nHeart Association\u2019s pediatric guidelines were based on \nrandomized clinical trials.  J.A. 114.  And the Food and \nDrug Administration (FDA) approved the use of pu-\nberty blockers to treat precocious puberty based on ob-\nservational studies\u2014not randomized trials.  J.A. 981.   \nTennessee emphasizes that the FDA has not ap-\nproved puberty blockers or hormones specifically to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Pet. App. \n27a.  But \u201conce the FDA approves a drug, healthcare \n\n40 \n \nproviders generally may prescribe the drug for an un-\napproved use when they judge that it is medically ap-\npropriate for their patient.\u201d  FDA, Understanding Un-\napproved Use of Approved Drugs \u201cOff Label\u201d (Feb. 5, \n2018), https://perma.cc/A9DG-ML23.  The FDA does \nnot sua sponte approve additional uses of drugs ap-\nproved for other indications, and drug sponsors may \nchoose not to incur the time and expense of seeking such \napproval for any number of reasons.  Accordingly, as \nthe district court found, \u201coff-label\u201d use of approved \ndrugs \u201cis common in medicine generally and particu-\nlarly in pediatrics.\u201d  Pet. App. 202a (citation omitted).  \nAs especially pertinent here, that includes off-label use \nof both puberty blockers and hormones to treat condi-\ntions other than gender dysphoria.  See, e.g., Carla M. \nLopez et al., Trends in the \u201cOff-Label\u201d Use of GnRH Ag-\nonists Among Pediatric Patients in the United States, 57 \nClinical Pediatrics 1432, 1434-1435 (2018) (discussing off-\nlabel use of puberty blockers to treat children with short \nstature and adolescents diagnosed with certain can-\ncers); Rodolfo A. Rey, Recent advancement in the treat-\nment of boys and adolescents with hypogonadism, 13 \nTherapeutic Advances in Endocrinology & Metabolism 1, \n7, 9 (2022) (discussing off-label use of certain testosterone \ntreatments to treat hypogonadism and infants suffering \nfrom microphallus); Andrea Cignarella et al., Pharma-\ncological Approaches to Controlling Cardiometabolic \nRisk in Women with PCOS, 21 Int\u2019l J. of Molecular Sci-\nences 3-7 (2020) (discussing off-label use of anti-andro-\ngen drugs to treat females with polycystic ovary syn-\ndrome). \nUltimately, Tennessee dismisses the demonstrated \nbenefits of gender-affirming care because it asserts that \nmany minors diagnosed with gender dysphoria will \n\n41 \n \n\u201cdesist[]\u201d in experiencing gender incongruence in adult-\nhood.  Br. in Opp. 7-8; see Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(h).  But that claim is not substantiated by any of the \ndata Tennessee cites, which is limited to studies focused \non the persistence of gender dysphoria or gender non-\nconforming behavior in pre-pubertal children.  Rather, \nadolescents who continue to have marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria in puberty \u201crarely come to identify \nwith their assigned sex at birth.\u201d  J.A. 151 (capitaliza-\ntion and emphasis altered); see Pet. App. 279a n.1.  That \ndistinction between early childhood and adolescence is \ncritical:  None of the relevant clinical guidelines recom-\nmend any medical intervention to treat gender dyspho-\nria before the onset of puberty.  Pet. App. 255a, 286a.  \nIn other words, the only patients eligible to receive the \ntreatments that SB1 bans are highly likely to persist in \ntheir gender incongruence and gender dysphoria in \nadulthood.  J.A. 151-152. \nC. Tennessee Overstates The Risks Of The Banned Treat-\nments  \n \nAs the district court found, Tennessee also errs on \nthe other side of the ledger by greatly exaggerating the \nrisks of the banned treatments.   \n1. As an initial matter, Tennessee errs in identifying \nthe intended effects of gender-affirming care as medical \nrisks that SB1 seeks to prevent.  The State suggests, for \nexample, that \u201cirreversible vocal-cord changes\u201d are a \n\u201crisk[]\u201d of gender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 8.  Again, \nensuring conformity with the physical expectations for \nthe sex assigned to an individual at birth is not a valid \ngovernmental objective, and the intended result of a \nmedical treatment is not a risk.  See pp. 33-34 supra. \n2. The district court correctly found that many of \nthe other risks identified by Tennessee were not \n\n42 \n \nsupported by the record.  For example, Tennessee as-\nserts (Br. in Opp. 35) that hormone therapy is associ-\nated with cardiovascular risks.  But after carefully con-\nsidering the record evidence, the district court deter-\nmined that such risk was not elevated for transgender \nboys and that any such risk for transgender girls is usu-\nally present \u201conly  *  *  *  when a patient is denied care \nand self-administers the treatment without appropriate \nclinical supervision.\u201d  Pet. App. 190a (quoting J.A. 971). \nTennessee also identifies (Br. in Opp. 7-8, 35) pur-\nported effects on brain development and sexual dys-\nfunction and an increased risk of cancer.  The district \ncourt made detailed findings that these risks were un-\nsubstantiated by the record.  Tennessee\u2019s own expert \nadmitted that there have been \u201cno \u2018substantial studies \nto identify\u2019\u200a\u201d any impact on brain development from gen-\nder-affirming care, while the evidence submitted by the \nprivate plaintiffs showed that no such effect has been \nfound.  Pet. App. 184a-185a (quoting J.A. 432, 969).  The \ndistrict court also found that Tennessee\u2019s expert had \ncited neither \u201cstudies [n]or research\u201d to support his \ncontention that gender-affirming care results in sexual \ndysfunction.  Id. at 187a; see id. at 187a-188a; J.A. 429-\n430, 763 (same for Tennessee\u2019s other experts).  Finally, \nafter considering the relevant data, the court found that \nthe \u201cweight of the evidence\u201d does not support the con-\nclusion that hormone therapy increases the risk of can-\ncer.  Pet. App. 191a-192a. \n3. As to the remaining risks that Tennessee identi-\nfies, the district court correctly found that none were so \nsubstantial as to justify SB1\u2019s outright ban. \n \nTennessee argues, for instance, that puberty block-\ners are associated with a potential decrease in bone min-\neral density when used to treat gender dysphoria.  Br. \n\n43 \n \nin Opp. 6-7.  But as the district court recognized, multi-\nple studies have shown that there are no adverse effects \non bone mineralization during the time interval that pa-\ntients with gender dysphoria ordinarily take such block-\ners.  Pet. App. 189a; J.A. 966-967, 969.  Rather, the avail-\nable evidence indicates that puberty blockers maintain \nthe accrual of bone mineral density to a pre-pubertal \nrate until discontinued; when the individual then under-\ngoes either endogenous puberty or puberty prompted \nby hormone therapy, bone mineralization accrues at the \nusual rate.  J.A. 966-967; see also Brandt, 677 F. Supp. \n3d at 903, 920.  Accordingly, the district court concluded \nthat the record did not establish that puberty blockers \n\u201cpose a serious risk to a patient[\u2019s] bone density.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 189a.   \nTennessee also asserts that SB1\u2019s ban is justified by \nconcerns that gender-affirming care may threaten a pa-\ntient\u2019s future fertility.  Br. in Opp. 8; see also Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(b).  But SB1 bans puberty block-\ners even though all the available evidence demon-\nstrates\u2014and the State has never disputed\u2014that \n\u201c[p]ubertal suppression on its own has no impact on fer-\ntility.\u201d  Pet. App. 267a.  As to hormone therapy, the dis-\ntrict court correctly found that the record \u201cdemon-\nstrates that many individuals receiving  * * *  cross-sex \nhormones will remain fertile for procreation purposes, \nand that the risk of negative impacts on fertility can be \nmitigated.\u201d  Id. at 185a; see id. at 267a-268a; J.A. 973-\n974 & nn. 9-11.  \u201cTransgender men and women\u201d can \n\u201cproduc[e] eggs and sperm respectively both during \nand after the discontinuation of gender-affirming hor-\nmone treatment.\u201d  J.A. 127-128; see J.A. 973-974.  Fur-\nthermore, patients for whom hormone therapy is clini-\ncally indicated after treatment with puberty blockers \n\n44 \n \ncan first \u201cpreserve their sperm or eggs for future as-\nsisted reproduction by stopping puberty suppression \nbriefly before initiating gender-affirming hormones.\u201d  \nPet. App. 292a.  In all events, the relevant clinical guide-\nlines and ethical principles governing pediatric care re-\nquire patients and their parents to be thoroughly coun-\nseled on these risks, and to be provided with fertility-\npreserving options. \nD. SB1 Is Not Tailored To Tennessee\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescents From Harmful Medical Proce-\ndures \n \nSB1\u2019s complete lack of tailoring means that it is not \nsubstantially related to the State\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting adolescents.  States undoubtedly have legit-\nimate interests in ensuring informed consent and regu-\nlating the practice of medicine.  But when a State regu-\nlates using sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on \nsweeping and untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate \nand impartial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, \n582 U.S. at 63 n.13.  That \u201cclose relationship\u201d require-\nment \u201cassure[s]\u201d that \u201cthe validity of a classification is \ndetermined through reasoned analysis\u201d rather than use \nof gender as a \u201cproxy for other, more germane bases of \nclassification.\u201d  Hogan, 458 U.S. at 725-726 (citation \nomitted).  SB1 flunks that test because it is severely un-\nder- and overinclusive. \n1. SB1 is severely underinclusive \nFirst, SB1 is \u201cseverely underinclusive\u201d because \u201cit \nbans [the prohibited] procedures for a tiny fraction of \nminors, while leaving them available for all other mi-\nnors (who would be subjected to the very risks that the \nstate asserts SB1 is intended to eradicate).\u201d  Pet. App. \n204a-205a.   \n\n45 \n \nAs the district court observed, \u201cthe medical proce-\ndures banned by SB1 because they are purportedly un-\nsafe to treat gender dysphoria in minors  *  *  *  are not \nbanned when provided to treat other conditions.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 200a.  Indeed, SB1 expressly permits the banned \nmedications for conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding \u201cto treat a minor\u2019s congenital defect, preco-\ncious puberty, disease, or physical injury.\u201d  Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-103(b)(1)(A).   \nPuberty blockers are routinely used to treat preco-\ncious puberty, to delay puberty for patients undergoing \nchemotherapy, to preserve fertility for patients with \nhormone-sensitive cancers, and to treat endometriosis.  \nPet. App. 263a-264a.  Hormone therapy, too, is used to \ntreat a range of conditions other than gender dysphoria, \nincluding to treat various intersex conditions, infants \nsuffering from microphallus, and teenage boys with de-\nlayed puberty.  Id. at 265a-266a.  SB1 allows all those \nuses, across the board, even though many carry the \nsame or greater risks as use of these medications to \ntreat gender dysphoria.  Id. at 266a-267a; see also J.A. \n127-128, 963-974, 995-996.  Instead, the line SB1 draws \nis non-medical in nature:  SB1 bans the use of these \ntreatments to assist minors in departing from the phys-\nical expectations consistent with their sex assigned at \nbirth, and permits them for other purposes, including to \nassist minors in conforming to physical expectations \nconsistent with their sex assigned at birth.   \n \nWhen compared to the State\u2019s regulation of other pe-\ndiatric treatments, Tennessee\u2019s assertion that SB1 is \nsubstantially related to its interest in protecting adoles-\ncents becomes still less tenable.  SB1 rests on the prem-\nise that adolescents lack the maturity to make informed \nmedical decisions about the risks and benefits of \n\n46 \n \npuberty blockers and hormone therapy in conjunction \nwith their parents and doctors.  See Tenn. Code Ann. \n\u00a7 68-33-101(h).  But that concern applies with equal or \nmore force to many pediatric treatments that are ac-\ncompanied by similar or greater risks\u2014none of which \nTennessee (or any other State) has attempted to ban.  \nFor example, certain irreversible bariatric surgeries for \nweight loss are \u201ccommonly performed in the pediatric \nage group,\u201d despite the risk of serious complications, in-\ncluding splenic injury, hemorrhage, intestinal leaks, \nand blood clots.8  The same is true for other medications \nand procedures with significant risks: \n\u2022 Use of growth hormones to treat a minor\u2019s idio-\npathic short stature (potential risks include can-\ncer and hemorrhagic stroke).9  \n\u2022 Use of anti-estrogen drugs to treat boys whose \nbodies overproduce breast tissue (potential risks \ninclude blood clots).10   \n \n8 Sarah E.

SB1 singles out\u2014\nand bans\u2014only treatments for gender dysphoria. \n2. SB1 is also severely overinclusive \nAt the same time, SB1 \u201cclassif[ies] unnecessarily and \noverbroadly,\u201d Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 63 n.13, be-\ncause it categorically bans all hormone treatments and \n \n11 Danielle L.

If Tennessee\u2019s concern is that gender-af-\nfirming care is too readily available, see Tenn. Code \nAnn. \u00a7 68-33-101(g), one might expect to see gatekeep-\ning requirements, waiting periods, or other guardrails.  \nIf Tennessee\u2019s concern is that some doctors are improp-\nerly prescribing these treatments beyond their exper-\ntise or for reasons other than the child\u2019s best interest, \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-101(i)-(m), one might expect to see licens-\ning, certification, or reporting requirements.  If Tennes-\nsee\u2019s concern is infertility, id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), one might \nexpect to see a law that exempts puberty blockers \n(which have no effect on fertility) or requirements \naimed at fertility preservation.  If Tennessee\u2019s concern \nis a minor\u2019s ability to make an informed decision about \nwhether to receive such care, see id. \u00a7 68-33-101(h), one \nmight expect to see requirements like two-parent con-\nsent or counseling.  And if Tennessee\u2019s interest is con-\nsistency with aspects of the international landscape con-\ncerning treatment for gender dysphoria, see id. \u00a7 68-33-\n101(e), one might expect to see readiness criteria or age \nrecommendations that still allow adolescents in appro-\npriate cases to get the care they need.   \nAt the very least, one might expect a law grounded \nin medical risks to allow care in cases in which gender-\naffirming care is necessary to limit the risk of self-harm \nor suicidality.  Cf. W. Va. Code \u00a7 30-3-20(c)(5)(B) (re-\nstricting gender-affirming care to cases where \u201c[t]he di-\nagnosing medical professionals\u201d opine \u201cthat treatment \nwith pubertal modulating and hormonal therapy is med-\nically necessary to treat the minor\u2019s psychiatric \n\n49 \n \nsymptoms and limit self-harm, or the possibility of self-\nharm, by the minor\u201d).  But SB1 instead categorically \nbans all such care\u2014without regard for how necessary \nsuch care may be in an individual case or the potential \nconsequences of withholding care.   \n* * * * *  \nIn short, SB1 lacks anything resembling a \u201cclose \nmeans-end fit\u201d with Tennessee\u2019s asserted interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents from harmful med-\nical treatments.  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at 68.  SB1 \nis a much better fit for Tennessee\u2019s other stated inter-\nest: \u201cencouraging minors to appreciate their sex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Or, put more plainly, \n\u201cforc[ing] boys and girls to look and live like boys and \ngirls.\u201d  Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting).  But a law \njustified on that basis cannot withstand heightened \nscrutiny.  Indeed, heightened scrutiny is designed to \nprotect against the \u201cdanger\u201d that \u201cgovernment policies \nthat professedly are based on reasonable considerations \nin fact may be reflective of \u2018archaic and overbroad\u2019 gen-\neralizations about gender.\u201d  J.E.B., 511 U.S. at 135 (ci-\ntation omitted).  SB1 reflects just such overbroad gen-\neralizations, and Tennessee\u2019s invocation of a \u201creasona-\nble consideration[]\u201d\u2014protecting adolescents\u2019 health\u2014\ncannot justify its categorical ban. \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has solidified around a central, well-defined legal conflict. The acquisition and analysis of the primary briefs from both the Petitioner (United States) and the Respondent (Tennessee) have resolved the initial, broad uncertainty and replaced it with a highly specific predictive question.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Stable):** The U.S. government's position remains anchored in the argument that Tennessee's SB1 constitutes sex discrimination. Their legal test is the \"but-for\" causation standard derived from the statutory interpretation of Title VII in *Bostock v. Clayton County*. They frame gender-affirming care as the accepted medical standard and portray the state's justifications as pretextual, pointing to the law's exceptions as evidence of underinclusivity.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis - Stable & Confirmed):** My understanding of Tennessee's strategy is now a high-fidelity model based on their filed brief. They have constructed a powerful counter-narrative by:\n    *   **Framing the Law:** Defining SB1 not as a classification of people by sex, but as a regulation of specific *medical procedures* based on *age* and *intended use*. This is positioned as a standard exercise of the state's police power to protect minors.\n    *   **Building a Constitutional Firewall:** Directly attacking the applicability of *Bostock*'s \"but-for\" test to the Equal Protection Clause. They argue this statutory test has never been the constitutional standard, citing precedents like *Geduldig v. Aiello* and *Personnel Adm\u2019r of Mass. v. Feeney* which allow for laws with disparate impacts. They warn of doctrinal chaos if *Bostock* were constitutionalized.\n    *   **Leveraging \"Scientific Uncertainty\":** Vigorously contesting the \"medical consensus\" narrative. They cite the UK's Cass Review, policy shifts in European nations, and detransitioner testimony as evidence of profound uncertainty. This strategy explicitly invokes *Gonzales v. Carhart*, which grants legislatures \"wide discretion\" to regulate in the face of medical and scientific debate.\n    *   **Rebutting Underinclusivity:** Arguing that the law is perfectly tailored to its purpose by defining the regulated category as \"gender-transition interventions for minors,\" which they claim is a uniquely uncertain and irreversible class of procedures justifying specific regulation.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus (Refined & Focused):** The central legal battle is no longer a matter of speculation. It is a direct clash between two legal frameworks: the Petitioner's *Bostock*-based statutory discrimination model and the Respondent's *Geduldig*/*Carhart*-based constitutional deference model. The previous observation confirmed that Tennessee's brief provides multiple \"off-ramps\" for a conservative majority to uphold the law. This current `THINK` observation solidifies my understanding and focuses my predictive model on the next critical variable: **the Petitioner's Reply Brief**. My uncertainty has shifted from \"What will Tennessee argue?\" to \"How will the United States rebut Tennessee's constitutional firewall and its narrative of scientific uncertainty?\" The strength and nature of that rebuttal is now the single largest unknown affecting my prediction. My confidence in a ruling favorable to Tennessee remains high, pending the analysis of this final piece of argumentation.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, being a `THINK` action, provides a direct window into the agent's meta-cognitive process, strongly validating and refining my understanding of effective experimental design for this domain. My heuristics are not only being confirmed but are forming a more integrated and conscious system.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition (Stable & Confirmed):** The strategy of breaking the problem into knowns and unknowns continues to be the foundational principle of my inquiry.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Strongly Validated & Refined):** The thesis-antithesis-synthesis model is the primary engine of my progress. The `THINK` observation explicitly confirms the success of the Thesis (Petitioner's Brief) -> Antithesis (Respondent's Brief) sequence and clearly articulates the next logical step: seeking the Rebuttal/Synthesis in the Petitioner's Reply Brief. This heuristic provides a clear, predictable, and effective path through the adversarial legal process.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection (Strongly Validated):** The core DBOED principle is functioning perfectly. The agent's internal reasoning demonstrates a conscious process of identifying the point of maximum uncertainty (the Respondent's arguments), taking an action to resolve it (`CLOSED_SEARCH`), and then immediately re-evaluating to identify the *new* point of maximum uncertainty (the Petitioner's rebuttal).\n\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (`THINK` Actions) (Strongly Validated & Elevated):** This observation elevates the importance of the `THINK` action itself. It is not merely a pause but a critical, value-adding step in the process. It serves to consolidate knowledge, explicitly model the current state of the problem, validate the effectiveness of prior strategies, and, most importantly, efficiently direct the next information-gathering action. This confirms that periodic, deliberate synthesis is essential for maintaining momentum and ensuring each action has maximum informational value.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics (Updated & Integrated):** My library of legal analysis patterns continues to grow and become more interconnected.\n    *   **Statutory vs. Constitutional Firewall:** This remains the central legal principle of this specific case, validated by the Respondent's brief.\n    *   **\"Scientific Uncertainty\" Deference:** This heuristic is now firmly associated with the precedent *Gonzales v. Carhart* and a specific body of evidence (Cass Review, European shifts).\n    *   **The Framing Battle:** The competing frames are now fully crystallized: \"sex discrimination vs. medical consensus\" (Petitioner) vs. \"age/use-based regulation vs. scientific uncertainty\" (Respondent).\n    *   **Failed Search as Timeline Signal:** This remains a reliable, simple heuristic for tracking the public availability of court documents.\n    *   **\"Mine the TOC and TOA First\" (Codified Heuristic):** This practical heuristic for rapidly analyzing complex legal filings has been validated and is now a standard part of my process.\n\n6.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed & Articulated):** The sequence of the last few observations perfectly illustrates a self-reinforcing, entropy-reducing loop. The `THINK` action articulates this cycle: a focused inquiry resolves a key uncertainty, which in turn illuminates the next, more specific uncertainty, guiding the subsequent action. This demonstrates that the DBOED methodology is not just a series of isolated actions but a coherent, dynamic system for converging on a solution."

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. This webpage has hyperlinks to Volumes 1\u20134 of the Reporter\u2019s \nRecord, documenting the testimony and evidence presented at the \ntemporary injunction hearing in trial court, and Volumes 1\u20137 of the \nClerk\u2019s Record, containing the papers submitted in the trial court. \nCitations to the Reporter\u2019s Record will be in the form \n[Vol.X].RR.[Page Y-Z]. Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \no\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n194: 20241015102831480_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.438)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n7: 20241015102823960_23-47720Certificate.json (score: 0.438)\nSUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES \n \nNo. 23-477 \n ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n  \n United States,  \n \n \n \n \n \nPetitioner \n \n \n \nv. \nJonathan Skrmetti, Attorney General and Reporter for Tennessee, et al.  \n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------X \n \nCERTIFICATE OF COMPLIANCE \nAs \nrequired \nby \nSupreme \nCourt \nRule \n33.1(h),  \nI certify that the document contains 5,265 words, \nexcluding the parts of the document that are exempted by \nSupreme Court Rule 33.1(d). \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct. \nExecuted on this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n                                                                                  \n \n \n \n \n \n \n______________________________ \n \n \n \n \n \n               Marianna Buffolino \n \n \nSworn to and subscribed before me this 15th day of October, 2024. \n \n \n_______________________________ \n                                                                                                                          \n \n \n#333584 \nMariana Braylovskiy \nNotary Public State of New York \nNo. 01BR6004935 \nQualified in Richmond County \nCommission Expires March 30, 2026\n\n",

Texas \nHealth & Safety Code \u00a7\u00a7 161.701-.706 (statute); Pet. Br. \nat 7 n.3 (acknowledging the similarity). Texas has suc-\ncessfully defended its statute against challenges brought \nunder the Texas Constitution. Loe v. State, 692 S.W.3d \n215 (Tex. 2024). \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting such \nstatutes. They are appropriate responses to harmful \nideas that are not evidence-based about how to treat the \nunprecedented recent outbreak of gender dysphoria \namong a small number of adolescents, many of whom \nhave comorbidities, who report feeling unhappy about \ntheir biological sex. The States\u2019 traditional police powers \nhave always included the power to regulate medical pro-\ncedures for minors, and the Fourteenth Amendment did \nnot change that. \nIn its petition for certiorari, the United States \nclaimed that \u201coverwhelming evidence establishes that \nappropriate gender-affirming treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones directly and substantially im-\nproves the physical and psychological wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Cert. \nPet. at 7.  That assertion is false. See part I.B.6, infra. \nSimilarly, in its merits brief, the United States claims \nthat \u201c[m]edical evidence and clinical experience demon-\nstrate that [the prohibited medical procedures], provided \n \n1 No counsel for any party authored this brief, in whole or in \npart. No person or entity other than amici contributed monetarily \nto its preparation or submission. \n\n2 \n \nin appropriate cases, meaningfully improves the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing App. 194a\u2013197a). The \ncitation is to the district court\u2019s opinion at the prelimi-\nnary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that the medi-\ncal procedures banned by SB1 confer important benefits \non patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12). Based on its review of \nthe record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a. \nAlthough the district court\u2019s statement is limited to \n\u201cthis record\u201d at a preliminary-injunction stage, the \nUnited States presents the supposed \u201cfact\u201d that the pro-\nhibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully improve[] the health \nand wellbeing of transgender adolescents with gender \ndysphoria\u201d as an always-and-everywhere settled, undis-\nputed fact about the world. This type of fact is a \u201clegisla-\ntive fact\u201d because it is \u201cnot unique to the parties and may \ngive shape to legal rules that bind the world.\u201d Haley N. \nProctor, Rethinking Legislative Facts, 99 Notre Dame \nL. Rev. 955, 957 (2024). If the Court accepts the United \nStates\u2019 assertion, then other courts and non-parties will \nbe bound by it. \nBut the evidence set about the efficacy of the prohib-\nited procedures should not yet be closed. In Texas\u2019s de-\nfense of its statute in state court, Texas presented a \ngreat deal of evidence calling the United States\u2019 suppos-\nedly undisputed legislative fact into question.2 For in-\nstance, treatment of adolescent onset gender dysphoria \nis a developing field. The prohibited treatments are \nexperimental, and no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits there are two and only two biological \nsexes. Moreover, there is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. Gender \n \n2 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe. \n\n3 \n \nidentity can change over time. Adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is so new that it is not in the DSM-V. Gender \ndysphoria is a social contagion. The risks of the \nprohibited procedures outweigh the benefits. Minors \ncannot give informed consent to the prohibited \nprocedures. And therapy is effective. \nTexas therefore has an interest in not having the \nCourt announce a settled, undisputed legislative fact, \nbased only on the preliminary-injunction record in this \ncase, which could then be used to challenge Texas\u2019s stat-\nute in future litigation. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nTexas agrees with Tennessee that the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause does not prohibit states from enacting stat-\nutes like SB1 because such statutes do not discriminate \nbased on sex, do not discriminate against any quasi-sus-\npect class, and are subject to rational-basis review, which \nthey survive. Texas will not add anything to Tennessee\u2019s \nexcellent argument. \nBut if the Court were to view such statutes as dis-\ncriminating on the basis of sex, or as classifying based on \n\u201ctransgender\u201d status and that \u201ctransgender\u201d status is a \nquasi-suspect class, then such statues would be subject \nto intermediate scrutiny and would be declared unconsti-\ntutional unless they serve important governmental ob-\njectives and that the discriminatory means employed are \nsubstantially related to the achievement of those objec-\ntives. United States v. Virginia, 518 U.S. 515, 532\u201333 \n(1996). \nWhether the prohibited medical procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria\u201d is rele-\nvant to whether SB1 and similar statutes serve im-\nportant governmental interests. The Court should not \n\n4 \n \nanswer that question, as a matter of always-and-every-\nwhere settled, undisputed legislative fact, because the \nevidence set should not be considered closed\u2014especially \nin the light of the record Texas developed in its case de-\nfending its similar statute. \nARGUMENT \nI. The Court Should Not Declare, As A Legislative \nFact, That The Prohibited Procedures Are \nEffective Treatments of Gender Dysphoria In \nMinors. \nThe United States claims that the district court de-\ntermined that the prohibited procedures are effective to \ntreat gender dysphoria in minors, and that the question \nis forever settled. But the court did not and could not do \nthat, and in fact the question is hardly settled. To the \ncontrary, Texas compiled a great deal of evidence chal-\nlenging the United States\u2019 claim in its parallel state-law \nchallenge. \nA. The district court did not determine any \nlegislative \nfacts \nabout \nthe \nprohibited \nprocedures. \nCiting the trial court\u2019s preliminary injunction order, \nthe United States claims that the district court deter-\nmined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evidence and \nclinical experience demonstrate that [the prohibited pro-\ncedures], provided in appropriate cases, meaningfully \nimproves the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d Pet. Br. at 5\u20136 (citing \nApp. 194a\u2013197a). But in its ruling at the preliminary-in-\njunction phase, the district court specified that it was \nonly \u201cconcerned with the relative persuasiveness of the \ntwo sides\u2019 experts based on the current record, and not \nwith declaring which side\u2019s experts ultimately are in the \n\n5 \n \nright.\u201d App. 176a n.39. The United States mischaracter-\nizes the district court\u2019s ruling as establishing settled, un-\ndisputed legislative facts about the efficacy of the pro-\nhibited procedures to treat gender dysphoria in minors. \nIn so doing, the United States confuses legislative facts \nfor adjudicative facts. \n\u201cLegislative facts are established truths, facts, or \npronouncements that do not change from case to case but \napply universally, while adjudicative facts are those de-\nveloped in a particular case.\u201d United States v. Gould, 536 \nF.2d 216, 220 (8th Cir. 1976). Legislative facts are \u201cnot \nunique to the parties and may give shape to legal rules \nthat bind the world.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 957. They \u201care \nfacts about the broader world, while adjudicative facts \nare facts about the parties and their dispute,\u201d id. at 977, \nand \u201ccall for exercises of conjecture, prediction, or opin-\nion, while adjudicative facts do not,\u201d id. at 978. \nCourts have never developed a systematic method for \ndetermining legislative facts. \u201cJudges, litigants, legisla-\ntors, and scholars have grappled with legislative facts for \nnigh on a century, yet repeated invocations of the con-\ncept have yet to mature into administrable rules about \nwhat they are and who should find them.\u201d Proctor, su-\npra, at 957\u201358. \nBut, as Professor Gary Lawson has argued, any \u201cfor-\nmal structure for proof of facts in the law\u201d must involve \nfive principles: \n\u2022 Admissibility (what counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Principles of weight or significance (how much the \nadmissible evidence counts towards establishing a \nclaim) \n\u2022 Standards of proof (how much total admissible ev-\nidence one must have in order to establish a claim) \n\n6 \n \n\u2022 Burdens of proof (how one makes decisions in the \nface of uncertainty) \n\u2022 Principles of closure (when one can stop looking \nfor more information and declare the evidence set \nclosed) \nGary Lawson, EVIDENCE OF THE LAW: PROVING LEGAL \nCLAIMS 9 (2017); see also id. at 16\u201344. \nWhether or not Professor Lawson is entirely correct \nabout the nature of proof, any method of proving legis-\nlative facts must have a closure principle. However \ncourts should decide legislative facts about the efficacy \nof the prohibited procedures, the evidence set should not \nbe closed based on a single preliminary-injunction hear-\ning which did not even result in a final ruling. The district \ncourt itself recognized that it was only making a prelim-\ninary ruling and was not purporting to establish a legis-\nlative fact. \n\u201c[C]ourts finding legislative facts are conducting \ncomplex, empirical inquiries.\u201d Proctor, supra, at 972. \nThe complex, empirical inquiry into the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures for minors should not cease with \nthe district court\u2019s ruling on a preliminary injunction in \na single case that happened to be the first to reach this \nCourt. \nAlthough the United States claims that the trial court \ndetermined, without qualification, that \u201cMedical evi-\ndence and clinical experience demonstrate that [the pro-\nhibited procedures], provided in appropriate cases, \nmeaningfully improves the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria (citing \nA00.194a\u2013197a),\u201d it cited the trial court\u2019s opinion at the \npreliminary-injunction stage: \u201cPlaintiffs contend that \nthe medical procedures banned by SB1 confer important \nbenefits on patients.  (Doc. No. 33 at 12).  Based on its \n\n7 \n \nreview of the record, the Court agrees.\u201d App. 194a\u2013195a \n(emphasis added). The district court thus never said that \nthe prohibited procedures had been finally demonstrated \nas good for adolescents with gender dysphoria as a mat-\nter of legislative fact. \nSimilarly, the United States asserts, \u201c[t]he [district] \ncourt found that \u2018the benefits of the medical procedures \nbanned by SB1 are well-established (citing App. 197a).\u2019\u201d \nIn fact, the district court found \u201cthat the benefits of the \nmedical procedures banned by SB1 are well-established \nby the existing record.\u201d App. 197a (emphasis added). \nThe district court made a preliminary ruling at a pre-\nliminary-injunction stage based on the record before it. \nIn that posture, the court\u2019s order did \u201cnot [] conclusively \ndetermine the rights of the parties, but\u201d instead \u201cbal-\nance[d] the equities as the litigation moves forward.\u201d \nTrump v. In\u2019'l Refugee Assistance Project, 582 U.S. 571, \n580 (2017) (citation omitted). It is not \u201cany sense in-\ntended as a final decision.\u201d Brown v. Chote, 411 U.S. 452, \n456 (1973). Indeed, \u201cfindings of fact and conclusions of \nlaw made by a court granting a preliminary injunction \nare not binding at trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. \nCamenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). \nThus, the district court never purported to conclu-\nsively establish that the prohibited procedures \u201cmean-\ningfully improve[] the health and wellbeing of \ntransgender adolescents with gender dysphoria.\u201d That is \nreason enough for the Court to decline the United States\u2019 \ninvitation to declare that as a settled, established, undis-\nputed legislative fact that binds future courts when de-\ntermining the constitutionality of similar statutes. \n\n8 \n \nB. In defending its statute in a different case, \nTexas produced substantial evidence that \nthere is no evidence for the efficacy of the \nprohibited procedures. \nIn Texas\u2019s ultimately successful defense of its statute \nthat is similar to SB1, Texas produced substantial evi-\ndence contrary to the United States\u2019 proposed legislative \nfact that the prohibited procedures \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria,\u201d3 detailed below. This evi-\ndence should preclude a finding of legislative fact about \nthe efficacy and safety of the prohibited procedures at \nthis time. The question is still open. \n1. There are two and only two biological \nsexes. \nDr. Colin Wright, Ph.D., an evolutionary behavioral \necologist, testified as an expert for Texas on biological \nsex. 2.RR.229-40. He explained that \u201cbiological sex re-\nfers to the type of reproductive strategy that an individ-\nual has,\u201d and it cannot be changed. 2.RR.228-29. In ani-\nsogamous species\u2014including humans\u2014biological sex is \ndefined by the type of gamete that individual can pro-\nduce\u2014an individual who produces the larger gamete is \ncalled the female, while one \u201cwho produce[] the smaller \ngamete or sperm is called the male.\u201d 2.RR.229-30. \n \n3 Available at https://www.texasattorneygeneral.gov/state-vs-\nloe.

Citations to the Clerk\u2019s Record will be in the \nform [Vol.X].CR.[Page Y-Z]. \n\n9 \n \nBecause there are \u201conly two gamete types\u201d for a species, \nthere are only two biological sexes. 2.RR.230. \nDr. Wright explained that in human beings, the type \nof gamete an individual can produce (sperm and ovum, \nrespectively) is determined by his or her chromosomes \n(typically XY for males and XX for females); one\u2019s type \nof gamete, in turn, results in the production of relatively \ngreater testosterone (males) and estrogen (females), \nwhich in turn result in secondary sex-related character-\nistics such as facial hair (males) or breasts (females). \n2.RR.235-40. These secondary characteristics do not \u201cde-\nfine the sex of an individual,\u201d but \u201care downstream con-\nsequences of an individual\u2019s sex.\u201d 2.RR.235. \nDr. Michael Laidlaw, M.D., an endocrinologist, testi-\nfied as an expert for Texas that it is not medically possi-\nble for anyone to change their biological sex. 3.RR.63. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence.  \n2. There is no physical test for gender \ndysphoria. It is purely a mental condition. \nDr. Johanna Olson-Kennedy testified as an expert for \nplaintiffs on \u201cthe study, research, and treatment of gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d 2.RR.112. Regarding the process of di-\nagnosing \ngender \ndysphoria, \nDr. \nOlson-Kennedy \nacknowledged that the condition has no physical mani-\nfestation, and that there is no \u201cphysical test to prove or \ndisprove\u201d a person\u2019s \u201cexperience of having an incongru-\nent gender identity.\u201d 2.RR.135. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that \u201cthere is \nno brain study, there is no imaging, there is no blood test, \nthere is no chromosome test, there is no genetic test \nwhich can definitively show diagnostically the gender \nidentity of a given person. So there is no biological phys-\nical method to confirm the gender identity.\u201d 3.RR.66. He \nalso testified that in the DSM-V, \u201cgender identity is a \n\n10 \n \nsocial psychological concept distinct from biologic sex, \nwhich has to do with a person's internal feeling of being \nmale or female or on a spectrum of male to female or \nsome other gender identity.\u201d Id. As one of Plaintiffs\u2019 ex-\nperts testified, the DSM-V is \u201cpublished by the American \nPsychiatric Association. It's the primary guide by which \nwe use to make diagnoses in the field of mental health.\u201d \n2.RR.39. Dr. Laidlaw also testified, \u201cEndocrinology is \nthe study of glands and hormones, diagnosing disorders \nwith those, looking at hormone imbalances or structural \nproblems with glands\u2026. Gender dysphoria is not an en-\ndocrine disorder. It is a psychological disorder found in \nthe Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Health \nDisorders V.\u201d 3.RR.28\u201329. \nKatrina Taylor, a psychologist, testified as an expert \nfor Texas: \u201cGender identity, it\u2019s not an empirical state-\nment. We have no proof that there\u2019s such a thing as a \ngender identity. I have come to see it as a personal or \nspiritual belief about the self. Therefore, I don\u2019t agree \nthat one can have a gender identity that is fundamentally \ndifferent from one\u2019s sexed body. What is possible are \nfeelings of hatred, of revulsion for one\u2019s own body, \nwhether it has to do with sex and the sexed body or \nwhether it has to do, you know, with weight like we see \nin eating disorders.\u201d 3.RR.144.4 \n \n4 Incidentally, if gender dysphoria is purely a mental condition, \nand not a physical condition, as was undisputed in the case against \nTexas\u2019s statute, then gender dysphoria is not a \u201cdisability\u201d under \nfederal law. \u201cDisability \u2026 shall not include \u2026 gender identity dis-\norders not resulting from physical impairments.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 12211(b)(1); 29 U.S.C. \u00a7 705(20)(F)(i). The Americans with Disa-\nbilities Act recognizes \u201cphysical impairments\u201d as a distinct category \nfrom \u201cmental impairment[s].\u201d Id. \u00a7\u00a7 12102(1)(A), 12211(b)(1); Kin-\ncaid v. Williams, 143 S. Ct. 2414, 2417\u201318 (2023) (Alito, J., dissent-\ning from the denial of certiorari). \n\n11 \n \n3. Gender identity can change over time. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that one\u2019s \ngender identity can change over time. 3.RR.67\u201368. Like-\nwise, Dr. Olson-Kennedy, expert for plaintiffs, testified \nthat gender identity \u201cunfolds,\u201d and that some people \u201cre-\nalized their gender was different than their sex\u201d later in \nlife. 2.RR.134\u201335. \nIncidentally, this cuts against the idea that \n\u201ctransgenderism\u201d is an immutable characteristic, and \nthus cuts against the idea that \u201ctransgenderism\u201d is a \nquasi-suspect class. After all, one of the factors the Court \nhas used to determine whether to recognize a quasi-sus-\npect class is whether members of the class have \u201cobvious, \nimmutable, or distinguishing characteristics that define \nthem as a discrete group,\u201d Lyng v. Castillo, 477 U.S. 635, \n638 (1986). \n4. Adolescent onset gender dysphoria is so \nnew that it is not in the DSM-V. \nDr. James Cantor, Ph.D., testified as an expert for \nTexas on the scientific research related to treating gen-\nder dysphoria in minors. He testified that there are two \n\u201cmajor types [of gender dysphoria] that have been well-\nknown for decades \u2026 childhood onset gender dysphoria \n[and] \u2026 adult onset dysphoria.\u201d 3.RR.105. The former \n\u201care kids who feel like they\u2019re the opposite sex pretty \nmuch from the get-go. They start reporting it prepuber-\ntally really since childhood.\u201d 3.RR.106. The latter \u201cal-\nmost always are in men\u2026. These are men who are at-\ntracted to women\u2026. But usually by middle age, you \nknow, they\u2019ve decided that they've lived a heterosexual \nlife and that it\u2019s just not working for them. They experi-\nence a sexual interest pattern that we call autoandro-\nphilia where they actually experience sexual arousal to \nthe image of themselves as female.\u201d 3.RR.105\u201306. \n\n12 \n \nBut \nin the past ten years or so, really coinciding al-\nmost identically with the advent of social me-\ndia, a third group has started coming to clinics, \nand these are completely unlike either of the \nfirst two clinics. They do not report childhood \ngender dysphoria like the childhood onset \ntypes. They're majority female, and they have \na completely different mental health pattern, \nagain, unlike the other two groups. This is the \ngroup who now is the large, large majority of \npeople coming into clinics saying that they feel \nunhappy with their gender and want to live in \nsome other way. Also unlike the other two \ntypes, they're very frequently picking some \nneologism or some ambiguous status such as \nbeing fluid or non-binary, unlike the other two \ngroups. \n3.RR.107\u201308. \nOn cross-examination, Dr. Cantor testified that the \nDSM-V has only two diagnoses for gender dysphoria: \ngender dysphoria in children and gender dysphoria is ad-\nolescents and adults. It does not have a diagnosis for ad-\nolescent onset gender dysphoria. 3.RR.132. \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \n5. Gender dysphoria is a social contagion. \nDr. Sven Rom\u00e1n, a child and adolescent psychiatrist, \ntestified by declaration as an expert for Texas: \n In psychiatry, it is very common for syn-\ndromes to be socially transmitted, especially \namong teenage and young adult females. \nThose who have similar problems are in con-\ntact or socialize and in these subcultures there \ncan be a kind of competition to go the furthest. \n\n13 \n \nOne example is anorexia, and experience has \nshown that it is often directly counterproduc-\ntive to admit these patients to inpatient care, \nbecause then these girls and young women are \ninspired by the other anorexia patients, and a \nvery destructive desire to extremes. Another \nexample of social contagion is self-harm. It \nemerged as an epidemic in the early 1990s and \nhas since escalated. Even for this group of pa-\ntients, inpatient care is often counterproduc-\ntive. It is not uncommon for patients with self-\nharm to post pictures and videos of self-harm \non social media and, while in hospital, to con-\ntact likeminded people and ask when they will \nbe admitted to the clinic. \nMy view is that gender dysphoria in children \nand young adults is largely explained as a so-\ncial contagion. A slight increase in prevalence \nstarted in 2007, when the first smartphone was \nlaunched. However, it took a few years before \nthe majority of teenagers had a smartphone, \nand this coincides quite well with the sharp in-\ncrease in the diagnosis of gender dysphoria in \nyoung people. American journalist Abigail \nSchrier's book Irreversible Damage: The \nTransgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters \n(2020) provides a vivid and detailed account of \nthe social contagion of gender dysphoria. \n4.CR.1630\u201331. \n\n14 \n \n6. Treatment of adolescent onset gender \ndysphoria is a developing field. The \nprohibited treatments are experimental, \nand no scientific evidence supports their \nsupposed benefits. \nDr. Cantor, expert for Texas, testified that although \n\u201cwe have outcome studies on the childhood onset type \nand we have outcome studies on the adult onset type, we \nhave absolutely no data, we have no outcome studies on \nthis -- what I\u2019ll call the adolescent onset type even though \nthey are now suddenly the large majority of people com-\ning into clinics.\u201d 3.RR.108. \nHe also testified that there are \u201cvarious levels of evi-\ndence going from low-quality evidence that are relatively \nuncertain or ambiguous up through high-quality evi-\ndence that is highly reliable and worth generalizing to \nother people.\u201d 3.RR.83. \u201c[L]ow-quality studies are very \nnumerous in the research literature exactly because or \nas a side effect of their being easy to perform, but they're \nless reliable. The more systematic and the more reliable \nstudies are harder to perform, take more time to per-\nform, and take much more thorough analysis, so there \nare fewer of them.\u201d 3.RR.86. The highest-quality studies \nare \u201csystematic reviews which review all the other stud-\nies beneath it assessing them according to their relative \nqualities.\u201d Id. \nDr. Cantor testified that the \u201cgreat majority of the \nstudies [relied on by the plaintiffs\u2019 experts] were sur-\nveys.\u201d Surveys \u201care very, very common because it\u2019s so \neasy to conduct a survey, for example, on the Internet. \nSurveys can, you know, help us give, you know -- help us \nproduce hypotheses, can help give us ideas, but they \ndon't represent evidence at all\u2026. [T]hey can give us a \ngood idea of questions to look at, but they don't represent \n\n15 \n \nany kind of outcomes evidence.\u201d 3.RR.95. Surveys \u201cdon\u2019t \ncount as medical evidence, they don't count as outcome \nevidence, but the conclusions of the [plaintiffs\u2019] experts \ndepended largely on what doesn't count as evidence.\u201d \n3.RR.96. \nThe lowest-quality evidence comes from \u201ccase stud-\nies and reports,\u201d which \u201care generally retrospective \nstudies where somebody would go through hospital rec-\nords, for example, pull out cases of specific diagnoses and \nsee what happened amongst those people. It gives -- it \ncan give some idea of what to expect if nothing is done, \nbut because these are not systematic, they're not yet \nready for any kind of generalization to other cases.\u201d \n3.RR.90. \u201c[T]here have been a handful [of case studies \nabout the prohibited procedures on minors] published \nover the years. But again, they generally came out with \nambiguous -- with ambiguous results but results that, \nagain, suggested that it was at least worth looking at \nmore systematically.\u201d 3.RR.97\u201398. \nHigher quality evidence comes from \u201ccase-controlled \nstudies,\u201d which are \u201clooking for patterns of what hap-\npens in different groups of people or what makes differ-\nent groups of people different from each other.\u201d \n3.RR.90\u201391. Dr. Cantor is only aware of one such study, \nwhich was \u201ca particularly low-quality study because we \ncan\u2019t tell, you know, what changes, you know, what im-\nprovements and, you know, what got worse amongst \nthese people\u201d and \u201c[t]hey were in a poor mental health \nstatus to begin with.\u201d 3.RR.98. \nThe next highest-quality evidence is \u201ccohort studies,\u201d \nin which \u201cwe\u2019re now checking on a single group of people \nbut over time. We\u2019re looking to see what happened, for \nexample, before or after they were exposed to a treat-\nment or exposed to some not just substance. So instead \n\n16 \n \nof just taking a look at them at one point in time, we\u2019re \ntaking the same group of people and looking at them over \nseveral groups of time.\u201d 3.RR.91. \u201cThere have been ex-\nactly 13 [cohort studies], and these are the 13 that I sum-\nmarize in my own report. This is the highest level study \nthat so far has been conducted at all for the medical tran-\nsition of minors.\u201d 3.RR.99. \n\u201c[F]our of [the cohort studies] showed essentially no \nimprovement at all.\u201d 3.RR.100. In \u201croughly six of them, \nthere were some improvements in some mental health \nparameters, but we can\u2019t conclude that it was the inter-\nvention, that it was the medical interventions itself that \ncaused the improvement because the people were get-\nting psychotherapy at the same time.\u201d Id. \u201c[T]here were \ntwo studies which were designed in a way that allowed \nmore direct comparison trying to allocate how much of \nthe improvement was due to the medical interventions \nversus how much of the improvement was due to the \nmental health interventions. And both of those demon-\nstrate -- and both of those failed to demonstrate that the \nmedical interventions produced any more benefit than \ndid the mental health -- the psychotherapeutic interven-\ntions.\u201d 3.RR.100-01. \u201cAnd there was one other very re-\ncent study that just did not indicate whether the people \nwere in psychotherapy at the same time, so the results -\n- we can\u2019t assess whether the medical interventions were \nsuperior because we don't know how many were getting \npsychotherapy at the same time.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nThe next highest level of evidence comes from \u201cran-\ndomized controlled trials[, which] are the ones where we \ntake a group of people, randomly assign which ones are \ngoing to receive the experimental treatment and which \nones are going to receive either no treatment or some \nother comparison treatment such as treatment as usual, \n\n17 \n \na placebo treatment, or some other -- some other inter-\nvention.\u201d 3.RR.92. There have not been any randomized \ncontrol studies of the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.101. \nThe highest-level evidence comes from systematic re-\nviews, which \u201canalyze all of the studies and all of the lay-\ners that were beneath it. Again, especially in large fields \nwith many people, there are many, many studies, and es-\npecially for very busy clinicians, it\u2019s not possible to read \nand integrate every single one. So the purpose of system-\natic reviews is to get the big picture of what all of the \nother studies have shown, but as I say, to do it in a sys-\ntematic way that removes the potential for bias. The big-\ngest bias, as I mentioned, was cherry-picking where peo-\nple pick out the positive studies but don't mention the \nstudies where the experiment failed.\u201d 3.R.93\u201394. \u201cThere \nhave now been several systematic reviews, none con-\nducted in the U.S. They've all been conducted by the na-\ntional public healthcare systems in Europe.\u201d 3.RR.101. \nEach of them concluded that \u201cthere is no evidence to sug-\ngest that medicalized interventions provides any benefits \nsuperior to the mental health interventions.\u201d 3.RR.102. \n\u201cEach of the systematic reviews came to the same con-\nclusion, that the evidence for benefits are outweighed by \nthe evidence of the risks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. Those \nharms include, sterilization, permanent loss of capacity \nto breast-feed, inability to orgasm and loss of sexual \nfunction, interference with neurological and cognitive de-\nvelopment, elevated risk of Parkinsonism, and reduced \nbone density. 4.CR.1220\u201325. \nIn short, there is no evidence that the prohibited pro-\ncedures are safe and effective to treat minors with gen-\nder dysphoria. The prohibited procedures have \u201cnot yet \nbeen tested with experimental studies, so it\u2019s necessarily \nstill within the experimental status.\u201d 3.RR.116. \n\n18 \n \nPlaintiffs produced no contradicting evidence. \nDr. Cantor\u2019s testimony is consistent with the Cass \nReport, 5 a study recently commissioned by the National \nHealth Service in the United Kingdom to evaluate the \nsafety and efficacy of puberty blockers and cross-sex \nhormones for children diagnosed with gender dysphoria. \nThe authors of Cass Report spent four years reviewing \nclinical data, interviewing patients and providers, and \nconducting six systematic reviews. It concluded, among \nother things, the following:  \n\u2022 Gender Dysphoria: a diagnosis of gender dyspho-\nria is \u201cnot reliably predictive of whether that \nyoung person will have longstanding gender in-\ncongruence in the future, or whether medical in-\ntervention will be the best option for them.\u201d Cass \nReport at 29. \n\u2022 Social Transition: there is \u201cno clear evidence \nthat social transition in childhood has any positive \nor negative mental health outcomes, and rela-\ntively weak evidence for any effect in adoles-\ncence.\u201d Id. at 31. \n\u2022 Puberty Blockers: the use of puberty blockers \nresulted in \u201cno changes in gender dysphoria or \nbody satisfaction\u201d and there is \u201cinsufficient/incon-\nsistent evidence about the effects of puberty sup-\npression on psychological or psychosocial wellbe-\ning, cognitive development, cardio-metabolic risk \nor fertility \u2026 there is no evidence that puberty \nblockers buy time to think, and some concern that \n \n5 Hilary Cass, M.D., Independent Review of Gender Identity \nServices for Children and Young Adults, National Health Services \nEngland (Apr. 2024) (the \u201cCass Report\u201d), available at https://ti-\nnyurl.com/mw4s3arn. \n\n19 \n \nthey may change the trajectory of psychosexual \nand gender identity development.\u201d Id. at 32. \n\u2022 Cross-Sex Hormones: \u201c[t]here is a lack of high-\nquality research assessing the outcomes of hor-\nmone interventions in adolescents with gender \ndysphoria/incongruence, and few studies that un-\ndertake long-term follow-up. No conclusions can \nbe drawn about the effect on gender dysphoria, \nbody satisfaction, psychosocial health, cognitive \ndevelopment, or fertility [from the use of cross-\nsex hormones]. Uncertainty remains about the \noutcomes for height/growth, cardiometabolic and \nbone health.\u201d Id. at 33. \n\u2022 Suicides: \u201cIt has been suggested that hormone \ntreatment reduces the elevated risk of death by \nsuicide in this population, but the evidence found \ndid not support this conclusion.\u201d Id. \n7. The risks of the prohibited procedures \noutweigh the benefits. \nAs noted, Dr. Cantor testified, \u201cEach of the system-\natic reviews came to the same conclusion, that the evi-\ndence for benefits are outweighed by the evidence of the \nrisks of harm.\u201d 3.RR.104. \nDr. Rom\u00e1n, expert for Texas, testified that the \u201cSwe-\ndish National Board of Health and Welfare concluded \nthat \u2018the risks of puberty blockers and gender-affirming \ntreatment are likely to outweigh the expected benefits of \nthese treatments.\u2019\u201d 4.CR.1637. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, also testified, \u201cThe po-\ntential benefits [of providing puberty blockers to minors] \ndo not outweigh the risks,\u201d 3.RR.37\u201338, and that \u201cthe \nbenefits do not outweigh the risks for cross-sex hor-\nmones for adolescents,\u201d 3.RR.52. \n\n20 \n \n8. Minors cannot give informed consent to \nthe prohibited procedures. \nDr. Geeta Nangia, a child and adolescent psychia-\ntrist, testified as an expert for Texas. She testified that \n\u201cminors lack the necessary neurological, psychosocial, \nand cognitive development to provide informed consent \nor assent to\u201d the prohibited procedures. 4.CR.1452\u201385. \nDr. Laidlaw, expert for Texas, testified that minors \nhave very limited capacity to understand the implica-\ntions of taking potentially life-altering puberty blockers \nor cross-sex hormones. 3.RR.54\u201357. \nDr. Alan Hopewell, a clinical psychologist and neuro-\npsychologist, testified as an expert for Texas that minors \nhave limited reasoning ability and cannot give informed \nconsent to the prohibited procedures. 3.RR.186\u201390. \n9. Therapy is effective. \nDr. Nangia, expert for Texas, \u201ctreat[s] her patients \nwith exploratory, supportive, and family therapy,\u201d and \ntestified that \u201cchildren with gender dysphoria benefit \ntremendously from therapy\u2014particularly psychody-\nnamic therapy.\u201d 4.CR.1447\u201349. \nDr. Taylor, expert for Texas, testified that psycho-\ntherapy is a safe and effective treatment for minors with \ngender dysphoria. 3.RR.144. She testified that minors \nwith gender dysphoria or confusion is a symptom of the \nfamily dynamic and that dysfunction in the family system \nneeds to be addressed to resolve their feelings of gender \ndysphoria and confusion. 3.RR.143\u201344. \n \n* * * \nIn sum, the district court did not and could not have \nannounced as a matter of legislative fact (\u201cestablished \ntruths, facts, or pronouncements that do not change from \ncase to case but apply universally,\u201d Gould, 536 F.2d at \n\n21 \n \n220) that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully im-\nprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender adoles-\ncents with gender dysphoria.\u201d And the evidence set for \nthis question should not be closed. Evidence such as that \npresented in Texas\u2019s defense of its statute similar to SB1 \nand the Cass report needs to be considered before the \nCourt can announce any legislative fact about the prohib-\nited procedures. \n \n \n \n \n\n22 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be af-\nfirmed. But if the Court remands this case, it should not \nannounce that the prohibited treatments \u201cmeaningfully \nimprove[] the health and wellbeing of transgender ado-\nlescents with gender dysphoria\u201d as a matter of settled, \nundisputed legislative fact. \nRespectfully submitted. \nKEN PAXTON \nAttorney General of Texas \nBRENT WEBSTER \nFirst Assistant Attorney \n  General \nRALPH MOLINA \nDeputy First Assistant \n  Attorney General \nAUSTIN KINGHORN \nDeputy Attorney General \n  for Legal Strategy \nOCTOBER 15, 2024 \nCHARLES K.

          "task_beliefs": "My predictive model of this case remains centered on the well-defined clash between the Petitioner's sex discrimination framework and the Respondent's constitutional deference framework. The acquisition of the primary briefs has successfully narrowed my focus to the most critical remaining variable.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Stable):** The U.S. government's argument, confirmed by the re-analysis of their initial brief in this observation, is that Tennessee's SB1 is a form of sex discrimination. The legal test they advocate for is the \"but-for\" causation standard from *Bostock v. Clayton County*. They assert that gender-affirming care is the medical consensus and that the state's justifications are pretextual, as evidenced by the law's exceptions.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis - Stable):** Tennessee's counter-argument, derived from their brief, is a robust, multi-pronged defense. They frame the law as a regulation of *procedures* for minors, not a classification of people by sex. They directly attack the applicability of the statutory *Bostock* test to the constitutional Equal Protection context, instead invoking precedents like *Geduldig v. Aiello* that permit disparate impacts. Critically, they leverage the \"scientific uncertainty\" narrative, citing the Cass Review and European policy shifts, to argue for legislative deference under the precedent of *Gonzales v. Carhart*.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus (Stable & Unresolved):** The central legal battle is a direct conflict between the Petitioner's *Bostock*-based discrimination model and the Respondent's *Geduldig*/*Carhart*-based deference model. My previous analysis correctly identified that the next crucial piece of evidence is the **Petitioner's Reply Brief**, which must counter Tennessee's constitutional firewall and scientific uncertainty arguments.\n    *   **Key Uncertainty Unresolved (New Finding):** The search for the Petitioner's Reply Brief has failed. The documents returned were the initial Petitioner's Brief and its Certificate of Service. This is a significant finding because it confirms that the single largest unknown in my predictive model\u2014how the United States will rebut Tennessee's powerful defensive framework\u2014remains an unknown.\n    *   **Predictive Stasis:** Because this critical piece of argumentative evidence is not yet available, my model cannot be substantively updated. The probability distribution over the case's outcome has not changed. My confidence in a ruling favorable to Tennessee remains high, but it is explicitly and critically *conditional* on the content of this still-unseen reply brief. The core tension of the case is fully modeled, but the final move in the argumentative sequence is missing.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, a failed search for an anticipated document, provides powerful validation for several key heuristics and introduces important practical refinements to my information-gathering methodology.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition (Stable & Confirmed):** The strategy of breaking the problem into knowns and unknowns remains the bedrock of my approach.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Strongly Validated & Procedurally Grounded):** The thesis-antithesis-synthesis model continues to be my primary engine. This observation confirms that the model maps directly onto the procedural reality of Supreme Court litigation. My model predicted the next document in the sequence would be the Petitioner's Reply Brief. The search action tested this, and the result (its absence) confirms where we are in the real-world timeline. The heuristic correctly identified the *what*, and the observation clarified the *when*.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection (Strongly Validated):** The DBOED principle of acting to resolve the greatest uncertainty is functioning perfectly. I identified the reply brief as the point of maximum leverage, and the search action was the correct probe. The result, while negative, was maximally informative under the circumstances.\n\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (`THINK` Actions) (Strongly Validated):** The value of periodic synthesis is reinforced. The prior `THINK` step allowed me to precisely identify the reply brief as the next target, ensuring this `CLOSED_SEARCH` action was not a random guess but a highly targeted, hypothesis-driven inquiry.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics (Stable & Integrated):** My library of legal analysis patterns remains robust and unchanged by this observation. The \"Statutory vs. Constitutional Firewall,\" \"Scientific Uncertainty Deference\" (*Carhart*), and \"Framing Battle\" heuristics are all stable components of my model for this case.\n\n6.  **\"Failed Search as Timeline Signal\" (Strongly Re-validated):** This observation provides a textbook validation of this heuristic. The failure to find the reply brief is not a null result; it is a positive and useful piece of information. It tells me the document has not yet been publicly filed on the docket. This prevents me from wasting resources on further searches and accurately calibrates my model to the real-world procedural posture of the case. An empty result is a data point.\n\n7.  **Refined Search Heuristics (New & Refined):**\n    *   **Precision is Paramount:** The query for \"Reply brief\" returned the initial \"Brief\". This highlights the need for extreme precision in search terms and, more importantly, for careful verification of the results. I must check the exact title, date, and metadata of a returned document, not just rely on its semantic similarity score, to confirm it is the specific document I seek.\n    *   **Temporal Availability of Evidence:** This observation codifies a crucial meta-heuristic: the DBOED process must account for the temporal reality of evidence. The most informative experiment may be to query for evidence that does not yet exist. A failed search confirms this unavailability and suggests that the next optimal action may be to either wait, or to search for procedural information (like a scheduling order) to predict *when* the evidence will become available. Patience, informed by procedural awareness, is an essential strategic element.\n\n8.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed):** The DBOED loop continues to function effectively. A focused inquiry (the search) was guided by a specific uncertainty (the rebuttal). The result of that inquiry (the brief is not available) has now refined my understanding of the state of the world and will guide my next actions, which may involve waiting or investigating filing deadlines."

My search for a pro-petitioner amicus brief unexpectedly returned a powerful pro-respondent amicus brief from the State of Texas. This has significantly updated my understanding of the case (\u03b8) and my meta-level strategies (D).\n\n**Task Beliefs (\u03b8) Update:**\n1.  **Respondent's Argument Bolstered:** The Texas brief massively strengthens Tennessee's position by introducing a large body of evidence from a parallel state case (*Loe v. State*) that directly challenges the 'medical consensus' narrative pushed by the United States. It argues the science is far from settled.\n2.  **New Legal Doctrine Introduced:** The brief introduces the 'legislative fact' vs. 'adjudicative fact' distinction. It argues that the Court should not establish the efficacy of gender-affirming care as a binding 'legislative fact' based on a limited preliminary injunction record. This gives the Court a doctrinal 'off-ramp' to defer to the legislature, citing *Gonzales v. Carhart*, without having to definitively rule on the competing scientific claims. This is a sophisticated and potentially very persuasive argument for the conservative justices.\n3.  **Increased Burden on Petitioner:** The Petitioner's (United States) task in its Reply Brief is now much harder. It must not only rebut Tennessee's arguments but also counter the 'legislative fact' doctrine and the amplified narrative of scientific uncertainty.\n4.  **Central Uncertainty:** The single greatest point of uncertainty remains the content of the Petitioner's Reply Brief. It is the final piece of the primary dialectic (Thesis -> Antithesis -> Synthesis/Rebuttal).\n\n**Design Beliefs (D) Update:**\n1.  **Amicus Briefs as Innovators:** I have learned that key amicus briefs (especially from other states) are not just 'me-too' filings. They can amplify arguments and, more importantly, introduce novel and powerful legal theories that the primary parties might not have focused on. This refines my 'Dialectical Analysis' heuristic.\n2.  **'Failed Search as Signal' Refined:** A search for evidence supporting one side can yield high-value evidence for the *opposing* side. This is a crucial sub-heuristic. I must analyze all results, even those that don't match the query's intent.\n3.  **New Heuristic Added:** I have added the 'Legislative Fact Doctrine' to my mental library of legal patterns. I will now be on the lookout for this argument in cases involving complex, contested empirical questions.\n\n**Next Step Rationale:**\nMy entire model of the case now hinges on how the United States will respond to the powerful arguments from Tennessee and its amici. The Petitioner's Reply Brief is the document that will contain this response. I have previously failed to find it. Given the high value of this information, I must try again with a different search strategy. My previous search might have been too specific.

It moves beyond a simple dialectic to a more nuanced understanding where the Respondent's position is significantly bolstered by a key amicus brief. The identification of the 'legislative fact' doctrine as a doctrinal 'off-ramp' for the Court is a major insight that refines the predictive landscape. The action crystallizes the central uncertainty down to a single, high-value target: the Petitioner's Reply Brief. This sharpening of the predictive model is a massive gain.\n\nDesign EIG (0.9): This action is the primary mechanism for meta-learning (improving D). The agent explicitly codifies several powerful new heuristics: the role of amicus briefs as 'innovators' and 'amplifiers,' a refined 'failed search as signal' strategy, and the addition of the 'legislative fact' doctrine to its library of legal patterns. This is not just learning about the case; it's learning how to be a better legal analyst. The value of these generalizable strategies is exceptionally high.\n\nJoint EIG (1.7): The action is nearly perfect in its function.

Given the high value of this information, I must try again with a different search strategy. My previous search might have been too specific. I will now conduct a broader search for the reply brief, as it is the action that promises the highest possible information gain for \u03b8.\n"

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's argumentative structure has deepened significantly. While the core dialectic remains, the weight and texture of the Respondent's position have been substantially enhanced by new evidence.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Stable):** The U.S. government's argument remains anchored in the framework of sex discrimination, using the \"but-for\" causation standard from *Bostock v. Clayton County*. They maintain that the medical consensus supports gender-affirming care and that Tennessee's law is a pretextual form of discrimination. This belief is stable and awaits the Petitioner's Reply Brief for its next evolution.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis - Substantially Bolstered):** The Respondent's defense, centered on legislative deference and scientific uncertainty, has received powerful support from an amicus brief filed by the State of Texas.\n    *   **Argument Amplification (New Finding):** The Texas brief directly reinforces Tennessee's \"scientific uncertainty\" narrative. It does so by referencing a substantial body of evidence and expert testimony compiled in a parallel Texas state case (*Loe v. State*). This evidence explicitly challenges the Petitioner's \"medical consensus\" claim by arguing that: gender dysphoria is a purely mental condition, \"adolescent onset gender dysphoria\" is a new phenomenon potentially driven by \"social contagion,\" and the treatments are experimental with unproven benefits.\n    *   **Introduction of New Legal Doctrine (New Finding):** The Texas brief introduces a sophisticated new argument: the distinction between \"adjudicative facts\" (specific to the parties) and \"legislative facts\" (universal truths that shape law). Texas argues the Court should not establish the efficacy of gender-affirming care as a binding \"legislative fact\" based on a limited preliminary injunction record. This provides the Court with a doctrinal off-ramp, allowing it to defer to the legislature's judgment under the precedent of *Gonzales v. Carhart* without having to definitively rule on the competing scientific claims. This argument directly strengthens the Respondent's call for judicial restraint.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Current Predictive Focus (Shifted & Refined):** The central conflict is still the Petitioner's *Bostock* discrimination model versus the Respondent's *Carhart* deference model. However, the scales have tipped further in favor of the deference model.\n    *   **Increased Burden on Petitioner:** The arguments presented in the Texas amicus brief significantly raise the bar for the Petitioner's forthcoming Reply Brief. The U.S. must now not only rebut Tennessee's arguments but also counter the \"legislative fact\" doctrine and the amplified narrative of scientific uncertainty being pushed by multiple states.\n    *   **Key Uncertainty Remains:** The single greatest unknown remains the content of the Petitioner's Reply Brief. Its absence was previously a procedural data point; now, its eventual content is the critical variable that will determine if the Petitioner can overcome the Respondent's bolstered defensive position.\n    *   **Predictive Shift:** My confidence in a ruling favorable to Tennessee has increased. The Texas amicus brief has illuminated a clearer, more doctrinally grounded path for the Court to uphold the law by framing the issue as one of legislative deference in the face of scientific debate, rather than one of settled science and clear discrimination.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, validating core strategies while introducing crucial new heuristics for analyzing Supreme Court litigation, particularly regarding the role of amici and the nature of evidence.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition (Stable & Confirmed):** The strategy of identifying knowns and unknowns continues to guide my inquiry effectively.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Validated & Expanded):** The thesis-antithesis model is robust, but this observation expands it. The legal battle is not a simple duet but a performance with a \"chorus.\" My model must now account for the arguments of key amici, who can amplify a party's position and introduce novel arguments. The analysis is now Thesis vs. (Antithesis + Amici).\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection (Strongly Validated):** My focus on the next logical document in the sequence continues to yield high-value information, even when the search is technically \"unsuccessful.\"\n\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (`THINK` Actions) (Strongly Validated):** The value of pausing to synthesize and identify the point of maximum uncertainty remains a cornerstone of my efficient DBOED process.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics (Stable & Integrated):** My library of patterns like \"Statutory vs. Constitutional Firewall\" and \"Framing Battle\" remains stable. The \"Scientific Uncertainty Deference\" (*Carhart*) heuristic is now much richer, as the Texas brief provides a textbook example of how to construct this argument.\n\n6.  **\"Failed Search as Signal\" (Validated & Refined):** This heuristic is confirmed but also refined. A search for evidence supporting one side can return highly relevant evidence supporting the *other* side. The query for a pro-petitioner brief yielded a pro-respondent brief. This leads to a new sub-heuristic: **\"Anticipate and Analyze the Opposition.\"** A failed search is not a null result; it is an opportunity to analyze the counter-arguments that are discoverable with the same query.\n\n7.  **Refined Search Heuristics (Stable & Reinforced):**\n    *   **Precision is Paramount:** The fact that a search for \"in support of petitioner\" returned a document clearly titled \"IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS\" powerfully reinforces the need to verify the metadata and summary of every search result before analysis.\n    *   **Temporal Availability of Evidence:** The core principle that evidence is bound by a real-world timeline remains a key strategic constraint.\n\n8.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed):** The DBOED loop is functioning as designed, with each observation refining my model of the world and guiding the next, more targeted inquiry.\n\n9.  **Amicus Briefs as Argument Amplifiers and Innovators (New Heuristic):** This observation establishes the critical importance of amicus briefs. They serve two primary functions: (1) **Amplification:** They add weight and evidentiary support to a party's existing arguments (as Texas did for Tennessee's \"scientific uncertainty\" claim). (2) **Innovation:** They can introduce novel legal theories or frameworks that the parties themselves may not have prioritized (like the \"legislative fact\" doctrine). Analyzing key amicus briefs is now a primary objective.\n\n10. **The \"Legislative Fact\" Doctrine (New Legal Heuristic):** I have added this doctrine to my analytical toolkit. It is a mechanism for courts to exercise judicial restraint in cases involving complex, contested empirical questions (e.g., science, economics, sociology) by deferring to a legislature's fact-finding role. I will now look for this argument pattern in similar cases."

As every court to consider the issue \nhas recognized, that interest cannot justify a categorical \nban on medical treatments supported by the over-\nwhelming consensus of the medical community.  But the \nSixth Circuit held that courts may not even consider \nwhether the State has substantiated its asserted justi-\nfication; instead, it held that laws like Tennessee\u2019s must \nbe upheld so long as they are not irrational.   \nThat was a profound and consequential error that \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Tennessee\u2019s SB1, like \nsimilar bans enacted by other States, forthrightly clas-\nsifies based on both sex and transgender status.  By its \nterms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments intended to \n\n2 \n \nallow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a purported \nidentity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or to treat \n\u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d\u2014but \nSB1 permits the exact same treatments when pre-\nscribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-\n33-103(a)(1) (2023).  That focus on sex and gender con-\nformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to bar treatment \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Be-\ncause SB1 classifies based on sex and transgender sta-\ntus, it must satisfy heightened scrutiny.  \n \nRespondents\u2019 efforts to demonstrate that SB1 with-\nstands that scrutiny fall short.  Respondents ignore the \ndistrict court\u2019s detailed factual findings, which the Sixth \nCircuit did not disturb.  Instead, respondents rely on \ntheir own selective and distorted presentation of the ev-\nidence.  And none of respondents\u2019 arguments justifies a \ncategorical ban on care that is consistent with the med-\nical consensus and that the affected adolescents, their \nparents, and their doctors have concluded is appropri-\nate and essential to their wellbeing. \n \nNor do respondents provide any other reason to \ndeny review.  They acknowledge that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision conflicts with decisions by other courts of ap-\npeals on both the ultimate validity of laws like SB1 and \non key subsidiary questions.  Given the wave of similar \nlaws adopted in States around the country and the near-\nuniform conclusion by district courts that those laws are \nunconstitutional, respondents cannot plausibly deny \nthat this Court will ultimately have to resolve those cir-\ncuit conflicts.  Delaying that authoritative resolution \nwould needlessly leave transgender adolescents and \n\n3 \n \ntheir families in limbo and inflict particularly acute \nharm in Tennessee and other States where these laws \nhave taken effect.   \nA. The Decision Below Is Incorrect \n1. Respondents offer no persuasive defense of the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that SB1 is subject only to \ndeferential rational-basis review. \na. In insisting that SB1 does not classify based on \nsex, respondents repeat the Sixth Circuit\u2019s errors.  \nThey assert that SB1\u2019s express references to sex should \nbe disregarded because SB1 prohibits \u201csex-transition \ntreatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Br. in \nOpp. 22 (quoting Pet. App. 35a).  But respondents do not \ndispute that the application of SB1 to any particular in-\ndividual turns on that individual\u2019s sex.  And this Court \nhas already rejected the argument that a law that clas-\nsifies based on race or sex can escape heightened review \nby targeting members of all races or both sexes equally.  \nSee Pet. 18, 20-21 (citing, e.g., J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 \nU.S. 127, 136 (1994), and Johnson v. California, 543 \nU.S. 499, 506 (2005)).  Respondents do not respond to \nour citation of J.E.B. or Johnson, let alone try to recon-\ncile their forgiving approach to sex-based line-drawing \nwith the rule this Court has consistently enforced. \nRespondents invoke (Br. in Opp. 24-25) this Court\u2019s \nholding that, absent evidence of pretext, laws regulat-\ning medical procedures that \u201conly one sex can undergo\u201d \ndo not trigger heightened scrutiny under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health \nOrg., 597 U.S. 215, 236 (2022).  But as we have explained \n(Pet. 22), SB1 regulates procedures that all individuals \ncan undergo, regardless of their sex:  Healthcare  \nproviders cannot perform an abortion on a cisgender \nman, but they can prescribe \u201cpuberty blocker[s]\u201d or \n\n4 \n \n\u201chormone[s],\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B) (2023), \nto any person, regardless of sex assigned at birth.  In-\ndeed, that is why the law speaks in explicit sex-based \nterms, prohibiting providers from prescribing treat-\nments only \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to \nidentify with, or live as, a purported identity incon-\nsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201c[t]reating purported \ndiscomfort or distress from a discordance between the \nminor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1); \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).  That language is necessary to \nensure that the targeted treatments\u2014which can be \ngiven to members of both sexes\u2014are prohibited only \nwhen prescribed to treat gender dysphoria.  \nChanging tack, respondents assert that despite this \nCourt\u2019s holding that \u201call gender-based classifications\u201d \nwarrant \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d United States v. Vir-\nginia, 518 U.S. 515, 555 (1996) (VMI\u200a) (citation omitted), \nsome such classifications do not.  Respondents put the \npoint in different ways, but all of them reduce to the \nsame basic error:  Respondents seek to avoid height-\nened scrutiny altogether by invoking considerations \nthat are relevant only in determining whether a sex-\nbased classification withstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s \nprecedents require.  \nRespondents assert (Br. in Opp. 23), for example, \nthat SB1 does not treat \u201csimilarly situated individuals \ndifferently based on their sex\u201d because an adolescent \nboy receiving testosterone to \u201ccorrect a deficiency\u201d is \nnot \u201csimilarly situated to an adolescent girl suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria\u201d who receives testosterone to al-\nleviate distress from that condition.  Respondents also \nmaintain (ibid.) that the cost-benefit calculus for pre-\nscribing puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender \ndysphoria is different than the calculus for prescribing \n\n5 \n \nthem to treat other conditions.  But those are just dif-\nferent ways of saying that respondents believe that \nSB1\u2019s sex-based classifications are justified by biologi-\ncal differences between the sexes.  And as we have ex-\nplained (Pet. 20-22), when a legislature classifies based \non sex, heightened scrutiny applies even if the legisla-\nture asserts that it had a good reason to do so\u2014indeed, \nthe whole point of heightened scrutiny is to give courts \na principled yardstick for measuring such justifications.   \nLike the Sixth Circuit, respondents emphasize (Br. \nin Opp. 24) VMI\u200a\u2019s recognition of \u201cenduring\u201d physical \ndifferences between men and women.  518 U.S. at 533.  \nBut VMI simply makes clear that those differences \nmean that sex-based lines will sometimes withstand \nheightened scrutiny; it does not suggest that courts can \nabandon heightened scrutiny altogether whenever a \nchallenged law purports to rest on biology.  Pet. 21-22.  \nRespondents cannot reconcile their contrary view with \nNguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53 (2001), where this Court ap-\nplied heightened scrutiny to a law it described as based \non the \u201cbiological\u201d reality that \u201c[f\u200a]athers and mothers \nare not similarly situated with regard to the proof of bi-\nological parenthood.\u201d  Id. at 63-64. \nb. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus, restricting care only for transgender individuals \nsuffering from gender dysphoria.  Pet. 19, 24-25.  In re-\nsponse, respondents principally argue (Br. in Opp. 27-\n29) that transgender status is not a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification warranting heightened scrutiny, citing Mas-\nsachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 \n(1976) (per curiam), and City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985).  But those  \ndecisions\u2014which held that age and mental disability, \n\n6 \n \nrespectively, are not suspect classes\u2014only reinforce \nthe distinct nature of the classification at issue here.   \nIn Murgia, the Court emphasized that \u201cold age does \nnot define a \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 group\u201d because it \n\u201cmarks a stage that each of us will reach if we live out \nour normal span.\u201d  427 U.S. at 313-314 (citation omit-\nted).  In City of Cleburne, the Court similarly empha-\nsized that those with mental disabilities are a \u201clarge and \ndiversified group,\u201d and it saw no reason to expect that \nthey faced a distorted political process.  473 U.S. at 442-\n443.  Transgender individuals, in contrast, are a discrete \nminority accounting for roughly one percent of the pop-\nulation.  Pet. 4.  And respondents do not deny that \ntransgender Americans face \u201ca skewed or unfair politi-\ncal process,\u201d Pet. App. 46a\u2014presumably because the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s contrary assertion is refuted by the re-\ncent wave of legislation targeting transgender individu-\nals in many different aspects of life.  Pet. 3 n.1, 8 n.3. \n2. The district court correctly held\u2014consistent with \nevery court to consider the question in the context of a \nsimilar law\u2014that SB1 cannot survive heightened scru-\ntiny.  See Pet. 25-26.  As the district court\u2019s detailed fac-\ntual findings make clear, the record refutes respond-\nents\u2019 assertion that SB1 furthers the State\u2019s interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents; rather, the evi-\ndence shows that when gender-affirming care is pro-\nvided in accordance with prevailing medical standards, \nthe benefits far outweigh any risks.  Pet. App. 181a-\n205a.  Indeed, every major American medical organiza-\ntion agrees that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, \nand can be medically necessary to treat gender dyspho-\nria in transgender adolescents.  Pet. 4-5.  SB1\u2019s sweep-\ning ban, moreover, cannot be described as \u201ctailored\u201d in \nany meaningful sense; SB1 categorically prohibits all \n\n7 \n \navailable medical treatments for all transgender adoles-\ncents suffering from gender dysphoria.  Pet. 26.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not endorse respondents\u2019 argu-\nment that SB1 could survive intermediate scrutiny, nor \ndid it disturb the district court\u2019s factual findings.  And \nin attempting to justify SB1 here, respondents repeat \nfactual assertions rejected by the district court, mis-\ncharacterize the record evidence, and rely on discred-\nited or inapposite data.  A complete response to re-\nspondent\u2019s assertions can await merits briefing, but a \nfew examples illustrate the point. \nRespondents assert (Br. in Opp. 9) that no reliable \nstudies show that gender-affirming care lowers suicide \nrates or improves long-term mental health.  But the dis-\ntrict court joined courts across the country in rejecting \nthat assertion:  \u201c[T]he weight of evidence in the record \nsuggests the contrary\u2014that treatment for gender dys-\nphoria lowers rates of depression, suicide, and addi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a; see Pet. 7; 23-466 Am. Acad. \nof Pediatrics et al. (AAP) Amici Br. 17-20 & nn.55-66 \n(collecting dozens of studies).  Respondents have not \nidentified any data undermining the district court\u2019s de-\ntailed findings.* \n \n*  Respondents highlight (Br. in Opp. 9) a study suggesting that \npeople who have received gender-affirming care have higher rates \nof suicide.  But the study compares individuals who have received \ngender-affirming care to the population as a whole, not to the rele-\nvant comparator group\u2014individuals who experience gender dys-\nphoria but do not receive gender-affirming care.  That distinction \nmatters, because the suicide rate among the transgender population \nis much higher than the general population.  Pet. App. 195a-196a.  \nStudies that focus on the relevant population show that gender-\naffirming care meaningfully reduces the risk of suicide.  See, e.g., \nDiana M. Tordoff, Mental Health Outcomes In Transgender & \n\n8 \n \nRespondents dismiss the medical evidence support-\ning gender-affirming care as \u201clow quality\u201d because it \ndoes not include randomized trials.  Br. in Opp. 9-10, 36 \n(citations omitted).  But as the district court found, the \nevidence supporting gender-affirming care is consistent \nwith the type of evidence relied on in other clinical prac-\ntices throughout the medical community, especially in \nthe pediatric context.  For example, \u201c20% of the Amer-\nican Heart Association\u2019s Guideline for Pediatric Basic \nand Advanced Life Support include strong recommen-\ndations based on evidence of similar quality.\u201d  Pet. App. \n179a. \nRespondents also assert that gender-affirming care \nis associated with various health risks, but the district \ncourt found that most of those risks are not supported \nby evidence.  See, e.g., Pet. App. 188a-189a (bone min-\neralization); id. at 190a (cardiovascular issues); id. at \n192a (cancer).  Again, respondents do not acknowledge, \nmuch less refute, those detailed findings.   \nRespondents also emphasize that hormone therapy \nmay carry a risk of infertility.  But the district court \nfound that many transgender patients who are pre-\nscribed hormone therapy remain fertile, and any risk of \ninfertility is comparable to that associated with other per-\nmitted treatments and can be mitigated in well-established \nways.  Pet. App. 185a-187a; see Pet. 7.  Importantly, \nmoreover, SB1 bans puberty blockers even though re-\nspondents have not identified any evidence suggesting \nthat they pose a risk of infertility.  To extend their in-\nfertility objections to puberty blockers, respondents \n \nNonbinary Youths Receiving Gender-Affirming Care, JAMA Net-\nwork Open (Feb. 25, 2022) (finding \u201c73% lower odds of suicidality\u201d \namong adolescents who had received puberty blockers or hormone \ntherapy). \n\n9 \n \nnote (Br. in Opp. 7) that \u201c[n]early all minors who start \npuberty blockers\u201d later progress to hormone ther-\napy.  But that does not establish any medical risk asso-\nciated with puberty blockers themselves, or any justifi-\ncation for categorically banning them as a treatment for \ngender dysphoria.   \nInstead, respondents\u2019 observation that patients who \nreceive puberty blockers typically progress to hormone \ntherapy simply confirms that adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria find gender-affirming care ben-\neficial and often choose\u2014with their parents and in con-\nsultation with their doctors\u2014to receive additional \ncare.  And that pattern is unsurprising:  adolescents \nmust undergo careful, individualized assessments be-\nfore being prescribed puberty blockers, and it is rare \nfor adolescents with sustained dysphoria to subse-\nquently stop identifying as transgender.  Pet. 5-7. \nRespondents\u2019 reliance on the international landscape \n(Br. in Opp. 3, 10, 35) fares no better.  Transgender  \nadolescents \u201chave access to gender-affirming medical \ncare in developed nations across the world,\u201d including \neach of the countries that respondents cite; SB1 thus \n\u201cmake[s] Tennessee an outlier in the international med-\nical community, not the norm.\u201d  AAP Amici Br. 25-26; \nsee Foreign Non-Profit Organizations Amici Br. 3-12 \n(documenting access to such care in Sweden, the United \nKingdom, Finland, and Norway). \n \nFinally, respondents repeatedly refer to a purported \n\u201csurge\u201d in youth identifying as transgender and seeking \ngender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 1; see, e.g., id. at i, \n4, 15, 34.  But until recently, today\u2019s transgender ado-\nlescents had been growing up in a world where \ntransgender individuals had greater access to appropri-\nate healthcare and faced less (but still significant) \n\n10 \n \ndiscrimination and stigmatization than in earlier decades\n\u2014which would naturally prompt a greater number of ad-\nolescents who would otherwise hide their gender dyspho-\nria to disclose their condition and obtain essential care.  \nSee D. Ct. Doc. 144, at 11-13 (June 1, 2023).  Insofar as \nrespondents mean to invoke their experts\u2019 assertion \nthat this purported \u201csurge\u201d is instead due to \u201csocial con-\ntagion,\u201d their experts relied almost entirely on a publi-\ncation reporting the results of an \u201canonymous online \nsurvey\u201d of parents of transgender youth \u201crecruited \nfrom websites where this notion of \u2018social contagion\u2019 \nleading to transgender identity is popular.\u201d  Id. at 10-\n11; see D. Ct. Doc. 143, at 8-9 (June 1, 2023). \nB. The Question Presented Warrants This Court\u2019s Review \nNow \n1. Respondents do not dispute that the courts of ap-\npeals are divided on the validity of laws like SB1:  The \nSixth and Eleventh Circuits have held that bans on gender-\naffirming care for adolescents trigger only rational-basis \nreview and likely satisfy that standard, but the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed a preliminary injunction against Ar-\nkansas\u2019 ban after applying heightened scrutiny.  See \nPet. 27.   \nRespondents emphasize (Br. in Opp. 17) that pro-\nceedings in the Eighth Circuit are ongoing (as are pro-\nceedings in the Eleventh).  But as respondents recog-\nnize (id. at i), SB1 is part of a recent wave of similar \nlaws.  More than twenty states have enacted such \nlaws\u2014including one since the petition was filed, see \nOhio H.B. 68 (enacted on Jan. 24, 2024, over governor\u2019s \nveto).  Those laws have given rise to suits in federal \ncourts across the country.  See Pet. 28 & n.7.  Nearly \nevery district court to rule has held that such laws are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny and likely invalid\u2014\n\n11 \n \nincluding seven district courts before this petition was \nfiled, and an additional district court in the months \nsince, see Poe v. Labrador, No. 23-cv-269, 2023 WL \n8935065, at *18 (D. Idaho Dec. 26, 2023).   \nAn appeal involving the challenge to Oklahoma\u2019s ban \nwas argued in the Tenth Circuit last month; an appeal \ninvolving a challenge to Indiana\u2019s ban was argued in the \nSeventh Circuit last week; and briefing is underway in \nan appeal pending in the Ninth Circuit.  See Poe v. \nDrummond, No. 23-5110 (10th Cir. argued Jan. 17, \n2024); K.C. v. Medical Licensing Bd., No. 23-2366 (7th \nCir. argued Feb. 16, 2024); Poe v. Labrador, No. 24-142 \n(9th Cir. filed Feb. 6, 2024).  It is thus highly likely that \nthe circuit conflict as to the validity of such bans will \npersist and require this Court\u2019s resolution\u2014a reality \nrespondents do not seriously dispute. \n \nRespondents likewise do not contest that the courts \nof appeals are divided on key premises of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s equal-protection analysis.  See Pet. 28-31.  Those \nconflicts both make it more likely that the conflict over \nbans on gender-affirming care will endure and also in-\ndependently warrant this Court\u2019s review.  Respondents \nobject (Br. in Opp. 18-19) that those conflicts involve de-\ncisions addressing different types of laws, some of \nwhich included alternative holdings.  But respondents \ndo not dispute that if this case had arisen in the Fourth, \nSeventh, or Ninth Circuits, SB1 would have been sub-\nject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. Respondents offer no sound reason to defer this \nCourt\u2019s review.  They do not deny that the relevant legal \nissues have been fully ventilated in the lower courts, in-\ncluding in the decisions below.  Pet. 27-28 & n.7, 32.  Re-\nspondents urge the Court to wait for a case where trial \nproceedings have occurred, but this case was decided on \n\n12 \n \nan extensive evidentiary record\u2014after the parties \nagreed to present expert testimony in writing, Pet. 32\u2014\nand respondents do not point to any additional factual \ndevelopment that could change the outcome here.  \nMeanwhile, delay would prolong the profound harm suf-\nfered by adolescents in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits \nwho have lost access to critical medical care.  And the \npresent patchwork of decisions is imposing grave con-\nsequences on families across the Nation who are being \nforced to make weighty decisions about whether to \nabandon their homes, jobs, schools, and communities in \nthe hopes of preserving access to necessary medical \ncare for their children without knowing whether the \nbans in their State and neighboring States will be up-\nheld or enjoined. \n*  *  *  *  * \n \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the pe-\ntition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

SB1 defines the banned \ntreatments in explicitly sex-based terms:  It forbids pre-\nscribing medications to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, \nor live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the mi-\nnor\u2019s sex\u201d or to treat \u201cdistress from a discordance be-\ntween the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1) (emphases added).  And \nSB1 bluntly declares that it draws those sex-based lines \n\n2 \n \nto \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d as-\nsigned at birth.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nRespondents now disclaim the legislature\u2019s stated \ninterest in discouraging adolescents from identifying as \ntransgender.  Instead, respondents assert that SB1 pro-\ntects adolescents\u2019 health.  But respondents spend most \nof their brief insisting that Tennessee had no obligation \nto substantiate that assertion or to tailor the law\u2019s pro-\nhibition to that interest.  On their view, SB1 must be \nupheld so long as it is not wholly irrational\u2014and, by \nnecessary implication, the same deferential standard \nwould apply to bans on gender-affirming care for adults. \nThat is wrong.  SB1 classifies based on sex\u2014and \nwarrants heightened scrutiny\u2014because its application \ndepends on the regulated individual\u2019s sex.  Someone as-\nsigned female at birth, for example, cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live as a male, but \nsomeone assigned male at birth can.  Respondents \nmaintain (e.g., Br. 2, 16) that SB1 classifies based on \n\u201cmedical purpose,\u201d not sex.  But by their own descrip-\ntion, the banned purpose\u2014\u201cgender transition\u201d (ibid.)\u2014\nis defined by sex.  And respondents\u2019 various other at-\ntempts to secure mere rational-basis review have no \ngrounding in precedent or principle. \nHeightened scrutiny neither prohibits States from \nregulating gender-affirming care nor compels them to \npresume \u201cthat males and females are medically the \nsame\u201d (Resp. Br. 31).  The very premise of heightened \nscrutiny is that \u201cbiological difference[s]\u201d between men \nand women are sometimes a valid basis for legislation.  \nNguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 64 (2001).  A decision rec-\nognizing that SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny would \nthus leave States room to regulate based on such differ-\nences, including by adopting \u201cdiffering approaches to \n\n3 \n \nevolving medical disputes\u201d (Resp. Br. 1).  It would \nsimply require States to show that the lines they draw \nare, in fact, substantially related to their interest in pro-\ntecting adolescent health.  \nRespondents assert that SB1 satisfies that standard, \nbut their cursory analysis fails to grapple with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s factual findings and pervasively relies on a \nselective presentation of extra-record material.  That \nprovides further reason to remand for application of the \ncorrect standard\u2014which could include reopening the \nrecord to evaluate the new material respondents invoke.  \nBut if the Court reaches the issue, it should hold that \nSB1 likely fails heightened scrutiny because Tennessee \nmade no attempt to tailor the law to the State\u2019s asserted \nhealth concerns.  SB1 categorically prohibits an entire \nclass of care for transgender adolescents yet leaves the \nsame medications entirely unrestricted when used for \nany other purpose\u2014and makes no attempt to regulate \na host of other treatments that implicate the State\u2019s as-\nserted interests to an equal or greater degree.  \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \n \nRespondents emphasize (Br. 1-2, 19-20) that States \ngenerally have wide latitude to regulate medicine sub-\nject only to deferential review.  But respondents \nacknowledge (Br. 2) that the Equal Protection Clause \ndemands a more searching judicial inquiry for \u201cdiscrim-\ninatory classifications.\u201d  Respondents\u2019 plea for rational-\nbasis review thus rests on their assertion (ibid.) that \nSB1 \u201cincludes no sex classification.\u201d  That is wrong.  \nAnd because SB1 also discriminates based on trans-\ngender status, it warrants heightened scrutiny twice \nover.  \n\n4 \n \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \n1. As our opening brief explained (at 19-23), a law \nclassifies based on sex if its application to an individual \nturns on that individual\u2019s sex.  At times, respondents \nagree.  They concede, for example, that \u201c[a] law prohib-\niting people from working in professions \u2018inconsistent \nwith\u2019 their sex creates sex-based lines.\u201d  Br. 25 (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  That is because \n\u201cfor some jobs, a male can have the job and a female \ncannot, and vice versa.\u201d  Ibid.  In other words, whether \nan individual can have a given job depends on that indi-\nvidual\u2019s sex. \nSB1 draws precisely that kind of line.  It bans pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014\nthey are provided \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of allowing a minor \nto \u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex,\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender iden-\ntity.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Like a law re-\nstricting professions based on inconsistency with sex, \nSB1 restricts medical care when it would induce effects \ninconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  \nAnd like the hypothetical professions law, SB1\u2019s appli-\ncation depends on sex assigned at birth:  Changing the \nregulated individual\u2019s sex changes the result.   \nConsider medications provided \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \nallowing an adolescent to \u201cidentify\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a male\u2014\nthat is, medications to cause the development of mascu-\nline characteristics (or prevent the development of fem-\ninine characteristics).  Was the patient assigned male at \nbirth?  Permitted.  Assigned female at birth?  Prohib-\nited.  Now take medications provided \u201cfor the purpose\u201d \nof \u201cenabling\u201d an adolescent to \u201cidentify\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a \n\n5 \n \nfemale\u2014that is, medications to cause the development \nof feminine characteristics (or prevent the development \nof masculine characteristics).  SB1\u2019s restriction flips.  \nWas the patient assigned male at birth?  Prohibited.  \nAssigned female at birth?  Permitted.   \nBy its terms, therefore, SB1 \u201cprovides that different \ntreatment be accorded to [individuals] on the basis of \ntheir sex.\u201d  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 75 (1971).  That is \na facial sex classification. \n2. In seeking to avoid that straightforward conclu-\nsion, respondents do not offer any principled theory of \nwhat constitutes a sex-based classification.  And each of \ntheir arguments fails on its own terms. \na. Respondents principally assert (e.g., Br. 23) that, \nalthough SB1 references sex, it classifies based on \n\u201cmedical purpose[]\u201d by prohibiting \u201cgender transition\u201d \nfor \u201cboth boys and girls.\u201d  But unlike respondents\u2019 hy-\npothetical law providing that \u201c[n]either men nor women \nmay drive an automobile without a license\u201d (Br. 24), SB1 \ndoes not merely \u201creference\u201d sex.  That law could simply \nsay:  \u201cNo one may drive an automobile without a li-\ncense.\u201d  SB1, by contrast, uses sex to define the prohib-\nited medical purpose; there is no way to articulate the \nlaw\u2019s prohibition without using sex-based terms. \nRespondents\u2019 preferred formulation illustrates the \npoint.  They say (e.g., Br. 2, 15, 20) that SB1 prohibits \nprescribing medications for the \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u201cgender \ntransition.\u201d  But that is just another way of saying that \nthe law forbids treatments that induce characteristics \ninconsistent with a patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth\u2014that \nis, that SB1\u2019s application depends on the patient\u2019s sex.  \nAnd where, as here, the law\u2019s application changes de-\npending on an individual\u2019s sex, a State cannot avoid \nheightened scrutiny by using other \u201clabels.\u201d  Bostock v. \n\n6 \n \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 664-665 (2020); see, e.g., \nLos Angeles Dep\u2019t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 \nU.S. 702, 713 (1978) (rejecting \u201clongevity\u201d label for pol-\nicy because life expectancy was assessed based on sex). \nRespondents assert (Br. 40) that SB1\u2019s application \ndoes not depend on sex even under Bostock because \nchanging the sex of the patient receiving testosterone \nor estrogen \u201cchanges both sex and medical purpose.\u201d  \nBut Bostock rejected the materially identical argument \nthat changing an employee\u2019s sex \u201cchange[ed] his sexual \norientation too.\u201d  590 U.S. at 671.  Like the prohibited \npurpose of \u201cgender transition,\u201d sexual orientation is de-\nfined by reference to sex, so changing an individual\u2019s \nsex necessarily changes that characteristic as well.1 \nRelatedly, respondents assert (Br. 16) that SB1\u2019s re-\nstriction on puberty blockers cannot classify based on \nsex because \u201cboth males and females take the same \ndrug.\u201d  But that drug is prohibited only if it is provided \n\u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \u201ciden-\ntify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with the \nminor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Be-\ncause someone assigned male at birth cannot receive \npuberty blockers for the purpose of identifying or living \nas a girl, but someone assigned female at birth can (and \n \n1 Respondents also err in asserting (Br. 40) that treatment for \ngender dysphoria involves \u201cdifferent dosages\u201d than other uses of \nthe relevant medications.  Compare, e.g., Seattle Children\u2019s Gen-\nder Clinic Gender-Affirming Hormone Protocols 2, 6, 12 (Feb. \n2023), https://perma.cc/D49P-EH2L, with ACOG, Hormone Ther-\napy \nin \nPrimary \nOvarian \nInsufficiency \n(May \n2017), \nhttps://perma.cc/8TWU-JDUN; Rodolfo A. Rey and Romina P. \nGrinspon, Androgen Treatment in Adolescent Males With Hy-\npogonadism, 14 Am. J. of Men\u2019s Health, at 11 (May 2020); and Lu-\npron, \nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/ \n020263s053lbl.pdf (rev. Apr. 2023). \n\n7 \n \nvice versa), SB1 classifies based on sex as to puberty \nblockers as well. \nRespondents object (Br. 23) that the class regulated \nby SB1 (adolescents seeking the covered medications \nfor \u201cgender transition\u201d) and the class left unregulated \n(adolescents seeking them for \u201cother medical pur-\nposes\u201d) each includes \u201cboth boys and girls.\u201d  But the \nsame could be said of the hypothetical professions law:  \nThe class seeking sex-inconsistent jobs and the class \nseeking sex-consistent jobs each includes both men and \nwomen.  The law nevertheless classifies based on sex \nbecause its application to any individual depends on that \nindividual\u2019s sex:  Men cannot have jobs deemed insuffi-\nciently masculine and women cannot have jobs deemed \ninsufficiently feminine.  So too here.   \nb. Respondents next assert (Br. 25) that \u201cnot all re-\nstrictions on non-conforming behavior involve a sex-\nbased classification.\u201d  But unlike a \u201cdress code that per-\nmits only pants\u201d (ibid.), SB1 is not a sex-neutral rule \nthat incidentally prohibits some gender-nonconforming \nconduct.  Instead, SB1 explicitly classifies based on sex, \nprohibiting treatments to allow adolescents to \u201ciden-\ntify\u201d or \u201clive\u201d in a manner \u201cinconsistent\u201d with their \u201csex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  The proper dress-\ncode analogy is prohibiting clothing \u201cinconsistent with\u201d \nthe wearer\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  And even respond-\nents concede (Br. 25) that such a rule plainly classifies \nbased on sex.   \nc. Respondents next advance (Br. 31-39) a multi-\nstep argument about Bostock.  They begin by assuming \nthe conclusion, declaring (Br. 32) that \u201cSB1 does not fa-\ncially classify by sex.\u201d  Relying on that premise, they \nassert (Br. 2, 32) that our argument uses Bostock to cre-\nate \u201ca novel path\u201d to heightened scrutiny absent a facial \n\n8 \n \nclassification when \u201csome non-sex-based classification \nincorporates sex as a but-for matter.\u201d  And respondents \nmaintain that such an approach would contradict prec-\nedent and lead to adverse consequences.  All of that is \nwrong. \nFirst, we do not contend that SB1 warrants height-\nened scrutiny because it classifies based on a \u201cnon-sex-\nbased characteristic\u201d that has some causal connection \nto sex.  Rather, at the risk of belaboring the point, SB1 \nclassifies based on sex\u2014it says, explicitly, that whether \na minor can receive certain medical care turns on  \nthe minor\u2019s \u201csex\u201d assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1); see pp. 4-7, supra. \nSecond, Bostock used but-for causation the same way \nwe do:  to identify \u201csex-based rules\u201d that facially clas-\nsify based on sex.  590 U.S. at 667.  The question is not, \nas respondents suggest (e.g., Br. 37-38), whether a pol-\nicy has a disparate impact, or whether sex was a but-for \ncause of some other characteristic that triggers the pol-\nicy.  Instead, the question is whether sex itself deter-\nmines how the policy applies:  A policy facially discrim-\ninates based on sex \u201cif changing the employee\u2019s sex \nwould have yielded a different choice by the employer,\u201d \neven if \u201cother factors may contribute to the decision.\u201d  \nId. at 659, 661.   \nThird, there is nothing novel about applying those \n\u201c\u200a\u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019\u200a\u201d but-for principles, Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 656 (citation omitted), in this context.  This \nCourt\u2019s equal-protection decisions have long identified \nsex-based classifications by asking whether changing \nthe plaintiff\u2019s sex would have changed the law\u2019s applica-\ntion.  See, e.g., Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, \n640-641 (1975) (\u201cIf [Mr. Wiesenfeld] had been a woman, \nhe would have received [social-security benefits].\u201d); Orr \n\n9 \n \nv. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 273 (1979) (\u201cMr. Orr bears a burden \nhe would not bear were he female.\u201d).  Respondents dis-\nclaim any argument that sex must be the sole basis for \na law\u2019s application, acknowledging (Br. 25) that \u201c[p]ack-\naging sex classifications with other considerations does \nnot somehow immunize the sex classification from scru-\ntiny.\u201d  And respondents do not offer any test for identi-\nfying a sex-based classification other than asking \nwhether an individual\u2019s sex determines the law\u2019s appli-\ncation. \nFourth, respondents err in asserting (Br. 28, 33-34) \nthat our position is inconsistent with Geduldig v. Aiello, \n417 U.S. 484 (1974).  There, the Court held that alt-\nhough \u201conly women can become pregnant,\u201d a policy \nbased on pregnancy did not facially classify based on \nsex.  Id. at 496 n.20.  Respondents say (Br. 28) that \nGeduldig \u201creject[ed] heightened scrutiny for sex-adja-\ncent restrictions that draw no sex-based lines.\u201d  But \nagain, SB1 is not a \u201csex-adjacent restriction[]\u201d; it ex-\nplicitly draws lines based on \u201csex.\u201d   \nFifth, respondents\u2019 warnings about the implications \nof our position (Br. 37-39) are misplaced.  Because Bos-\ntock used but-for causation to identify disparate treat-\nment, adhering to but-for principles here would not \n\u201copen the door to disparate-impact liability under the \nConstitution\u201d (Resp. Br. 37).  Respondents likewise err \nin invoking (Br. 38) the ongoing debate about the appli-\ncation of sex-specific policies on \u201cbathrooms,\u201d \u201clocker \nrooms,\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s sports\u201d to transgender individu-\nals.  Because those policies unquestionably draw sex-\nbased lines, they will trigger heightened scrutiny even \nif respondents prevail here; the legal issue in those con-\ntexts is not whether a sex-based classification exists, \nbut instead whether the policies are justified under \n\n10 \n \nheightened scrutiny.  See, e.g., Adams v. School Bd. of \nSt. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791, 803 (11th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc) (upholding sex-specific bathroom policy under \n\u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d).  Lastly, applying heightened \nscrutiny to laws like SB1 will not undermine conscience \nrights for \u201cdoctors at State-run hospitals\u201d (Resp. Br. \n38).  SB1\u2019s constitutional flaw is that it draws sex-based \nlines to prohibit doctors from providing care that they, \ntheir patients, and their patients\u2019 parents agree is es-\nsential.  No one suggests that the Equal Protection \nClause could compel doctors to provide gender-affirm-\ning care to which they religiously object. \n3. Although respondents spend much of their brief \ninsisting that SB1 does not classify based on sex at all, \ntheir final argument against heightened scrutiny takes \na different (and contradictory) approach:  They assert \nthat even though SB1 treats boys and girls differently, \nthat differential treatment does not warrant heightened \nscrutiny because \u201cboys and girls \u2018are not similarly situ-\nated\u2019 for purposes of SB1\u2019s restrictions.\u201d  Br. 28 (cita-\ntion omitted).  But a State\u2019s assertion that a sex-based \nclassification is justified has never been a basis for dis-\npensing with heightened scrutiny altogether. \nNo one disputes that legislatures may sometimes \nclassify based on sex when \u201cbiological difference[s]\u201d \nmean that men and women \u201care not similarly situated.\u201d  \nNguyen, 533 U.S. at 57, 63-64.  But as Nguyen and this \nCourt\u2019s other decisions demonstrate, those considera-\ntions are relevant only in determining whether a sex-\nbased classification survives heightened scrutiny.  U.S. \nBr. 24-26.  Indeed, the Court developed the heightened-\nscrutiny framework in large part to test the validity of \nasserted biological justifications for laws treating men \nand women differently.  NWLC Br. 18-21. \n\n11 \n \nRespondents do not cite any decision from this Court \nsuggesting that a court must ask whether the sexes are \nsimilarly situated before applying heightened scrutiny \nto a sex-based classification.  Indeed, the decisions on \nwhich they rely (Resp. Br. 29 & n.1) did not involve fa-\ncial classifications at all.  Respondents also do not ex-\nplain what work heightened scrutiny would do if it ap-\nplied only when courts had already determined that \nmen and women are similarly situated.  The Court \nshould reject respondents\u2019 invitation to add a novel and \nunworkable threshold step to the familiar heightened-\nscrutiny framework.  \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \n \nSB1 also warrants heightened scrutiny because it \ndiscriminates against transgender individuals, who \nqualify as a quasi-suspect class. \n1. Although the Sixth Circuit held that transgender-\nbased classifications do not warrant heightened scru-\ntiny, it did not doubt that SB1 targets transgender indi-\nviduals.  Pet. App. 44a.  Respondents, however, assert \n(Br. 41-44) that SB1 does not discriminate against \ntransgender individuals because\u2014while the law bars \nthem from receiving gender-affirming treatments that \nthey and their doctors deem essential\u2014they may re-\nceive the covered medications for other purposes, such \nas if they happen to have precocious puberty.  That ar-\ngument blinks reality. \nSB1\u2019s text confirms that it \u201cexpressly and exclu-\nsively targets transgender people.\u201d  Pet. App. 152a.  \nThe defining characteristic of transgender individuals \nis that their gender identity does not align with their \nsex assigned at birth.  U.S. Br. 29.  SB1 specifically tar-\ngets \nthat \ncharacteristic, \nprohibiting \ntreatments \n\n12 \n \nintended to allow an adolescent to \u201cidentify with, or live \nas, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  And SB1 ex-\nplicitly seeks to discourage adolescents from identifying \nas transgender, forthrightly asserting a state interest \nin preventing minors from \u201cbecom[ing] disdainful of \ntheir sex\u201d assigned at birth.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nconclusion that SB1 targets transgender individuals \nthus does not rest on any inquiry into unenacted \u201clegis-\nlative motives.\u201d  Resp. Br. 42-43 (citation omitted).  It \nsimply takes the Tennessee legislature at its word.  \n2. Respondents assert (Br. 44-45) that this Court \nshould decline to recognize transgender status as a \nquasi-suspect classification.  But transgender individu-\nals satisfy the established criteria for \u201cextraordinary \nprotection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d \nMassachusetts Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 \n(1976) (per curiam) (citation omitted); see U.S. Br. 29-31.   \nMost obviously, transgender Americans have histor-\nically been subject to discrimination\u2014and such hostility \nis rising rather than abating.  In recent years, States \nacross the Nation have enacted a staggering number of \nlaws targeting transgender individuals.  NAACP Br. 6-\n7.  And the accompanying rhetoric underscores how \ntransgender individuals face a distorted political pro-\ncess.  Legislators have called transgender Americans \n\u201cmutants,\u201d \u201cdemons,\u201d \u201cimps,\u201d \u201cfilth,\u201d and \u201cdelusional.\u201d  \nDoe v. Ladapo, 676 F. Supp. 3d 1205, 1223 n.62 (N.D. \nFla. 2023); NAACP Br. 8; Members of Congress Br. 8-\n9.  That underscores the need for \u201cmore searching eval-\nuation\u201d than bare rationality review, Cleburne v. \nCleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), to en-\nsure that laws targeting transgender individuals do not \nreflect stereotypes or prejudice.   \n\n13 \n \nRespondents\u2019 contrary arguments (Br. 45-48) are \nunpersuasive.  The fact that \u201c[t]he current Administra-\ntion\u201d has sought to protect transgender individuals \nfrom discrimination (Br. 46) does not vitiate the need \nfor heightened judicial scrutiny.  And respondents err \nin invoking Murgia and Cleburne, which declined to \nrecognize age and mental disability as suspect classifi-\ncations.  Murgia emphasized that \u201cold age does not de-\nfine a \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 group\u201d because it \u201cmarks a \nstage that each of us will reach if we live out our normal \nspan.\u201d  427 U.S. at 313-314 (citation omitted).  Similarly, \nCleburne reasoned that individuals with mental disabil-\nities are a \u201clarge and diversified group\u201d that do\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

As every court to consider the issue \nhas recognized, that interest cannot justify a categorical \nban on medical treatments supported by the over-\nwhelming consensus of the medical community.  But the \nSixth Circuit held that courts may not even consider \nwhether the State has substantiated its asserted justi-\nfication; instead, it held that laws like Tennessee\u2019s must \nbe upheld so long as they are not irrational.   \nThat was a profound and consequential error that \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  Tennessee\u2019s SB1, like \nsimilar bans enacted by other States, forthrightly clas-\nsifies based on both sex and transgender status.  By its \nterms, SB1 prohibits all medical treatments intended to \n\n2 \n \nallow \u201ca minor to identify with, or live as, a purported \nidentity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or to treat \n\u201cpurported discomfort or distress from a discordance \nbetween the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity\u201d\u2014but \nSB1 permits the exact same treatments when pre-\nscribed for any other purpose.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-\n33-103(a)(1) (2023).  That focus on sex and gender con-\nformity is deliberate:  SB1 declares that its very pur-\npose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d \nand to bar treatment \u201cthat might encourage minors to \nbecome disdainful of their sex.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  Be-\ncause SB1 classifies based on sex and transgender sta-\ntus, it must satisfy heightened scrutiny.  \n \nRespondents\u2019 efforts to demonstrate that SB1 with-\nstands that scrutiny fall short.  Respondents ignore the \ndistrict court\u2019s detailed factual findings, which the Sixth \nCircuit did not disturb.  Instead, respondents rely on \ntheir own selective and distorted presentation of the ev-\nidence.  And none of respondents\u2019 arguments justifies a \ncategorical ban on care that is consistent with the med-\nical consensus and that the affected adolescents, their \nparents, and their doctors have concluded is appropri-\nate and essential to their wellbeing. \n \nNor do respondents provide any other reason to \ndeny review.  They acknowledge that the Sixth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision conflicts with decisions by other courts of ap-\npeals on both the ultimate validity of laws like SB1 and \non key subsidiary questions.  Given the wave of similar \nlaws adopted in States around the country and the near-\nuniform conclusion by district courts that those laws are \nunconstitutional, respondents cannot plausibly deny \nthat this Court will ultimately have to resolve those cir-\ncuit conflicts.  Delaying that authoritative resolution \nwould needlessly leave transgender adolescents and \n\n3 \n \ntheir families in limbo and inflict particularly acute \nharm in Tennessee and other States where these laws \nhave taken effect.   \nA. The Decision Below Is Incorrect \n1. Respondents offer no persuasive defense of the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s conclusion that SB1 is subject only to \ndeferential rational-basis review. \na. In insisting that SB1 does not classify based on \nsex, respondents repeat the Sixth Circuit\u2019s errors.  \nThey assert that SB1\u2019s express references to sex should \nbe disregarded because SB1 prohibits \u201csex-transition \ntreatments for all minors, regardless of sex.\u201d  Br. in \nOpp. 22 (quoting Pet. App. 35a).  But respondents do not \ndispute that the application of SB1 to any particular in-\ndividual turns on that individual\u2019s sex.  And this Court \nhas already rejected the argument that a law that clas-\nsifies based on race or sex can escape heightened review \nby targeting members of all races or both sexes equally.  \nSee Pet. 18, 20-21 (citing, e.g., J.E.B. v. Alabama, 511 \nU.S. 127, 136 (1994), and Johnson v. California, 543 \nU.S. 499, 506 (2005)).  Respondents do not respond to \nour citation of J.E.B. or Johnson, let alone try to recon-\ncile their forgiving approach to sex-based line-drawing \nwith the rule this Court has consistently enforced. \nRespondents invoke (Br. in Opp. 24-25) this Court\u2019s \nholding that, absent evidence of pretext, laws regulat-\ning medical procedures that \u201conly one sex can undergo\u201d \ndo not trigger heightened scrutiny under the Equal \nProtection Clause.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health \nOrg., 597 U.S. 215, 236 (2022).  But as we have explained \n(Pet. 22), SB1 regulates procedures that all individuals \ncan undergo, regardless of their sex:  Healthcare  \nproviders cannot perform an abortion on a cisgender \nman, but they can prescribe \u201cpuberty blocker[s]\u201d or \n\n4 \n \n\u201chormone[s],\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B) (2023), \nto any person, regardless of sex assigned at birth.  In-\ndeed, that is why the law speaks in explicit sex-based \nterms, prohibiting providers from prescribing treat-\nments only \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling a minor to \nidentify with, or live as, a purported identity incon-\nsistent with the minor\u2019s sex\u201d or \u201c[t]reating purported \ndiscomfort or distress from a discordance between the \nminor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1); \nsee id. \u00a7 68-33-102(5)(B).  That language is necessary to \nensure that the targeted treatments\u2014which can be \ngiven to members of both sexes\u2014are prohibited only \nwhen prescribed to treat gender dysphoria.  \nChanging tack, respondents assert that despite this \nCourt\u2019s holding that \u201call gender-based classifications\u201d \nwarrant \u201cheightened scrutiny,\u201d United States v. Vir-\nginia, 518 U.S. 515, 555 (1996) (VMI\u200a) (citation omitted), \nsome such classifications do not.  Respondents put the \npoint in different ways, but all of them reduce to the \nsame basic error:  Respondents seek to avoid height-\nened scrutiny altogether by invoking considerations \nthat are relevant only in determining whether a sex-\nbased classification withstands the scrutiny this Court\u2019s \nprecedents require.  \nRespondents assert (Br. in Opp. 23), for example, \nthat SB1 does not treat \u201csimilarly situated individuals \ndifferently based on their sex\u201d because an adolescent \nboy receiving testosterone to \u201ccorrect a deficiency\u201d is \nnot \u201csimilarly situated to an adolescent girl suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria\u201d who receives testosterone to al-\nleviate distress from that condition.  Respondents also \nmaintain (ibid.) that the cost-benefit calculus for pre-\nscribing puberty blockers and hormones to treat gender \ndysphoria is different than the calculus for prescribing \n\n5 \n \nthem to treat other conditions.  But those are just dif-\nferent ways of saying that respondents believe that \nSB1\u2019s sex-based classifications are justified by biologi-\ncal differences between the sexes.  And as we have ex-\nplained (Pet. 20-22), when a legislature classifies based \non sex, heightened scrutiny applies even if the legisla-\nture asserts that it had a good reason to do so\u2014indeed, \nthe whole point of heightened scrutiny is to give courts \na principled yardstick for measuring such justifications.   \nLike the Sixth Circuit, respondents emphasize (Br. \nin Opp. 24) VMI\u200a\u2019s recognition of \u201cenduring\u201d physical \ndifferences between men and women.  518 U.S. at 533.  \nBut VMI simply makes clear that those differences \nmean that sex-based lines will sometimes withstand \nheightened scrutiny; it does not suggest that courts can \nabandon heightened scrutiny altogether whenever a \nchallenged law purports to rest on biology.  Pet. 21-22.  \nRespondents cannot reconcile their contrary view with \nNguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53 (2001), where this Court ap-\nplied heightened scrutiny to a law it described as based \non the \u201cbiological\u201d reality that \u201c[f\u200a]athers and mothers \nare not similarly situated with regard to the proof of bi-\nological parenthood.\u201d  Id. at 63-64. \nb. SB1 also discriminates based on transgender sta-\ntus, restricting care only for transgender individuals \nsuffering from gender dysphoria.  Pet. 19, 24-25.  In re-\nsponse, respondents principally argue (Br. in Opp. 27-\n29) that transgender status is not a quasi-suspect clas-\nsification warranting heightened scrutiny, citing Mas-\nsachusetts Board of Retirement v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307 \n(1976) (per curiam), and City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985).  But those  \ndecisions\u2014which held that age and mental disability, \n\n6 \n \nrespectively, are not suspect classes\u2014only reinforce \nthe distinct nature of the classification at issue here.   \nIn Murgia, the Court emphasized that \u201cold age does \nnot define a \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 group\u201d because it \n\u201cmarks a stage that each of us will reach if we live out \nour normal span.\u201d  427 U.S. at 313-314 (citation omit-\nted).  In City of Cleburne, the Court similarly empha-\nsized that those with mental disabilities are a \u201clarge and \ndiversified group,\u201d and it saw no reason to expect that \nthey faced a distorted political process.  473 U.S. at 442-\n443.  Transgender individuals, in contrast, are a discrete \nminority accounting for roughly one percent of the pop-\nulation.  Pet. 4.  And respondents do not deny that \ntransgender Americans face \u201ca skewed or unfair politi-\ncal process,\u201d Pet. App. 46a\u2014presumably because the \nSixth Circuit\u2019s contrary assertion is refuted by the re-\ncent wave of legislation targeting transgender individu-\nals in many different aspects of life.  Pet. 3 n.1, 8 n.3. \n2. The district court correctly held\u2014consistent with \nevery court to consider the question in the context of a \nsimilar law\u2014that SB1 cannot survive heightened scru-\ntiny.  See Pet. 25-26.  As the district court\u2019s detailed fac-\ntual findings make clear, the record refutes respond-\nents\u2019 assertion that SB1 furthers the State\u2019s interest in \nprotecting transgender adolescents; rather, the evi-\ndence shows that when gender-affirming care is pro-\nvided in accordance with prevailing medical standards, \nthe benefits far outweigh any risks.  Pet. App. 181a-\n205a.  Indeed, every major American medical organiza-\ntion agrees that gender-affirming care is safe, effective, \nand can be medically necessary to treat gender dyspho-\nria in transgender adolescents.  Pet. 4-5.  SB1\u2019s sweep-\ning ban, moreover, cannot be described as \u201ctailored\u201d in \nany meaningful sense; SB1 categorically prohibits all \n\n7 \n \navailable medical treatments for all transgender adoles-\ncents suffering from gender dysphoria.  Pet. 26.   \nThe Sixth Circuit did not endorse respondents\u2019 argu-\nment that SB1 could survive intermediate scrutiny, nor \ndid it disturb the district court\u2019s factual findings.  And \nin attempting to justify SB1 here, respondents repeat \nfactual assertions rejected by the district court, mis-\ncharacterize the record evidence, and rely on discred-\nited or inapposite data.  A complete response to re-\nspondent\u2019s assertions can await merits briefing, but a \nfew examples illustrate the point. \nRespondents assert (Br. in Opp. 9) that no reliable \nstudies show that gender-affirming care lowers suicide \nrates or improves long-term mental health.  But the dis-\ntrict court joined courts across the country in rejecting \nthat assertion:  \u201c[T]he weight of evidence in the record \nsuggests the contrary\u2014that treatment for gender dys-\nphoria lowers rates of depression, suicide, and addi-\ntional mental health issues faced by transgender indi-\nviduals.\u201d  Pet. App. 196a; see Pet. 7; 23-466 Am. Acad. \nof Pediatrics et al. (AAP) Amici Br. 17-20 & nn.55-66 \n(collecting dozens of studies).  Respondents have not \nidentified any data undermining the district court\u2019s de-\ntailed findings.* \n \n*  Respondents highlight (Br. in Opp. 9) a study suggesting that \npeople who have received gender-affirming care have higher rates \nof suicide.  But the study compares individuals who have received \ngender-affirming care to the population as a whole, not to the rele-\nvant comparator group\u2014individuals who experience gender dys-\nphoria but do not receive gender-affirming care.  That distinction \nmatters, because the suicide rate among the transgender population \nis much higher than the general population.  Pet. App. 195a-196a.  \nStudies that focus on the relevant population show that gender-\naffirming care meaningfully reduces the risk of suicide.  See, e.g., \nDiana M. Tordoff, Mental Health Outcomes In Transgender & \n\n8 \n \nRespondents dismiss the medical evidence support-\ning gender-affirming care as \u201clow quality\u201d because it \ndoes not include randomized trials.  Br. in Opp. 9-10, 36 \n(citations omitted).  But as the district court found, the \nevidence supporting gender-affirming care is consistent \nwith the type of evidence relied on in other clinical prac-\ntices throughout the medical community, especially in \nthe pediatric context.  For example, \u201c20% of the Amer-\nican Heart Association\u2019s Guideline for Pediatric Basic \nand Advanced Life Support include strong recommen-\ndations based on evidence of similar quality.\u201d  Pet. App. \n179a. \nRespondents also assert that gender-affirming care \nis associated with various health risks, but the district \ncourt found that most of those risks are not supported \nby evidence.  See, e.g., Pet. App. 188a-189a (bone min-\neralization); id. at 190a (cardiovascular issues); id. at \n192a (cancer).  Again, respondents do not acknowledge, \nmuch less refute, those detailed findings.   \nRespondents also emphasize that hormone therapy \nmay carry a risk of infertility.  But the district court \nfound that many transgender patients who are pre-\nscribed hormone therapy remain fertile, and any risk of \ninfertility is comparable to that associated with other per-\nmitted treatments and can be mitigated in well-established \nways.  Pet. App. 185a-187a; see Pet. 7.  Importantly, \nmoreover, SB1 bans puberty blockers even though re-\nspondents have not identified any evidence suggesting \nthat they pose a risk of infertility.  To extend their in-\nfertility objections to puberty blockers, respondents \n \nNonbinary Youths Receiving Gender-Affirming Care, JAMA Net-\nwork Open (Feb. 25, 2022) (finding \u201c73% lower odds of suicidality\u201d \namong adolescents who had received puberty blockers or hormone \ntherapy). \n\n9 \n \nnote (Br. in Opp. 7) that \u201c[n]early all minors who start \npuberty blockers\u201d later progress to hormone ther-\napy.  But that does not establish any medical risk asso-\nciated with puberty blockers themselves, or any justifi-\ncation for categorically banning them as a treatment for \ngender dysphoria.   \nInstead, respondents\u2019 observation that patients who \nreceive puberty blockers typically progress to hormone \ntherapy simply confirms that adolescents suffering \nfrom gender dysphoria find gender-affirming care ben-\neficial and often choose\u2014with their parents and in con-\nsultation with their doctors\u2014to receive additional \ncare.  And that pattern is unsurprising:  adolescents \nmust undergo careful, individualized assessments be-\nfore being prescribed puberty blockers, and it is rare \nfor adolescents with sustained dysphoria to subse-\nquently stop identifying as transgender.  Pet. 5-7. \nRespondents\u2019 reliance on the international landscape \n(Br. in Opp. 3, 10, 35) fares no better.  Transgender  \nadolescents \u201chave access to gender-affirming medical \ncare in developed nations across the world,\u201d including \neach of the countries that respondents cite; SB1 thus \n\u201cmake[s] Tennessee an outlier in the international med-\nical community, not the norm.\u201d  AAP Amici Br. 25-26; \nsee Foreign Non-Profit Organizations Amici Br. 3-12 \n(documenting access to such care in Sweden, the United \nKingdom, Finland, and Norway). \n \nFinally, respondents repeatedly refer to a purported \n\u201csurge\u201d in youth identifying as transgender and seeking \ngender-affirming care.  Br. in Opp. 1; see, e.g., id. at i, \n4, 15, 34.  But until recently, today\u2019s transgender ado-\nlescents had been growing up in a world where \ntransgender individuals had greater access to appropri-\nate healthcare and faced less (but still significant) \n\n10 \n \ndiscrimination and stigmatization than in earlier decades\n\u2014which would naturally prompt a greater number of ad-\nolescents who would otherwise hide their gender dyspho-\nria to disclose their condition and obtain essential care.  \nSee D. Ct. Doc. 144, at 11-13 (June 1, 2023).  Insofar as \nrespondents mean to invoke their experts\u2019 assertion \nthat this purported \u201csurge\u201d is instead due to \u201csocial con-\ntagion,\u201d their experts relied almost entirely on a publi-\ncation reporting the results of an \u201canonymous online \nsurvey\u201d of parents of transgender youth \u201crecruited \nfrom websites where this notion of \u2018social contagion\u2019 \nleading to transgender identity is popular.\u201d  Id. at 10-\n11; see D. Ct. Doc. 143, at 8-9 (June 1, 2023). \nB. The Question Presented Warrants This Court\u2019s Review \nNow \n1. Respondents do not dispute that the courts of ap-\npeals are divided on the validity of laws like SB1:  The \nSixth and Eleventh Circuits have held that bans on gender-\naffirming care for adolescents trigger only rational-basis \nreview and likely satisfy that standard, but the Eighth \nCircuit affirmed a preliminary injunction against Ar-\nkansas\u2019 ban after applying heightened scrutiny.  See \nPet. 27.   \nRespondents emphasize (Br. in Opp. 17) that pro-\nceedings in the Eighth Circuit are ongoing (as are pro-\nceedings in the Eleventh).  But as respondents recog-\nnize (id. at i), SB1 is part of a recent wave of similar \nlaws.  More than twenty states have enacted such \nlaws\u2014including one since the petition was filed, see \nOhio H.B. 68 (enacted on Jan. 24, 2024, over governor\u2019s \nveto).  Those laws have given rise to suits in federal \ncourts across the country.  See Pet. 28 & n.7.  Nearly \nevery district court to rule has held that such laws are \nsubject to heightened scrutiny and likely invalid\u2014\n\n11 \n \nincluding seven district courts before this petition was \nfiled, and an additional district court in the months \nsince, see Poe v. Labrador, No. 23-cv-269, 2023 WL \n8935065, at *18 (D. Idaho Dec. 26, 2023).   \nAn appeal involving the challenge to Oklahoma\u2019s ban \nwas argued in the Tenth Circuit last month; an appeal \ninvolving a challenge to Indiana\u2019s ban was argued in the \nSeventh Circuit last week; and briefing is underway in \nan appeal pending in the Ninth Circuit.  See Poe v. \nDrummond, No. 23-5110 (10th Cir. argued Jan. 17, \n2024); K.C. v. Medical Licensing Bd., No. 23-2366 (7th \nCir. argued Feb. 16, 2024); Poe v. Labrador, No. 24-142 \n(9th Cir. filed Feb. 6, 2024).  It is thus highly likely that \nthe circuit conflict as to the validity of such bans will \npersist and require this Court\u2019s resolution\u2014a reality \nrespondents do not seriously dispute. \n \nRespondents likewise do not contest that the courts \nof appeals are divided on key premises of the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s equal-protection analysis.  See Pet. 28-31.  Those \nconflicts both make it more likely that the conflict over \nbans on gender-affirming care will endure and also in-\ndependently warrant this Court\u2019s review.  Respondents \nobject (Br. in Opp. 18-19) that those conflicts involve de-\ncisions addressing different types of laws, some of \nwhich included alternative holdings.  But respondents \ndo not dispute that if this case had arisen in the Fourth, \nSeventh, or Ninth Circuits, SB1 would have been sub-\nject to heightened scrutiny. \n2. Respondents offer no sound reason to defer this \nCourt\u2019s review.  They do not deny that the relevant legal \nissues have been fully ventilated in the lower courts, in-\ncluding in the decisions below.  Pet. 27-28 & n.7, 32.  Re-\nspondents urge the Court to wait for a case where trial \nproceedings have occurred, but this case was decided on \n\n12 \n \nan extensive evidentiary record\u2014after the parties \nagreed to present expert testimony in writing, Pet. 32\u2014\nand respondents do not point to any additional factual \ndevelopment that could change the outcome here.  \nMeanwhile, delay would prolong the profound harm suf-\nfered by adolescents in the Sixth and Eleventh Circuits \nwho have lost access to critical medical care.  And the \npresent patchwork of decisions is imposing grave con-\nsequences on families across the Nation who are being \nforced to make weighty decisions about whether to \nabandon their homes, jobs, schools, and communities in \nthe hopes of preserving access to necessary medical \ncare for their children without knowing whether the \nbans in their State and neighboring States will be up-\nheld or enjoined. \n*  *  *  *  * \n \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the pe-\ntition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

SB1 defines the banned \ntreatments in explicitly sex-based terms:  It forbids pre-\nscribing medications to allow \u201ca minor to identify with, \nor live as, a purported identity inconsistent with the mi-\nnor\u2019s sex\u201d or to treat \u201cdistress from a discordance be-\ntween the minor\u2019s sex and asserted identity.\u201d  Tenn. \nCode Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1) (emphases added).  And \nSB1 bluntly declares that it draws those sex-based lines \n\n2 \n \nto \u201cencourag[e] minors to appreciate their sex\u201d as-\nsigned at birth.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).   \nRespondents now disclaim the legislature\u2019s stated \ninterest in discouraging adolescents from identifying as \ntransgender.  Instead, respondents assert that SB1 pro-\ntects adolescents\u2019 health.  But respondents spend most \nof their brief insisting that Tennessee had no obligation \nto substantiate that assertion or to tailor the law\u2019s pro-\nhibition to that interest.  On their view, SB1 must be \nupheld so long as it is not wholly irrational\u2014and, by \nnecessary implication, the same deferential standard \nwould apply to bans on gender-affirming care for adults. \nThat is wrong.  SB1 classifies based on sex\u2014and \nwarrants heightened scrutiny\u2014because its application \ndepends on the regulated individual\u2019s sex.  Someone as-\nsigned female at birth, for example, cannot receive pu-\nberty blockers or testosterone to live as a male, but \nsomeone assigned male at birth can.  Respondents \nmaintain (e.g., Br. 2, 16) that SB1 classifies based on \n\u201cmedical purpose,\u201d not sex.  But by their own descrip-\ntion, the banned purpose\u2014\u201cgender transition\u201d (ibid.)\u2014\nis defined by sex.  And respondents\u2019 various other at-\ntempts to secure mere rational-basis review have no \ngrounding in precedent or principle. \nHeightened scrutiny neither prohibits States from \nregulating gender-affirming care nor compels them to \npresume \u201cthat males and females are medically the \nsame\u201d (Resp. Br. 31).  The very premise of heightened \nscrutiny is that \u201cbiological difference[s]\u201d between men \nand women are sometimes a valid basis for legislation.  \nNguyen v. INS, 533 U.S. 53, 64 (2001).  A decision rec-\nognizing that SB1 warrants heightened scrutiny would \nthus leave States room to regulate based on such differ-\nences, including by adopting \u201cdiffering approaches to \n\n3 \n \nevolving medical disputes\u201d (Resp. Br. 1).  It would \nsimply require States to show that the lines they draw \nare, in fact, substantially related to their interest in pro-\ntecting adolescent health.  \nRespondents assert that SB1 satisfies that standard, \nbut their cursory analysis fails to grapple with the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s factual findings and pervasively relies on a \nselective presentation of extra-record material.  That \nprovides further reason to remand for application of the \ncorrect standard\u2014which could include reopening the \nrecord to evaluate the new material respondents invoke.  \nBut if the Court reaches the issue, it should hold that \nSB1 likely fails heightened scrutiny because Tennessee \nmade no attempt to tailor the law to the State\u2019s asserted \nhealth concerns.  SB1 categorically prohibits an entire \nclass of care for transgender adolescents yet leaves the \nsame medications entirely unrestricted when used for \nany other purpose\u2014and makes no attempt to regulate \na host of other treatments that implicate the State\u2019s as-\nserted interests to an equal or greater degree.  \nI. SB1 WARRANTS HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \n \nRespondents emphasize (Br. 1-2, 19-20) that States \ngenerally have wide latitude to regulate medicine sub-\nject only to deferential review.  But respondents \nacknowledge (Br. 2) that the Equal Protection Clause \ndemands a more searching judicial inquiry for \u201cdiscrim-\ninatory classifications.\u201d  Respondents\u2019 plea for rational-\nbasis review thus rests on their assertion (ibid.) that \nSB1 \u201cincludes no sex classification.\u201d  That is wrong.  \nAnd because SB1 also discriminates based on trans-\ngender status, it warrants heightened scrutiny twice \nover.  \n\n4 \n \nA. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Classi-\nfies Based On Sex  \n1. As our opening brief explained (at 19-23), a law \nclassifies based on sex if its application to an individual \nturns on that individual\u2019s sex.  At times, respondents \nagree.  They concede, for example, that \u201c[a] law prohib-\niting people from working in professions \u2018inconsistent \nwith\u2019 their sex creates sex-based lines.\u201d  Br. 25 (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  That is because \n\u201cfor some jobs, a male can have the job and a female \ncannot, and vice versa.\u201d  Ibid.  In other words, whether \nan individual can have a given job depends on that indi-\nvidual\u2019s sex. \nSB1 draws precisely that kind of line.  It bans pu-\nberty blockers and hormone therapy if\u2014and only if\u2014\nthey are provided \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of allowing a minor \nto \u201cidentify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent \nwith the minor\u2019s sex,\u201d or treating distress \u201cfrom a dis-\ncordance between the minor\u2019s sex\u201d and gender iden-\ntity.  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Like a law re-\nstricting professions based on inconsistency with sex, \nSB1 restricts medical care when it would induce effects \ninconsistent with an individual\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  \nAnd like the hypothetical professions law, SB1\u2019s appli-\ncation depends on sex assigned at birth:  Changing the \nregulated individual\u2019s sex changes the result.   \nConsider medications provided \u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \nallowing an adolescent to \u201cidentify\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a male\u2014\nthat is, medications to cause the development of mascu-\nline characteristics (or prevent the development of fem-\ninine characteristics).  Was the patient assigned male at \nbirth?  Permitted.  Assigned female at birth?  Prohib-\nited.  Now take medications provided \u201cfor the purpose\u201d \nof \u201cenabling\u201d an adolescent to \u201cidentify\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a \n\n5 \n \nfemale\u2014that is, medications to cause the development \nof feminine characteristics (or prevent the development \nof masculine characteristics).  SB1\u2019s restriction flips.  \nWas the patient assigned male at birth?  Prohibited.  \nAssigned female at birth?  Permitted.   \nBy its terms, therefore, SB1 \u201cprovides that different \ntreatment be accorded to [individuals] on the basis of \ntheir sex.\u201d  Reed v. Reed, 404 U.S. 71, 75 (1971).  That is \na facial sex classification. \n2. In seeking to avoid that straightforward conclu-\nsion, respondents do not offer any principled theory of \nwhat constitutes a sex-based classification.  And each of \ntheir arguments fails on its own terms. \na. Respondents principally assert (e.g., Br. 23) that, \nalthough SB1 references sex, it classifies based on \n\u201cmedical purpose[]\u201d by prohibiting \u201cgender transition\u201d \nfor \u201cboth boys and girls.\u201d  But unlike respondents\u2019 hy-\npothetical law providing that \u201c[n]either men nor women \nmay drive an automobile without a license\u201d (Br. 24), SB1 \ndoes not merely \u201creference\u201d sex.  That law could simply \nsay:  \u201cNo one may drive an automobile without a li-\ncense.\u201d  SB1, by contrast, uses sex to define the prohib-\nited medical purpose; there is no way to articulate the \nlaw\u2019s prohibition without using sex-based terms. \nRespondents\u2019 preferred formulation illustrates the \npoint.  They say (e.g., Br. 2, 15, 20) that SB1 prohibits \nprescribing medications for the \u201cpurpose\u201d of \u201cgender \ntransition.\u201d  But that is just another way of saying that \nthe law forbids treatments that induce characteristics \ninconsistent with a patient\u2019s sex assigned at birth\u2014that \nis, that SB1\u2019s application depends on the patient\u2019s sex.  \nAnd where, as here, the law\u2019s application changes de-\npending on an individual\u2019s sex, a State cannot avoid \nheightened scrutiny by using other \u201clabels.\u201d  Bostock v. \n\n6 \n \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 664-665 (2020); see, e.g., \nLos Angeles Dep\u2019t of Water & Power v. Manhart, 435 \nU.S. 702, 713 (1978) (rejecting \u201clongevity\u201d label for pol-\nicy because life expectancy was assessed based on sex). \nRespondents assert (Br. 40) that SB1\u2019s application \ndoes not depend on sex even under Bostock because \nchanging the sex of the patient receiving testosterone \nor estrogen \u201cchanges both sex and medical purpose.\u201d  \nBut Bostock rejected the materially identical argument \nthat changing an employee\u2019s sex \u201cchange[ed] his sexual \norientation too.\u201d  590 U.S. at 671.  Like the prohibited \npurpose of \u201cgender transition,\u201d sexual orientation is de-\nfined by reference to sex, so changing an individual\u2019s \nsex necessarily changes that characteristic as well.1 \nRelatedly, respondents assert (Br. 16) that SB1\u2019s re-\nstriction on puberty blockers cannot classify based on \nsex because \u201cboth males and females take the same \ndrug.\u201d  But that drug is prohibited only if it is provided \n\u201cfor the purpose\u201d of \u201c[e]nabling\u201d an adolescent to \u201ciden-\ntify with\u201d or \u201clive as\u201d a gender \u201cinconsistent with the \nminor\u2019s sex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  Be-\ncause someone assigned male at birth cannot receive \npuberty blockers for the purpose of identifying or living \nas a girl, but someone assigned female at birth can (and \n \n1 Respondents also err in asserting (Br. 40) that treatment for \ngender dysphoria involves \u201cdifferent dosages\u201d than other uses of \nthe relevant medications.  Compare, e.g., Seattle Children\u2019s Gen-\nder Clinic Gender-Affirming Hormone Protocols 2, 6, 12 (Feb. \n2023), https://perma.cc/D49P-EH2L, with ACOG, Hormone Ther-\napy \nin \nPrimary \nOvarian \nInsufficiency \n(May \n2017), \nhttps://perma.cc/8TWU-JDUN; Rodolfo A. Rey and Romina P. \nGrinspon, Androgen Treatment in Adolescent Males With Hy-\npogonadism, 14 Am. J. of Men\u2019s Health, at 11 (May 2020); and Lu-\npron, \nhttps://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2023/ \n020263s053lbl.pdf (rev. Apr. 2023). \n\n7 \n \nvice versa), SB1 classifies based on sex as to puberty \nblockers as well. \nRespondents object (Br. 23) that the class regulated \nby SB1 (adolescents seeking the covered medications \nfor \u201cgender transition\u201d) and the class left unregulated \n(adolescents seeking them for \u201cother medical pur-\nposes\u201d) each includes \u201cboth boys and girls.\u201d  But the \nsame could be said of the hypothetical professions law:  \nThe class seeking sex-inconsistent jobs and the class \nseeking sex-consistent jobs each includes both men and \nwomen.  The law nevertheless classifies based on sex \nbecause its application to any individual depends on that \nindividual\u2019s sex:  Men cannot have jobs deemed insuffi-\nciently masculine and women cannot have jobs deemed \ninsufficiently feminine.  So too here.   \nb. Respondents next assert (Br. 25) that \u201cnot all re-\nstrictions on non-conforming behavior involve a sex-\nbased classification.\u201d  But unlike a \u201cdress code that per-\nmits only pants\u201d (ibid.), SB1 is not a sex-neutral rule \nthat incidentally prohibits some gender-nonconforming \nconduct.  Instead, SB1 explicitly classifies based on sex, \nprohibiting treatments to allow adolescents to \u201ciden-\ntify\u201d or \u201clive\u201d in a manner \u201cinconsistent\u201d with their \u201csex.\u201d  \nTenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  The proper dress-\ncode analogy is prohibiting clothing \u201cinconsistent with\u201d \nthe wearer\u2019s sex assigned at birth.  And even respond-\nents concede (Br. 25) that such a rule plainly classifies \nbased on sex.   \nc. Respondents next advance (Br. 31-39) a multi-\nstep argument about Bostock.  They begin by assuming \nthe conclusion, declaring (Br. 32) that \u201cSB1 does not fa-\ncially classify by sex.\u201d  Relying on that premise, they \nassert (Br. 2, 32) that our argument uses Bostock to cre-\nate \u201ca novel path\u201d to heightened scrutiny absent a facial \n\n8 \n \nclassification when \u201csome non-sex-based classification \nincorporates sex as a but-for matter.\u201d  And respondents \nmaintain that such an approach would contradict prec-\nedent and lead to adverse consequences.  All of that is \nwrong. \nFirst, we do not contend that SB1 warrants height-\nened scrutiny because it classifies based on a \u201cnon-sex-\nbased characteristic\u201d that has some causal connection \nto sex.  Rather, at the risk of belaboring the point, SB1 \nclassifies based on sex\u2014it says, explicitly, that whether \na minor can receive certain medical care turns on  \nthe minor\u2019s \u201csex\u201d assigned at birth.  Tenn. Code Ann.  \n\u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1); see pp. 4-7, supra. \nSecond, Bostock used but-for causation the same way \nwe do:  to identify \u201csex-based rules\u201d that facially clas-\nsify based on sex.  590 U.S. at 667.  The question is not, \nas respondents suggest (e.g., Br. 37-38), whether a pol-\nicy has a disparate impact, or whether sex was a but-for \ncause of some other characteristic that triggers the pol-\nicy.  Instead, the question is whether sex itself deter-\nmines how the policy applies:  A policy facially discrim-\ninates based on sex \u201cif changing the employee\u2019s sex \nwould have yielded a different choice by the employer,\u201d \neven if \u201cother factors may contribute to the decision.\u201d  \nId. at 659, 661.   \nThird, there is nothing novel about applying those \n\u201c\u200a\u2018simple\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019\u200a\u201d but-for principles, Bostock, \n590 U.S. at 656 (citation omitted), in this context.  This \nCourt\u2019s equal-protection decisions have long identified \nsex-based classifications by asking whether changing \nthe plaintiff\u2019s sex would have changed the law\u2019s applica-\ntion.  See, e.g., Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, 420 U.S. 636, \n640-641 (1975) (\u201cIf [Mr. Wiesenfeld] had been a woman, \nhe would have received [social-security benefits].\u201d); Orr \n\n9 \n \nv. Orr, 440 U.S. 268, 273 (1979) (\u201cMr. Orr bears a burden \nhe would not bear were he female.\u201d).  Respondents dis-\nclaim any argument that sex must be the sole basis for \na law\u2019s application, acknowledging (Br. 25) that \u201c[p]ack-\naging sex classifications with other considerations does \nnot somehow immunize the sex classification from scru-\ntiny.\u201d  And respondents do not offer any test for identi-\nfying a sex-based classification other than asking \nwhether an individual\u2019s sex determines the law\u2019s appli-\ncation. \nFourth, respondents err in asserting (Br. 28, 33-34) \nthat our position is inconsistent with Geduldig v. Aiello, \n417 U.S. 484 (1974).  There, the Court held that alt-\nhough \u201conly women can become pregnant,\u201d a policy \nbased on pregnancy did not facially classify based on \nsex.  Id. at 496 n.20.  Respondents say (Br. 28) that \nGeduldig \u201creject[ed] heightened scrutiny for sex-adja-\ncent restrictions that draw no sex-based lines.\u201d  But \nagain, SB1 is not a \u201csex-adjacent restriction[]\u201d; it ex-\nplicitly draws lines based on \u201csex.\u201d   \nFifth, respondents\u2019 warnings about the implications \nof our position (Br. 37-39) are misplaced.  Because Bos-\ntock used but-for causation to identify disparate treat-\nment, adhering to but-for principles here would not \n\u201copen the door to disparate-impact liability under the \nConstitution\u201d (Resp. Br. 37).  Respondents likewise err \nin invoking (Br. 38) the ongoing debate about the appli-\ncation of sex-specific policies on \u201cbathrooms,\u201d \u201clocker \nrooms,\u201d and \u201cwomen\u2019s sports\u201d to transgender individu-\nals.  Because those policies unquestionably draw sex-\nbased lines, they will trigger heightened scrutiny even \nif respondents prevail here; the legal issue in those con-\ntexts is not whether a sex-based classification exists, \nbut instead whether the policies are justified under \n\n10 \n \nheightened scrutiny.  See, e.g., Adams v. School Bd. of \nSt. Johns County, 57 F.4th 791, 803 (11th Cir. 2022) (en \nbanc) (upholding sex-specific bathroom policy under \n\u201cintermediate scrutiny\u201d).  Lastly, applying heightened \nscrutiny to laws like SB1 will not undermine conscience \nrights for \u201cdoctors at State-run hospitals\u201d (Resp. Br. \n38).  SB1\u2019s constitutional flaw is that it draws sex-based \nlines to prohibit doctors from providing care that they, \ntheir patients, and their patients\u2019 parents agree is es-\nsential.  No one suggests that the Equal Protection \nClause could compel doctors to provide gender-affirm-\ning care to which they religiously object. \n3. Although respondents spend much of their brief \ninsisting that SB1 does not classify based on sex at all, \ntheir final argument against heightened scrutiny takes \na different (and contradictory) approach:  They assert \nthat even though SB1 treats boys and girls differently, \nthat differential treatment does not warrant heightened \nscrutiny because \u201cboys and girls \u2018are not similarly situ-\nated\u2019 for purposes of SB1\u2019s restrictions.\u201d  Br. 28 (cita-\ntion omitted).  But a State\u2019s assertion that a sex-based \nclassification is justified has never been a basis for dis-\npensing with heightened scrutiny altogether. \nNo one disputes that legislatures may sometimes \nclassify based on sex when \u201cbiological difference[s]\u201d \nmean that men and women \u201care not similarly situated.\u201d  \nNguyen, 533 U.S. at 57, 63-64.  But as Nguyen and this \nCourt\u2019s other decisions demonstrate, those considera-\ntions are relevant only in determining whether a sex-\nbased classification survives heightened scrutiny.  U.S. \nBr. 24-26.  Indeed, the Court developed the heightened-\nscrutiny framework in large part to test the validity of \nasserted biological justifications for laws treating men \nand women differently.  NWLC Br. 18-21. \n\n11 \n \nRespondents do not cite any decision from this Court \nsuggesting that a court must ask whether the sexes are \nsimilarly situated before applying heightened scrutiny \nto a sex-based classification.  Indeed, the decisions on \nwhich they rely (Resp. Br. 29 & n.1) did not involve fa-\ncial classifications at all.  Respondents also do not ex-\nplain what work heightened scrutiny would do if it ap-\nplied only when courts had already determined that \nmen and women are similarly situated.  The Court \nshould reject respondents\u2019 invitation to add a novel and \nunworkable threshold step to the familiar heightened-\nscrutiny framework.  \nB. SB1 Warrants Heightened Scrutiny Because It Discrim-\ninates Against Transgender Individuals \n \nSB1 also warrants heightened scrutiny because it \ndiscriminates against transgender individuals, who \nqualify as a quasi-suspect class. \n1. Although the Sixth Circuit held that transgender-\nbased classifications do not warrant heightened scru-\ntiny, it did not doubt that SB1 targets transgender indi-\nviduals.  Pet. App. 44a.  Respondents, however, assert \n(Br. 41-44) that SB1 does not discriminate against \ntransgender individuals because\u2014while the law bars \nthem from receiving gender-affirming treatments that \nthey and their doctors deem essential\u2014they may re-\nceive the covered medications for other purposes, such \nas if they happen to have precocious puberty.  That ar-\ngument blinks reality. \nSB1\u2019s text confirms that it \u201cexpressly and exclu-\nsively targets transgender people.\u201d  Pet. App. 152a.  \nThe defining characteristic of transgender individuals \nis that their gender identity does not align with their \nsex assigned at birth.  U.S. Br. 29.  SB1 specifically tar-\ngets \nthat \ncharacteristic, \nprohibiting \ntreatments \n\n12 \n \nintended to allow an adolescent to \u201cidentify with, or live \nas, a purported identity inconsistent with the minor\u2019s \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-103(a)(1).  And SB1 ex-\nplicitly seeks to discourage adolescents from identifying \nas transgender, forthrightly asserting a state interest \nin preventing minors from \u201cbecom[ing] disdainful of \ntheir sex\u201d assigned at birth.  Id. \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The \nconclusion that SB1 targets transgender individuals \nthus does not rest on any inquiry into unenacted \u201clegis-\nlative motives.\u201d  Resp. Br. 42-43 (citation omitted).  It \nsimply takes the Tennessee legislature at its word.  \n2. Respondents assert (Br. 44-45) that this Court \nshould decline to recognize transgender status as a \nquasi-suspect classification.  But transgender individu-\nals satisfy the established criteria for \u201cextraordinary \nprotection from the majoritarian political process.\u201d \nMassachusetts Bd. of Ret. v. Murgia, 427 U.S. 307, 313 \n(1976) (per curiam) (citation omitted); see U.S. Br. 29-31.   \nMost obviously, transgender Americans have histor-\nically been subject to discrimination\u2014and such hostility \nis rising rather than abating.  In recent years, States \nacross the Nation have enacted a staggering number of \nlaws targeting transgender individuals.  NAACP Br. 6-\n7.  And the accompanying rhetoric underscores how \ntransgender individuals face a distorted political pro-\ncess.  Legislators have called transgender Americans \n\u201cmutants,\u201d \u201cdemons,\u201d \u201cimps,\u201d \u201cfilth,\u201d and \u201cdelusional.\u201d  \nDoe v. Ladapo, 676 F. Supp. 3d 1205, 1223 n.62 (N.D. \nFla. 2023); NAACP Br. 8; Members of Congress Br. 8-\n9.  That underscores the need for \u201cmore searching eval-\nuation\u201d than bare rationality review, Cleburne v. \nCleburne Living Center, Inc., 473 U.S. 432 (1985), to en-\nsure that laws targeting transgender individuals do not \nreflect stereotypes or prejudice.   \n\n13 \n \nRespondents\u2019 contrary arguments (Br. 45-48) are \nunpersuasive.  The fact that \u201c[t]he current Administra-\ntion\u201d has sought to protect transgender individuals \nfrom discrimination (Br. 46) does not vitiate the need \nfor heightened judicial scrutiny.  And respondents err \nin invoking Murgia and Cleburne, which declined to \nrecognize age and mental disability as suspect classifi-\ncations.  Murgia emphasized that \u201cold age does not de-\nfine a \u2018discrete and insular\u2019 group\u201d because it \u201cmarks a \nstage that each of us will reach if we live out our normal \nspan.\u201d  427 U.S. at 313-314 (citation omitted).  Similarly, \nCleburne reasoned that individuals with mental disabil-\nities are a \u201clarge and diversified group\u201d that does not \nface a distorted political process.  473 U.S. at 442-443.   \nTransgender individuals, in contrast, are a discrete \nminority accounting for roughly one percent of the pop-\nulation.  Their transgender status bears no relation to \ntheir ability to contribute to society, yet they face a \nwave of hostile legislation targeting them in all areas of \nlife.  And that wave will undoubtedly grow if this Court \nholds that laws discriminating against transgender \nAmericans\u2014which could include, for example, laws pro-\nhibiting them from adopting children or becoming li-\ncensed as teachers\u2014warrant only the most deferential \nreview under the Equal Protection Clause. \nII. SB1 CANNOT SURVIVE HEIGHTENED SCRUTINY \nThe Sixth Circuit did not consider whether SB1 can \nsurvive heightened scrutiny.  Respondents now assert \nthat it can, but they devote only a few perfunctory pages \nto that issue.  And respondents neither meaningfully en-\ngage with the district court\u2019s factual findings nor offer \nanything resembling a traditional heightened-scrutiny \nanalysis.  Instead, they rely heavily on a selective \npresentation of developments postdating the close of \n\n14 \n \nthe preliminary-injunction record, such as the United \nKingdom\u2019s Cass Review and evidence from an entirely \ndifferent case. \nRespondents provide no reason for this Court to be \nthe first to consider that new material or to depart from \nthe usual practice of remanding to allow the Sixth Cir-\ncuit to apply heightened scrutiny in the first  \ninstance\u2014which could include reopening the record to \nevaluate that new material.  U.S. Br. 32.  But if the \nCourt instead decides the issue itself based on the cur-\nrent record, it should hold that SB1 likely fails height-\nened scrutiny.   \nA. This Case Is Governed By Ordinary Principles Of \nHeightened Scrutiny And Clear-Error Review  \nAt the outset, respondents assert (Br. 50) that even \nif SB1 is subject to heightened scrutiny, it must be as-\nsessed under a special \u201cdeferential framework\u201d because \nit addresses \u201cunsettled health questions.\u201d  But this \nCourt has never suggested that a State receives defer-\nence when it classifies based on sex.  To the contrary, \n\u201c[t]he burden of justification\u201d for any sex-based line \n\u201crests entirely on the State.\u201d  United States v. Virginia, \n518 U.S. 515, 533 (1996); see, e.g., Sessions v. Morales-\nSantana, 582 U.S. 47, 59 (2017).   \nOf course, States are entitled to legislate in response \nto risks and uncertainties, so a State may be able to jus-\ntify a law based on medical uncertainty.  But respond-\nents do not identify a single sex-discrimination case in \nwhich this Court merely deferred to legislative findings \nrather than requiring an independent judicial assess-\nment of whether the challenged statute is substantially \nrelated to an important government interest.  Respond-\nents cite Gonzales v. Carhart, 550 U.S. 124 (2007), but \nthat decision applied a different constitutional standard \n\n15 \n \nin a different context.  And even then, the Court empha-\nsized courts\u2019 \u201cindependent constitutional duty to review \nfactual findings when constitutional rights are at stake\u201d \nand rejected congressional findings that the district \ncourts had found to be \u201cincorrect.\u201d  Id. at 165-166. \nRespondents likewise err in asserting that the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s factual findings are not entitled to \u201cclear-\nerror weight\u201d because the court did not defer to SB1\u2019s \nlegislative findings.  Br. 52.  Even when some deference \nto the legislature is warranted, Gonzales confirms that \ndistrict courts must make independent findings of fact.  \nAnd in any event, the Tennessee legislature did not \nmake any specific findings on most of the issues ad-\ndressed by the district court, so the court cannot have \napplied an \u201cerroneous standard\u201d (Br. 52) even under re-\nspondents\u2019 novel approach to factfinding in constitu-\ntional cases. \nB. Respondents Continue To Disregard The Benefits And \nOverstate The Risks Of Gender-Affirming Care \nAlthough SB1 is perfectly crafted to serve the \nState\u2019s declared interest in \u201cencourag[ing] minors to \nappreciate their sex,\u201d Tenn. Code Ann. \u00a7 68-33-101(m), \nrespondents do not defend SB1 on that basis.  To the \ncontrary, they minimize that express legislative purpose \nas an \u201c[a]long the way\u201d aside, Resp. Br. 26\u2014effectively \nacknowledging that a State has no legitimate interest in \nencouraging \u201cboys and girls to look and live like boys \nand girls,\u201d Pet. App. 85a (White, J., dissenting); see U.S. \nBr. 33-34. \nInstead, respondents try to defend SB1 as a routine \nmedical regulation, arguing that it reflects lawmakers\u2019 \n\u201cwell-informed judgment\u201d about a \u201cdangerous and \nrisky treatment.\u201d  Br. 49-50.  But the district court care-\nfully examined the evidence and found that it does not \n\n16 \n \nsupport respondents\u2019 characterization of either the ben-\nefits or the risks of gender-affirming care.  Pet. App. \n181a-199a.  Respondents make no real effort to grapple \nwith those findings. \n1. Respondents acknowledge (e.g., Br. 21, 52) that a \nState cannot justify sex-based regulation of medical \ncare by focusing on risks alone\u2014it must also consider \nthe benefits.  U.S. Br.  34-36.  But respondents ignore \nthe district court\u2019s finding, based on extensive evidence, \nthat gender-affirming care is associated with significant \nmental-health benefits in adolescents, such as lower \nrates of depression, disruptive behaviors, and anxiety.  \nU.S. Br. 37-38.  Critically, treatment with puberty \nblockers and hormones is associated with meaningfully \nreduced suicidality, including suicide attempts.  U.S. \nBr. 36-37.  And respondents further ignore the evidence \nthat providing such treatment during adolescence can \nhave life-long benefits, allowing transgender individu-\nals to live and be accepted in accordance with their iden-\ntity without invasive and less-effective procedures, in-\ncluding surgery, later in life.  U.S. Br. 38-39.  \nRespondents assert (Br. 54) that the evidence sup-\nporting reduced suicidality is \u201cinconclusive and conflicts \nwith other studies.\u201d  But the record evidence nearly uni-\nformly shows that gender-affirming care is associated \nwith sharp reductions in the risk of suicidal ideation and \nsuicide attempts\u2014just as the district court found.  U.S. \nBr. 37; see Pet. App. 264a, 290a & n.14, 293a & nn.17-18 \n(collecting studies); J.A. 143-146 & nn.5-12 (same).2 \n \n2 Respondents say (Br. 54) that \u201cone [study] shows that hormonal \ninterventions increased mental distress.\u201d But adolescents who re-\nceived gender-affirming care reported improvements in body dis-\nsatisfaction, depression, and anxiety.  See Laura E. Kuper et al., \n \n\n17 \n \nTellingly, moreover, respondents offer no viable al-\nternative to gender-affirming care.  Respondents have \nnot identified any studies suggesting that psychother-\napy alone results in mental-health benefits comparable \nto those associated with gender-affirming medical care.  \nJ.A. 147, 1031.  And \u201cwatchful waiting\u201d in a State that \nhas categorically banned any medical care\u2014no matter \nwhat such monitoring reveals about a given patient\u2019s \nneed for that care\u2014amounts to no treatment at all.   \nRespondents assert (Br. 4-5) that left untreated, \ngender dysphoria \u201cgoes away on its own\u201d for \u201cabout \n85%\u201d of \u201cchildren.\u201d  But that is deeply misleading:   The \nstudies underlying that claim (referenced at J.A. 384-\n385, 505-506) involved mostly prepubertal children, \nmany of whom merely departed from gender stereo-\ntypes rather than exhibiting actual gender dysphoria.  \nThe treatments at issue here are available only to ado-\nlescents with marked, sustained gender dysphoria.  And \n\u201cno studies\u201d \u201csupport the proposition that adolescents \nwith gender dysphoria are likely to later identify as \ntheir sex assigned at birth.\u201d  AAP Br. 25.  Indeed, re-\nspondents do not appear to dispute that some trans-\ngender adolescents are at risk of serious harm from \ngender dysphoria.  But SB1 categorically bans the only \nevidence-based treatment for that condition, leaving af-\nfected patients with no viable alternative. \n2. On the other side of the ledger, respondents re-\nnew their assertion that gender-affirming care carries \n \nBody Dissatisfaction and Mental Health Outcomes of Youth on \nGender-Affirming Hormone Therapy, 145 Pediatrics, no. 4 (Apr. \n2020).  Although more adverse events occurred following treatment \nthan in the short period immediately prior, it is unsurprising that \nmore such events happened over a many-times-longer period. \n\n18 \n \nserious risks.  But they fail to address the district \ncourt\u2019s findings that those risks are exaggerated. \nIntended effects.  Respondents again err (Br. 5-6) in \ndescribing as risks effects such as delayed puberty, in-\ncreased levels of estrogen in transgender girls, increased \nlevels of testosterone in transgender boys, and associ-\nated development of masculine or feminine characteris-\ntics.  Those are the intended effects of puberty blockers \nand hormone therapy\u2014effects that can be critical to re-\nducing distress from gender dysphoria\u2014not risks or \nside effects.  U.S. Br. 41.   \nMedical risks.  Respondents assert (Br. 5-6) that \nprescribing puberty blockers and hormones for gender \ntransition carries medical risks.  Of course, all drugs \nhave risks.  But the district court found that respond-\nents had failed to substantiate some of the alleged risks; \nthat others\u2014such as decreased bone mineral density \nfrom puberty blockers\u2014do not have lasting conse-\nquences; and that serious side effects are limited and \ninfrequent.  U.S. Br. 5-7, 41-42; see Pet. App. 263a-269a.  \nEven more to the point, the court found that the rele-\nvant medications generally carry similar risks, whether \nprescribed for gender-affirming care or for any of the \nother reasons that SB1 leaves unregulated.  Pet. App. \n204a-205a, 267a.  Respondents make no effort to explain \nwhy the district court\u2019s findings were wrong or to reha-\nbilitate their cited evidence; they simply restate the \nsame alleged risks as fact.  See Resp. Br. 5-6, 55-56.  \nFertility.  Respondents note (Br. 5-6, 12) fertility \nrisks associated with hormone therapy.  But SB1 bans \npuberty blockers even though pubertal suppression it-\nself has no impact on fertility.  U.S. Br. 33-34.  And as \nto hormone therapy, the district court found that many \nindividuals receiving cross-sex hormones remain fertile \n\n19 \n \nand that patients can be provided with fertility-preserving \noptions.  Moreover, as our opening brief explained (U.S. \nBr. 46-47), similar or greater risks\u2014including fertility \nrisks\u2014attend various pediatric treatments, yet SB1 \nsingles out and bans only gender-affirming care.  Re-\nspondents cannot reconcile SB1 with the State\u2019s general \napproach to pediatric care.   \nUncertainty.  Respondents also invoke (Br. 6, 53) \u201cun-\nknown effects\u201d and medical \u201cuncertainty.\u201d  But gender-\naffirming care is not new; the same treatments have \nbeen safely prescribed for decades to treat a variety of \nconditions, including gender dysphoria.  U.S. Br. 7.  As \nthe district court found, the evidence supporting such \ncare is consistent with the type and quality of evidence \nrelied on across clinical practice, especially in the pedi-\natric context.  Pet. App. 179a-180a; see U.S. Br. 39; Clin-\nical Practice Guideline Experts Br. 25-38.  Respondents \ndo not engage with that finding\u2014let alone explain why \nany uncertainty justifies cutting off all access to this \ncare alone.  \nRegret.  Finally, respondents emphasize the risk that \nindividuals who receive gender-affirming care may not \npersist in their transgender identity and may come to \nregret that care.  But the evidence shows that the only \npatients medically eligible to receive the treatments \nthat SB1 bans\u2014adolescents with marked and sustained \ngender dysphoria\u2014are highly likely to persist in their \ngender incongruence and dysphoria in adulthood.  U.S. \nBr. 40-41.  That is not to deny that \u201cde-transition exists\u201d \n(Resp. Br. 54-55).  But all available evidence suggests \nthat it is very rare.  And respondents never explain why \nthe risk of regret among a small fraction of the relevant \npatient population justifies banning care for all adoles-\ncents\u2014particularly \nwhen \nmany \nother \nmedical \n\n20 \n \nprocedures, including those that SB1 specifically per-\nmits, pose equal or greater risks of regret.  See J.A. 131-\n133; interACT Br. 15, 22-24 (observing that \u201cfor infants \nwith many intersex variations, the initial sex assign-\nment will prove incorrect from 10% to more than 60% of \nthe time,\u201d yet SB1 expressly \u201cpermits all so-called \u2018nor-\nmalizing\u2019 treatments when performed on intersex mi-\nnors\u2014even those that are highly invasive and unques-\ntionably irreversible\u201d). \n3. Respondents\u2019 failure to meaningfully engage with \nthe evidence establishing the significant benefits of \ngender-affirming care\u2014or to weigh the asserted risks \nagainst those benefits\u2014is especially problematic given \nthe medical community\u2019s position that such care is ap-\npropriate and medically necessary for adolescents \nwhere clinically indicated.  U.S. Br. 35.  Respondents \ncriticize (Br. 9-11) the drafting process for WPATH\u2019s \nclinical guidelines, selectively citing out-of-context ex-\ncerpts from the unadjudicated summary-judgment rec-\nord in a different case.  But it is not just WPATH that \nsupports gender-affirming care for adolescents in ap-\npropriate cases. To the contrary, \u201c[t]he widely accepted \nview of the professional medical community is that gen-\nder-affirming care is the appropriate treatment for gen-\nder dysphoria.\u201d  AAP Br. 8.  That care is supported by \nthe Nation\u2019s major medical organizations\u2014including \nthe American Academy of Pediatrics, the American \nMedical Association, the American Psychological Asso-\nciation, and the Endocrine Society\u2014as well as leading \nchildren\u2019s hospitals.  See id. at 8-28; APA Br. 10-33.  Re-\nspondents dismiss (Br. 54) those respected medical or-\nganizations as \u201cadvocacy\u201d groups, but respondents do \nnot engage with the evidence on which that medical \njudgment rests. \n\n21 \n \nC. SB1 Is Not Tailored To The State\u2019s Asserted Interest In \nProtecting Adolescent Health \n \nHeightened scrutiny does not foreclose laws regulat-\ning gender-affirming care.  To the contrary, this Court \nhas repeatedly recognized that sex-based classifications \ncan be legitimate responses to \u201cbiological difference[s].\u201d  \nNguyen, 533 U.S. at 64.  But when a State regulates us-\ning sex-based classifications, it cannot rely on sweeping \nand untailored measures if \u201cmore accurate and impar-\ntial lines can be drawn.\u201d  Morales-Santana, 582 U.S. at \n63 n.13.  Requiring such tailoring has long been a critical \nfunction of heightened scrutiny.  And although respond-\nents protest that courts should not second-guess legis-\nlatures on matters of medical science or policy, courts \nare well-equipped to judge the \u201ccongruence\u201d between a \nsex-based law and the legislature\u2019s stated objectives.  \nCraig v. Boren, 429 U.S. 190, 197-199 (1976). \n \nThat traditional judicial inquiry is fatal to SB1:  \nStates undoubtedly have a compelling interest in pro-\ntecting adolescent health, but SB1 is completely untai-\nlored to that interest\u2014even accounting for legislatures\u2019 \nfreedom to regulate in the face of uncertainty.  SB1 is \nseverely underinclusive because it singles out and cate-\ngorically bans the use of the covered medications to \ntreat transgender adolescents suffering from gender \ndysphoria, while leaving the same medications available \nfor all other minors for all other uses\u2014and likewise \nleaving decisions about all other pediatric treatments to \nparents, doctors, and minors themselves.  U.S. Br. 44-47.   \nSB1 is also severely overinclusive because it makes \nno effort to tailor its prohibition to the concerns the \nState has identified.  A range of more tailored laws \ncould respond to those concerns while preserving access \nto care where appropriate\u2014including gatekeeping \n\n22 \n \nrequirements; waiting periods; licensing, certification, \nand reporting requirements; requirements aimed at \nfertility preservation; two-parent consent; counseling; \npsychological evaluations; readiness criteria; and age \nrecommendations.  U.S. Br. 48-49.   \nRespondents do not explain why more tailored laws \nwould not address the State\u2019s asserted concerns, other \nthan to say (Br. 57) that these measures do not account \nfor individuals who regret receiving gender-affirming \ncare.  But gatekeeping, licensing, and counseling re-\nquirements, as well as psychological evaluations and \nwaiting periods, would directly address concerns about \nregret by ensuring that specialized mental-health pro-\nfessionals evaluate adolescents for sustained gender \ndysphoria and rule out confounding diagnoses.  See An-\nderson Br. 4.  Given that such regret is already rare \namong the relevant patient population, respondents \ncannot establish that this concern justifies a blunder-\nbuss ban on gender-affirming care for all adolescents no \nmatter their individual circumstances. \nRespondents repeatedly invoke (e.g., Br. 1, 7-9, 17) \nvarious European countries\u2019 \u201ctightened restrictions\u201d on \ngender-affirming care.  But each of the countries they \nidentify has adopted measures aimed at further devel-\noping an individualized, evidence-based approach to \ngender-affirming care, while simultaneously ensuring \nthat transgender adolescents can continue to receive \nsuch care in appropriate cases.  None of those countries \nhas adopted a categorical ban like SB1.3  Those more \n \n3 See Foreign Non-Profit Organizations Br. 4-13 (documenting \naccess to care in Sweden, the United Kingdom, and Norway); For-\neign Non-Profit Organizations Cert. Br. 3-12 (documenting access \nin Finland).  Respondents also repeatedly cite (Br. 8, 54) the Cass \n \n\n23 \n \nnuanced regulatory approaches cannot justify cutting \noff access to care altogether for transgender adoles-\ncents in Tennessee. \n* * * * * \nIn the final analysis, SB1 is nothing like a typical \nmedical regulation.  Respondents insist that SB1 is de-\nsigned to help transgender adolescents, but SB1 cate-\ngorically prohibits medical treatments that have been \nsafely provided for decades and that many transgender \nadolescents\u2014along with their parents and doctors\u2014\nhave found essential to their health and wellbeing.  And \nSB1 enacts that across-the-board prohibition in a stark \ndeparture from the State\u2019s regulation of pediatric care \nin all other contexts, including those involving similar \nrisks and uncertainties.  Indeed, SB1 acknowledges on \nits face that it is not just a medical regulation.  The law \ndeclares that its very purpose is to \u201cencourag[e] minors \nto appreciate their sex\u201d and to ban treatments \u201cthat \nmight encourage minors to become disdainful of their \nsex.\u201d  Tenn. Code \u00a7 68-33-101(m).  The State\u2019s decision \nto single out and ban gender-affirming care is precisely \ntailored to that interest\u2014and to that interest only. \nAgainst that backdrop, the question in this case is not \nwhether States can seek to protect adolescents\u2019 health; \neveryone agrees that they can.  And the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause unquestionably leaves States room to \n \nReview.  But the British Medical Association is undertaking a public \nevaluation of the Cass Review in light of concerns about its method-\nological weaknesses.  British Med. Ass\u2019n, BMA to undertake an \nevaluation of the Cass Review (July 31, 2024), https://tinyurl.com/\n43t7jtrr.  And the Cass Review notably does not recommend an out-\nright ban on gender-affirming care but instead recognizes that med-\nical treatment is appropriate for some adolescents with gender dys-\nphoria.  See Independent Review of Gender Identity Services for \nChildren and Young People: Final Report 21, 30 (Apr. 2024).  \n\n24 \n \nregulate gender-affirming care in the face of uncer-\ntainty, including by adopting different approaches to \nthese challenging issues.  But where, as here, a State \nregulates by drawing sex-based lines, the Constitution \ndemands more than bare rationality.  And if heightened \nscrutiny means anything, it must mean that a State can-\nnot invoke health and safety to categorically foreclose \ncritical medical treatments for a disfavored minority \nwhile leaving the same treatments\u2014and a host of other \ntreatments that impose the same or greater risks\u2014 \nentirely unregulated when used for any other purpose.   \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be va-\ncated and the case remanded for further proceedings. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nELIZABETH B.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's argumentative landscape is now solidified. The `THINK` action served to crystallize the significant shifts caused by the last observation, confirming my updated model of the core conflict and the current predictive state.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Stable):** The Petitioner's argument remains anchored in the \"but-for\" sex discrimination framework established in *Bostock v. Clayton County*. They assert that a medical consensus supports gender-affirming care, and thus Tennessee's law is discriminatory without a legitimate, non-pretextual justification. This belief is stable.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis - Bolstered & Formalized):** The Respondent's position, previously centered on general legislative deference, is now a more formidable and doctrinally specific argument for judicial restraint under *Gonzales v. Carhart*. This position has been powerfully reinforced by key amici, particularly the State of Texas.\n    *   **\"Scientific Uncertainty\" Narrative (Amplified):** The claim that the science behind gender-affirming care is unsettled is no longer just Tennessee's assertion. It is now a multi-state narrative backed by a significant volume of evidence cited from parallel litigation (e.g., *Loe v. State* in Texas). This evidence directly attacks the Petitioner's \"medical consensus\" premise.\n    *   **\"Legislative Fact\" Doctrine (New & Integrated):** The introduction of the distinction between \"adjudicative facts\" and \"legislative facts\" is a critical development. This doctrine provides a formal legal pathway for the Court to uphold the law. It allows the justices to rule that the efficacy and safety of gender-affirming care for minors is a contested \"legislative fact,\" a matter of public policy and scientific debate that legislatures are better equipped to handle than courts reviewing a preliminary injunction record. This strengthens the *Carhart* deference argument significantly.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Predictive State (Refined & Solidified):** The central conflict is now sharply defined as the Petitioner's *Bostock* discrimination model versus the Respondent's *Carhart*/*Legislative Fact* deference model.\n    *   **Increased Burden on Petitioner:** The Petitioner's Reply Brief must now accomplish more than originally anticipated. It cannot simply reiterate the *Bostock* argument; it must actively dismantle the \"legislative fact\" framework and provide a compelling rebuttal to the now-amplified narrative of scientific uncertainty.\n    *   **Central Uncertainty:** The point of maximum uncertainty is unequivocally the content of the Petitioner's Reply Brief. This document represents the final move in the primary briefing sequence and will determine if the Petitioner can regain the argumentative high ground. My entire predictive model now hinges on its contents.\n    *   **Predictive Shift (Confirmed):** My confidence in a ruling favorable to Tennessee is solidified at a higher level than before. The Respondent and its amici have successfully articulated a clear, doctrinally grounded rationale for the conservative justices to uphold the law without needing to declare a \"winner\" in the underlying scientific debate.",
          "design_beliefs": "The recent `THINK` action served as a crucial meta-cognitive step, confirming the value of deliberate synthesis and formalizing the strategic lessons learned from analyzing the Texas amicus brief. My methodology for legal analysis has become more robust and nuanced.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition (Stable & Confirmed):** The practice of breaking down the problem into knowns and unknowns remains the foundational principle of my inquiry, guiding my focus toward the most valuable next action.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Expanded & Formalized):** The simple Thesis vs. Antithesis model is now officially expanded. The legal dialectic is Thesis vs. (Antithesis + Key Amici). I now recognize that key amici can be co-protagonists, not just a supporting chorus, by amplifying arguments and introducing novel legal theories.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection (Strongly Validated):** The rationale articulated in the `THINK` step confirms this is my core operational driver. By identifying the Petitioner's Reply Brief as the greatest source of uncertainty, I can justify dedicating resources to finding it, maximizing expected information gain.\n\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (`THINK` Actions) (Proven as a Core Strategy):** This observation, being a `THINK` action itself, provides powerful meta-validation for this strategy. Pausing to explicitly synthesize new information, update belief models (\u03b8 and D), and articulate the next step's rationale is not a delay but a critical accelerator for efficient and accurate learning.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics (Stable & Integrated):** My library of legal patterns is growing. The \"Scientific Uncertainty Deference\" heuristic, modeled on *Carhart*, is now much richer. The \"Legislative Fact\" doctrine is now a fully integrated and understood heuristic that I will actively look for in cases involving complex empirical or scientific questions.\n\n6.  **\"Failed Search as Signal\" (Refined & Formalized):** This heuristic is confirmed and now includes a formal sub-heuristic: **\"Anticipate and Analyze the Opposition.\"** A search query that fails to find evidence for side A but returns powerful evidence for side B is a high-value outcome, not a failure. It mandates an immediate analysis of the opposition's newly discovered arguments.\n\n7.  **Refined Search Heuristics (Stable & Reinforced):** The principles of verifying search result metadata against content (\"Precision is Paramount\") and respecting the real-world timeline of evidence availability (\"Temporal Availability\") remain critical operational constraints.\n\n8.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed):** The DBOED loop\u2014where observations refine the world model (\u03b8) and the strategic model (D), which in turn guides a more targeted next observation\u2014is functioning exactly as designed.\n\n9.  **Amicus Briefs as Argument Amplifiers and Innovators (New Core Heuristic):** This is now a fundamental principle. I will no longer treat amicus briefs as secondary. I will actively prioritize identifying and analyzing briefs from key actors (like other states or prominent organizations) to watch for (1) amplification of a party's core arguments and (2) innovation of new legal theories.\n\n10. **The \"Legislative Fact\" Doctrine (New Legal Heuristic):** This doctrine is now a permanent part of my analytical toolkit. It serves as a specific pattern for identifying how courts can apply judicial restraint. I will now recognize it as a powerful tool for litigants asking a court to defer to a legislature on a complex, fact-intensive policy issue."

Duke Power Co.[1]\u2014almost all legal commentators have accepted that decision\u2019s insistence that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 imposes liability on employers for policies that yield disparate impacts across different groups defined by their race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. They first claimed the original Act imposed that liability. When the Supreme Court began to correct its course and reconsider elements of Griggs, commentators asserted that Congress\u2019s 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act closed that door by ratifying the decision. These commentators have always been wrong and remain wrong now. No Congress ever passed, no President ever signed, and as a result Title VII never contained (and does not contain now) any language outlawing employment policies bearing disparate impacts across demographic groups or imposing disparate-impact liability on employers for using such policies. Our entire 54-year foray since Griggs has been an unwarranted mistake, which has harmed employment law and infected other areas with concepts incompatible with core constitutional commitments. We are long overdue for a reversal of the direction of American employment law. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, Mo.[2] unavoidably (whether or not intentionally) invites that reversal. I. Title VII and the Rise of Disparate-Impact Liability A. Congress Acts Against Intentional Discrimination In Title VII, Congress enacted specific language through bicameralism and presentment. While Title VII includes separate prohibitions for employers, employment agencies, unions, and training programs, they run parallel in prohibiting each from discriminating in employment actions against: \u201cany individual\u201d \u201cbecause of\u201d his or such individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d[3] Purely as a linguistic matter, these provisions focus on the intent of the governed parties as much as on their actions. They ban actions taken \u201cbecause of\u201d demography, not actions taken that result in any particular effect across demographics. This was how the main architects of Title VII understood their work. Senator Hubert Humphrey, the statute\u2019s main author, relied on the advice of Department of Justice lawyer Richard K. Berg in crafting this language.[4] Berg explained in a contemporaneous law review article: \u201cDiscrimination is by its nature intentional. It involves both an action and a reason for the action.\u201d[5] \u201cTo discriminate \u2018unintentionally\u2019 on grounds of race\u201d \u201cappears a contradiction in terms.\u201d[6] Furthermore, Title VII\u2019s legislative history teems with further support for this interpretation of its language as the dominant one in its original interpretive community.[7] The Senate passed Title VII only when it was satisfied that it dealt solely with intentional discrimination, and it very clearly would not have passed it without that firm understanding.[8] B. The EEOC Takes Over Through Title VII, Congress created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to help administer the statute. Whatever Congress wrote and however the original interpretive community understood what it had written, once up and running, the EEOC had other plans.[9] The EEOC\u2019s first Chief of Conciliations rejected limiting Title VII enforcement to instances of intentional discrimination, instead openly advocating for imposing \u201cfair qualification standards.\u201d[10] His superiors listened and \u201cinterpret[ed] Title VII a step further than other agencies\u201d had for other provisions of the Civil Rights Act. The EEOC \u201creason[ed] that in addition to discrimination in employment, it is also an unlawful practice to [use] criteria which prove to have a demonstrable racial effect without a clear and convincing business motive.\u201d[11] Whatever Congress and the President had legislated, the EEOC \u201cinterpreted\u201d Title VII to impose liability on employers for policies bearing disparate impacts across demographic groups. These are not mere post-hoc impressions of the EEOC\u2019s motivations or unfavorable readings imposed with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cThe EEOC\u2019s own official history of these early years records with unusual candor the commission\u2019s fundamental disagreement with its founding charter, especially Title VII\u2019s literal requirement that the discrimination be intentional.\u201d[12] C. In Griggs, the Supreme Court Defers to the EEOC\u2019s Misreading Nonethless, overcoming clear text, historical context, and the preponderant weight of indisputable legislative history, the Supreme Court chose in 1971 in Griggs to defer to the EEOC\u2019s interpretation.[13] It did so unanimously,[14] on the purported basis that \u201cthe Act and its legislative history support the Commission\u2019s construction,\u201d \u201cafford[ing] good reason to treat\u201d the disparate-impact theory conjured by the EEOC \u201cas expressing the will of Congress.\u201d[15] It is worth noting how the Justices discerned that \u201cthe Act and its legislative history support[ed]\u201d this conclusion. They did not interpret or even rely on any language from section\u00a02000e-2(a)(1), the statute\u2019s main prohibitory section for employers.[16] Instead, they purported to divine an \u201cobjective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII\u201d as \u201cplain from [unspecified] language of the statute.\u201d[17] Despite that enacted language prohibiting acts taken \u201cbecause of\u201d demography, the Justices asserted that Congress had acted to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to \u201cfreeze\u201d the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.[18] Without explanation of whether they found such commands in any particular statutory language or where such commands might be found, the Justices declared that: What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification . . . . The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone is business necessity.[19] In 1971, the terms \u201cartificial,\u201d \u201carbitrary,\u201d \u201cunnecessary,\u201d \u201cbarriers,\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d appeared nowhere in Title VII. In their absence, relying entirely on ether and vibes, the Supreme Court declared that \u201cCongress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation.\u201d[20] On that basis, \u201cgood intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures . . . that operate as \u2018built-in headwinds\u2019 for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.\u201d[21] The Justices asserted the support of legislative history for this result through what can only be described as chicanery, even by the low standards of arguments from legislative history.[22] The Griggs Court picked out congressional authorities the Justices seemingly believed to carry gravitas, quoted their statements, and bald-faced lied about what they meant. The unanimous Court referenced the history of senators adopting language allowing employers to use professionally crafted intelligence tests\u2014the very tests at issue in the suit before it\u2014name-checking \u201cSenators Case of New Jersey and Clark of Pennsylvania, co-managers of the bill on the Senate floor, [for having] issued a memorandum explaining that the [relevant language] \u2018expressly protects the employer\u2019s right to insist that any prospective applicant, Negro or white, must meet the applicable job qualifications.\u201d[23] The Court continued to quote the same senators\u2019 conclusion from that memo: \u201cIndeed, the very purpose of Title VII is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis of race or color.\u201d[24] Yet, according to Griggs, with only the sparsest explanation of any interstitial reasoning,[25] the resulting provision of Title VII allowed only \u201cemployment tests [proven by an employer to] be job related.\u201d[26] At the end of the day, Griggs made two epochal errors\u2014one methodological, one factual. First, the Griggs Court chose to base its statutory interpretation on an indefensible purposivist methodology. Second, its purposivism badly missed the mark in its fact-finding, concluding that Congress\u2019s purposes were other than what they were. As Justice Robert H. Jackson had written of another matter a generation earlier, the Supreme Court\u2019s Griggs opinion was \u201cnot final because we are infallible, but . . . infallible only because we are final.\u201d[27] Despite resulting from a mistaken application of an indefensible methodology, Griggs enshrined disparate-impact liability under Title VII in Supreme Court precedent. And that flawed precedent remained untouched for quite some time. II. The Usual Telling of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 A. Tightening Disparate-Impact Analysis It took almost two decades for the Supreme Court to express second thoughts over Griggs\u2019s unanimous defacement of Title VII. Those second thoughts took clearest shape in Justice Byron White\u2019s 1989 majority opinion in Ward\u2019s Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio.[28] Ward\u2019s Cove involved a challenge to a seafood cannery\u2019s policies as both intentionally discriminatory and having disparate impacts across races.[29] The district court entirely dismissed the case, and a Ninth Circuit panel affirmed; then the en banc court reversed the panel on the plaintiffs\u2019 disparate-impact claims.[30] The en banc Ninth Circuit concluded that, \u201cin such a case, \u2018[o]nce the plaintiff class has shown disparate impact caused by specific, identifiable employment practices or criteria, the burden shifts to the employer,\u2019 to \u2018prov[e the] business necessity\u2019 of the challenged practice.\u201d[31] Justice White did not revisit whether Title VII authorized disparate-impact suits. He didn\u2019t reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s burden allocation in the suit, either. Instead, the Ward\u2019s Cove majority faulted the Ninth Circuit primarily for failing to employ the proper comparator for the plaintiffs\u2019 racial statistics in assessing whether a disparate impact had been proven,[32] as well as for failing to require a causal link between the policies challenged and those racial statistics.[33] The opinion then sought to clarify how lower courts should assess the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense created from whole cloth by the Griggs Court.[34] With regard to the comparator, Ward\u2019s Cove reiterated that in assessing whether a plaintiff has proven any disparate impact, the courts must compare \u201cthe racial composition of [the at-issue jobs]\u201d to \u201cthe racial composition of the qualified . . . population in the relevant labor market.\u201d[35] In addressing the need for a causal link, Ward\u2019s Cove made plain that \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate that it is the application of a specific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate impact under attack. Such a showing is an integral part of the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case in a disparate-impact suit under Title VII.\u201d[36] In clarifying the business necessity analysis, Ward\u2019s Cove held that, once a plaintiff shows a disparate impact, a defendant has the \u201cburden of producing evidence of a business justification for his employment practice,\u201d although the \u201cburden of persuasion . . . remains with the disparate-impact plaintiff.\u201d[37] The Ward\u2019s Cove Court clarified that all that was necessary was showing that \u201ca challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer,\u201d with \u201cno requirement that the challenged practice be \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018indispensable\u2019 to the employer\u2019s business.\u201d[38] B. Ward\u2019s Cove\u2019s Rhetorical Move Away from Griggs On a substantive level, that was all that Ward\u2019s Cove did. It did not address the propriety of disparate-impact liability. It did not address the propriety of a burden-shifting rule. It just altered the standard a defendant-employer had to meet at the second stage of that burden-shifting analysis. The firestorm that followed would be inexplicable but for the atmospherics of Justice White\u2019s opinion; Ward\u2019s Cove rhetorically went further than its holding, seemingly inviting a successor case to ask the Supreme Court to take additional steps. The relevant rhetorical flight explored how the en banc Ninth Circuit had found the plaintiffs to have proven there was a disparate impact. By failing to identify a proper comparator, the court of appeals had allowed \u201cany employer who had a segment of his work force that was\u2014for some reason\u2014racially imbalanced\u201d to \u201cbe haled into court and forced to engage in the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the \u2018business necessity\u2019 of the methods used to select the other members of his work force.\u201d[39] This was unacceptable, because it would leave as the \u201conly practicable option for many employers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 . . . to adopt racial quotas, insuring that no portion of their work forces deviated in racial composition from the other portions thereof; this is a result that Congress expressly rejected in drafting Title VII.\u201d[40] The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test for disparate impact as one that \u201cwould leave the employer little choice . . . but to engage in a subjective quota system of employment selection.\u201d[41] And Justice White went further, insisting that Racial imbalance in one segment of an employer\u2019s work force does not, without more, establish a prima facie case of disparate impact with respect to the selection of workers for the employer\u2019s other positions, even where workers for the different positions may have somewhat fungible skills . . . . As long as there are no barriers or practices deterring qualified [individuals from underrepresented groups] from applying for [such] positions, . . . if the percentage of selected applicants who are [from those groups] is not significantly less than the percentage of qualified applicants who are [from the same], the employer\u2019s selection mechanism probably does not operate with a disparate impact on [those groups].[42] C. The Usual Telling of the 1991 Civil Rights Act: Ward\u2019s Cove Repudiated Ward\u2019s Cove\u2019s refinement of the business-necessity defense was meaningful but comparatively trivial, so it is perhaps surprising that Ward\u2019s Cove set off a sufficient kerfuffle to trigger passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. But that is exactly what happened. Perhaps Justice White\u2019s rhetoric was to blame. After all, while he was exactly right about how the en banc Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis would play out, his critique employed more horsepower than necessary to make his point. His digression on the unfairness of hauling an employer through an allegation of discrimination applied equally well to an employer like Duke Power, the employer in Griggs which had proven that it had no discriminatory intent,[43] yet still found itself \u201chaled into court and forced to engage in the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the \u2018business necessity\u2019 of the methods used to select its workers.\u201d[44] Such employers surely did find themselves confronted\u2014as Justice White feared the lower court\u2019s rule would confront others\u2014with a situation where the \u201conly practicable option [was] to adopt racial quotas, insuring that no portion of their work forces deviated in racial composition from\u201d[45] anticipated norms. The critique hit so true and so broadly against the entire disparate-impact machinery\u2014quite possibly more true and more broadly than Justice White meant it to\u2014that, even though Ward\u2019s Cove only tweaked the minorest of that machinery\u2019s outlines, one might have reasonably read it as implying an openness to reconsidering the justness of the whole game. For that reason or whatever other, Congress was sufficiently scandalized by the Ward\u2019s Cove opinion to write and pass the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Commentators almost invariably describe the 1991 Act as having overturned Ward\u2019s Cove\u2019s purported attack on disparate-impact liability and having codified Griggs.[46] While there is a reason for this description, it misunderstands what Ward\u2019s Cove did that Congress felt it necessary to address. First the reason: the 1991 Congress included in the passed bill a statement of the Act\u2019s purpose. Section 3 reads: The purposes of this Act are\u2014 . . . (2) to codify the concepts of \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d and \u201cjob related\u201d enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), and in the other Supreme Court decisions prior to Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989); (3) to confirm statutory authority and provide statutory guidelines for the adjudication of disparate impact suits under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[47] Pay attention to Congress\u2019s specific statements and omissions. Section 3 states that Congress sought to unwind Ward\u2019s Cove\u2014which did not reach the propriety of disparate-impact liability\u2014and to \u201ccodify the concepts of \u2018business necessity\u2019 and \u2018job related\u2019 enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs.\u201d It does not say that Congress sought to codify disparate-impact liability as enunciated in Griggs, an issue Ward\u2019s Cove did not address. Section 3 does state that Congress sought to \u201cconfirm statutory authority and provide statutory guidelines for the adjudication of disparate impact suits.\u201d Even there, though, it never states that Congress intended to codify a cause of action assigning liability on this basis. Providing \u201cstatutory authority . . . for the adjudication\u201d of suits allows courts to hear such suits; it does not authorize any party to file or litigate them. And \u201cproviding statutory guidelines for the adjudication\u201d of disparate-impact suits means setting the parameters for how to decide such cases if they exist, but it does not necessarily address the issue of whether they exist at all. More importantly, Section 3 is a statement of purpose. The substance of the 1991 Act lay elsewhere. To conclude anything about what that substance actually does to the nation\u2019s laws, we need to review not only what Congress said it meant to do, but also what Congress did in the rest of the Act. Congress put the relevant substantive language in Section 105 of the 1991 Act.[48] III. The Text of the 1991 Act and What it Really Did There is no question that the 1991 Congress sought to codify Griggs\u2019s version of the business-necessity defense. But the business-necessity defense is not the totality, or even the most important part, of Griggs. Griggs\u2019s most important effect was to read disparate-impact liability into Title VII, which is different. Notice how\u2014there\u2014the pieces come together. Or rather, notice how they don\u2019t. The 1991 Congress knew how to amend the U.S. Code. Section 105 expressly does amend the U.S. Code to set out its allocation of burdens in the litigation of a business-necessity defense to any validly brought Title VII disparate-impact claims. But the 1991 Congress chose not to codify the statement of purposes they included in Section 3. The 1991 Act did not enact those purposes into the U.S. Code. Nor did the 1991 Congress amend 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02000e-2(a)\u2019s actual prohibitory language. Or add in the new section\u00a02000e-2(k) any supplement to Title VII\u2019s pre-existing, closed, defined set of \u201cunlawful employment actions.\u201d Instead, the 1991 Act left Title VII prohibiting exactly what it had prohibited in 1964: employment discrimination against \u201cany individual\u201d \u201cbecause of\u201d that individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d The new section (k) provides no more than that \u201c[a]n unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is established under this title only if\u201d its criteria are met.[49] If Congress had written the law to render policies bearing disparate impacts unlawful employment practices, section (k) would dictate what would need to be established to prove such practices. But passing section (k) does not mean the 1991 Congress made such policies unlawful employment practices, created such a claim, or established that such policies were already unlawful or that such a claim already existed. Think of it this way: imagine Congress passed a statute providing that one\u2019s status as a 5-star Admiral is established only if one proves one is in the Navy. Would that statute mean that anyone proving they were in the Navy had thereby established that they were a 5-star Admiral? Obviously not. Could you even conclude from the fact that Congress had passed such a statute that there were any 5-star Admirals? Again, the answer is no.[50] Nor does the new language infer a silent redefinition of the prior statutory language. Imagine that, in 1964, Congress had passed a statute forbidding anyone from bringing a dog into the Capitol building and that ordinary usage, the straightforward meaning of the text, the historical context, and the clear, uniform legislative history all conveyed that when they did so, they were talking about man\u2019s best canine friends. Imagine that subsequently, in 1991, the Congress amended that Dog Ban to add a statement that, nonetheless, if one establishes that a hot dog is kosher, one may bring it into the Capitol. That amendment would certainly clarify the legality of bringing kosher hot dogs into the building. But would its blessing of kosher hot dogs retroactively alter the meaning of the original Dog Ban to prohibit individuals from bringing non-kosher hot dogs into the Capitol? Again, the answer is no. So long as this hypothetical Congress chose not to amend the original ban\u2019s prohibition, it would remain true in 1992 that no Congress ever had banned such \u201cdogs\u201d from the Capitol. The new language would clarify the legality of something no prior statute had prohibited. That might \u201cgild the lily,\u201d but it would fall well within the power of Congress. One cannot and should not\u2014just to render the new, confirmatory language more clearly non-superfluous\u2014read the 1991 amendment to do something it did not do: alter the original Dog Ban to prohibit the bringing of non-kosher weiners into the Capitol. Congress\u2019s language in section\u00a02000e-2(k) assigns burdens in the litigation of defenses available to a valid disparate-impact claim if there is such a claim. It goes no further. It addresses the small alteration of law effected by Ward\u2019s Cove. Like Ward\u2019s Cove, it does not address more fundamental issues that were uncontested in that litigation. Section (k) establishes necessary but insufficient predicates for prevailing on disparate-impact claims. It does not establish that the claims themselves are available. And the modern Court has been deeply hostile to the judicial creation of new causes of action unauthorized by Congress.[51] The usual telling of the 1991 Act\u2019s impact on Title VII both over-reads Congress\u2019s stated purpose in enacting the 1991 Act and wrongly assumes that the language Congress actually codified through the 1991 Act achieved that artificially broader end. On close reading, though, just as Ward\u2019s Cove did not go as far as its logic could have been read to extend, neither did the actual text of the 1991 Act go as far as the usual telling claims it did in responding to Ward\u2019s Cove. As textualism has taught us over its decades-long rise, what matters in determining the meaning of a law is the enacted, codified text of that law. The codified text of the 1991 Act does not say what the usual telling would have us believe. It does not create or establish the existence of a cause of action for employment discrimination based on disparate impact. IV. Further Buttressing: The Canon of Constitutional Avoidance In N.L.R.B. v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, the Supreme Court declined to interpret a statute in a way that would require it to resolve \u201cdifficult and sensitive\u201d constitutional questions.[52] Disparate-impact liability\u2019s constitutionality is, at best, \u201cdifficult and sensitive.\u201d[53] Under Griggs, where a facially neutral, even-handedly applied policy \u201cwould have a disparate impact, a decision-maker is often compelled to act intentionally on the basis of racial considerations to avoid the disparate impact, thus disparate impact regulations require decision makers \u2018to evaluate the racial outcomes of their policies, and to make decisions based on (because of) those racial outcomes.\u2019\u201d[54] It has been clear since the 1950s that the Constitution imposes the same constraints on the federal government that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause imposes on the states.[55] At least seven of the current Justices have recognized this parallelism. Chief Justice John Roberts did so in Sessions v. Morales-Santana[56] and\u2014with Justice Samuel Alito\u2014in Ashcroft v. Iqbal.[57] Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan have done so repeatedly, including in Morales-Santana. In United States v. Madero,[58] Justice Clarence Thomas agreed, anchoring this constraint in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause, but continuing to find it imposed the same limits. Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s concurrence in Madero, slightly less explicitly, recognizes the same contours.[59] In 2021, Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined a concurrence to a denial of certiorari which agreed (by citation to Sessions and other authorities) that the \u201cFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the Federal Government from discriminating\u201d in terms paralleling the Court\u2019s application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[60] Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson appear to have not yet taken a position on this question since their investitures. Regardless of where this constraint on federal power is most properly found in the Constitution, the constraint\u2019s existence is by now a truth universally acknowledged. Exactly coterminous with the Equal Protection Clause, it renders all federal racial discrimination odious, no matter the context.[61] It \u201cdemeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.\u201d[62] \u201cThat principle\u201d\u2014the core of equal protection\u2014\u201ccannot be overridden except in the most extraordinary case,\u201d where racial classification and disparate treatment satisfy strict scrutiny.[63] What once satisfied strict scrutiny may not always continue to satisfy it.[64] Is intentional employment discrimination so pervasive and hard to suss out today that disparate-impact liability satisfies strict scrutiny? These questions and their answers are, at least, \u201cdifficult and sensitive.\u201d Against this backdrop, the canon of constitutional avoidance furnishes a strong additional reason for the Court to address Griggs\u2019s lack of merit as a statutory precedent. Why deal with the thorny question of whether Congress violated the Constitution by imposing disparate-impact liability when it\u2019s both easier and more accurate to say that Congress never actually imposed it? Reversing Griggs\u2019s statutory mistake would free the Court from needing to resolve these nettlesome, difficult, and sensive matters of constitutional law. V. Muldrow: An Invitation to Revisit Griggs Perhaps you grant all this. Still, why bother speculating about whether the Supreme Court might have any interest in revisiting Griggs after 54 years? A recent Title VII decision of the Court provides an answer. A. Muldrow v. City of St. Louis Muldrow was a Title VII case, but it involved no disparate-impact claims. It saw allegations of intentional sex-based discrimination. The Supreme Court considered only one issue: the compatibility with Title VII of some courts of appeals\u2019 adoption of a requirement that only \u201cmaterially significant disadvantage\u201d from discrimination would be litigable.[65] But these particulars are not why Muldrow matters to the future of Griggs. Shifting our focus to the statutory language at issue and the Court\u2019s reasoning makes the case\u2019s relevance clear. B. The Court\u2019s Unanimous Interpretation of Title VII (as Amended in 1991) In Muldrow, Justice Kagan wrote for a six-Justice majority.[66] While three Justices filed concurring opinions, none provided a different assessment of any point relevant here.[67] On all of the following points, Justice Kagan spoke for a unanimous court. Justice Kagan began by noting that Title VII prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against any individual . . . because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d[68] She emphasized that \u201cthe statutory language . . . prohibits \u2018discriminat[ing] against\u2019 an individual . . . because of that individual\u2019s\u201d demography and clarified that \u201cthe statute targets practices that \u2018treat[] a person worse\u2019 because of sex or other protected trait\u2019\u201d\u2014\u201c\u2018Discriminate against\u2019 means treat worse.\u201d[69] Justice Kagan said that was sensible because \u201cthe anti-discrimination provision . . . \u2018seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against\u2019 because of traits like race and sex. The provision thus flatly \u2018prevent[s] injury to individuals based on\u2019 status . . . without distinguishing between\u201d them.[70] The Court admitted that there were policy arguments to the contrary, but it rejected them because \u201cpolicy objections cannot override Title VII\u2019s text.\u201d[71] Still, Justice Kagan addressed the merits of one of those policy arguments: that \u201ca significant-injury requirement is needed to prevent transferred employees from \u2018swamp[ing] courts and employers\u2019 with insubstantial lawsuits requiring \u2018burdensome discovery and trials.\u2019\u201d[72] The Court found \u201creason to doubt that the floodgates will open in the way feared.\u201d \u201cPerhaps most notably,\u201d the Court doubted the sky would fall because Title VII \u201crequires that the employer have acted for discriminatory reasons\u2014\u2018because of\u2019 sex or race or other protected trait,\u201d and because \u201ca court may consider whether a less harmful act is, in a given context, less suggestive of intentional discrimination.\u201d[73] The Court clearly believed this factor would successfully prevent a flood of cases. But it also addressed the possibility that the flood could come anyways: even supposing the City\u2019s worst predictions come true, that would be the result of the statute Congress drafted. As we noted in another Title VII decision, we will not \u201cadd words to the law\u201d to achieve what some employers might think \u201ca desirable result.\u201d Had Congress wanted [to write a law aimed at a different result,] it could have done so. By contrast, this Court does not get to make that judgment.[74] C. Implications of Muldrow\u2019s Reasoning for Title VII Disparate-Impact Liability The statutory language at issue in Muldrow\u2014barring discrimination \u201cbecause of\u201d demography\u2014is present in all the subparts of Title VII\u2019s prohibitions.[75] Thus, Muldrow interpreted the same statutory language that Griggs did. As Muldrow hammered home relentlessly, that language bans \u201ctreating people worse\u201d \u201cbecause of\u201d their demographic status, and it provides justification for punishing only (and all) defendants who \u201cacted for discriminatory reasons\u201d (however damaging their discriminatory acts). But the defining feature of Griggs\u2019s disparate-impact regime is its assignment of liability to those who acted without discriminatory reasons. This means Griggs and Muldrow are fundamentally incompatible. This is most clearly seen in the Muldrow Court\u2019s discussion of Title VII\u2019s built-in gatekeeper. Justice Kagan suggested that the lower courts would be able to weed out small-potatoes cases by considering whether a \u201cless harmful act\u201d would be \u201cless suggestive of intentional discrimination.\u201d But that can only meaningfully help reduce courts\u2019 case loads if intentional discrimination is a necessary component of a valid claim. If Griggs is good law and disparate-impact claims remain valid, that gatekeeper can\u2019t work, because there is no gate to keep. Griggs stands as perhaps the modern Court\u2019s most prominent example of adding words to the law to achieve what some might think a desirable result.[76] It did so through quite possibly the modern Court\u2019s most aggressively purposivist decision, relying for its interpretation of Title VII entirely on policy arguments and the unfounded assertion that those policy goals were in the mind of Congress when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But Muldrow rejects the whole premise of such arguments, flatly declaring both that the Court \u201cdoes not get to make [such] judgment[s]\u201d and that courts should never allow policy arguments to override enacted text. This 2024 case deals with the statute as it exists post-1991. Justice Kagan and the Justices who joined and concurred in her opinion knew full well of the existence of subsection (k), but they rightly did not read it to have altered the text or meaning of subsection (a)\u2019s prohibitions. After Muldrow, it is clear that all nine Justices read the modern version of Title VII to mean that Griggs is entirely wrong. D. Stare Decisis Factors Support Griggs\u2019s Vunerability Though Muldrow shows that the current Court would likely not decide Griggs the same way, the Supreme Court does not always overturn precedents simply because it thinks they were wrongly decided. The Supreme Court most recently addressed statutory stare decisis in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.[77] The Loper Bright analysis simplified the broader discussion of stare decisis from Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.[78] As discussed in these cases, the traditional factors to be weighed in determining whether to overturn a mistaken precedent include: The nature of its error;[79] The quality of its reasoning;[80] The \u201cworkability\u201d of its rule;[81] The consistency of the opinion with related opinions;[82] The disruptive effect of its rule on other areas of the law;[83] The presence or absence of concrete reliance interests;[84] Intervening changes of law or facts.[85] None of these factors clearly favor retaining Griggs. 1. Nature of the Error and Quality of Reasoning Griggs\u2019s purposivist methodology has been categorically rejected by the Supreme Court. Griggs lacks even a rudimentary textual peg to any language that ever overcame bicameralism and presentment. It entirely lacks any discussion of how any portion of Title VII\u2019s language could possibly be interpreted to impose disparate-impact liability, as the opinion held. This is a categorical, not an incremental, error. The Griggs Court not only employed indefensible methods, it employed them badly, reaching an assessment of purpose clearly disproven by the congressional record. Congress did not mean to say what the Griggs Court ventriloquized into its mouth\u2014that employers should be liable for nondiscriminatory policies bearing unintended disparate impacts across demographic groups. Congress\u2019s actual enacted words\u2014as the Muldrow Court recently reminded us\u2014do not say that. Griggs\u2019s doubly-flawed reasoning places it in the far-low-tail of the judicial quality distribution. If these factors ever favor overturning a precedent, they do so here. 2. Concrete Reliance Interests Could anyone ever have relied on Griggs\u2019s holding that Title VII provides a cause of action for disparate impacts across demographic groups in structuring any employment affairs? As Professor Gail Heriot has written, all employment practices have disparate impacts across some forbidden demographic groups.[86] No employer can ever structure its affairs to completely avoid any disparate impacts. All any employer can ever rely on in structuring its employment decisions to seek to avoid liability is the EEOC\u2019s guidance on what disparate impacts will interest it sufficiently for it to bring litigation. That guidance shifts more-or-less continuously with the EEOC\u2019s majority. The very fact that the EEOC\u2019s guidance shifts so frequently demonstrates that employers cannot have any fixed, justified reliance on Griggs itself. Thus this factor cannot favor Griggs\u2019s retention either. 3. Workability Workability is a closer call, depending on whose vantage the Court adopts in assessing the workability of Griggs\u2019s rule and any potential replacement. To the extent this factor gauges the workability of disparate-impact liability for courts, it would be hard to argue after five decades that Griggs\u2019s standard is unworkable. Courts have worked with it throughout that time. They could continue to do so. Still, the factor remains at best ambiguous. If the Court instead focused on the workability of Griggs as guidance to employees and employers seeking to comply with Title VII, it would find that the disparate-impact liability Griggs established is completely unworkable. Since all employment policies have a disparate impact across some relevant demographic threshold, how workable would the Court find a rule that makes every policy presumptively illegal, subject only to a business-necessity defense? 4. Consistency With and Disruptive Effect on Other Areas of Law Griggs\u2019s inconsistency with and disruptive effect on other areas of law, on the other hand, are so pronounced that these factors cut against retaining Griggs as clearly as they could ever cut against retaining any mistaken decision. Griggs\u2019s logic has long bedeviled other areas of law and continues to conjure problems for them. More than a half century later, we continue to litigate theories of disparate-impact liability under the regulations for Title VI of the Civil Rights Act,[87] under the regulations for Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972,[88] and under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.[89] This is true despite the fact that the courts have consistently held for decades that Title VI and Title IX\u2019s nearly identical language to that in Title VII does not make them disparate-impact statutes,[90] and their even longer-standing insistence that the Equal Protection Clause bans only intentional discrimination rather than facially neutral policies bearing disparate impacts across demographic groups.[91] 5. Intervening Changes of Fact or Law Finally, intervening changes of fact and law strongly counsel against retaining Griggs\u2019s error. On the factual side, Griggs\u2019s issuance in 1971 followed the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by only seven years. As demonstrated in contemporaneous school-desegregation cases,[92] among many other examples, Griggs was decided at a moment when it was arguable that Jim Crow yet clung to life and might resurge if given the chance. Today, such facts feel as though they are from another age of the world. Justice Thomas spent his early years attending segregated schools in the Deep South,[93] and he is now America\u2019s leading opponent of disparate-impact theory from his perch on the highest Court in the land.[94] America\u2019s two largest states have no racial majority.[95] The nation as a whole is projected to follow them by 2045.[96] Our major parties are now both multi-racial, multi-confessional coalitions.[97] There is no audience or appetite for more racial discrimination by governments, a point that the public has insisted on consistently for decades.[98] These are precisely the kind of facts that tip the factor toward favoring reversal of a precedent. On the legal side, as noted, the Supreme Court\u2019s Muldrow decision interprets the same language of the same statute that Griggs did in an irreconcilable way. Griggs adopted its incompatible interpretation of Title VII, in part, based on the alleged propriety of judicial deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute.[99] The Supreme Cout has since abandoned such deference and recommitted the judiciary to performing its independent constitutional obligation to deterimine and apply the most accurate interpretation of statutes possible.[100] Intervening legal changes thus also favor reconsideration of Griggs. 6. In Sum: Stare Decisis Factors Counsel Overturning Griggs Of the seven factors furnished by the Court\u2019s precedents on precedent, at least six\u2014and arguably all seven\u2014weigh against retaining Griggs. The decision is therefore not just wrong; it is precisely the kind of wrong that stare decisis does not protect. VI. How to Correct Griggs The Supreme Court has invited what appears to be a thoroughly justified challenge to Griggs and its creation from whole cloth of a cause of action against employers whose facially neutral, even-handedly applied policies produce disparate impacts across demographic groups. President Trump has even more clearly invited such a challenge by either a federal agency or a private actor.[101] Someone still must bring that challenge to court for it to make its way to the Justices. There are a few different options for how a party could get such a challenge into court: (a) through action of the EEOC; \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 42,000 characters]\n\n36: Supreme Court Should Not Turn Equal Protection Clause ...

Skrmetti, a case in which the Court is considering whether Tennessee\u2019s ban on providing gender-affirming medical care to transgender adolescents violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC) Director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program David Gans issued the following reaction: The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equality under the law to all persons without exception. Consistent with that guarantee, the Supreme Court has for decades repeatedly held that all sex-based classifications must be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny. Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender adolescents is unquestionably sex-based. Rather than regulating on a neutral basis, the legislature wrote a statute that uses a person\u2019s sex to determine whether certain types of medical care are prohibited or not. As Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices, that is a \u201cfacial sex-classification, full stop.\u201d None of the justices said anything that meaningfully suggests otherwise. Instead, some of the Court\u2019s conservative justices seemed to shrink from applying the Constitution\u2019s protections against sex-based laws, suggesting courts should defer to legislative judgments in an area of evolving debate rather than give them a hard look to ensure they respect the right to equal protection of the laws. But that is not the way the Equal Protection Clause works. The Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution to check state-sponsored discrimination and vindicate the equality of all persons. Deferring to the state when it discriminates on the basis of sex would turn the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s promise of equality on its head. CAC Vice President Praveen Fernandes added this reaction: Time and time again during today\u2019s oral argument, the discussion made clear that the Tennessee statute at issue, S.B. 1, contains a facial sex-classification. To not require this statute to be subject to heightened scrutiny would be to disregard the Constitution\u2019s text and history, along with the Court\u2019s own precedent. It would also be a betrayal of the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality\u2014a promise enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment, and further developed in other amendments, including the Nineteenth Amendment. ## Get updates on our work Join CAC's Constitutional Progressives email list for updates on our work!

Back to Blog Blog Post The Supreme Court questions law on gender affirming care for teenagers December 9, 2024 | by Scott Bomboy More in Constitution Daily Blog A divided Supreme Court on Dec. 4, 2024 considered one of the highest profile cases in its current term, leaving perhaps more questions than answers about how it will decide if a state can regulate gender-affirming health care for teenagers. The case of United States v. Skrmetti \u00a0is an appeal from the Biden administration and several families from a decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding a Tennessee law that greatly restricted such care to limited circumstances. The challengers argued the law violates the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and that the Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) made clear that discrimination on the basis of gender identity constitutes \u00a0discrimination on the basis of sex. A divided Sixth Circuit Court found that the law did not discriminate on the basis of sex, did not violate due process, and that the Bostock decision did not apply in this case. Tennessee enacted SB1 in March 2023, which prohibits health care providers from \u201c[p]rescribing, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker or hormone\u201d to minors, or anyone under the age of 18, who identify with a gender other than their sex assigned at birth. The law has limited exceptions in cases of a \u201ccongenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical injury,\u201d and for procedures that began prior to the passage of the act and concluded on or before March 31, 2024. Not long after, Kentucky enacted a similar law, banning medical treatments \u201cfor the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of, or to validate a minor\u2019s perception of, [a] minor\u2019s sex.\u201d Relate Podcast: Can Tennessee Ban Medical Transitions for Transgender Minors? Soon after the laws were passed, several families from both states challenged them in federal court. Federal district courts in each state blocked the laws from going into effect. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court considered both the Tennessee and Kentucky cases together, and reversed the injunction, finding that the states were likely to win. The Biden administration intervened in the Tennessee case to support the challengers, and the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. During Supreme Court arguments on Dec. 4, the justices posed a variety of questions to the attorneys for various parties in the case focusing on the equal protection issue. After U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar opened arguments by calling SB1 a \u201csweeping ban,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas countered with a qualification: \u201cIt\u2019s really for minors. So why isn\u2019t this simply a case of age classification when it comes to these treatments as opposed to a ban, as you suggested in your opening statement?\u201d Prelogar replied that the law packages an \u201cage classification with a sex restriction,\u201d and that \u201cyou can\u2019t avoid heightened scrutiny just because you have a non-protected characteristic that accompanies the protected one.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts brought up a different line of arguments about an analysis of medical conditions that was outside of the court\u2019s expertise. \u201cWe are not the best situated to address issues like that,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s true, doesn\u2019t that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?\u201d Prelogar said the Court could recognize SB1 as \u201ca facial sex classification\u201d and then have the Sixth Circuit reconsider the case. Justice Samuel Alito pointed out research in Europe that claimed to find more risks than benefits in the use of puberty blockers and gender-affirming treatments. Prelogar noted however that despite certain research, these countries had not yet banned such care, and again returned to a discrimination argument. \u201cWe think the court here just needs to recognize the sex-based classification in this statute and send the case back,\u201d she told Justice Alito. Alito then described Prelogar as making a \u201cBostock-like\u201d argument, but said the Bostock precedent did not apply in the Skrmetti case, since that case involved the interpretation of a particular statute. Instead, Alito mentioned two other decisions, Geduldig v. Aiello (1974), a case that upheld denial of certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities, and Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization (2022), which struck down the constitutional right to abortion, as more appropriate in considering the Equal Protection Clause\u2019s application to medical conditions associated with just one sex. Prelogar countered that the Court\u2019s approach in Bostock to determining if there is a facial sex classification was applicable here, and the reasoning from the two other cases did not contradict this approach either. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson saw parallels in the debate in Skrmetti with the Court\u2019s precedent in Loving v. Virginia (1967). \u201cThese questions about sort of who decides and the concerns and legislative prerogatives, et cetera, sound very familiar to me. They sound in the same kinds of arguments that were made back in the day, the \u201950s, \u201960s, with respect to racial classifications and inconsistencies,\u201d Jackson told Prelogar. \u201cI\u2019m thinking in particular about Loving.\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh also asked Matthew Rice, the solicitor for the state of Tennessee, if the questions presented in Skrmetti were best left to state lawmakers to decide. \u201cNo matter how you draw these lines, there are risks and\u2026 potential benefits and\u2014and harms to people on both sides. And the question of how to balance those harms is not a question for the judiciary. It\u2019s a question for the legislature,\u201d Rice responded. Justice Jackson told Rice that line of thinking was inconsistent with the Court\u2019s prior decisions. \u201cCan states make a different choice if doing so means that a state\u2019s law operates to treat its citizens differently on the basis of\u2014name the suspect classification. I thought that was the work of the Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause?\u201d Justice Elena Kagan was also worried about the message that could be communicated by the Tennessee law \u201cthat there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong, fundamentally bad, about youth who are \u2026 trying to transition. And that\u2019s the way this purpose seems to me.\u201d Rice countered that the law did not \u201csupport the narrative that Tennessee wants boys to live as boys and girls to live as girls.\u201d Also noteworthy was the one justice who remained silent during arguments was the drafter of the majority decision in Bostock, Justice Neil Gorsuch. The Skrmetti decision will be closely analyzed when the Court issues its decision before late June 2025, since several of the questions presented to the justices will likely be back before them in future years. Other issues mentioned briefly in the arguments were public access to bathrooms and athletic competitions based on gender identity, and the role of parental rights in medical decision making.

Duke Power Co.[1]\u2014almost all legal commentators have accepted that decision\u2019s insistence that Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 imposes liability on employers for policies that yield disparate impacts across different groups defined by their race, color, national origin, religion, or sex. They first claimed the original Act imposed that liability. When the Supreme Court began to correct its course and reconsider elements of Griggs, commentators asserted that Congress\u2019s 1991 amendments to the Civil Rights Act closed that door by ratifying the decision. These commentators have always been wrong and remain wrong now. No Congress ever passed, no President ever signed, and as a result Title VII never contained (and does not contain now) any language outlawing employment policies bearing disparate impacts across demographic groups or imposing disparate-impact liability on employers for using such policies. Our entire 54-year foray since Griggs has been an unwarranted mistake, which has harmed employment law and infected other areas with concepts incompatible with core constitutional commitments. We are long overdue for a reversal of the direction of American employment law. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, Mo.[2] unavoidably (whether or not intentionally) invites that reversal. I. Title VII and the Rise of Disparate-Impact Liability A. Congress Acts Against Intentional Discrimination In Title VII, Congress enacted specific language through bicameralism and presentment. While Title VII includes separate prohibitions for employers, employment agencies, unions, and training programs, they run parallel in prohibiting each from discriminating in employment actions against: \u201cany individual\u201d \u201cbecause of\u201d his or such individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d[3] Purely as a linguistic matter, these provisions focus on the intent of the governed parties as much as on their actions. They ban actions taken \u201cbecause of\u201d demography, not actions taken that result in any particular effect across demographics. This was how the main architects of Title VII understood their work. Senator Hubert Humphrey, the statute\u2019s main author, relied on the advice of Department of Justice lawyer Richard K. Berg in crafting this language.[4] Berg explained in a contemporaneous law review article: \u201cDiscrimination is by its nature intentional. It involves both an action and a reason for the action.\u201d[5] \u201cTo discriminate \u2018unintentionally\u2019 on grounds of race\u201d \u201cappears a contradiction in terms.\u201d[6] Furthermore, Title VII\u2019s legislative history teems with further support for this interpretation of its language as the dominant one in its original interpretive community.[7] The Senate passed Title VII only when it was satisfied that it dealt solely with intentional discrimination, and it very clearly would not have passed it without that firm understanding.[8] B. The EEOC Takes Over Through Title VII, Congress created the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to help administer the statute. Whatever Congress wrote and however the original interpretive community understood what it had written, once up and running, the EEOC had other plans.[9] The EEOC\u2019s first Chief of Conciliations rejected limiting Title VII enforcement to instances of intentional discrimination, instead openly advocating for imposing \u201cfair qualification standards.\u201d[10] His superiors listened and \u201cinterpret[ed] Title VII a step further than other agencies\u201d had for other provisions of the Civil Rights Act. The EEOC \u201creason[ed] that in addition to discrimination in employment, it is also an unlawful practice to [use] criteria which prove to have a demonstrable racial effect without a clear and convincing business motive.\u201d[11] Whatever Congress and the President had legislated, the EEOC \u201cinterpreted\u201d Title VII to impose liability on employers for policies bearing disparate impacts across demographic groups. These are not mere post-hoc impressions of the EEOC\u2019s motivations or unfavorable readings imposed with the benefit of hindsight. \u201cThe EEOC\u2019s own official history of these early years records with unusual candor the commission\u2019s fundamental disagreement with its founding charter, especially Title VII\u2019s literal requirement that the discrimination be intentional.\u201d[12] C. In Griggs, the Supreme Court Defers to the EEOC\u2019s Misreading Nonethless, overcoming clear text, historical context, and the preponderant weight of indisputable legislative history, the Supreme Court chose in 1971 in Griggs to defer to the EEOC\u2019s interpretation.[13] It did so unanimously,[14] on the purported basis that \u201cthe Act and its legislative history support the Commission\u2019s construction,\u201d \u201cafford[ing] good reason to treat\u201d the disparate-impact theory conjured by the EEOC \u201cas expressing the will of Congress.\u201d[15] It is worth noting how the Justices discerned that \u201cthe Act and its legislative history support[ed]\u201d this conclusion. They did not interpret or even rely on any language from section\u00a02000e-2(a)(1), the statute\u2019s main prohibitory section for employers.[16] Instead, they purported to divine an \u201cobjective of Congress in the enactment of Title VII\u201d as \u201cplain from [unspecified] language of the statute.\u201d[17] Despite that enacted language prohibiting acts taken \u201cbecause of\u201d demography, the Justices asserted that Congress had acted to achieve equality of employment opportunities and remove barriers that have operated in the past to favor an identifiable group of white employees over other employees. Under the Act, practices, procedures, or tests neutral on their face, and even neutral in terms of intent, cannot be maintained if they operate to \u201cfreeze\u201d the status quo of prior discriminatory employment practices.[18] Without explanation of whether they found such commands in any particular statutory language or where such commands might be found, the Justices declared that: What is required by Congress is the removal of artificial, arbitrary, and unnecessary barriers to employment when the barriers operate invidiously to discriminate on the basis of racial or other impermissible classification . . . . The Act proscribes not only overt discrimination but also practices that are fair in form, but discriminatory in operation. The touchstone is business necessity.[19] In 1971, the terms \u201cartificial,\u201d \u201carbitrary,\u201d \u201cunnecessary,\u201d \u201cbarriers,\u201d and \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d appeared nowhere in Title VII. In their absence, relying entirely on ether and vibes, the Supreme Court declared that \u201cCongress directed the thrust of the Act to the consequences of employment practices, not simply the motivation.\u201d[20] On that basis, \u201cgood intent or absence of discriminatory intent does not redeem employment procedures . . . that operate as \u2018built-in headwinds\u2019 for minority groups and are unrelated to measuring job capability.\u201d[21] The Justices asserted the support of legislative history for this result through what can only be described as chicanery, even by the low standards of arguments from legislative history.[22] The Griggs Court picked out congressional authorities the Justices seemingly believed to carry gravitas, quoted their statements, and bald-faced lied about what they meant. The unanimous Court referenced the history of senators adopting language allowing employers to use professionally crafted intelligence tests\u2014the very tests at issue in the suit before it\u2014name-checking \u201cSenators Case of New Jersey and Clark of Pennsylvania, co-managers of the bill on the Senate floor, [for having] issued a memorandum explaining that the [relevant language] \u2018expressly protects the employer\u2019s right to insist that any prospective applicant, Negro or white, must meet the applicable job qualifications.\u201d[23] The Court continued to quote the same senators\u2019 conclusion from that memo: \u201cIndeed, the very purpose of Title VII is to promote hiring on the basis of job qualifications, rather than on the basis of race or color.\u201d[24] Yet, according to Griggs, with only the sparsest explanation of any interstitial reasoning,[25] the resulting provision of Title VII allowed only \u201cemployment tests [proven by an employer to] be job related.\u201d[26] At the end of the day, Griggs made two epochal errors\u2014one methodological, one factual. First, the Griggs Court chose to base its statutory interpretation on an indefensible purposivist methodology. Second, its purposivism badly missed the mark in its fact-finding, concluding that Congress\u2019s purposes were other than what they were. As Justice Robert H. Jackson had written of another matter a generation earlier, the Supreme Court\u2019s Griggs opinion was \u201cnot final because we are infallible, but . . . infallible only because we are final.\u201d[27] Despite resulting from a mistaken application of an indefensible methodology, Griggs enshrined disparate-impact liability under Title VII in Supreme Court precedent. And that flawed precedent remained untouched for quite some time. II. The Usual Telling of the Civil Rights Act of 1991 A. Tightening Disparate-Impact Analysis It took almost two decades for the Supreme Court to express second thoughts over Griggs\u2019s unanimous defacement of Title VII. Those second thoughts took clearest shape in Justice Byron White\u2019s 1989 majority opinion in Ward\u2019s Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio.[28] Ward\u2019s Cove involved a challenge to a seafood cannery\u2019s policies as both intentionally discriminatory and having disparate impacts across races.[29] The district court entirely dismissed the case, and a Ninth Circuit panel affirmed; then the en banc court reversed the panel on the plaintiffs\u2019 disparate-impact claims.[30] The en banc Ninth Circuit concluded that, \u201cin such a case, \u2018[o]nce the plaintiff class has shown disparate impact caused by specific, identifiable employment practices or criteria, the burden shifts to the employer,\u2019 to \u2018prov[e the] business necessity\u2019 of the challenged practice.\u201d[31] Justice White did not revisit whether Title VII authorized disparate-impact suits. He didn\u2019t reverse the Ninth Circuit\u2019s burden allocation in the suit, either. Instead, the Ward\u2019s Cove majority faulted the Ninth Circuit primarily for failing to employ the proper comparator for the plaintiffs\u2019 racial statistics in assessing whether a disparate impact had been proven,[32] as well as for failing to require a causal link between the policies challenged and those racial statistics.[33] The opinion then sought to clarify how lower courts should assess the \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d defense created from whole cloth by the Griggs Court.[34] With regard to the comparator, Ward\u2019s Cove reiterated that in assessing whether a plaintiff has proven any disparate impact, the courts must compare \u201cthe racial composition of [the at-issue jobs]\u201d to \u201cthe racial composition of the qualified . . . population in the relevant labor market.\u201d[35] In addressing the need for a causal link, Ward\u2019s Cove made plain that \u201ca plaintiff must demonstrate that it is the application of a specific or particular employment practice that has created the disparate impact under attack. Such a showing is an integral part of the plaintiff\u2019s prima facie case in a disparate-impact suit under Title VII.\u201d[36] In clarifying the business necessity analysis, Ward\u2019s Cove held that, once a plaintiff shows a disparate impact, a defendant has the \u201cburden of producing evidence of a business justification for his employment practice,\u201d although the \u201cburden of persuasion . . . remains with the disparate-impact plaintiff.\u201d[37] The Ward\u2019s Cove Court clarified that all that was necessary was showing that \u201ca challenged practice serves, in a significant way, the legitimate employment goals of the employer,\u201d with \u201cno requirement that the challenged practice be \u2018essential\u2019 or \u2018indispensable\u2019 to the employer\u2019s business.\u201d[38] B. Ward\u2019s Cove\u2019s Rhetorical Move Away from Griggs On a substantive level, that was all that Ward\u2019s Cove did. It did not address the propriety of disparate-impact liability. It did not address the propriety of a burden-shifting rule. It just altered the standard a defendant-employer had to meet at the second stage of that burden-shifting analysis. The firestorm that followed would be inexplicable but for the atmospherics of Justice White\u2019s opinion; Ward\u2019s Cove rhetorically went further than its holding, seemingly inviting a successor case to ask the Supreme Court to take additional steps. The relevant rhetorical flight explored how the en banc Ninth Circuit had found the plaintiffs to have proven there was a disparate impact. By failing to identify a proper comparator, the court of appeals had allowed \u201cany employer who had a segment of his work force that was\u2014for some reason\u2014racially imbalanced\u201d to \u201cbe haled into court and forced to engage in the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the \u2018business necessity\u2019 of the methods used to select the other members of his work force.\u201d[39] This was unacceptable, because it would leave as the \u201conly practicable option for many employers\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 . . . to adopt racial quotas, insuring that no portion of their work forces deviated in racial composition from the other portions thereof; this is a result that Congress expressly rejected in drafting Title VII.\u201d[40] The Court rejected the Ninth Circuit\u2019s test for disparate impact as one that \u201cwould leave the employer little choice . . . but to engage in a subjective quota system of employment selection.\u201d[41] And Justice White went further, insisting that Racial imbalance in one segment of an employer\u2019s work force does not, without more, establish a prima facie case of disparate impact with respect to the selection of workers for the employer\u2019s other positions, even where workers for the different positions may have somewhat fungible skills . . . . As long as there are no barriers or practices deterring qualified [individuals from underrepresented groups] from applying for [such] positions, . . . if the percentage of selected applicants who are [from those groups] is not significantly less than the percentage of qualified applicants who are [from the same], the employer\u2019s selection mechanism probably does not operate with a disparate impact on [those groups].[42] C. The Usual Telling of the 1991 Civil Rights Act: Ward\u2019s Cove Repudiated Ward\u2019s Cove\u2019s refinement of the business-necessity defense was meaningful but comparatively trivial, so it is perhaps surprising that Ward\u2019s Cove set off a sufficient kerfuffle to trigger passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991. But that is exactly what happened. Perhaps Justice White\u2019s rhetoric was to blame. After all, while he was exactly right about how the en banc Ninth Circuit\u2019s analysis would play out, his critique employed more horsepower than necessary to make his point. His digression on the unfairness of hauling an employer through an allegation of discrimination applied equally well to an employer like Duke Power, the employer in Griggs which had proven that it had no discriminatory intent,[43] yet still found itself \u201chaled into court and forced to engage in the expensive and time-consuming task of defending the \u2018business necessity\u2019 of the methods used to select its workers.\u201d[44] Such employers surely did find themselves confronted\u2014as Justice White feared the lower court\u2019s rule would confront others\u2014with a situation where the \u201conly practicable option [was] to adopt racial quotas, insuring that no portion of their work forces deviated in racial composition from\u201d[45] anticipated norms. The critique hit so true and so broadly against the entire disparate-impact machinery\u2014quite possibly more true and more broadly than Justice White meant it to\u2014that, even though Ward\u2019s Cove only tweaked the minorest of that machinery\u2019s outlines, one might have reasonably read it as implying an openness to reconsidering the justness of the whole game. For that reason or whatever other, Congress was sufficiently scandalized by the Ward\u2019s Cove opinion to write and pass the Civil Rights Act of 1991. Commentators almost invariably describe the 1991 Act as having overturned Ward\u2019s Cove\u2019s purported attack on disparate-impact liability and having codified Griggs.[46] While there is a reason for this description, it misunderstands what Ward\u2019s Cove did that Congress felt it necessary to address. First the reason: the 1991 Congress included in the passed bill a statement of the Act\u2019s purpose. Section 3 reads: The purposes of this Act are\u2014 . . . (2) to codify the concepts of \u201cbusiness necessity\u201d and \u201cjob related\u201d enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., 401 U.S. 424 (1971), and in the other Supreme Court decisions prior to Wards Cove Packing Co. v. Atonio, 490 U.S. 642 (1989); (3) to confirm statutory authority and provide statutory guidelines for the adjudication of disparate impact suits under title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964.[47] Pay attention to Congress\u2019s specific statements and omissions. Section 3 states that Congress sought to unwind Ward\u2019s Cove\u2014which did not reach the propriety of disparate-impact liability\u2014and to \u201ccodify the concepts of \u2018business necessity\u2019 and \u2018job related\u2019 enunciated by the Supreme Court in Griggs.\u201d It does not say that Congress sought to codify disparate-impact liability as enunciated in Griggs, an issue Ward\u2019s Cove did not address. Section 3 does state that Congress sought to \u201cconfirm statutory authority and provide statutory guidelines for the adjudication of disparate impact suits.\u201d Even there, though, it never states that Congress intended to codify a cause of action assigning liability on this basis. Providing \u201cstatutory authority . . . for the adjudication\u201d of suits allows courts to hear such suits; it does not authorize any party to file or litigate them. And \u201cproviding statutory guidelines for the adjudication\u201d of disparate-impact suits means setting the parameters for how to decide such cases if they exist, but it does not necessarily address the issue of whether they exist at all. More importantly, Section 3 is a statement of purpose. The substance of the 1991 Act lay elsewhere. To conclude anything about what that substance actually does to the nation\u2019s laws, we need to review not only what Congress said it meant to do, but also what Congress did in the rest of the Act. Congress put the relevant substantive language in Section 105 of the 1991 Act.[48] III. The Text of the 1991 Act and What it Really Did There is no question that the 1991 Congress sought to codify Griggs\u2019s version of the business-necessity defense. But the business-necessity defense is not the totality, or even the most important part, of Griggs. Griggs\u2019s most important effect was to read disparate-impact liability into Title VII, which is different. Notice how\u2014there\u2014the pieces come together. Or rather, notice how they don\u2019t. The 1991 Congress knew how to amend the U.S. Code. Section 105 expressly does amend the U.S. Code to set out its allocation of burdens in the litigation of a business-necessity defense to any validly brought Title VII disparate-impact claims. But the 1991 Congress chose not to codify the statement of purposes they included in Section 3. The 1991 Act did not enact those purposes into the U.S. Code. Nor did the 1991 Congress amend 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02000e-2(a)\u2019s actual prohibitory language. Or add in the new section\u00a02000e-2(k) any supplement to Title VII\u2019s pre-existing, closed, defined set of \u201cunlawful employment actions.\u201d Instead, the 1991 Act left Title VII prohibiting exactly what it had prohibited in 1964: employment discrimination against \u201cany individual\u201d \u201cbecause of\u201d that individual\u2019s \u201crace, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d The new section (k) provides no more than that \u201c[a]n unlawful employment practice based on disparate impact is established under this title only if\u201d its criteria are met.[49] If Congress had written the law to render policies bearing disparate impacts unlawful employment practices, section (k) would dictate what would need to be established to prove such practices. But passing section (k) does not mean the 1991 Congress made such policies unlawful employment practices, created such a claim, or established that such policies were already unlawful or that such a claim already existed. Think of it this way: imagine Congress passed a statute providing that one\u2019s status as a 5-star Admiral is established only if one proves one is in the Navy. Would that statute mean that anyone proving they were in the Navy had thereby established that they were a 5-star Admiral? Obviously not. Could you even conclude from the fact that Congress had passed such a statute that there were any 5-star Admirals? Again, the answer is no.[50] Nor does the new language infer a silent redefinition of the prior statutory language. Imagine that, in 1964, Congress had passed a statute forbidding anyone from bringing a dog into the Capitol building and that ordinary usage, the straightforward meaning of the text, the historical context, and the clear, uniform legislative history all conveyed that when they did so, they were talking about man\u2019s best canine friends. Imagine that subsequently, in 1991, the Congress amended that Dog Ban to add a statement that, nonetheless, if one establishes that a hot dog is kosher, one may bring it into the Capitol. That amendment would certainly clarify the legality of bringing kosher hot dogs into the building. But would its blessing of kosher hot dogs retroactively alter the meaning of the original Dog Ban to prohibit individuals from bringing non-kosher hot dogs into the Capitol? Again, the answer is no. So long as this hypothetical Congress chose not to amend the original ban\u2019s prohibition, it would remain true in 1992 that no Congress ever had banned such \u201cdogs\u201d from the Capitol. The new language would clarify the legality of something no prior statute had prohibited. That might \u201cgild the lily,\u201d but it would fall well within the power of Congress. One cannot and should not\u2014just to render the new, confirmatory language more clearly non-superfluous\u2014read the 1991 amendment to do something it did not do: alter the original Dog Ban to prohibit the bringing of non-kosher weiners into the Capitol. Congress\u2019s language in section\u00a02000e-2(k) assigns burdens in the litigation of defenses available to a valid disparate-impact claim if there is such a claim. It goes no further. It addresses the small alteration of law effected by Ward\u2019s Cove. Like Ward\u2019s Cove, it does not address more fundamental issues that were uncontested in that litigation. Section (k) establishes necessary but insufficient predicates for prevailing on disparate-impact claims. It does not establish that the claims themselves are available. And the modern Court has been deeply hostile to the judicial creation of new causes of action unauthorized by Congress.[51] The usual telling of the 1991 Act\u2019s impact on Title VII both over-reads Congress\u2019s stated purpose in enacting the 1991 Act and wrongly assumes that the language Congress actually codified through the 1991 Act achieved that artificially broader end. On close reading, though, just as Ward\u2019s Cove did not go as far as its logic could have been read to extend, neither did the actual text of the 1991 Act go as far as the usual telling claims it did in responding to Ward\u2019s Cove. As textualism has taught us over its decades-long rise, what matters in determining the meaning of a law is the enacted, codified text of that law. The codified text of the 1991 Act does not say what the usual telling would have us believe. It does not create or establish the existence of a cause of action for employment discrimination based on disparate impact. IV. Further Buttressing: The Canon of Constitutional Avoidance In N.L.R.B. v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago, applying the doctrine of constitutional avoidance, the Supreme Court declined to interpret a statute in a way that would require it to resolve \u201cdifficult and sensitive\u201d constitutional questions.[52] Disparate-impact liability\u2019s constitutionality is, at best, \u201cdifficult and sensitive.\u201d[53] Under Griggs, where a facially neutral, even-handedly applied policy \u201cwould have a disparate impact, a decision-maker is often compelled to act intentionally on the basis of racial considerations to avoid the disparate impact, thus disparate impact regulations require decision makers \u2018to evaluate the racial outcomes of their policies, and to make decisions based on (because of) those racial outcomes.\u2019\u201d[54] It has been clear since the 1950s that the Constitution imposes the same constraints on the federal government that the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause imposes on the states.[55] At least seven of the current Justices have recognized this parallelism. Chief Justice John Roberts did so in Sessions v. Morales-Santana[56] and\u2014with Justice Samuel Alito\u2014in Ashcroft v. Iqbal.[57] Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan have done so repeatedly, including in Morales-Santana. In United States v. Madero,[58] Justice Clarence Thomas agreed, anchoring this constraint in the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Citizenship Clause, but continuing to find it imposed the same limits. Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s concurrence in Madero, slightly less explicitly, recognizes the same contours.[59] In 2021, Justice Brett Kavanaugh joined a concurrence to a denial of certiorari which agreed (by citation to Sessions and other authorities) that the \u201cFifth Amendment to the United States Constitution prohibits the Federal Government from discriminating\u201d in terms paralleling the Court\u2019s application of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.[60] Justices Amy Coney Barrett and Ketanji Brown Jackson appear to have not yet taken a position on this question since their investitures. Regardless of where this constraint on federal power is most properly found in the Constitution, the constraint\u2019s existence is by now a truth universally acknowledged. Exactly coterminous with the Equal Protection Clause, it renders all federal racial discrimination odious, no matter the context.[61] It \u201cdemeans the dignity and worth of a person to be judged by ancestry instead of by his or her own merit and essential qualities.\u201d[62] \u201cThat principle\u201d\u2014the core of equal protection\u2014\u201ccannot be overridden except in the most extraordinary case,\u201d where racial classification and disparate treatment satisfy strict scrutiny.[63] What once satisfied strict scrutiny may not always continue to satisfy it.[64] Is intentional employment discrimination so pervasive and hard to suss out today that disparate-impact liability satisfies strict scrutiny? These questions and their answers are, at least, \u201cdifficult and sensitive.\u201d Against this backdrop, the canon of constitutional avoidance furnishes a strong additional reason for the Court to address Griggs\u2019s lack of merit as a statutory precedent. Why deal with the thorny question of whether Congress violated the Constitution by imposing disparate-impact liability when it\u2019s both easier and more accurate to say that Congress never actually imposed it? Reversing Griggs\u2019s statutory mistake would free the Court from needing to resolve these nettlesome, difficult, and sensive matters of constitutional law. V. Muldrow: An Invitation to Revisit Griggs Perhaps you grant all this. Still, why bother speculating about whether the Supreme Court might have any interest in revisiting Griggs after 54 years? A recent Title VII decision of the Court provides an answer. A. Muldrow v. City of St. Louis Muldrow was a Title VII case, but it involved no disparate-impact claims. It saw allegations of intentional sex-based discrimination. The Supreme Court considered only one issue: the compatibility with Title VII of some courts of appeals\u2019 adoption of a requirement that only \u201cmaterially significant disadvantage\u201d from discrimination would be litigable.[65] But these particulars are not why Muldrow matters to the future of Griggs. Shifting our focus to the statutory language at issue and the Court\u2019s reasoning makes the case\u2019s relevance clear. B. The Court\u2019s Unanimous Interpretation of Title VII (as Amended in 1991) In Muldrow, Justice Kagan wrote for a six-Justice majority.[66] While three Justices filed concurring opinions, none provided a different assessment of any point relevant here.[67] On all of the following points, Justice Kagan spoke for a unanimous court. Justice Kagan began by noting that Title VII prohibits \u201cdiscriminat[ion] against any individual . . . because of such individual\u2019s race, color, religion, sex, or national origin.\u201d[68] She emphasized that \u201cthe statutory language . . . prohibits \u2018discriminat[ing] against\u2019 an individual . . . because of that individual\u2019s\u201d demography and clarified that \u201cthe statute targets practices that \u2018treat[] a person worse\u2019 because of sex or other protected trait\u2019\u201d\u2014\u201c\u2018Discriminate against\u2019 means treat worse.\u201d[69] Justice Kagan said that was sensible because \u201cthe anti-discrimination provision . . . \u2018seeks a workplace where individuals are not discriminated against\u2019 because of traits like race and sex. The provision thus flatly \u2018prevent[s] injury to individuals based on\u2019 status . . . without distinguishing between\u201d them.[70] The Court admitted that there were policy arguments to the contrary, but it rejected them because \u201cpolicy objections cannot override Title VII\u2019s text.\u201d[71] Still, Justice Kagan addressed the merits of one of those policy arguments: that \u201ca significant-injury requirement is needed to prevent transferred employees from \u2018swamp[ing] courts and employers\u2019 with insubstantial lawsuits requiring \u2018burdensome discovery and trials.\u2019\u201d[72] The Court found \u201creason to doubt that the floodgates will open in the way feared.\u201d \u201cPerhaps most notably,\u201d the Court doubted the sky would fall because Title VII \u201crequires that the employer have acted for discriminatory reasons\u2014\u2018because of\u2019 sex or race or other protected trait,\u201d and because \u201ca court may consider whether a less harmful act is, in a given context, less suggestive of intentional discrimination.\u201d[73] The Court clearly believed this factor would successfully prevent a flood of cases. But it also addressed the possibility that the flood could come anyways: even supposing the City\u2019s worst predictions come true, that would be the result of the statute Congress drafted. As we noted in another Title VII decision, we will not \u201cadd words to the law\u201d to achieve what some employers might think \u201ca desirable result.\u201d Had Congress wanted [to write a law aimed at a different result,] it could have done so. By contrast, this Court does not get to make that judgment.[74] C. Implications of Muldrow\u2019s Reasoning for Title VII Disparate-Impact Liability The statutory language at issue in Muldrow\u2014barring discrimination \u201cbecause of\u201d demography\u2014is present in all the subparts of Title VII\u2019s prohibitions.[75] Thus, Muldrow interpreted the same statutory language that Griggs did. As Muldrow hammered home relentlessly, that language bans \u201ctreating people worse\u201d \u201cbecause of\u201d their demographic status, and it provides justification for punishing only (and all) defendants who \u201cacted for discriminatory reasons\u201d (however damaging their discriminatory acts). But the defining feature of Griggs\u2019s disparate-impact regime is its assignment of liability to those who acted without discriminatory reasons. This means Griggs and Muldrow are fundamentally incompatible. This is most clearly seen in the Muldrow Court\u2019s discussion of Title VII\u2019s built-in gatekeeper. Justice Kagan suggested that the lower courts would be able to weed out small-potatoes cases by considering whether a \u201cless harmful act\u201d would be \u201cless suggestive of intentional discrimination.\u201d But that can only meaningfully help reduce courts\u2019 case loads if intentional discrimination is a necessary component of a valid claim. If Griggs is good law and disparate-impact claims remain valid, that gatekeeper can\u2019t work, because there is no gate to keep. Griggs stands as perhaps the modern Court\u2019s most prominent example of adding words to the law to achieve what some might think a desirable result.[76] It did so through quite possibly the modern Court\u2019s most aggressively purposivist decision, relying for its interpretation of Title VII entirely on policy arguments and the unfounded assertion that those policy goals were in the mind of Congress when it passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But Muldrow rejects the whole premise of such arguments, flatly declaring both that the Court \u201cdoes not get to make [such] judgment[s]\u201d and that courts should never allow policy arguments to override enacted text. This 2024 case deals with the statute as it exists post-1991. Justice Kagan and the Justices who joined and concurred in her opinion knew full well of the existence of subsection (k), but they rightly did not read it to have altered the text or meaning of subsection (a)\u2019s prohibitions. After Muldrow, it is clear that all nine Justices read the modern version of Title VII to mean that Griggs is entirely wrong. D. Stare Decisis Factors Support Griggs\u2019s Vunerability Though Muldrow shows that the current Court would likely not decide Griggs the same way, the Supreme Court does not always overturn precedents simply because it thinks they were wrongly decided. The Supreme Court most recently addressed statutory stare decisis in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo.[77] The Loper Bright analysis simplified the broader discussion of stare decisis from Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization.[78] As discussed in these cases, the traditional factors to be weighed in determining whether to overturn a mistaken precedent include: The nature of its error;[79] The quality of its reasoning;[80] The \u201cworkability\u201d of its rule;[81] The consistency of the opinion with related opinions;[82] The disruptive effect of its rule on other areas of the law;[83] The presence or absence of concrete reliance interests;[84] Intervening changes of law or facts.[85] None of these factors clearly favor retaining Griggs. 1. Nature of the Error and Quality of Reasoning Griggs\u2019s purposivist methodology has been categorically rejected by the Supreme Court. Griggs lacks even a rudimentary textual peg to any language that ever overcame bicameralism and presentment. It entirely lacks any discussion of how any portion of Title VII\u2019s language could possibly be interpreted to impose disparate-impact liability, as the opinion held. This is a categorical, not an incremental, error. The Griggs Court not only employed indefensible methods, it employed them badly, reaching an assessment of purpose clearly disproven by the congressional record. Congress did not mean to say what the Griggs Court ventriloquized into its mouth\u2014that employers should be liable for nondiscriminatory policies bearing unintended disparate impacts across demographic groups. Congress\u2019s actual enacted words\u2014as the Muldrow Court recently reminded us\u2014do not say that. Griggs\u2019s doubly-flawed reasoning places it in the far-low-tail of the judicial quality distribution. If these factors ever favor overturning a precedent, they do so here. 2. Concrete Reliance Interests Could anyone ever have relied on Griggs\u2019s holding that Title VII provides a cause of action for disparate impacts across demographic groups in structuring any employment affairs? As Professor Gail Heriot has written, all employment practices have disparate impacts across some forbidden demographic groups.[86] No employer can ever structure its affairs to completely avoid any disparate impacts. All any employer can ever rely on in structuring its employment decisions to seek to avoid liability is the EEOC\u2019s guidance on what disparate impacts will interest it sufficiently for it to bring litigation. That guidance shifts more-or-less continuously with the EEOC\u2019s majority. The very fact that the EEOC\u2019s guidance shifts so frequently demonstrates that employers cannot have any fixed, justified reliance on Griggs itself. Thus this factor cannot favor Griggs\u2019s retention either. 3. Workability Workability is a closer call, depending on whose vantage the Court adopts in assessing the workability of Griggs\u2019s rule and any potential replacement. To the extent this factor gauges the workability of disparate-impact liability for courts, it would be hard to argue after five decades that Griggs\u2019s standard is unworkable. Courts have worked with it throughout that time. They could continue to do so. Still, the factor remains at best ambiguous. If the Court instead focused on the workability of Griggs as guidance to employees and employers seeking to comply with Title VII, it would find that the disparate-impact liability Griggs established is completely unworkable. Since all employment policies have a disparate impact across some relevant demographic threshold, how workable would the Court find a rule that makes every policy presumptively illegal, subject only to a business-necessity defense? 4. Consistency With and Disruptive Effect on Other Areas of Law Griggs\u2019s inconsistency with and disruptive effect on other areas of law, on the other hand, are so pronounced that these factors cut against retaining Griggs as clearly as they could ever cut against retaining any mistaken decision. Griggs\u2019s logic has long bedeviled other areas of law and continues to conjure problems for them. More than a half century later, we continue to litigate theories of disparate-impact liability under the regulations for Title VI of the Civil Rights Act,[87] under the regulations for Title IX of the Educational Amendments of 1972,[88] and under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s Equal Protection Clause.[89] This is true despite the fact that the courts have consistently held for decades that Title VI and Title IX\u2019s nearly identical language to that in Title VII does not make them disparate-impact statutes,[90] and their even longer-standing insistence that the Equal Protection Clause bans only intentional discrimination rather than facially neutral policies bearing disparate impacts across demographic groups.[91] 5. Intervening Changes of Fact or Law Finally, intervening changes of fact and law strongly counsel against retaining Griggs\u2019s error. On the factual side, Griggs\u2019s issuance in 1971 followed the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by only seven years. As demonstrated in contemporaneous school-desegregation cases,[92] among many other examples, Griggs was decided at a moment when it was arguable that Jim Crow yet clung to life and might resurge if given the chance. Today, such facts feel as though they are from another age of the world. Justice Thomas spent his early years attending segregated schools in the Deep South,[93] and he is now America\u2019s leading opponent of disparate-impact theory from his perch on the highest Court in the land.[94] America\u2019s two largest states have no racial majority.[95] The nation as a whole is projected to follow them by 2045.[96] Our major parties are now both multi-racial, multi-confessional coalitions.[97] There is no audience or appetite for more racial discrimination by governments, a point that the public has insisted on consistently for decades.[98] These are precisely the kind of facts that tip the factor toward favoring reversal of a precedent. On the legal side, as noted, the Supreme Court\u2019s Muldrow decision interprets the same language of the same statute that Griggs did in an irreconcilable way. Griggs adopted its incompatible interpretation of Title VII, in part, based on the alleged propriety of judicial deference to an administrative agency\u2019s interpretation of a statute.[99] The Supreme Cout has since abandoned such deference and recommitted the judiciary to performing its independent constitutional obligation to deterimine and apply the most accurate interpretation of statutes possible.[100] Intervening legal changes thus also favor reconsideration of Griggs. 6. In Sum: Stare Decisis Factors Counsel Overturning Griggs Of the seven factors furnished by the Court\u2019s precedents on precedent, at least six\u2014and arguably all seven\u2014weigh against retaining Griggs. The decision is therefore not just wrong; it is precisely the kind of wrong that stare decisis does not protect. VI. How to Correct Griggs The Supreme Court has invited what appears to be a thoroughly justified challenge to Griggs and its creation from whole cloth of a cause of action against employers whose facially neutral, even-handedly applied policies produce disparate impacts across demographic groups. President Trump has even more clearly invited such a challenge by either a federal agency or a private actor.[101] Someone still must bring that challenge to court for it to make its way to the Justices. There are a few different options for how a party could get such a challenge into court: (a) through action of the EEOC; (b) through assertion of a straightforward defense against a pending disparate-impact claim that such a claim is unavailable under Title VII; and (c) through an employer\u2019s pursuit of a declaratory judgment. A. Dance With the One that Brung Ya: The EEOC Option Our disparate-impact journey started with the EEOC embracing an interpretation of Title VII through its guidance offered to American employers. The cleanest way to end this journey would be for the EEOC to end what the EEOC began using the same mechanism. Perhaps uniquely among America\u2019s federal agencies tasked with enforcing substantive laws, the EEOC has next to no substantive rulemaking authority.[102] Title VII does not empower the EEOC to write substantive regulations. As a result, the EEOC has no Title VII rules that it could change only through notice-and-comment rulemaking. Instead, the EEOC simply issues \u201cguidance\u201d documents to inform its regulated community of the priorities the EEOC intends to emphasize and the theories under which it intends to bring enforcement actions. Those documents do not\u2014and cannot\u2014alter substantive law. Nonetheless, they often affect the behavior of the regulated community, and they have been subjected to litigated challenges determining their legal merits.[103] The EEOC thus can simply correct its erroneous legal interpretation of Title VII, to which the Supreme Court deferred in Griggs. It would not be the first time the EEOC reversed a position it had previously taken, which in the meantime had become enshrined in precedent.[104] Such a self-correction is long overdue in the disparate-impact context. Indeed, given President Trump\u2019s recent directive to the EEOC concerning disparate-impact litigation, it may even be required.[105] Once the EEOC self-corrected, it could begin advancing its corrected interpretation of Title VII in the courts through amicus filings and interventions in ongoing litigation.[106] Or it could simply defend its guidance when challenged by a plaintiff in a declaratory judgment action.[107] Through any of these mechanisms, the EEOC could assure that litigation considered the propriety of its position and could advance that position through appeal toward confirmation at the Supreme Court. B. The Private Options Private parties need not wait on the EEOC to clean its house, though. They could take action right now to advance a correct understanding of the law. The two most obvious ways for a private party to do so would be for it to either (a) assert as a defense the absence of any Title VII cause of action to hold liable employers whose facially neutral, even-handedly applied policies have disparate impacts across demographic groups, or (b) file a declaratory judgment action against the EEOC seeking a ruling that, should the employer pursue a particular employment policy that has a disparate impact across groups, it will not incur liability under Title VII for doing so. 1. Defensive Assertion While there are comparatively few disparate-impact claims filed annually, they do happen. The simplest way to challenge the disparate-impact theory of liability in court would be for a defendant in such a suit to assert as a defense that Title VII gives rise to no such claim. Given the existence of Griggs, the defendant should expect to lose on this point in a district court. They would also need to resist settling their suit long enough to get to a final judgment that they could appeal, lose at a court of appeals, and convince the Supreme Court to grant cert, before\u2014hopefully\u2014prevailing with the Justices. There are countless reasons an accused employer might prefer not to take this route. Nonetheless, it is unquestionably the least problematic way to present the merits of the matter to the only Court that can undo Griggs. 2. Declaratory Judgment Action Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a02201, any party that could be named as a defendant in an action has the right to preemptively bring into federal court a declaratory judgment action against the party that could have otherwise sued it in such an action. Since the EEOC has the enforcement power to tee up Title VII enforcement actions, a private employer could therefore file a declaratory judgment action against the EEOC asking for a declaration of its right under Title VII to pursue a facially neutral, even-handedly applied employment policy that it has reason to believe will carry disparate impacts across demographic groups. Take a concrete example. Last year, the EEOC brought an enforcement action against Sheetz, Inc. and its affiliates challenging their practice of screening all job applicants for records of criminal convictions.[108] The suit argues that this practice violates Title VII because it \u201cdisproportionately screened out Black, Native American/Alaska Native and multiracial applicants.\u201d[109] Expressly, this disparate-impact claim \u201cdoes not allege that Sheetz was motivated by race when making hiring decisions.\u201d[110] An employer that is subject to Title VII and motivated to overturn Griggs could file a declaratory judgment action asserting that (a) it wishes (with only non-discriminatory motivations) to screen job applicants for criminal backgrounds, (b) it intends to even-handedly apply such a policy to avoid hiring all those\u2014from any demographic groupings\u2014who have parallel criminal histories, (c) the EEOC\u2019s policies, as most recently represented by the Sheetz litigation, give it good reason to believe that doing so would subject it to Title VII litigation, (d) it does not understand such a policy to violate the text of Title VII, and (e) it wants a federal court to declare its relevant rights before undertaking action that would expose it to damages. Such a suit should be procedurally ripe and proper. It should allow a party to establish this point of law without exposing itself to potentially ruinous penalties. VII. Conclusion Griggs was wrong the day it was decided. It ignored statutory text, misstated historical context, played fast and loose with legislative history, and invented a reverse-burn congressional purpose which it allowed to override all of those. As judges have noted for decades, disparate-impact theory is not just wrong, but wrong in ways that systematically require illegal behavior that could not be constitutionally mandated. Yet Griggs\u2019s extraordinarily poor reasoning has spread like a virus, infecting other areas of law and undermining core values of our legal system. Despite the evident unsoundness of Griggs and disparate-impact theory, many believe that Congress subsequently changed the law to ratify Griggs\u2019s wrongness. A close reading of the 1991 Act shows that this, too, is not the case. We don\u2019t have to go on like this. No Congress ever passed, no President ever signed, and no code section requires us to maintain this mistake. And both the very recent ruling of the Supreme Court in Muldrow and our general rules governing stare decisis indicate that, if given the chance, the Justices would (or at least should) correct course.

Skrmetti, a case in which the Court is considering whether Tennessee\u2019s ban on providing gender-affirming medical care to transgender adolescents violates the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, Constitutional Accountability Center (CAC) Director of the Human Rights, Civil Rights, and Citizenship Program David Gans issued the following reaction: The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment guarantees equality under the law to all persons without exception. Consistent with that guarantee, the Supreme Court has for decades repeatedly held that all sex-based classifications must be subjected to heightened judicial scrutiny. Tennessee\u2019s ban on gender-affirming medical care for transgender adolescents is unquestionably sex-based. Rather than regulating on a neutral basis, the legislature wrote a statute that uses a person\u2019s sex to determine whether certain types of medical care are prohibited or not. As Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar told the justices, that is a \u201cfacial sex-classification, full stop.\u201d None of the justices said anything that meaningfully suggests otherwise. Instead, some of the Court\u2019s conservative justices seemed to shrink from applying the Constitution\u2019s protections against sex-based laws, suggesting courts should defer to legislative judgments in an area of evolving debate rather than give them a hard look to ensure they respect the right to equal protection of the laws. But that is not the way the Equal Protection Clause works. The Fourteenth Amendment was added to the Constitution to check state-sponsored discrimination and vindicate the equality of all persons. Deferring to the state when it discriminates on the basis of sex would turn the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s promise of equality on its head. CAC Vice President Praveen Fernandes added this reaction: Time and time again during today\u2019s oral argument, the discussion made clear that the Tennessee statute at issue, S.B. 1, contains a facial sex-classification. To not require this statute to be subject to heightened scrutiny would be to disregard the Constitution\u2019s text and history, along with the Court\u2019s own precedent. It would also be a betrayal of the Constitution\u2019s promise of equality\u2014a promise enshrined in the Fourteenth Amendment, and further developed in other amendments, including the Nineteenth Amendment. ## Get updates on our work Join CAC's Constitutional Progressives email list for updates on our work!

Back to Blog Blog Post The Supreme Court questions law on gender affirming care for teenagers December 9, 2024 | by Scott Bomboy More in Constitution Daily Blog A divided Supreme Court on Dec. 4, 2024 considered one of the highest profile cases in its current term, leaving perhaps more questions than answers about how it will decide if a state can regulate gender-affirming health care for teenagers. The case of United States v. Skrmetti \u00a0is an appeal from the Biden administration and several families from a decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals upholding a Tennessee law that greatly restricted such care to limited circumstances. The challengers argued the law violates the 14th Amendment\u2019s Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, and that the Supreme Court decision in Bostock v. Clayton County (2020) made clear that discrimination on the basis of gender identity constitutes \u00a0discrimination on the basis of sex. A divided Sixth Circuit Court found that the law did not discriminate on the basis of sex, did not violate due process, and that the Bostock decision did not apply in this case. Tennessee enacted SB1 in March 2023, which prohibits health care providers from \u201c[p]rescribing, administering, or dispensing any puberty blocker or hormone\u201d to minors, or anyone under the age of 18, who identify with a gender other than their sex assigned at birth. The law has limited exceptions in cases of a \u201ccongenital defect, precocious puberty, disease, or physical injury,\u201d and for procedures that began prior to the passage of the act and concluded on or before March 31, 2024. Not long after, Kentucky enacted a similar law, banning medical treatments \u201cfor the purpose of attempting to alter the appearance of, or to validate a minor\u2019s perception of, [a] minor\u2019s sex.\u201d Relate Podcast: Can Tennessee Ban Medical Transitions for Transgender Minors? Soon after the laws were passed, several families from both states challenged them in federal court. Federal district courts in each state blocked the laws from going into effect. On appeal, the Sixth Circuit Court considered both the Tennessee and Kentucky cases together, and reversed the injunction, finding that the states were likely to win. The Biden administration intervened in the Tennessee case to support the challengers, and the case went to the U.S. Supreme Court. During Supreme Court arguments on Dec. 4, the justices posed a variety of questions to the attorneys for various parties in the case focusing on the equal protection issue. After U.S. Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar opened arguments by calling SB1 a \u201csweeping ban,\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas countered with a qualification: \u201cIt\u2019s really for minors. So why isn\u2019t this simply a case of age classification when it comes to these treatments as opposed to a ban, as you suggested in your opening statement?\u201d Prelogar replied that the law packages an \u201cage classification with a sex restriction,\u201d and that \u201cyou can\u2019t avoid heightened scrutiny just because you have a non-protected characteristic that accompanies the protected one.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts brought up a different line of arguments about an analysis of medical conditions that was outside of the court\u2019s expertise. \u201cWe are not the best situated to address issues like that,\u201d Roberts said. \u201cAnd if that\u2019s true, doesn\u2019t that make a stronger case for us to leave those determinations to the legislative bodies rather than try to determine them for ourselves?\u201d Prelogar said the Court could recognize SB1 as \u201ca facial sex classification\u201d and then have the Sixth Circuit reconsider the case. Justice Samuel Alito pointed out research in Europe that claimed to find more risks than benefits in the use of puberty blockers and gender-affirming treatments. Prelogar noted however that despite certain research, these countries had not yet banned such care, and again returned to a discrimination argument. \u201cWe think the court here just needs to recognize the sex-based classification in this statute and send the case back,\u201d she told Justice Alito. Alito then described Prelogar as making a \u201cBostock-like\u201d argument, but said the Bostock precedent did not apply in the Skrmetti case, since that case involved the interpretation of a particular statute. Instead, Alito mentioned two other decisions, Geduldig v. Aiello (1974), a case that upheld denial of certain benefits for pregnancy-related disabilities, and Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization (2022), which struck down the constitutional right to abortion, as more appropriate in considering the Equal Protection Clause\u2019s application to medical conditions associated with just one sex. Prelogar countered that the Court\u2019s approach in Bostock to determining if there is a facial sex classification was applicable here, and the reasoning from the two other cases did not contradict this approach either. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson saw parallels in the debate in Skrmetti with the Court\u2019s precedent in Loving v. Virginia (1967). \u201cThese questions about sort of who decides and the concerns and legislative prerogatives, et cetera, sound very familiar to me. They sound in the same kinds of arguments that were made back in the day, the \u201950s, \u201960s, with respect to racial classifications and inconsistencies,\u201d Jackson told Prelogar. \u201cI\u2019m thinking in particular about Loving.\u201d Justice Brett Kavanaugh also asked Matthew Rice, the solicitor for the state of Tennessee, if the questions presented in Skrmetti were best left to state lawmakers to decide. \u201cNo matter how you draw these lines, there are risks and\u2026 potential benefits and\u2014and harms to people on both sides. And the question of how to balance those harms is not a question for the judiciary. It\u2019s a question for the legislature,\u201d Rice responded. Justice Jackson told Rice that line of thinking was inconsistent with the Court\u2019s prior decisions. \u201cCan states make a different choice if doing so means that a state\u2019s law operates to treat its citizens differently on the basis of\u2014name the suspect classification. I thought that was the work of the Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause?\u201d Justice Elena Kagan was also worried about the message that could be communicated by the Tennessee law \u201cthat there\u2019s something fundamentally wrong, fundamentally bad, about youth who are \u2026 trying to transition. And that\u2019s the way this purpose seems to me.\u201d Rice countered that the law did not \u201csupport the narrative that Tennessee wants boys to live as boys and girls to live as girls.\u201d Also noteworthy was the one justice who remained silent during arguments was the drafter of the majority decision in Bostock, Justice Neil Gorsuch. The Skrmetti decision will be closely analyzed when the Court issues its decision before late June 2025, since several of the questions presented to the justices will likely be back before them in future years. Other issues mentioned briefly in the arguments were public access to bathrooms and athletic competitions based on gender identity, and the role of parental rights in medical decision making.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's central conflict has evolved significantly with the resolution of my primary uncertainty: the content of the Petitioner's Reply Brief. The argumentative landscape is now fully mapped out, and the predictive balance has shifted.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's (United States) Core Argument (Thesis - Reinforced & Sharpened):** The Petitioner's argument remains anchored in the *Bostock v. Clayton County* \"but-for\" sex discrimination framework. However, the Reply Brief has sharpened this into a direct and forceful rebuttal of Tennessee's core defense. The Petitioner argues that SB1 is a facial sex classification because its application fundamentally depends on an individual's sex (e.g., a person assigned female at birth is barred from receiving testosterone for transition, while a person assigned male at birth is not). The brief explicitly frames this as a standard equal protection case requiring heightened scrutiny.\n\n2.  **Respondent's (Tennessee) Core Argument (Antithesis - Countered & Contained):** The Respondent's powerful *Gonzales v. Carhart* deference argument, which relies on framing the issue as a legislative judgment about \"scientific uncertainty,\" has been directly and skillfully countered.\n    *   **\"Scientific Uncertainty\" Narrative Rebutted:** The Petitioner's Reply Brief does not attempt to re-litigate the science in the brief itself. Instead, it makes a crucial procedural argument: the district court already made detailed factual findings that the medical consensus supports this care, and those findings were not found to be clear error. The Petitioner accuses Tennessee of relying on \"selective and distorted presentation of the evidence\" and \"extra-record material.\" This tactic aims to neutralize the \"scientific uncertainty\" narrative by binding the Supreme Court to the existing trial record.\n    *   **\"Legislative Fact\" Doctrine Contained:** The Petitioner directly confronts the \"legislative fact\" argument by framing the issue as one of \"adjudicative facts\" found by a district court. The brief argues that the case is governed by \"ordinary principles of heightened scrutiny and clear-error review,\" effectively walling off the *Carhart* precedent as inapplicable. This forces the Court to either defer to the *district court's* findings or explicitly overrule them, a much higher bar than simply deferring to the legislature.\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Predictive State (Rebalanced & Refocused):** The final argumentative clash is now set. It is no longer a simple contest between *Bostock* and *Carhart*. The Petitioner has successfully reframed the central choice for the Court.\n    *   **The Court's Decisive Choice:** The Court must now decide whether to (a) treat this as a standard equal protection case, apply heightened scrutiny, and defer to the district court's factual findings (which would likely lead to striking down the law), or (b) create a significant new carve-out in equal protection jurisprudence by elevating the \"legislative fact\" / *Carhart* deference model over traditional standards of review for sex-based classifications.\n    *   **Shift in Predictive Balance:** My confidence in a ruling favorable to Tennessee has decreased. The Petitioner's Reply Brief was highly effective in dismantling the Respondent's most compelling path to an easy victory. The Respondent's arguments, while still appealing to judicial restraint, now require the Court to take a more activist step in modifying equal protection doctrine, rather than simply applying an existing precedent like *Carhart*.\n    *   **New Central Uncertainty:** The primary uncertainty is no longer in the legal arguments, which are now fully articulated. The uncertainty has shifted to the judicial philosophies of the Court's key justices, particularly Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Kavanaugh and Barrett. The outcome will depend on how they weigh their commitment to the textualist logic of *Bostock* against their inclination to grant legislative deference on contentious social and medical issues.",
          "design_beliefs": "The acquisition of the Petitioner's Reply Brief was a high-yield action that provides powerful validation for my DBOED methodology and adds significant new layers of sophistication to my strategic heuristics.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition (Stable & Confirmed):** This remains the foundational principle of my inquiry.\n\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Refined & Expanded):** The model is now more nuanced: **Thesis (Opening Brief) -> Antithesis (Response Brief + Key Amici) -> Rebuttal & Re-framing (Reply Brief).** I now understand the Reply Brief not just as a point-by-point refutation, but as a crucial strategic opportunity to define the ultimate question for the Court and seize control of the argumentative frame.\n\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection (Strongly Validated):** This observation is a textbook success case for this principle. I correctly identified the Petitioner's Reply Brief as the single greatest source of uncertainty, and its contents fundamentally re-balanced my predictive model. This confirms that targeting the action with the highest Expected Information Gain is the most efficient path to improving predictive accuracy.\n\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (`THINK` Actions) (Proven as a Core Strategy):** My previous `THINK` action correctly diagnosed the state of play and identified the critical next step, proving the value of pausing to integrate information and plan strategically.\n\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics (Stable & Integrated):** My library of legal patterns continues to grow and become more nuanced.\n\n6.  **\"Failed Search as Signal\" (Refined & Generalized):** This heuristic is now part of a broader principle: **\"Anticipate the Decisive Document.\"** Whether a search fails or succeeds, the key is to correctly identify the document that contains the most potential to resolve uncertainty. A successful search for such a document is a massive information gain.\n\n7.  **Refined Search Heuristics (Stable & Reinforced):** The principles of metadata verification (\"Precision is Paramount\") and respecting evidence timelines (\"Temporal Availability\") remain critical. The successful retrieval of both the cert-stage and merits-stage briefs highlights the importance of carefully reading metadata to distinguish between documents.\n\n8.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed):** The DBOED loop is functioning optimally. The analysis of the amicus brief (observation) led to a refined model (\u03b8) and strategy (D), which guided a targeted search (action) that yielded a high-value observation (the reply brief), leading to this major update.\n\n9.  **Amicus Briefs as Argument Amplifiers and Innovators (New Core Heuristic):** This remains a fundamental principle, validated by the fact that the Petitioner's Reply Brief spent significant effort rebutting arguments that were amplified by amici.\n\n10. **The \"Legislative Fact\" Doctrine (New Legal Heuristic - Now Contextualized):** I now understand this doctrine not as a trump card, but as one side of a coin. The counter-argument is to frame the disputed issue as an \"adjudicative fact\" determined by a lower court. The strategic battle is over this characterization. I will now analyze which characterization is more plausible given the case's procedural posture.\n\n11. **New Heuristic: \"Weaponize the Standard of Review\":** The Petitioner's brief provides a masterclass in this strategy. It turned the Respondent's call for deference to the legislature on its head by demanding deference to the *district court's* fact-finding under the \"clear error\" standard of review. I will now actively look for how litigants use procedural standards of review as an offensive argumentative tool.\n\n12. **New Heuristic: \"The Rebuttal and Reframe\":** I have learned that the most effective reply briefs do not just win arguments; they change the subject of the argument. The Petitioner successfully shifted the debate from \"Is the science settled?\" to \"Did the government meet its burden under heightened scrutiny based on the trial record?\" I will now analyze reply briefs for this powerful \"re-framing\" maneuver."

While the Petitioner's Reply Brief effectively dismantled Tennessee's initial line of defense, this new observation reveals the potential for the Court's conservative wing to construct a more sophisticated and resilient justification for legislative deference. The central conflict is no longer a simple binary choice but a multi-faceted contest over the fundamental legal framework itself.\n\n1.  **Petitioner's Core Argument (Thesis - Stable but Facing New Hurdles):** The Petitioner's argument remains that Tennessee's SB1 is a facial sex classification under the *Bostock* \"but-for\" test, triggering heightened scrutiny. This view is strongly articulated in the observed analyses (Doc 36) and reportedly echoed by Justice Jackson, who powerfully analogized the deference arguments to those rejected in the context of racial discrimination in *Loving v. Virginia* (Doc 14). This remains the most direct and textually grounded path to striking down the law.\n\n2.  **Respondent's Reconstituted Argument (Antithesis - Evolved & Diversified):** Tennessee's core argument for deference has evolved beyond a simple reliance on *Carhart* and \"scientific uncertainty.\" The observation reveals several distinct, and potentially interlocking, paths the Court's conservative justices might take to uphold the law:\n    *   **The \"Institutional Competence\" Path (Roberts & Kavanaugh):** As revealed in the oral argument summary (Doc 14), Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Kavanaugh appear inclined to frame this as a complex policy matter involving the balancing of harms and uncertain medical science, an area where they believe legislatures, not courts, should have primacy. This is a classic judicial restraint argument that sidesteps a direct engagement with the merits of the equal protection claim.\n    *   **The \"Medical Regulation\" Path (Alito):** Justice Alito has introduced a critical alternative framework. By invoking *Geduldig v. Aiello* (which found that discrimination based on pregnancy was not sex discrimination) and *Dobbs*, he suggests this case is not about status-based discrimination (*Bostock*) but about the state's power to regulate specific medical procedures. This is a strategic \"off-ramp\" that would allow the Court to distinguish *Bostock* and apply a much more deferential standard of review.\n    *   **The \"Discriminatory Intent\" Path (Inferred from *Muldrow* analysis):** The deep analysis of Title VII jurisprudence (Doc 49) provides the most sophisticated potential justification. It argues that the Court's recent, unanimous decision in *Muldrow v. City of St. Louis* strongly signals that liability for discrimination \"because of\" a protected characteristic requires proof of discriminatory *intent* or *motive*. A majority could import this reasoning into the Equal Protection context, arguing that Tennessee's law is not motivated by animus towards transgender individuals, but by a \"neutral\" legislative goal of protecting minors. This would allow them to uphold the law while claiming to be consistent with the textual principle of \"because of sex.\"\n\n3.  **Synthesis and Predictive State (Increased Uncertainty, Favoring Respondent):** The Petitioner's path to victory is narrow and clear: convince a majority that this is a straightforward sex discrimination case requiring heightened scrutiny. The Respondent's path is now a multi-lane highway. The conservative justices do not need to agree on a single theory; they can use a combination of institutional competence, the medical regulation framework, and a restrictive reading of \"because of sex\" to reach the same outcome.\n    *   **Shift in Predictive Balance:** My prediction has shifted back towards a ruling favorable to Tennessee. The number and sophistication of the \"off-ramps\" available to the conservative justices to avoid a direct application of *Bostock* are more formidable than previously understood.\n    *   **New Central Uncertainty:** The key uncertainty is now a clash of judicial frameworks. Will a majority be persuaded by Justice Jackson's analogy to *Loving* (a classic civil rights/status case)? Or will they be more compelled by Justice Alito's analogy to *Geduldig*/*Dobbs* (a medical regulation case)? The silence of Justice Gorsuch, the author of *Bostock*, is the critical variable. The *Muldrow* analysis provides a potential textualist-friendly path for him to distinguish *Bostock* and side with the conservatives, making his vote highly unpredictable.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, not only for refining my task-specific prediction but also for adding several powerful new heuristics to my general methodology for legal analysis.\n\n1.  **Explicit Uncertainty Decomposition (Stable & Confirmed):** Remains the bedrock of my process.\n2.  **Sequential Dialectical Analysis (Refined):** The model is now: Thesis (Opening Brief) -> Antithesis (Response Brief) -> Rebuttal & Re-framing (Reply Brief) -> **Judicial Stress-Testing (Oral Argument analysis & Metadocuments)**. This new stage acknowledges that after the parties have their say, the crucial analysis is how the decision-makers themselves will probe, reframe, and potentially reject the arguments presented.\n3.  **Uncertainty-Driven Action Selection (Strongly Validated):** The targeted search for analysis on the key median justices' philosophies yielded the most significant insights yet, confirming that focusing on the dispositive uncertainty is the most efficient strategy.\n4.  **The Deliberate Synthesis Step (`THINK` Actions) (Proven as a Core Strategy):** The value of pausing to synthesize and identify the next critical question is repeatedly confirmed.\n5.  **Expansion of Key Legal Heuristics (Stable & Integrated):** My library of legal patterns continues to grow.\n6.  **\"Anticipate the Decisive Document\" (Stable & Confirmed):** This principle holds.\n7.  **Refined Search Heuristics (Stable & Reinforced):** Precision and temporal awareness in searching remain critical.\n8.  **The Virtuous Cycle of Inquiry (Strongly Confirmed):** The DBOED loop continues to generate compounding returns on knowledge.\n9.  **Amicus Briefs as Argument Amplifiers (Stable & Confirmed):** This remains a core heuristic.\n10. **The \"Legislative Fact\" Doctrine (Contextualized):** This is now understood as one side of a coin, with the counter-argument being \"adjudicative fact.\" The battle is over characterization.\n11. **\"Weaponize the Standard of Review\" (Stable & Integrated):** This remains a key offensive strategy to watch for.\n12. **\"The Rebuttal and Reframe\" (Stable & Integrated):** I continue to analyze reply briefs for this powerful maneuver.\n13. **New Heuristic: \"Argument by Analogy & Transference\":** I have learned that deep legal reasoning from an adjacent area of law (like the Title VII analysis in Doc 49) can be more predictive than surface-level analysis of the immediate case law. The core principle (e.g., the meaning of \"because of\") can be transferred across contexts. I must now actively look for these transferable principles in think tank papers and law review articles.\n14. **New Heuristic: \"Identify the Off-Ramp\":** When a major precedent (*Bostock*) seems to dictate an outcome, the most important analytical task is to identify the plausible legal arguments that allow a court to avoid (\"off-ramp\" from) that precedent. Justice Alito's use of *Geduldig* is a perfect example. My analysis will now explicitly seek to map these potential off-ramps.\n15. **New Heuristic: \"The Unanimous Signal\":** A recent, unanimous decision on related legal language (like *Muldrow*) is an extremely strong signal of the entire Court's baseline interpretive consensus. This consensus can then be used to predict how they might approach a more contentious case. I will prioritize identifying and analyzing such decisions.\n16. **New Heuristic: \"The Silent Justice as Fulcrum\":** The strategic silence of a key justice in oral argument (like Gorsuch) is not an absence of data, but a powerful signal in itself. It often indicates that this justice is the ideological fulcrum on which the case turns and is unwilling to reveal their position.\n17. **Validated Source Type: \"Metadocuments\":** The search confirmed that high-quality analytical documents from sources like think tanks and legal commentary blogs (metadocuments) can provide a synthesis and predictive insight that is difficult to achieve by only reading primary source materials (briefs and opinions). This source type is now considered high-value."
