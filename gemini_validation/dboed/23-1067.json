      "Does the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia have exclusive jurisdiction to review an Environmental Protection Agency action that affects only one state or region, simply because the EPA published that action alongside actions affecting other states in a single Federal Register notice?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2015, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) strengthened its national air quality standards for ozone, requiring states to submit implementation plans that would prevent their emissions from significantly impacting other states\u2019 air quality. In February 2023, the EPA issued a final rule disapproving the plans submitted by 21 states, including Oklahoma and Utah, after evaluating them using a four-step framework designed to address interstate pollution. Oklahoma and Utah, along with various industry groups, challenged the EPA\u2019s disapproval of their plans in their respective regional circuit courts. The EPA responded by moving to transfer these cases to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit, arguing that because the disapprovals were published together in a single Federal Register notice and used a consistent analytical approach, they must be reviewed by the D.C. Circuit rather than regional courts.\n\nThe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit agreed with the EPA that the challenged rule is nationally applicable, so it granted the EPA\u2019s motions to transfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit.",

This will cause a massive update to my task beliefs (\u03b8), making the Task EIG extremely high. Concurrently, this action serves as the first empirical test of my newly formed design belief (D) that starting with the cert petition is the optimal initial step. Successfully retrieving and analyzing this document will provide strong positive evidence for this heuristic and allow me to refine my 'dual-layer analysis' principle by observing the strategic choices made by the petitioners.

Ave. N.W. \nWashington, DC 20001 \nCounsel for Petitioners \nState of Oklahoma and  \nOklahoma Department of \nEnvironmental Quality \n \n \n\n \n \n(i) \n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nUnder the Clean Air Act, each state must adopt an im-\nplementation plan to meet national standards, which EPA \nthen reviews for compliance with the Act. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410. In 2023, EPA published disapprovals of \n21 states\u2019 plans implementing national ozone standards. It \ndid so in a single Federal Register notice. The Act speci-\nfies that \u201c[a] petition for review of the [EPA\u2019s] action in \napproving or promulgating any implementation plan \u2026 or \nany other final action of the [EPA] under this Act \u2026 which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in\u201d the \nappropriate regional circuit, while \u201cnationally applicable \nregulations \u2026 may be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Circuit. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Parties from a dozen states sought ju-\ndicial review of their respective state plan disapprovals in \ntheir appropriate regional circuits.  \nThe Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits held \nthat the implementation plan disapprovals of states within \nthose circuits are appropriately challenged in their re-\nspective regional courts of appeals. In the decision below, \nthe Tenth Circuit held that challenges to the disapprovals \nof Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s plans can only be brought in the \nD.C. Circuit, explicitly disagreeing with the decisions of \nits sister circuits.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether a final action by EPA taken pursuant to its \nClean Air Act authority with respect to a single state or \nregion may be challenged only in the D.C. Circuit because \nEPA published the action in the same Federal Register \nnotice as actions affecting other states or regions and \nclaimed to use a consistent analysis for all states. \n \n\n \n \n(ii) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners filed separate petitions for review of sepa-\nrate agency action in the court of appeals. Petitioners the \nState of Oklahoma, by and through its Attorney General, \nand the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality \nchallenged EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s state imple-\nmentation plan. Petitioner the State of Utah, by and \nthrough its Governor, Spencer J. Cox, and its Attorney \nGeneral, Sean D. Reyes, challenged EPA\u2019s disapproval of \nUtah\u2019s state implementation plan.  \nThe Tenth Circuit procedurally consolidated Okla-\nhoma\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the same \nagency action filed by Oklahoma Gas & Electric Com-\npany, Tulsa Cement LLC, d/b/a/ Central Plains Cement \nCompany LLC, Republic Paperboard Company, and \nWestern Farmers Electric Cooperative. \nThe Tenth Circuit also procedurally consolidated \nUtah\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the same \nagency action filed by PacifiCorp and Utah Associated \nMunicipal Power Systems.  \nRespondent the Environmental Protection Agency \nwas the respondent in each challenge in the Tenth Circuit.  \n \n \n\n \n \n(iii) \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \n1. This Petition arises out of separate petitions for re-\nview of agency action that Oklahoma and Utah filed in the \ncourt of appeals seeking review of EPA\u2019s disapproval of \ntheir respective state implementation plans. See Okla-\nhoma v. EPA, No. 23-9514 (10th Cir.); Utah v. EPA, No. \n23-9509 (10th Cir.).  \n2. On May 30, 2023, the Tenth Circuit procedurally \nconsolidated Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s petitions with re-\nlated challenges to the same agency action. Oklahoma\u2019s \npetition was consolidated with petitions filed by Okla. Gas \n& Elec. Company, Tulsa Cement LLC, d/b/a/ Central \nPlains Cement Company LLC, Republic Paperboard \nCompany, and Western Farmers Electric Cooperative. \nSee Okla. Gas & Elec. v. EPA, No. 23-9521 (10th Cir.); \nTulsa Cement LLC v. EPA, No. 23-9533 (10th Cir.); W. \nFamers Elec. Coop. v. EPA, No. 23-9534 (10th Cir.). \nUtah\u2019s petition was consolidated with petitions filed by \nPacifiCorp and Utah Associated Municipal Power Sys-\ntems. See PacifiCorp v. EPA, No. 23-9512 (10th Cir.); \nUtah Assoc. Mun. Power Sys., No. 23-9520 (10th Cir.). \n3. Because EPA sought to dismiss or transfer the \nabove-referenced petitions filed in the Tenth Circuit, the \nTenth Circuit petitioners also filed protective petitions in \nthe D.C. Circuit. Utah v. EPA, No. 23-1102 (D.C. \nCir.); Oklahoma v. EPA, No. 23-1103 (D.C. Cir.); Okla. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. EPA, No. 23-1105 (D.C. Cir.); Tulsa \nCement LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1106 (D.C. Cir.); W. Farmers \nElec. Coop. v. EPA, No. 23-1107 (D.C. Cir.); PacifiCorp v. \nEPA, No. 23-1112 (D.C. Cir.). \n4. On February 27, 2024, the Tenth Circuit transferred \nthe challenges to the D.C.

R. 11 ................................................................ 3, 19 \n \n \n\n \n \n \n \n1 \nINTRODUCTION \nFive courts of appeals are in direct and acknowledged \nconflict over an important and recurring federal question \nabout how to interpret the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue provi-\nsion, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). States and industry from \ntwelve states filed separate challenges to EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval of their respective state\u2019s ozone plan for imple-\nmenting the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cGood Neighbor Provision.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, \nand Eighth Circuits held that venue for those challenges \nis appropriate in the regional federal courts of appeal. \nBut, below, the Tenth Circuit explicitly departed from its \nsister circuits and held that exclusive venue for this type \nof challenge lies in the D.C. Circuit. Pet. App. 8a-19a. This \nCourt\u2019s review is needed to resolve the split.  \nThe conflict centers on how to characterize the agency \naction being challenged. The Clean Air Act provides that \nchallenges to \u201cnationally applicable regulations\u201d may \u201cbe \nfiled only\u201d in the D.C. Circuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). But \nchallenges to \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d actions \n\u201cmay be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the appropriate circuit.\u201d Id. Under the statute, \u201cEPA\u2019s \n\u2018action in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan\u2019 is the prototypical \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction that may be challenged only in the appropriate re-\ngional court of appeals.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)).  \nThe Tenth Circuit held that challenges to EPA\u2019s dis-\napprovals of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s Good Neighbor plans \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nare challenges to a \u201cnationally applicable action\u201d because \nEPA combined those disapprovals with the disapprovals \nof 19 other states into a single Federal Register notice. \nPet. App. 13a. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Cir-\ncuits reached the opposite conclusion in addressing other \nstates\u2019 plans\u2014from Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Min-\nnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia\u2014\nthat were disapproved by EPA in the same 21-state Fed-\neral Register notice.  As the Fourth Circuit explained, the \nClean Air Act does not elevate form over substance: \u201cthe \nfact that the EPA consolidated its disapprovals in a single \nfinal rule does not, by that fact alone, make its 21 separate \ndecisions \u2026 a single nationally applicable action.\u201d West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024). \nThe confusion over the proper venue for challenges \nbrought under the Clean Air Act imposes significant bur-\ndens on courts and litigants. This Court has repeatedly \nrecognized the importance of clear jurisdictional and \nvenue rules. E.g., Navarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458, \n464 n.13 (1980). Confusion over where to file produces un-\nnecessary \u201cappeals and reversals\u201d and \u201cencourage[s] \ngamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 \n(2010).  \nThis case demonstrates those concerns. Petitioners \nare being forced to litigate in the D.C. Circuit, while chal-\nlengers from ten other states continue to litigate in the \nregional circuits. If this Court waits until final judgment \nto resolve this question, party and judicial resources will \nnecessarily be wasted: either Petitioners will be required \nto re-litigate (and courts will have to re-adjudicate) in the \nTenth Circuit, or parties in ten other states will be \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \ncompelled to do the same in the D.C. Circuit. Review now, \nbefore judgment, is therefore justified, as this Court has \npreviously recognized. See Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of \nDef., 583 U.S. 109, 119 (2018) (granting certiorari before \njudgment to resolve dispute about which court should re-\nview challenges under the Clean Water Act). \nMoreover, absent this Court\u2019s guidance, venue dis-\nputes under the Clean Air Act will continue to recur fre-\nquently. States must submit new implementation plans \nevery time EPA establishes new national standards for \nany given air pollutant\u2014standards EPA reviews every \nfive years. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(d)(1), 7410(a)(1). Challenges \nof the kind brought here are therefore common. Mean-\nwhile, venue questions arise in other Clean Air Act con-\ntexts, too, which has led to other circuit splits. And given \nthe immense role of this cooperative federalism statute, \nthese Clean Air Act cases often involve issues of tremen-\ndous importance to states, the economy, critical national \nindustries, and the public. Repeated and protracted dis-\nputes about venue only delay their resolution. \nThis Court should grant review to end the division \namong courts of appeals and the uncertainty over how to \ninterpret the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue provision. \nOPINION BELOW \n The decision of the court of appeals (Pet. App.1a-19a) \nis was selected for publication and is available at Okla-\nhoma v. EPA, 93 F.4th 1262 (10th Cir. 2024). \nJURISDICTION \nThis petition is filed under Rule 11 of this Court. The \norder transferring venue sought to be reviewed was \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nentered by the Tenth Circuit on February 27, 2024. This \nCourt has jurisdiction to review on a writ of certiorari the \norder below under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and 2101(e). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7410 and 7607(b)(1) is repro-\nduced in the appendix to this petition. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. The Clean Air Act centers around the \u201c\u2018core princi-\nple\u2019 of cooperative federalism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City \nGeneration, L.P., 572 U.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). It does so \nby delegating some regulatory responsibilities to EPA \nand others to individual states.  \nThe Act delegates to EPA authority to establish \nstandards that apply nationwide, such as the National \nAmbient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7409(a)-(b). Meanwhile, the Act gives each state the au-\nthority to \u201cimplement[], maint[ain], and enforce[]\u201d these \nstandards through state implementation plans based on \nstate-specific considerations. Id. \u00a7 7410(a); see also Train \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 421 U.S. 60, 79 (1975) \n(\u201c[S]o long as the ultimate effect of a State\u2019s choice of \nemission limitations is compliance with the national stand-\nards for ambient air, the State is at liberty to adopt what-\never mix of emission limitations it deems best suited to its \nparticular situation.\u201d). States thereby assume \u201cprimary \nresponsibility for assuring air quality within \u2026 such State \nby submitting an implementation plan for such State \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nwhich will specify the manner in which [the NAAQS] will \nbe achieved and maintained.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(a).   \nThe state implementation plan process involves a \nback-and-forth between EPA and the individual State. \n\u201cEach State shall \u2026 adopt and submit\u201d to EPA a state \nimplementation \nplan \nfor \n\u201csuch \nState.\u201d \nId. \n\u00a7 7410(a)(1). EPA then \u201cshall approve\u201d the plan \u201cif it \nmeets all of the applicable requirements of\u201d the Act. Id. \n\u00a7 7410(k)(3). \u201cThe mandatory \u2018shall\u2019 makes it quite clear \nthat the Administrator is not to be concerned with factors \nother than those specified.\u201d Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 \nU.S. 246, 257 (1976).  This means that EPA has \u201cno au-\nthority to question the wisdom of a State\u2019s choices\u201d in de-\nveloping a state plan. Train, 421 U.S. at 79; see also Union \nElec. Co., 427 U.S. at 269 (Congress delegated to states, \nnot EPA, the power to make \u201clegislative choices in regu-\nlating air pollution.\u201d). But if EPA validly \u201cfinds that a \nState has failed to \u2026 satisfy the minimum criteria\u201d of the \nAct, it may promulgate a federal implementation plan for \nthat state. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(c)(1).  \n2. The Clean Air Act provides for judicial review of \nEPA\u2019s actions under the Act, vesting original jurisdiction \nin the court of appeals. See id. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It then divides \nvenue, depending on the EPA action challenged, between \nthe regional courts of appeals and the U.S. Court of Ap-\npeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Id. \nThe Act provides for review in the regional circuits of \nactions under \u201cseveral specifically enumerated provisions \nof the Act,\u201d Harrison v. PPG Indus., Inc., 446 U.S. 578, \n584 (1980), including any EPA action \u201cin approving or \npromulgating any implementation plan under section \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \n7410 of this title,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Con-\ngress added to that list a catch-all: also reviewable in the \nregional federal appellate courts are \u201cany other final ac-\ntion of the Administrator under [the] Act which is locally \nor regionally applicable.\u201d Harrison, 446 U.S. at 584-85 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)).  \nMeanwhile, the Act states that challenges to certain \nother EPA actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7407(b)(1). This list includes EPA actions such as \n\u201cpromulgating any national primary or secondary ambi-\nent air quality standard,\u201d \u201cany emission standard,\u201d \u201cany \nstandard of performance,\u201d or \u201cany other nationally appli-\ncable regulations.\u201d Id. Finally, even for actions that must \notherwise be filed in a regional circuit, challenges to those \nactions \u201cmay be filed only in the [D.C. Circuit] if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator finds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a determi-\nnation.\u201d Id. \nB. Procedural History \n1. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone, lower-\ning the national air quality standard from 75 to 70 parts \nper billion. 80 Fed. Reg. 65,292, 65,293-94 (Oct. 26, 2015). \nThis triggered the responsibility for each state to develop \nan implementation plan for the revised NAAQS. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). One aspect of a state plan is demon-\nstrating compliance with the Act\u2019s \u201cGood Neighbor Provi-\nsion,\u201d which delegates to each state the task of ensuring \nno \u201cemissions activity within the State\u201d will emit \u201cin \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \namounts which will \u2026 contribute significantly to nonat-\ntainment,\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance,\u201d of the \nNAAQS by \u201cany other State.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). \nStates accordingly developed and submitted to EPA their \nrespective implementation plans to demonstrate compli-\nance with the revised ozone NAAQS, including the Good \nNeighbor Provision. In developing these plans, states \nworked in close coordination with EPA\u2019s Regional Offices. \nSee, e.g., No. 23-9514, J.A.424-26 (correspondence be-\ntween EPA\u2019s Region 6 Office and Oklahoma regarding \nOklahoma\u2019s draft Good Neighbor plan); No. 23-9509, \nJ.A.0069-73 (correspondence between EPA\u2019s Region 8 Of-\nfice and Utah regarding Utah\u2019s plan).1 \n Throughout 2022, EPA proposed to disapprove the \nstate Good Neighbor plans for 23 states. EPA published \nthe proposed disapprovals in separate Federal Register \nnotices, each covering a state or group of states within a \nsingle EPA Region. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798 (Feb. 22, \n2022) (proposed state plan disapproval for Arkansas, Lou-\nisiana, Oklahoma, Texas); 87 Fed. Reg. 31,470 (May 24, \n2022) (proposed state plan disapproval for Utah). In the \nproposed rulemakings, EPA purported to detail why each \nstate\u2019s plan should be disapproved, individually examining \neach state\u2019s specific submission, emissions sources and \ntrends, and downwind air quality contributions. See \n \n1 These citations are to the joint appendices filed in the court of ap-\npeals. The joint appendix (Dkt. No. 11041131) on the Oklahoma \ndocket (No. 23-9514) was filed on November 1, 2023. The joint ap-\npendix (Dkt. No. 11037455) on the Utah docket (No. 23-9509) was \nfiled on October 17, 2023.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \ngenerally id. In response, each state, and often regulated \nindustries within each state, submitted comments to the \nproposed disapprovals demonstrating why the state\u2019s par-\nticular circumstances showed the state\u2019s plan was factu-\nally, analytically, and legally justified. See, e.g., No. 23-\n9514, J.A.389-404 (Oklahoma comment letter on EPA\u2019s \nproposed Oklahoma state plan disapproval); No. 23-9509, \nJ.A.0145-48 (Utah comment letter on EPA\u2019s proposed \nUtah state plan disapp\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Ave. N.W. \nWashington, DC 20001 \nCounsel for Petitioners \nState of Oklahoma and  \nOklahoma Department of \nEnvironmental Quality \n \n \n\n \n \n(i) \n \nQUESTION PRESENTED \nUnder the Clean Air Act, each state must adopt an im-\nplementation plan to meet national standards, which EPA \nthen reviews for compliance with the Act. See \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410. In 2023, EPA published disapprovals of \n21 states\u2019 plans implementing national ozone standards. It \ndid so in a single Federal Register notice. The Act speci-\nfies that \u201c[a] petition for review of the [EPA\u2019s] action in \napproving or promulgating any implementation plan \u2026 or \nany other final action of the [EPA] under this Act \u2026 which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in\u201d the \nappropriate regional circuit, while \u201cnationally applicable \nregulations \u2026 may be filed only in\u201d the D.C. Circuit. 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Parties from a dozen states sought ju-\ndicial review of their respective state plan disapprovals in \ntheir appropriate regional circuits.  \nThe Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits held \nthat the implementation plan disapprovals of states within \nthose circuits are appropriately challenged in their re-\nspective regional courts of appeals. In the decision below, \nthe Tenth Circuit held that challenges to the disapprovals \nof Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s plans can only be brought in the \nD.C. Circuit, explicitly disagreeing with the decisions of \nits sister circuits.  \nThe question presented is: \nWhether a final action by EPA taken pursuant to its \nClean Air Act authority with respect to a single state or \nregion may be challenged only in the D.C. Circuit because \nEPA published the action in the same Federal Register \nnotice as actions affecting other states or regions and \nclaimed to use a consistent analysis for all states. \n \n\n \n \n(ii) \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioners filed separate petitions for review of sepa-\nrate agency action in the court of appeals. Petitioners the \nState of Oklahoma, by and through its Attorney General, \nand the Oklahoma Department of Environmental Quality \nchallenged EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s state imple-\nmentation plan. Petitioner the State of Utah, by and \nthrough its Governor, Spencer J. Cox, and its Attorney \nGeneral, Sean D. Reyes, challenged EPA\u2019s disapproval of \nUtah\u2019s state implementation plan.  \nThe Tenth Circuit procedurally consolidated Okla-\nhoma\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the same \nagency action filed by Oklahoma Gas & Electric Com-\npany, Tulsa Cement LLC, d/b/a/ Central Plains Cement \nCompany LLC, Republic Paperboard Company, and \nWestern Farmers Electric Cooperative. \nThe Tenth Circuit also procedurally consolidated \nUtah\u2019s challenge with petitions challenging the same \nagency action filed by PacifiCorp and Utah Associated \nMunicipal Power Systems.  \nRespondent the Environmental Protection Agency \nwas the respondent in each challenge in the Tenth Circuit.  \n \n \n\n \n \n(iii) \n \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \n1. This Petition arises out of separate petitions for re-\nview of agency action that Oklahoma and Utah filed in the \ncourt of appeals seeking review of EPA\u2019s disapproval of \ntheir respective state implementation plans. See Okla-\nhoma v. EPA, No. 23-9514 (10th Cir.); Utah v. EPA, No. \n23-9509 (10th Cir.).  \n2. On May 30, 2023, the Tenth Circuit procedurally \nconsolidated Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s petitions with re-\nlated challenges to the same agency action. Oklahoma\u2019s \npetition was consolidated with petitions filed by Okla. Gas \n& Elec. Company, Tulsa Cement LLC, d/b/a/ Central \nPlains Cement Company LLC, Republic Paperboard \nCompany, and Western Farmers Electric Cooperative. \nSee Okla. Gas & Elec. v. EPA, No. 23-9521 (10th Cir.); \nTulsa Cement LLC v. EPA, No. 23-9533 (10th Cir.); W. \nFamers Elec. Coop. v. EPA, No. 23-9534 (10th Cir.). \nUtah\u2019s petition was consolidated with petitions filed by \nPacifiCorp and Utah Associated Municipal Power Sys-\ntems. See PacifiCorp v. EPA, No. 23-9512 (10th Cir.); \nUtah Assoc. Mun. Power Sys., No. 23-9520 (10th Cir.). \n3. Because EPA sought to dismiss or transfer the \nabove-referenced petitions filed in the Tenth Circuit, the \nTenth Circuit petitioners also filed protective petitions in \nthe D.C. Circuit. Utah v. EPA, No. 23-1102 (D.C. \nCir.); Oklahoma v. EPA, No. 23-1103 (D.C. Cir.); Okla. \nGas & Elec. Co. v. EPA, No. 23-1105 (D.C. Cir.); Tulsa \nCement LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1106 (D.C. Cir.); W. Farmers \nElec. Coop. v. EPA, No. 23-1107 (D.C. Cir.); PacifiCorp v. \nEPA, No. 23-1112 (D.C. Cir.). \n4. On February 27, 2024, the Tenth Circuit transferred \nthe challenges to the D.C. Circuit. \n \n \n\n \n \n(iv) \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nQuestion Presented ............................................................. i \nParties to the Proceeding .................................................. ii \nRelated Proceedings ......................................................... iii \nTable of Appendices ........................................................... v \nTable of Authorities .......................................................... vi \nIntroduction ........................................................................ 1 \nOpinion Below ..................................................................... 3 \nJurisdiction ......................................................................... 3 \nStatutory Provisions Involved .......................................... 4 \nStatement of the Case ........................................................ 4 \nA.

States and industry from \ntwelve states filed separate challenges to EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval of their respective state\u2019s ozone plan for imple-\nmenting the Clean Air Act\u2019s \u201cGood Neighbor Provision.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, \nand Eighth Circuits held that venue for those challenges \nis appropriate in the regional federal courts of appeal. \nBut, below, the Tenth Circuit explicitly departed from its \nsister circuits and held that exclusive venue for this type \nof challenge lies in the D.C. Circuit. Pet. App. 8a-19a. This \nCourt\u2019s review is needed to resolve the split.  \nThe conflict centers on how to characterize the agency \naction being challenged. The Clean Air Act provides that \nchallenges to \u201cnationally applicable regulations\u201d may \u201cbe \nfiled only\u201d in the D.C. Circuit. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). But \nchallenges to \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d actions \n\u201cmay be filed only in the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the appropriate circuit.\u201d Id. Under the statute, \u201cEPA\u2019s \n\u2018action in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan\u2019 is the prototypical \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction that may be challenged only in the appropriate re-\ngional court of appeals.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.) (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)).  \nThe Tenth Circuit held that challenges to EPA\u2019s dis-\napprovals of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s Good Neighbor plans \n\n \n \n \n \n2 \nare challenges to a \u201cnationally applicable action\u201d because \nEPA combined those disapprovals with the disapprovals \nof 19 other states into a single Federal Register notice. \nPet. App. 13a. The Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Cir-\ncuits reached the opposite conclusion in addressing other \nstates\u2019 plans\u2014from Arkansas, Kentucky, Louisiana, Min-\nnesota, Mississippi, Missouri, Texas, and West Virginia\u2014\nthat were disapproved by EPA in the same 21-state Fed-\neral Register notice.  As the Fourth Circuit explained, the \nClean Air Act does not elevate form over substance: \u201cthe \nfact that the EPA consolidated its disapprovals in a single \nfinal rule does not, by that fact alone, make its 21 separate \ndecisions \u2026 a single nationally applicable action.\u201d West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024). \nThe confusion over the proper venue for challenges \nbrought under the Clean Air Act imposes significant bur-\ndens on courts and litigants. This Court has repeatedly \nrecognized the importance of clear jurisdictional and \nvenue rules. E.g., Navarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458, \n464 n.13 (1980). Confusion over where to file produces un-\nnecessary \u201cappeals and reversals\u201d and \u201cencourage[s] \ngamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. v. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 \n(2010).  \nThis case demonstrates those concerns. Petitioners \nare being forced to litigate in the D.C. Circuit, while chal-\nlengers from ten other states continue to litigate in the \nregional circuits. If this Court waits until final judgment \nto resolve this question, party and judicial resources will \nnecessarily be wasted: either Petitioners will be required \nto re-litigate (and courts will have to re-adjudicate) in the \nTenth Circuit, or parties in ten other states will be \n\n \n \n \n \n3 \ncompelled to do the same in the D.C. Circuit. Review now, \nbefore judgment, is therefore justified, as this Court has \npreviously recognized. See Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of \nDef., 583 U.S. 109, 119 (2018) (granting certiorari before \njudgment to resolve dispute about which court should re-\nview challenges under the Clean Water Act). \nMoreover, absent this Court\u2019s guidance, venue dis-\nputes under the Clean Air Act will continue to recur fre-\nquently. States must submit new implementation plans \nevery time EPA establishes new national standards for \nany given air pollutant\u2014standards EPA reviews every \nfive years. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7409(d)(1), 7410(a)(1). Challenges \nof the kind brought here are therefore common. Mean-\nwhile, venue questions arise in other Clean Air Act con-\ntexts, too, which has led to other circuit splits. And given \nthe immense role of this cooperative federalism statute, \nthese Clean Air Act cases often involve issues of tremen-\ndous importance to states, the economy, critical national \nindustries, and the public. Repeated and protracted dis-\nputes about venue only delay their resolution. \nThis Court should grant review to end the division \namong courts of appeals and the uncertainty over how to \ninterpret the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue provision. \nOPINION BELOW \n The decision of the court of appeals (Pet. App.1a-19a) \nis was selected for publication and is available at Okla-\nhoma v. EPA, 93 F.4th 1262 (10th Cir. 2024). \nJURISDICTION \nThis petition is filed under Rule 11 of this Court. The \norder transferring venue sought to be reviewed was \n\n \n \n \n \n4 \nentered by the Tenth Circuit on February 27, 2024. This \nCourt has jurisdiction to review on a writ of certiorari the \norder below under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1254(1) and 2101(e). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nThe text of 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7410 and 7607(b)(1) is repro-\nduced in the appendix to this petition. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Statutory Background \n1. The Clean Air Act centers around the \u201c\u2018core princi-\nple\u2019 of cooperative federalism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City \nGeneration, L.P., 572 U.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). It does so \nby delegating some regulatory responsibilities to EPA \nand others to individual states.  \nThe Act delegates to EPA authority to establish \nstandards that apply nationwide, such as the National \nAmbient Air Quality Standards (\u201cNAAQS\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7409(a)-(b). Meanwhile, the Act gives each state the au-\nthority to \u201cimplement[], maint[ain], and enforce[]\u201d these \nstandards through state implementation plans based on \nstate-specific considerations. Id. \u00a7 7410(a); see also Train \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 421 U.S. 60, 79 (1975) \n(\u201c[S]o long as the ultimate effect of a State\u2019s choice of \nemission limitations is compliance with the national stand-\nards for ambient air, the State is at liberty to adopt what-\never mix of emission limitations it deems best suited to its \nparticular situation.\u201d). States thereby assume \u201cprimary \nresponsibility for assuring air quality within \u2026 such State \nby submitting an implementation plan for such State \n\n \n \n \n \n5 \nwhich will specify the manner in which [the NAAQS] will \nbe achieved and maintained.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7407(a).   \nThe state implementation plan process involves a \nback-and-forth between EPA and the individual State. \n\u201cEach State shall \u2026 adopt and submit\u201d to EPA a state \nimplementation \nplan \nfor \n\u201csuch \nState.\u201d \nId. \n\u00a7 7410(a)(1). EPA then \u201cshall approve\u201d the plan \u201cif it \nmeets all of the applicable requirements of\u201d the Act. Id. \n\u00a7 7410(k)(3). \u201cThe mandatory \u2018shall\u2019 makes it quite clear \nthat the Administrator is not to be concerned with factors \nother than those specified.\u201d Union Elec. Co. v. EPA, 427 \nU.S. 246, 257 (1976).  This means that EPA has \u201cno au-\nthority to question the wisdom of a State\u2019s choices\u201d in de-\nveloping a state plan. Train, 421 U.S. at 79; see also Union \nElec. Co., 427 U.S. at 269 (Congress delegated to states, \nnot EPA, the power to make \u201clegislative choices in regu-\nlating air pollution.\u201d). But if EPA validly \u201cfinds that a \nState has failed to \u2026 satisfy the minimum criteria\u201d of the \nAct, it may promulgate a federal implementation plan for \nthat state. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(c)(1).  \n2. The Clean Air Act provides for judicial review of \nEPA\u2019s actions under the Act, vesting original jurisdiction \nin the court of appeals. See id. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). It then divides \nvenue, depending on the EPA action challenged, between \nthe regional courts of appeals and the U.S. Court of Ap-\npeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Id. \nThe Act provides for review in the regional circuits of \nactions under \u201cseveral specifically enumerated provisions \nof the Act,\u201d Harrison v. PPG Indus., Inc., 446 U.S. 578, \n584 (1980), including any EPA action \u201cin approving or \npromulgating any implementation plan under section \n\n \n \n \n \n6 \n7410 of this title,\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). In 1977, Con-\ngress added to that list a catch-all: also reviewable in the \nregional federal appellate courts are \u201cany other final ac-\ntion of the Administrator under [the] Act which is locally \nor regionally applicable.\u201d Harrison, 446 U.S. at 584-85 \n(quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)).  \nMeanwhile, the Act states that challenges to certain \nother EPA actions \u201cmay be filed only in the United States \nCourt of Appeals for the District of Columbia.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7407(b)(1). This list includes EPA actions such as \n\u201cpromulgating any national primary or secondary ambi-\nent air quality standard,\u201d \u201cany emission standard,\u201d \u201cany \nstandard of performance,\u201d or \u201cany other nationally appli-\ncable regulations.\u201d Id. Finally, even for actions that must \notherwise be filed in a regional circuit, challenges to those \nactions \u201cmay be filed only in the [D.C. Circuit] if such ac-\ntion is based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect and if in taking such action the Administrator finds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a determi-\nnation.\u201d Id. \nB. Procedural History \n1. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone, lower-\ning the national air quality standard from 75 to 70 parts \nper billion. 80 Fed. Reg. 65,292, 65,293-94 (Oct. 26, 2015). \nThis triggered the responsibility for each state to develop \nan implementation plan for the revised NAAQS. See 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). One aspect of a state plan is demon-\nstrating compliance with the Act\u2019s \u201cGood Neighbor Provi-\nsion,\u201d which delegates to each state the task of ensuring \nno \u201cemissions activity within the State\u201d will emit \u201cin \n\n \n \n \n \n7 \namounts which will \u2026 contribute significantly to nonat-\ntainment,\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance,\u201d of the \nNAAQS by \u201cany other State.\u201d Id. \u00a7 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I). \nStates accordingly developed and submitted to EPA their \nrespective implementation plans to demonstrate compli-\nance with the revised ozone NAAQS, including the Good \nNeighbor Provision. In developing these plans, states \nworked in close coordination with EPA\u2019s Regional Offices. \nSee, e.g., No. 23-9514, J.A.424-26 (correspondence be-\ntween EPA\u2019s Region 6 Office and Oklahoma regarding \nOklahoma\u2019s draft Good Neighbor plan); No. 23-9509, \nJ.A.0069-73 (correspondence between EPA\u2019s Region 8 Of-\nfice and Utah regarding Utah\u2019s plan).1 \n Throughout 2022, EPA proposed to disapprove the \nstate Good Neighbor plans for 23 states. EPA published \nthe proposed disapprovals in separate Federal Register \nnotices, each covering a state or group of states within a \nsingle EPA Region. See, e.g., 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798 (Feb. 22, \n2022) (proposed state plan disapproval for Arkansas, Lou-\nisiana, Oklahoma, Texas); 87 Fed. Reg. 31,470 (May 24, \n2022) (proposed state plan disapproval for Utah). In the \nproposed rulemakings, EPA purported to detail why each \nstate\u2019s plan should be disapproved, individually examining \neach state\u2019s specific submission, emissions sources and \ntrends, and downwind air quality contributions. See \n \n1 These citations are to the joint appendices filed in the court of ap-\npeals. The joint appendix (Dkt. No. 11041131) on the Oklahoma \ndocket (No. 23-9514) was filed on November 1, 2023. The joint ap-\npendix (Dkt. No. 11037455) on the Utah docket (No. 23-9509) was \nfiled on October 17, 2023.  \n\n \n \n \n \n8 \ngenerally id. In response, each state, and often regulated \nindustries within each state, submitted comments to the \nproposed disapprovals demonstrating why the state\u2019s par-\nticular circumstances showed the state\u2019s plan was factu-\nally, analytically, and legally justified. See, e.g., No. 23-\n9514, J.A.389-404 (Oklahoma comment letter on EPA\u2019s \nproposed Oklahoma state plan disapproval); No. 23-9509, \nJ.A.0145-48 (Utah comment letter on EPA\u2019s proposed \nUtah state plan disapproval); and J.A.0149-357 (Utah in-\ndustry comment letters).  \nEPA nonetheless finalized the disapproval of 21 state \nGood Neighbor plans, but it did so in a single Federal Reg-\nister notice. 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336 (Feb. 13, 2023). EPA\u2019s \nstate-by-state justification for disapproving each of these \nplans relied almost entirely on its assessment of the indi-\nvidual state plans in its proposed disapprovals. See, e.g., \nid. at 9,354-61.2 \n2. A mix of states and industry parties in 12 states \nchallenged their respective state-plan disapprovals in \ntheir regional circuits.3 In each of those regional courts of \n \n2 EPA has recently proposed to disapprove the state plans of five \nadditional states. 89 Fed. Reg. 12,666 (Feb. 16, 2024) (proposed dis-\napproval of state plans of Arizona, Iowa, Kansas, New Mexico, and \nTennessee). \n3 See West Virginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418 (4th Cir.); Texas v. EPA, \nNo. 23-60069 (5th Cir.) (Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi); Ken-\ntucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216 (6th Cir.); Arkansas v. EPA, No. 23-1320 \n(8th Cir.); Missouri v. EPA, No. 23-1719 (8th Cir.); Allete, Inc. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1776 (8th Cir.) (Minnesota); Nevada Cement Co. v. \nEPA, No. 23-682 (9th Cir.) (Nevada); Oklahoma v. EPA, No. 23-\n \n\n \n \n \n \n9 \nappeals, EPA filed motions to dismiss or transfer venue, \narguing that its state plan disapprovals were either \u201cna-\ntionally applicable regulations\u201d or \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d such that review is only \nappropriate in the D.C. Circuit under the Act\u2019s judicial re-\nview provision (42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). E.g. Mot. to \nTransfer, No. 23-9514, Dkt. No. 10983947 (10th Cir. Mar. \n16, 2023); Mot. to Transfer, No. 23-9509, Dkt. No. \n10983793 (10th Cir. Mar. 16, 2023). Until the decision be-\nlow was issued, each of the regional circuits declined to \ngrant EPA\u2019s motion to transfer venue. \nThe Fourth Circuit, in a published decision, denied \nEPA\u2019s motion to transfer, holding that review of West \nVirginia\u2019s challenge to its state plan disapproval was ap-\npropriate in that regional court of appeals instead of the \nD.C. Circuit. West Virginia, 90 F.4th 323. In an opinion \nby Judge Niemeyer, the court ruled that EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval of West Virginia\u2019s plan was not \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d noting that the \u201cfocus [is] on the geographical reach \nof the EPA\u2019s action\u201d\u2014which, in that case, was EPA\u2019s dis-\napproval of a plan for West Virginia. Id. at 328. It rejected \nEPA\u2019s argument that \u201cbecause [EPA] disapproved of the \n[state plans] of 21 States in a consolidated, single agency \naction, its determination that the West Virginia [plan] was \ninadequate somehow became national,\u201d reasoning that \nEPA\u2019s consolidated notice merely \u201cthrows a blanket la-\nbeled \u2018national\u2019 over 21 individual decisions rejecting 21 \n \n9514 (10th Cir.); Utah v. EPA, No. 23-9509 (10th Cir.); Alabama v. \nEPA, No. 23-11173 (11th Cir.).  \n\n \n \n \n \n10\nseparate States\u2019 [plans] in an effort to convert each unique \nstate decision into a national one.\u201d Id. at 330.  \n\u201cThe Clean Air Act,\u201d the Fourth Circuit explained, \n\u201cinstructs that \u2018[e]ach State\u2019 shall submit a [state plan] im-\nplementing the air quality standards\u201d and \u201cfollowing each \nState\u2019s submission, the EPA approves or disapproves of \neach State\u2019s \u2018plan\u2019\u2014using the word \u2018plan\u2019 in the singular \nto indicate that the agency acts on each plan.\u201d Id. (quoting \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1), (k)(1)-(3)). \u201cThus, the relevant \nagency action for our review here is the EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval of West Virginia\u2019s [state plan].\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s action \non West Virginia\u2019s plan was also not \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect\u201d because in \u201crejecting \nWest Virginia\u2019s [plan], it is clear that the EPA focused on \nfactual data localized to West Virginia and two downwind \nStates \u2018linked\u2019 to West Virginia\u201d and \u201crejected West Vir-\nginia\u2019s analysis of those factual circumstances.\u201d Id. at 328. \nThat EPA applied a \u201cnationally consistent approach\u201d to \nall state plans does not transform its action into a national \nregulation, otherwise \u201cthere never could be a local or re-\ngional action \u2026 because every action of the EPA purport-\nedly applies a national standard created by the national \nstatute and its national regulations.\u201d Id. at 329-30. Judge \nQuattlebaum joined Judge Niemeyer\u2019s opinion, but Judge \nThacker dissented, stating that, in her view, \u201cthe Final \nRule is clearly nationally applicable.\u201d Id. at 332. \nThe Fifth Circuit, like the Fourth, held that it was the \nproper venue for the challenges filed by Texas, Louisiana, \nand Mississippi to their respective plan disapprovals. \nTexas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840, at *3-6 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Here again, the court of appeals \n\n \n \n \n \n11\nfocused on the text of the Clean Air Act: the Act \u201cmakes \nclear that the EPA\u2019s relevant actions for purposes of the \npresent litigation are its various [state plan] denials.\u201d Id. \nat *4. So while \u201cthe EPA packaged these disapprovals to-\ngether with the disapprovals of eighteen other States \u2026 , \nthe EPA\u2019s chosen method of publishing an action isn\u2019t con-\ntrolling.\u201d Id. \u201cWhat controls is the [Act]\u201d and the Act \u201cis \nvery clear: The relevant unit of administrative action here \nis the EPA\u2019s individual SIP denials\u201d and, in fact, \u201cthe EPA \nseparately considered and disapproved Texas\u2019s [plan], \nLouisiana\u2019s [plan], and Mississippi\u2019s [plan].\u201d Id.  \nHaving determined the relevant EPA action at issue, \nthe Fifth Circuit had no trouble concluding venue was ap-\npropriate in that regional circuit, not the D.C. Circuit. \n\u201c[T]he \u2018legal impact\u2019 of the three [state plan] disapprovals \nis plainly local or regional\u201d given that they \u201cinvolve only \nthe regulation of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi emis-\nsion sources and have legal consequences only for Texas, \nLouisiana, and Mississippi facilities.\u201d Id. at *5. They are \ntherefore not nationally applicable actions where review \nis only appropriate in the D.C. Circuit. Id. Nor are the ac-\ntions challenged in that case, the Fifth Circuit held, \n\u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or effect\u201d \nbecause EPA\u2019s decisions \u201cwere plainly based on a number \nof intensely factual determinations unique to each State.\u201d \nId. (citation and internal marks omitted). Judge Douglas \ndissented from the per curiam opinion because she be-\nlieved EPA\u2019s action was \u201cnationally applicable on its face\u201d \nand \u201cwas based on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope \nor effect.\u2019\u201d Id. at *11. \n\n \n \n \n \n12\nThe Sixth Circuit ruled in accord with the Fourth and \nFifth, holding that transfer of Kentucky\u2019s challenge to its \nstate plan disapproval to the D.C. Circuit was not war-\nranted. Kentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, slip op. at 2-6 (6th \nCir. July 25, 2023). Relying on the Fifth Circuit\u2019s analysis \nof the text of the Act, the Sixth Circuit started by conclud-\ning that the relevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is \u201cEPA\u2019s denial of \nKentucky\u2019s\u201d plan. Id. at 4. The Sixth Circuit next ex-\nplained that \u201cState Implementation Plans, by their very \nnature, concern each State\u2019s plan\u201d and \u201c[b]ecause the de-\nnial and legal impact of Kentucky\u2019s [plan] affects only \nKentucky\u2014that is, it does not concern the nation, let \nalone any other state\u2014the final action is \u2018locally or region-\nally applicable.\u2019\u201d Id. at 5. And the court rejected EPA\u2019s \nclaim that its determination was one based on nationwide \nscope or effect because \u201cEPA\u2019s disapproval here was \nbased on a number of intensely factual determinations \nunique to Kentucky.\u201d Id. at 5-6 (citation and internal \nmarks omitted). Judge Cole dissented from the decision \nof Judges McKeague and Nalbandian because he believed \nEPA\u2019s act was \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d without opining on whether it was also \n\u201cnationally applicable.\u201d Id. at 10-21. \nThe Eighth Circuit, in separate orders unaccompanied \nby an opinion and without dissent, also denied EPA\u2019s mo-\ntion to transfer challenges to Arkansas\u2019s, Missouri\u2019s, and \nMinnesota\u2019s state plan disapprovals. Order, Arkansas v. \nEPA, No. 23-1320, Dkt. No. 5269098 (8th Cir. April 25, \n2023); Order, Missouri v. EPA, No. 23-1719, Dkt. No. \n5281126 (8th Cir. May 26, 2023); Order, Allete, Inc. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1776, Dkt. No. 5281229 (8th Cir. May 26, \n\n \n \n \n \n13\n2023). Meanwhile, motions panels in the Ninth, Tenth, and \nEleventh Circuits deferred decision on EPA\u2019s motions to \ntransfer to a later merits panel in challenges to the state \nplan disapprovals of Nevada, Oklahoma, Utah, and Ala-\nbama. Order, Nevada Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682, \nDkt. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023); Order, Utah v. EPA, \nNo. 23-9509, Dkt. No. 10994985 (10th Cir. April 27, 2023); \nOrder, Alabama v. EPA, No. 23-11173, Dkt. No. 24 (11th \nCir. July 12, 2023). \nC. Decision Below \nSplitting with its sister circuits, the Tenth Circuit mer-\nits panel published an opinion ruling that EPA\u2019s disap-\nprovals of the Utah and Oklahoma state plans were \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and ordered the cases transferred to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Pet. App. 12a-19a. The court below jus-\ntified this conclusion by stating \u201cPetitioners seek review \nof a final rule disapproving [state plans] from 21 states \nacross the country\u2014spanning eight EPA regions and ten \nfederal judicial circuits\u2014because those states all failed to \ncomply with the good-neighbor provision.\u201d Pet. App. 12a. \n\u201cAnd,\u201d the Tenth Circuit continued, \u201cin promulgating that \nrule, the EPA applied a uniform statutory interpretation \nand common analytical methods, which required the \nagency to examine the overlapping and interwoven link-\nages between upwind and downwind states in a consistent \nmanner.\u201d Pet. App. 12a-13a. \nIn so ruling, the Tenth Circuit \u201crecognize[d] that the \nFourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits recently reached the \ncontrary conclusion: each denied the EPA\u2019s motions to \ntransfer petitions challenging the same final rule at issue \n\n \n \n \n \n14\nhere\u201d\u2014 also acknowledging in a footnote that the Eighth \nCircuit also reached the contrary conclusion. Pet. App. \n17a. The court below believed that \u201call three courts \nstrayed\u201d from the statute\u2019s text and, \u201cbecause the Fourth, \nFifth, and Sixth Circuit decisions denying the EPA\u2019s \ntransfer motions all depart from [the Act\u2019s] plain text and \nour binding precedent, we decline to follow them.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 19a.  \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nThis Court should grant review of the decision below \nbecause it directly conflicts with the rulings of the Fourth, \nFifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits on an important and re-\ncurring federal question about the appropriate venue for \nchallenges to EPA actions under the Clean Air Act. The \ndisagreement among the courts of appeals presented by \nthis case is exceptionally clear; it was explicitly acknowl-\nedged by the court below. Moreover, the issue of venue \nfor Clean Air Act challenges is of immense importance to \nstates, the federal government, industry, and the public, \nand will continue to arise frequently in cases that extend \nwell beyond the Good Neighbor Provision. The Court \nshould decide this question now, before seven courts of \nappeals are required to reach merits decisions in this and \nrelated cases concerning the plans of a dozen (or more) \nstates without knowing the Court\u2019s judgment on the ap-\npropriate venue for these cases. \n\n \n \n \n \n15\nI. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision below explicitly \nconflicts with the decisions of several other courts \nof appeal. \nCertiorari is warranted because, in the ruling below, \nthe Tenth Circuit entered a decision in conflict with four \nother federal courts of appeals on an important issue. The \nTenth Circuit\u2019s ruling squarely splits with both the result \nand reasoning of decisions by the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and \nEighth Circuits.  \nStart with the result of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision. \nThe court below ruled that EPA\u2019s disapprovals of Okla-\nhoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s plans, which were published in the \nsame Federal Register notice as 19 other states\u2019 disap-\nprovals, could be reviewed only in the D.C. Circuit. Pet. \nApp. 19a. Meanwhile, the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth \nCircuits\u2014which are reviewing the disapprovals of other \nstates\u2019 plans contained in the same Federal Register no-\ntice\u2014have denied EPA\u2019s motion to transfer those cases to \nthe D.C. Circuit. Neither the court below nor EPA have \nsuggested that, for purposes of venue, anything distin-\nguishes the disapprovals of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s plans \nfrom the disapprovals of the other states\u2019 ozone Good \nNeighbor plans being reviewed in the regional circuits. \nThe conflict among courts of appeals is as clean as can be. \nThe reasoning of the court below also openly splits \nwith reasoning embraced by the other circuits. The courts \nof appeals are divided in their rationales in at least two \nrespects. \nFirst, the Tenth Circuit believed \u201cthe nature of the \nagency\u2019s final action\u201d being challenged was \u201ca final rule \n\n \n \n \n \n16\ndisapproving [state plans] from 21 states across the coun-\ntry\u2014spanning eight EPA regions and ten federal judicial \ncircuits.\u201d Pet. App. 12a-13a. In contrast, the Fourth Cir-\ncuit held \u201cthe relevant agency action for our review here \nis the EPA\u2019s disapproval of West Virginia\u2019s [implementa-\ntion plan].\u201d West Virginia, 90 F.4th at 330. The Fourth \nCircuit rejected EPA\u2019s attempt, adopted by the Tenth \nCircuit, to \u201cthrow[] a blanket labeled \u2018national\u2019 over 21 in-\ndividual decisions rejecting 21 separate States\u2019 [plans] in \nan effort to convert each unique state decision into a na-\ntional one.\u201d Id. So, \u201cthe fact that the EPA consolidated its \ndisapprovals in a single final rule does not, by that fact \nalone, make its 21 separate decisions included within its \nfinal rule \u2026 a single nationally applicable action.\u201d Id.  \nThe Fifth Circuit similarly considered the issue of \nwhat \u201cthe relevant \u2018action\u2019 is for purposes of \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u201d \nand ruled \u201cthe [Clean Air Act] makes clear that the EPA\u2019s \nrelevant actions for purposes of the present litigation are \nits various [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL 7204840, \nat *3. The Fifth Circuit acknowledged that, \u201c[y]es, the \nEPA packaged these disapprovals together with the dis-\napprovals of eighteen other States,\u201d but the court held \nthat \u201cthe EPA\u2019s chosen method of publishing an action \nisn\u2019t controlling.\u201d Id. at *4. \u201cWhat controls is the [Act]\u201d \nand \u201cthe [Act] is very clear: The relevant unit of adminis-\ntrative action here is the EPA\u2019s individual [state plan] de-\nnials.\u201d Id. The Sixth Circuit adopted the reasoning of the \nFifth Circuit in reaching the same conclusion. Kentucky, \nsupra, slip op. at 3-4. \nThis dispute arises because the Tenth Circuit inter-\nprets the text of the Clean Air Act differently than the \n\n \n \n \n \n17\nother courts of appeals. The Tenth Circuit believed that \nthe Federal Register notice containing the disapprovals of \n21 state plans was the relevant unit of analysis because \nthe Act\u2019s judicial review provision speaks of a \u201cfinal ac-\ntion.\u201d Pet. App. 13a (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)). The \ncourt then chided the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth\u2019s Circuits \nfrom having \u201cstrayed\u201d and \u201cdepart[ed] from \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nplain text.\u201d Pet. App. 17a, 19a.  \nBut for those other courts, the Tenth Circuit\u2019s invoca-\ntion of the words \u201cfinal action\u201d merely begs the question; \n\u201c[t]he relevant unit of administrative action\u201d still must be \ndetermined. Texas, 2023 WL 7204840, at *4. That deter-\nmination is governed by statute, namely, the provisions \nproviding \u201cthe legal source of the agency\u2019s (here the \nEPA\u2019s) authority to take the challenged actions (here the \n[state plan] denials).\u201d Id.; contra Pet. App. 16a n.6 \n(\u201cWhether an EPA action is nationally applicable does not \nturn on the \u2018type\u2019 of statutory authority delegated to the \nagency.\u201d). With respect to state implementation plans, the \nFifth Circuit wrote, the statute speaks in terms of state \nand EPA action for \u201ceach State\u201d and \u201cthe State.\u201d Texas, \n2023 WL 7204840, at *4 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a), \n(k)(3)). And because EPA\u2019s action on a single state\u2019s plan \nis indisputably local or regional, not national, venue is ap-\npropriate in the regional circuit. Id. The Fourth and Sixth \nCircuits concurred in a similar textual analysis as the \nFifth. West Virginia, 90 F.4th at 330 (\u201c[T]he relevant \nagency action for our review here is the EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval of West Virginia\u2019s [state plan].\u201d); Kentucky, supra, \nslip op. at 3-4 (explaining that the important question is \n\u201cdetermining what \u2018final action\u2019 we are dealing with\u201d and \n\n \n \n \n \n18\nconcluding that the answer is \u201cEPA\u2019s disapproval of each \nstate\u2019s [implementation plan]\u201d).  \nSecond, the Tenth Circuit held that EPA\u2019s disapprov-\nals were \u201cnationally applicable\u201d because \u201cEPA applied a \nuniform statutory interpretation and common analytical \nmethods, which required the agency to examine the over-\nlapping and interwoven linkages between upwind and \ndownwind states in a consistent manner.\u201d Pet. App. 12a-\n13a. The Fourth Circuit rejected precisely that reasoning: \n\u201cWhile national standards \u2014 imposed by the statute, reg-\nulations, and practices \u2014 were indeed applied to reject \nWest Virginia\u2019s [state plan], the venue provision of the \nClean Air Act does not focus on whether national stand-\nards were applied.\u201d West Virginia, 90 F.4th at 329. \u201cIf ap-\nplication of a national standard to disapprove a plan were \nthe controlling factor,\u201d the Fourth Circuit explained, \n\u201cthere never could be a local or regional action as recog-\nnized by the Clean Air Act because every action of the \nEPA purportedly applies a national standard created by \nthe national statute and its national regulations.\u201d Id. at \n329-30; see also id. at 328 (explaining that \u201cthe venue issue \n[does not] turn[] on whether a national rule or standard \nwas applied to make the determination\u201d because that \nwould mean \u201cthere could be no local or regional action\u201d). \nInstead, the Fourth Circuit pointed to EPA\u2019s state-spe-\ncific disapproval, where \u201cEPA focused on factual data lo-\ncalized to West Virginia\u201d and EPA\u2019s rejection of \u201cWest \nVirginia\u2019s analysis of those factual circumstances.\u201d Id. at \n328. The Fifth and Sixth Circuits are in accord with the \nFourth\u2019s approach here, too. Texas, 2023 WL 7204840, at \n*5 & n.5; Kentucky, supra, slip op. at 5-6. \n\n \n \n \n \n19\nIn short, the Tenth Circuit has squarely split with the \nFourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits on both what the \nappropriate venue is for these state plan disapproval chal-\nlenges and how that analysis should be conducted. The de-\ncision below openly acknowledges the conflict, \u201crecog-\nniz[ing] that the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits recently \nreached the contrary conclusion.\u201d This irreconcilable con-\nflict among the courts of appeals requires this Court\u2019s res-\nolution.4 \nII. The question of the appropriate venue for \nchallenges under the Clean Air Act is ripe for \nreview, important, and frequently recurring. \nA. Certiorari before judgment is warranted to resolve \nthe split on venue \u201cbecause of the importance of determin-\ning the locus of judicial review of the actions of EPA [un-\nder the Clean Air Act].\u201d Harrison, 446 U.S. at 586 (grant-\ning certiorari review before final judgment); see also Sup. \nCt. R. 11. Waiting until the D.C. Circuit decides the merits \nof this case will not impact the venue question, while delay \nwill only result in needless expenditure of state, federal, \nindustry, and court resources to litigate one or more cases \nin the incorrect venue.   \nThis Court has previously granted certiorari before \njudgment when \u201c[u]ncertainty surrounding the scope of \n \n4 While the Tenth Circuit mentioned the Eighth Circuit\u2019s decision \nonly in passing, Pet. App. 17a n.7, the Eighth Circuit, by denying \nEPA\u2019s motion to change venue, also necessarily disagreed with the \nTenth Circuit\u2019s decision that venue is appropriate only in the D.C. \nCircuit because the challenged agency action is \u201cnationally applica-\nble.\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n20\n[an] Act\u2019s judicial-review provision\u201d has divided courts \nand led to duplicative litigation. Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of Mfrs., 583 \nU.S. at 119. In that case, the Sixth Circuit held it had ju-\nrisdiction to review suits brought under the Clean Water \nAct, but a single district court with a suit before it chal-\nlenging the same rulemaking disagreed. Id. This Court \nresolved the confusion without waiting for the parallel lit-\nigation that had been proceeding across the country to \nreach final judgments. \nHere, the split is not only more pronounced, but the \nneed for immediate review is even greater given the pos-\nture of this case and the numerous courts of appeals with \nstate Good Neighbor plan challenges before them. Peti-\ntioners here have already fully briefed the merits of their \nclaims before the Tenth Circuit. If this Court declines re-\nview, the parties may engage in further briefing in the \nD.C. Circuit, expending the public funds of both state and \nfederal governments. Oral argument and the deci-\nsionmaking process will also consume valuable litigant \nand court resources. If this Court were to ultimately de-\ntermine that the Tenth Circuit should have retained \nvenue, the delay and duplicated effort from merits adjudi-\ncation in the D.C. Circuit would be unnecessary.  \nAnd, of course, if this Court determines that exclusive \nvenue lies in the D.C. Circuit, then the ten challenges cur-\nrently being litigated in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Eighth, \nNinth, and Eleventh Circuits would likewise be for \nnaught. Review now would serve public policy and con-\nserve judicial and party resources, instead of subjecting \nthe states and EPA \u201cto long and complex litigation which \nmay all be for naught if consideration of the preliminary \n\n \n \n \n \n21\nquestion of venue is postponed until the conclusion of the \nproceedings.\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 \nU.S. 555, 558 (1963). \n Nor would further delay \u201chelp[] to explain and formu-\nlate the underlying principles this Court \u2026 must con-\nsider.\u201d Obergefell v. Hodges, 135 S.Ct. 2584, 2597 (2015). \n\u201c[Venue] is a separate and independent matter, anterior \nto the merits and not enmeshed in the factual and legal \nissues comprising the [states\u2019 petitions for review].\u201d Mer-\ncantile Nat\u2019l Bank, 371 U.S. at 558. It is unlikely that the \nD.C. Circuit would reconsider the venue question after \ntransfer. See Christianson v. Colt Indus. Operating \nCorp., 486 U.S. 800, 816 (1988) (\u201c[T]he policies supporting \nthe [law of the case] doctrine apply with even greater \nforce to transfer decisions than to decisions of substantive \nlaw; transferee courts that feel entirely free to revisit \ntransfer decisions of a coordinate court threaten to send \nlitigants into a vicious circle of litigation.\u201d). And five cir-\ncuits have already considered the question presented. \nThis petition therefore presents a clean, well-developed, \nand fulsome split, ready for review.   \nIn short, additional delay would produce no benefits, \nbut it would result in unnecessary delays and tremendous \nwasted effort. This Court should grant review now rather \nthan subject litigants, courts, and the public to those costs.   \nB. The Court should also grant review because venue \nquestions arise frequently in the context of important \nClean Air Act disputes. Such disputes include the cur-\nrent voluminous litigation over state Good Neighbor \nplans, other disputes about state plan approvals and \n\n \n \n \n \n22\ndisapprovals, and still other disputes under the Clean Air \nAct. \nFirst, a determination from this Court on the appro-\npriate venue will provide definitive resolution to venue \nquestions being litigated in multiple circuits. Answering \nthe question presented will not merely resolve the dis-\npute over the proper venue for separate challenges \nbrought by Oklahoma and Utah to EPA\u2019s plan disap-\nproval for each state, it will also resolve disputed ques-\ntions of venue still ongoing in the related Ninth and Elev-\nenth Circuit cases. Nevada Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-\n682, Dkt. No. 27 (9th Cir. July 3, 2023) (referring venue \ndispute to merits panel); Order, Alabama v. EPA, No. \n23-11173, Dkt. No. 24 (11th Cir. July 12, 2023) (same). \nAnd it will confirm (or reject) the decisions to retain \nvenue in the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits.  \nAbsent this Court\u2019s intervention, an irreconcilable le-\ngal incongruity will persist: Oklahoma and Utah will be \nforced to litigate issues relating to their state-specific \nemissions and ozone contributions in the D.C. Circuit, \nwhile other states are litigating their local ozone issues \nin their regional circuits. Given the massive effect of \nEPA cross-state ozone regulation on local economies, \nthese disputes are too important to be litigated amidst \nsuch a legal haze. See Texas, 2023 WL 7204840, at *10 \n(explaining the \u201cbillions of dollars in compliance costs\u201d \nand harms to electric grid reliability imposed by EPA\u2019s \nproposed ozone Good Neighbor rulemakings); West Vir-\nginia, 90 F.4th at 331 (explaining burden on state regu-\nlators and consumers of EPA\u2019s Good Neighbor rule-\nmakings). \n\n \n \n \n \n23\nGranting certiorari would also resolve ongoing dis-\nputes about the venue provision\u2019s savings clause, which \ndirects to the D.C. Circuit review of EPA actions, includ-\ning those locally and regionally applicable, that are \n\u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1). The Tenth Circuit did not \u201cad-\ndress EPA\u2019s alternative argument that the petitions be-\nlong in the D.C. Circuit even if the final action is \u2018locally \nor regionally applicable\u2019 because it \u2018is based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect\u2019 made and pub-\nlished by the EPA.\u201d Pet. App. 19a n.8 (quoting \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1)). But the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits \nall directly rejected that argument. See Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *5 (holding that because the state plan disap-\nprovals were based on \u201cintensely factual determina-\ntions,\u201d they were not based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect); accord West Virginia, 90 F.4th at \n330; Kentucky, No. 23-3216, slip op. at 5-6. Meanwhile, \ndissenting judges in the Fifth and Sixth Circuits disa-\ngreed and would have transferred the cases to the D.C. \nCircuit, arguing that EPA\u2019s actions were based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope and effect. Texas, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *12-13 (Douglas, J., dissenting); Ken-\ntucky, No. 23-3216, slip op. at 12-19 (Cole, J., dissenting). \nReview of the question presented will address this ongo-\ning division, too. \nSecond, a decision from this Court will provide clarity \nin innumerable future challenges to state plan approvals \nor disapprovals under the Clean Air Act, which occur \nwhenever EPA revises ambient air quality standards \nand issues other regulations requiring state plan \n\n \n \n \n \n24\nrevisions. The Clean Air Act requires EPA to promul-\ngate new national ambient air quality standards every \nfive years for a host of different pollutants. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7409(d)(1). Then, every time a new national standard \nfor any given pollutant rolls out, States have no more \nthan three years to revise their state implementation \nplans. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 7410(a)(1), (a)(2)(D). And each state \nhas plans for different provisions of the Clean Air Act\u2014\nthe Good Neighbor Provision is just one of them\u2014each \nof which may generate their own litigation and concomi-\ntant venue disputes. E.g., Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, \n417-24 (5th Cir. 2016) (retaining venue in regional circuit \nin challenge to disapprovals of states\u2019 plans to meet Act\u2019s \n\u201cregional haze\u201d requirements); Am. Rd. & Transp. \nBuilders Ass\u2019n, 705 F.3d at 455-56 (adjudicating venue \nin challenge to approval of state plan for nonroad engines \nand vehicles); New York v. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 989-90 \n(7th Cir. 1998) (retaining venue in regional circuit over \ndispute concerning exemption from cross-state ozone \nstandards spanning states in three different circuits). \nLitigation over approvals and disapprovals of portions of \nstate plans is therefore almost constant. And they fur-\nther multiply every time EPA jumpstarts the process, \neven absent setting a new national standard, by issuing \ncalls for state plan revisions. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410(k)(5); \ne.g., W. Virginia Chamber of Com. v. Browner, 166 F.3d \n336 (4th Cir. 1998) (adjudicating venue dispute over call \nfor cross-state ozone plan revisions). \nLitigation over state plans addressing the Good \nNeighbor Provision is a prime example of how implemen-\ntation plan disputes are only increasing in scope and \n\n \n \n \n \n25\nfrequency. EPA\u2019s first Good Neighbor rule\u2014the 1998 \nNOx SIP Call\u2014was limited to Eastern states. 63 Fed. \nReg. 57,356, 57,386 (Oct. 27, 1998); see also 80 Fed. Reg. \n75,706, 75,715 (Dec. 3, 2015). EPA extended the program \nto additional states in the 2011 Transport Rule. See EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 499-500. Currently under the 2015 \nozone NAAQS, the Good Neighbor Provision now has po-\ntential implications as far west as Utah, Nevada, and Cal-\nifornia. 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,355, 9,358, 9,360. As EPA\u2019s reg-\nulatory approach has become more aggressive, vigorous \nlitigation of EPA\u2019s individual state plan actions has in-\ncreased. Without clear rules from this Court, venue dis-\nputes in challenges to EPA actions related to the Good \nNeighbor Provision will continue to recur, creating on-\ngoing uncertainty for litigants. \nThird, a decision by this Court will help resolve re-\ncurring venue disputes under a variety of other Clean Air \nAct provisions. For example, in cases involving attain-\nment designations under Section 107 of the Act, courts \noften disregard the substance of the EPA action at issue \nand simply rely on the number of states receiving desig-\nnations, with those attainment designations involving \nmore states being sent to the D.C. Circuit and those with \nfewer states remaining in the local circuits. See, e.g., S. \nIll. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, 668 (7th Cir. 2017) \n(24 states transferred to D.C.); W. Oil & Gas Ass\u2019n v. \nEPA, 633 F.2d 803, 806-07 (9th Cir. 1980) (one state re-\ntained in the local circuit); Texas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, \n832-35 (5th Cir. 2020) (same); Texas v. EPA, 706 F. App\u2019x \n159 (5th Cir. 2017) (same).  \n\n \n \n \n \n26\nCourts have also addressed venue issues over such \ndisparate topics as special provisions granting California \na Clean Air Act preemption waiver that may be adopted \nby states nationwide, to permitting decisions under Title \nV of the Act that advanced a novel interpretation of the \nAct, to allocation of pollution entitlements in the Act\u2019s \nacid rain program. See, e.g., Dalton Trucking, Inc. v. \nEPA, 808 F.3d 875, 877-78 (D.C. Cir. 2015); Sierra Club \nv. EPA, 926 F.3d 844, 846 (D.C. Cir. 2019); Chevron \nU.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 381-82 (D.C. Cir. 2022); \nTexas Mun. Power Agency v. EPA, 89 F.3d 858, 865-67 \n(D.C. Cir. 1996). Similarly, in recent decisions related to \nrefinery-specific waiver determinations under the Re-\nnewable Fuel Standards program, a split has developed \nas to whether such decisions should be heard in the local \ncircuits or in the D.C. Circuit. See Calumet Shreveport \nRef., L.L.C. v. EPA, 86 F.4th 1121, 1130-31 (5th Cir. \n2023) (holding that the Fifth Circuit was the appropriate \nvenue because each waiver decision was based on the \nunique facts and circumstances presented by each indi-\nvidual small refinery); Hunt Ref. Co. v. EPA, 90 F.4th \n1107, 1110-12 (11th Cir. 2024) (holding the D.C. Circuit \nwas the appropriate venue because EPA issued a single \nnotice for all affected small refineries and applied a com-\nmon decision-making method).  \nFinally, ensuring that the appropriate disputes re-\nmain in the regional circuits, consistent with the will of \nCongress expressed in the statutory text, is particularly \nimportant to the states. While the Act requires \u201c[n]ation-\nally applicable actions go to the D.C. Circuit\u201d to \u201cpro-\nmote[] national uniformity,\u201d it also mandated \u201clocally or \n\n \n \n \n \n27\nregionally applicable actions \u2026 go to the regional cir-\ncuits, which promotes responsiveness and attention to lo-\ncal and regional diversity.\u201d Texas, 983 F.3d at 835. Okla-\nhoma and Utah should, consistent with the Act, be af-\nforded the opportunity to litigate the specific issues re-\nlating to their emissions, and the downwind effects on \ntheir bordering neighbors, in courts intimately familiar \nwith their regional issues, economies, and geographies. \nThe regional circuit, moreover, will likely be able to re-\nsolve issues regarding a few states more expeditiously \nthan the D.C. Circuit would if all states were lumped into \na consolidation of numerous cases before that distant fo-\nrum. Such consolidation also often prejudices the ability \nof states to bring their unique issues to the fore. Those \nunfortunate results will only metastasize across many \naspects of Clean Air Act litigation if EPA is able to re-\npeat its procedural ploy, now endorsed by the Tenth Cir-\ncuit, of packaging together many disparate local actions \ninto a single Federal Register notice. Particularly given \nthe frequency of Clean Air Act disputes in a variety of \ncontexts, this Court\u2019s definitive interpretation of the \nAct\u2019s venue provision will advance important jurispru-\ndential interests.    \nC. This Court\u2019s review is also warranted because the \nconfusion over the proper application of 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) unnecessarily wastes judicial and party re-\nsources in the present cases and in future ones among the \npanoply of Clean Air Act disputes. \n \u201c[L]itigation over whether the case is in the right \ncourt is essentially a waste of time and resources.\u201d Na-\nvarro Sav. Ass\u2019n v. Lee, 446 U.S. 458, 464 n.13 (1980) \n\n \n \n \n \n28\n(internal quotation marks and citation omitted). Uncer-\ntainty on that question produces \u201cappeals and reversals, \nencourage[s] gamesmanship, and, again, diminish[es] the \nlikelihood that results and settlements will reflect a \nclaim\u2019s legal and factual merits.\u201d Hertz Corp., 559 U.S. at \n94. \nThe persistent conflict over the circuit in which a \nClean Air Act challenge belongs produces all those harms. \nCourts of appeals often defer disputed venue questions to \nthe merits panel, as the Tenth Circuit did here and the \nNinth and Eleventh Circuits did in challenges brought by \nother states over their Good Neighbor plans. Supra 12. \nLitigants therefore sometimes invest significant time and \nresources into briefing a case, only for the court to trans-\nfer the case to another circuit. Indeed, here, the transfer \ndecision came after the parties completely briefed the \nmerits and a month before oral argument. A decision by \nthis Court will promote judicial efficiency and streamline \nlitigation over EPA final actions. \nThe uncertainty surrounding \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s proper ap-\nplication has also incentivized petitioners to file protective \npetitions for review in multiple circuits. See Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n of \nMfrs., 583 U.S. at 119 (\u201cUncertainty surrounding the \nscope of the Act\u2019s judicial-review provision \u2026 prompted \nmany parties \u2026 to file \u2018protective\u2019 petitions for review in \nvarious Courts of Appeals to preserve their challenges\u201d). \nPetitioners challenging EPA actions related to state plans \nregularly file duplicative judicial review petitions in both \nthe regional circuit and the D.C. Circuit to preserve ap-\npeal rights in case they chose venue incorrectly and their \n\n \n \n \n \n29\n\u201cprimary\u201d petition gets dismissed rather than trans-\nferred.5  \nIn some cases, \u201cprimary\u201d petitions for review of the \nsame EPA action are filed by different parties in multiple \ncircuits. See Texas, 983 F.3d at 823 (Texas filed petition in \nFifth Circuit while the Sierra Club filed a petition in the \nD.C. Circuit). These repetitive petitions require party re-\nsources to prepare and impose unnecessary administra-\ntive burdens on courts.  \nIndeed, in this case, EPA has made this duplication of \nefforts even worse. Oklahoma and Utah filed protective \npetitions in the D.C. Circuit after EPA moved to transfer \nor dismiss their Tenth Circuit petitions. EPA then at-\ntempted to exploit the uncertainty by asking the D.C. Cir-\ncuit to adjudicate the venue issue already before the \nTenth Circuit so as to preempt the regional circuit\u2019s adju-\ndication. Utah v. EPA, Nos. 23-1102 et al., EPA Mot. to \nConfirm Venue and to Expedite, Dkt. No. 1999261 (D.C. \nCir. May 15, 2023). Thankfully, the D.C. Circuit rejected \nthat gambit, but not after yet more expenditure of party \nand court resources briefing the issue. Id., Petitioners\u2019 \nReply in Support of Abeyance, Dkt. No. 2001718 (D.C. \n \n5 See, e.g., Sierra Club, 926 F.3d at 846 (dismissing case for improper \nvenue rather than transferring to already open Tenth Circuit \ndocket); see also id. at 847 (protective petition filed in the Tenth Cir-\ncuit); Dalton Trucking, Inc., 808 F.3d at 877 (protective petition \nfiled in D.C.

Cir. \nJune 27, 2023). \n\u201c[A]dministrative simplicity is a major virtue\u201d in ap-\nplying a venue statute. Hertz Corp., 559 U.S. at 94. This \nCourt should grant review to provide it. \nIII. The Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision is wrong.  \nReview should also be granted to correct the errant \ndecision below. At bottom, the Tenth Circuit\u2019s decision \ngrants EPA the power to \u201ctransform\u201d the \u201cproper forum \nfor judicial review\u201d by packaging multiple \u201cregionally ap-\nplicable\u201d actions into a single Federal Register notice, and \ntherefore making it a \u201cnationally applicable action.\u201d Pet. \nApp. 13a. That holding badly misinterprets the Clean Air \nAct, and it adopts a view of venue that improperly elevates \nthe form of an EPA action over its substance.  \n A. To start, the Clean Air Act\u2019s venue provision \u201cspe-\ncifically enumerate[s]\u201d a list of EPA actions that are per \nse reviewable in the appropriate regional circuit. Harri-\nson, 446 U.S. at 584. In that list are challenges to EPA \n\u201caction in approving or promulgating any implementation \nplan under section 7410,\u201d such as plans implementing the \nGood Neighbor Provision of the Clean Air Act. 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1). Thus, \u201cthe statutory text places review of \n[state implementation plan] approvals or disapprovals in \nthe regional circuits.\u201d Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 \nn.16 (5th Cir. 2016). Not surprisingly, lower courts have \nrepeatedly described action on whether to approve a state \nimplementation plan as the \u201cprototypical \u2018locally or re-\ngionally applicable\u2019 action that may be challenged only in \nthe appropriate regional court of appeals.\u201d Am. Rd. & \n\n \n \n \n \n31\nTransp. Builders Ass\u2019n, 705 F.3d at 455; Nat\u2019l Parks Con-\nservation Ass\u2019n v. McCarthy, 816 F.3d 989, 993 (8th Cir. \n2016) (same); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 \nF.4th 380, 386 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (describing state imple-\nmentation plan rulemaking as at the far \u201cend of the spec-\ntrum\u201d of locally or regionally applicable actions); ATK \nLaunch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d 1194, 1199 (10th Cir. \n2011) (characterizing a state implementation plan as a \n\u201cpurely local action\u201d and \u201can undisputably regional ac-\ntion\u201d). \nThe Tenth Circuit dismissed this text by emphasizing \nthe catch-all at the end of the list of actions reviewable in \nthe regional circuit: \u201c[T]he statute merely provides,\u201d the \nTenth Circuit said, \u201cthat \u2018[a] petition for review of the \n[EPA]\u2019s action in approving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan \u2026 or any other final action \u2026 (including \nany denial or disapproval \u2026 ) which is locally or region-\nally applicable may be filed only in the \u2026 appropriate [re-\ngional] circuit.\u2019\u201d Pet. App. 11a n.5 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1)) (emphasis in original). According to the \ncourt below, this \u201cdoes not \u2026 say that any such approval, \npromulgation, denial, or disapproval is locally or region-\nally applicable.\u201d Id. But the Tenth Circuit ignores \u201cthe \ngrammatical \u2018rule of the last antecedent,\u2019 according to \nwhich a limiting clause or phrase \u2026 should ordinarily be \nread as modifying only the noun or phrase that it immedi-\nately follows.\u201d Barnhart v. Thomas, 540 U.S. 20, 26 (2003). \nThus, the inclusion of state implementation plan approv-\nals in the enumerated actions means they are categori-\ncally reviewable in the regional circuit regardless of \nwhether they are locally or regionally applicable. At the \n\n \n \n \n \n32\nvery least, this is a strong textual indication that the chal-\nlenges here are presumptively appropriate in the regional \ncircuit. \nIndeed, EPA concedes that challenges to its state im-\nplementation plan approvals belong in the regional cir-\ncuits. When EPA approved the interstate transport plans \nfor the 2015 ozone standard for several other states, it did \nso in a series of Federal Register notices covering individ-\nual states or small groups of states and instructed that \n\u201cpetitions for judicial review \u2026 must be filed in the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit.\u201d6  \nEPA nonetheless argues, and the Tenth Circuit \nagreed, that exclusive venue for challenges to the state \nGood Neighbor plan disapprovals lies in the D.C. Circuit \nbecause of EPA\u2019s calculated decision to announce 21 state \nplan disapprovals in a single Federal Register notice, \nclaiming the consolidated notice is therefore a \u201cnationally \napplicable\u201d action. The only distinction between EPA\u2019s \napproval of state plans and disapproval of state plans was \nthe form of the notice\u2014specifically, the number of states \nthat EPA included in a single Federal Register notice\u2014\nand to EPA, that makes all the difference.  \nBut the statute does not hinge the entire question of \nvenue on such manipulable formalities. A Federal Regis-\nter notice does not, by itself, constitute a \u201cfinal action.\u201d It \n \n6 See e.g. 86 Fed. Reg. 73,129 (Dec. 27, 2021) (Hawaii); 85 Fed. Reg. \n20,165 (Oct. 11, 2020) (Colorado and North Dakota); 86 Fed. Reg. \n68,413 (Dec. 2, 2021) (Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, and South \nCarolina); see also, e.g., Comm. for a Better Arvin v. EPA, 786 F.3d \n1169, 1174 (9th Cir. 2015) (reviewing challenge to approval of Cali-\nfornia\u2019s implementation plan). \n\n \n \n \n \n33\nis no more than a vehicle to communicate agency action. \nSee Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 706 F.3d 428, 432 (D.C. \nCir. 2013). Rather, as the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits \nexplained, how EPA packaged its state plan decisions \ndoes not determine the relevant \u201caction\u201d\u2014disapproval of \na single state\u2019s plan or 21 states\u2019 plans\u2014being challenged. \nSupra 15-16.  That determination instead stems from the \nsource of EPA\u2019s authority to take the action, which here \nis EPA\u2019s authority to approve or disapprove the plan of a \nsingle state under 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7410. Supra 16-17. Such sin-\ngle-state actions are categorically not \u201cnationally applica-\nble.\u201d \nB. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits also demon-\nstrated the Tenth Circuit\u2019s error in concluding that Okla-\nhoma and Utah\u2019s plan disapprovals were nationally appli-\ncable because EPA applied the same analytic framework \nin evaluating all state plans. That cannot be correct, the \nFourth Circuit explained, because it would make virtually \nevery EPA action national since EPA is always purport-\ning to apply some consistent standard to administer its \nportion of a national statute. Supra 17-18. After all, if EPA \napplied different standards to different states, that \n\u201c[u]nexplained inconsistency\u2019\u201d would be \u201carbitrary and \ncapricious.\u201d Encino Motorcars, LLC v. Navarro, 579 U.S. \n211, 222 (2016) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted). Indeed, here, EPA applied the same legal prin-\nciples and methodology to both the state plan approvals \nand the disapprovals. It contended challenges to the for-\nmer belong in the regional circuits. Supra 32 n.6. But that \ncannot be squared with its present argument that \n\n \n \n \n \n34\napplication of a national framework for the latter man-\ndates review only in the D.C. Circuit.  \nOther aspects of EPA\u2019s state plan disapprovals only \ncorroborate that each disapproval is a separate final ac-\ntion for purposes of the Act\u2019s venue provision. In its Fed-\neral Register notice, EPA offered only \u201ca brief, high level \noverview of the [state plan] submissions and the EPA\u2019s \nevaluation and key bases for disapproval,\u201d while stating \nthat the \u201cfull basis for the EPA\u2019s disapprovals\u201d was to be \nfound in the sundry proposed rulemakings that were \ngrouped and signed by EPA\u2019s regional offices. 88 Fed. \nReg. at 9,354; see supra 6-8. Thus, even EPA believed at \none point the true nature of its state plan disapprovals is \nlocal or regional.  \nAnd even in its final Federal Register notice, EPA cod-\nified Oklahoma\u2019s, Utah\u2019s, and every other state\u2019s plan dis-\napproval in separate sections of the Code of Federal Reg-\nulations. 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,381-84. Normally, \u201c[a]gency \nstatements \u2018having general applicability and legal effect\u2019 \nare to be published in the Code of Federal Regulations,\u201d \nwhile \u201cpreamble statements\u201d are not by default consid-\nered the final agency action that is subject to judicial re-\nview. Nat. Res. Def. Council v. EPA, 559 F.3d 561, 565 \n(D.C. Cir. 2009) (citing 44 U.S.C. \u00a7 1510(a)-(b); \n1 C.F.R. \u00a7 8.1); see also AT&T Corp. v. FCC, 970 F.3d 344, \n350 (D.C. Cir. 2020). Oklahoma challenges the regulation \ndisapproving its state plan that EPA seeks to codify at \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.1922(c), \nwhile \nUtah \nchallenges \n40 C.F.R. \u00a7 52.2354, and neither are challenging regula-\ntions applying to any other state. Those state-specific reg-\nulations are, on their face, not \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d \n\n \n \n \n \n35\nconfirming that the Tenth Circuit erred in concluding that \nvenue lies exclusively in the D.C. Circuit. \n* * * \nThe Tenth Circuit wrongly indulged EPA\u2019s decision to \nconsciously elevate form over substance. Congress di-\nrected that state plan approvals and disapprovals\u2014each \nof which reflect \u201cintensely factual determinations\u201d unique \nto each state\u2014belong in regional circuits. Texas, 829 F.3d \nat 421. Allowing EPA to gerrymander venue by packaging \ntogether a multitude of state plan disapprovals would un-\ndermine Congress\u2019s careful allocation. Whatever EPA\u2019s \nreasons are to attempt so nakedly to manipulate the fo-\nrum for these cases, \u201cvenue provisions in Acts of Congress \nshould not be so freely construed as to give the Govern-\nment the choice of \u2018a tribunal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. \nUnited States, 364 U.S. 631, 634 (1961) (citation omitted).  \nCONCLUSION \nThis Court should grant the petition. \n \nMarch 2024         Respectfully submitted, \n\n \n \n \n \n36\nSean D.

See Fed. R. App. P. 34(a)(2); 10th Cir. R. 34.1(G). The \ncase is therefore ordered submitted without oral argument.\n\nAppendix A\n8a\nIn a February 2023 final rule, the U.S. Environmental \nProtection Agency (EPA) disapproved state implementation \nplans (SIPs) from 21 states across the country because \nthose states all failed to adequately address their \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind states. \nThese seven petitions seek review of that final rule: \nOklahoma and various industry groups challenge the \nEPA\u2019s decision to disapprove Oklahoma\u2019s SIP; Utah and \nother industry groups challenge the disapproval of Utah\u2019s \nSIP. But the EPA has moved to dismiss or transfer the \npetitions to the D.C. Circuit under the Clean Air Act\u2019s \njudicial-review provision, 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1), which \nassigns to the D.C. Circuit any petition seeking review of \na \u201cnationally applicable\u201d agency action. And because we \nagree with the EPA that the challenged rule is nationally \napplicable, we grant the EPA\u2019s motions in part, to transfer \nthe petitions to the D.C. Circuit, and thus do not reach \nthe merits.\nBackground\nThe Clean Air Act establishes \u201ca cooperative-\nfederalism approach to regulate air quality.\u201d U.S. \nMagnesium, LLC v. EPA, 690 F.3d 1157, 1159 (10th Cir. \n2012). The Act directs the EPA to establish and periodically \nrevise National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), \nwhich represent \u201cthe maximum airborne concentration[s] \nof [certain air] pollutant[s] that the public health can \ntolerate.\u201d West Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707, 142 S. \nCt. 2587, 213 L. Ed. 2d 896 (2022) (quoting Whitman v. \nAm. Trucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 465, 121 S. Ct. 903, 149 \nL. Ed. 2d 1 (2001)). After the EPA revises or sets a new air-\n\nAppendix A\n9a\nquality standard, the agency must designate geographic \nregions around the country as areas of \u201cattainment\u201d or \n\u201cnonattainment\u201d (or label them \u201cunclassifiable\u201d). 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u202f7407(d)(1); see also EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, \nL.P., 572 U.S. 489, 498, 134 S. Ct. 1584, 188 L. Ed. 2d \n775 (2014). The burden then shifts to the states to each \nadopt and submit for the EPA\u2019s approval a SIP that will \nimplement, maintain, and enforce the NAAQS within its \nboundaries. See 42 U.S.C. \u00a7\u202f7410(a)(1); EME Homer City, \n572 U.S. at 498. But because air pollutants travel with the \nwind, \u201cheedless of state boundaries,\u201d emissions in upwind \nstates can threaten a downwind state\u2019s ability to attain and \nmaintain the NAAQS. EME Homer City, 572 U.S. at 496. \nTo tackle this complex interstate pollution problem, the \nAct includes a good-neighbor provision requiring each SIP \nto prohibit emissions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to \nnonattainment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d in any \nother state. \u00a7\u202f7410(a)(2)(D)(i).\nIn 2015, the EPA tightened the NAAQS for ozone. See \nNational Ambient Air Quality Standards for Ozone, 80 \nFed. Reg. 65292 (Oct. 26, 2015). This revision triggered \neach state\u2019s duty to submit a SIP to implement the 2015 \nozone NAAQS. See \u00a7\u202f7410(a)(1). In February 2023, the \nEPA issued a final rule disapproving SIPs submitted \nby 21 states because those states all failed to meet their \ngood-neighbor obligations. See Air Plan Disapprovals; \nInterstate Transport of Air Pollution for the 2015 \n8-Hour Ozone National Ambient Air Quality Standards, \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023) [hereinafter Air Plan \n\nAppendix A\n10a\nDisapprovals].2 In evaluating these SIPs, the EPA applied \na four-step framework it developed to implement the good-\nneighbor provision. See id. at 9338. Under this framework, \nthe EPA (1) identifies downwind areas expected to have \nproblems attaining or maintaining the relevant NAAQS; \n(2) determines which upwind states contribute to these \nidentified problems in amounts sufficient to link them \nto the downwind air-quality problems; (3) identifies the \nemissions reductions necessary to eliminate each linked \nupwind state\u2019s significant contribution to downwind \nnonattainment through a multifactor analysis; and \n(4) adopts enforceable control measures to achieve those \nreductions. Id. In applying the framework, the EPA also \nconsidered any alternative approach states proposed in \ntheir SIPs \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national consistency.\u201d \nId. at 9338, 9381.\nHere, two such states\u2014Oklahoma and Utah, joined \nby various industry groups\u2014have petitioned for review \nof the final rule, challenging the EPA\u2019s decision to \ndisapprove their SIPs. The EPA responded by moving to \ndismiss or transfer the petitions to the D.C. Circuit under \n\u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1).3 We stayed the Oklahoma and Utah SIP \n2.\u2002 We note that as to two of these 21 states, Minnesota and \nWisconsin, the EPA partially approved and partially disapproved the \nproposed SIPs. See Air Plan Disapprovals, 88 Fed. Reg. at 9336, 9354.\n3.\u2002 Utah and its industry groups suggest in a footnote that the \nEPA\u2019s motion to dismiss their petitions is untimely. In support, \nthey note that under Tenth Circuit Rule 27.3(A)(3)(a), a motion to \ndismiss \u201cshould be filed within 14 days after the notice of appeal is \nfiled, unless good cause is shown.\u201d But we agree with the EPA that \nit has shown good cause for filing its March 16, 2023 motion slightly \n\nAppendix A\n11a\ndisapprovals pending our review and referred the EPA\u2019s \nmotions to the panel assigned to hear these cases on their \nmerits.\nAnalysis\nThe EPA argues that we must dismiss or transfer \nthe petitions to the D.C. Circuit under the Clean Air \nAct\u2019s judicial-review provision, which divides reviewable \nEPA actions into three categories and designates the \nproper forum for each.4 See \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1). It provides that \na petition for review of a \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final \naction \u201cmay be filed only in [the D.C. Circuit].\u201d Id. By \ncontrast, a petition for review of a \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d final action \u201cmay be filed only in the\u202f.\u202f.\u202f. \nappropriate [regional] circuit.\u201d5 Id. But if that \u201clocally or \nmore than 14 days after Utah and its industry groups petitioned for \nreview on February 13 and 23, 2023: various petitioners have sought \nreview of the same final rule in regional circuit courts across the \ncountry, and the \u201cEPA has acted as expeditiously as practicable in \nmoving to [dismiss or] transfer these cases [to the D.C. Circuit] in a \ncoordinated fashion.\u201d EPA Utah Mot. 2 n.1.\n4.\u2002 We need not decide whether \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1) is a jurisdictional \nor venue provision. See ATK Launch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d \n1194, 1196 n.1 (10th Cir. 2011). For our purposes, it is enough that \nthe provision is mandatory and that the EPA invokes it here. See \nEberhart v. United States, 546 U.S. 12, 19, 126 S. Ct. 403, 163 L. \nEd. 2d 14 (2005) (explaining that nonjurisdictional claim-processing \nrules \u201cassure relief to a party properly raising them\u201d).\n5.\u2002 We reject petitioners\u2019 cursory suggestion that \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1), \nby its text, assigns all petitions challenging a SIP disapproval to \nthe regional circuits. The statute merely provides that \u201c[a] petition \n\nAppendix A\n12a\nregionally applicable\u201d action \u201cis based on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect\u201d and if the EPA, in taking \nthat action, \u201cfinds and publishes that such action is based \non such a determination,\u201d then the petition \u201cmay be filed \nonly in the [D.C. Circuit].\u201d Id.\nUnder the statute\u2019s plain text, then, whether a petition \nfor review belongs in the D.C. Circuit turns exclusively \non the nature of the challenged agency action. See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197. We must therefore ask \nwhether the action itself is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \n\u201clocally or regionally applicable.\u201d Id. (quoting \u00a7\u202f7607(b)\n(1)). And in answering that question, we look only to the \nface of the action, not its practical effects or the scope of \nthe petitioner\u2019s challenge. Id.\nOn its face, the final EPA action being challenged here \nis nationally applicable. Petitioners seek review of a final \nrule disapproving SIPs from 21 states across the country\u2014\nspanning eight EPA regions and ten federal judicial \ncircuits\u2014because those states all failed to comply with \nthe good-neighbor provision. See Air Plan Disapprovals, 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9380. And in promulgating that rule, the EPA \napplied a uniform statutory interpretation and common \nanalytical methods, which required the agency to examine \nfor review of the [EPA]\u2019s action in approving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan\u202f.\u202f.\u202f. or any other final action\u202f.\u202f.\u202f. (including any \ndenial or disapproval\u202f.\u202f.\u202f.) which is locally or regionally applicable \nmay be filed only in the\u202f.\u202f.\u202f. appropriate [regional] circuit.\u201d \u00a7\u202f7607(b)\n(1) (emphasis added). It does not, as petitioners assert, say that any \nsuch approval, promulgation, denial, or disapproval is locally or \nregionally applicable.\n\nAppendix A\n13a\nthe overlapping and interwoven linkages between upwind \nand downwind states in a consistent manner. Id. Because \na final action with these features is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nunder \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1), judicial review is proper only in the \nD.C. Circuit. See ATK Launch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197.\nSeeking to avoid this conclusion, petitioners urge \nus to view the 21 SIP disapprovals in the final rule \nas separate, locally or regionally applicable agency \nactions. They maintain that each of their seven petitions \nchallenges just one such action: either the Oklahoma SIP \ndisapproval or Utah SIP disapproval. Those final SIP \ndisapprovals, petitioners say, turned on state-specific \nfacts and grew out of several proposed rules signed by \nregional administrators. And in petitioners\u2019 view, the EPA \ncannot transform a locally or regionally applicable SIP \ndisapproval into a nationally applicable action by deciding \nto \u201cpackag[e] it together with 20 other SIP disapprovals\u201d \nin a single final rule. Utah Resp. 13.\nBut petitioners\u2019 arguments collide with \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nplain text, which directs courts to consider only the face \nof the \u201cfinal action,\u201d establishing an action-focused method \nfor determining the proper forum for judicial review. It is \nsimply not material to the analysis that the EPA issued \nseveral proposed rules or that it could have chosen to \nissue standalone final SIP disapprovals. What matters is \nthe nature of the agency\u2019s final action. See ATK Launch \nSys., 651 F.3d at 1197. And here, that action is a nationally \napplicable final rule, signed by the EPA administrator, \ndisapproving SIPs from 21 states across the country\u2014not \njust one\u2014because those states failed to meet their good-\nneighbor obligations.\n\nAppendix A\n14a\nNor is it material that petitioners each purport to \nchallenge only one such SIP disapproval. By its terms, \n\u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1) \u201cassigns to the D.C. Circuit all challenges \nto \u2018nationally applicable [final actions],\u2019 not, for instance, \nall national challenges or all challenges that will have a \nnational effect.\u201d Id. (quoting \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1)). Thus, we have \nmade clear that \u201cthe manner in which a petitioner frames \n[their] challenge\u201d does not \u201calter the court in which the \n[petition] belongs\u201d; \u201c[t]he nature of the [agency action], \nnot the challenge, controls.\u201d Id. And we are not alone in \nmaking this unremarkable observation. See, e.g., Hunt \nRefin. Co. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. 2024) \n(\u201cWhen deciding whether a final action is \u2018nationally \napplicable,\u2019 we begin by \u2018analyzing the nature of the EPA\u2019s \naction, not the specifics of the petitioner\u2019s grievance.\u201d \n(quoting RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1372 \n(11th Cir. 2023))); S. Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, \n670 (7th Cir. 2017) (\u201cUnder the straightforward (if wordy) \nstatutory text [of \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1)], venue depends entirely \non\u2014and is fixed by\u2014the nature of the agency\u2019s action; \nthe scope of the petitioner\u2019s challenge has no role to play \nin determining venue.\u201d); Sierra Club v. EPA, 926 F.3d \n844, 849, 441 U.S. App. D.C. 376 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (\u201cThe \ncourt need look only to the face of the agency action, not \nits practical effects, to determine whether an action is \nnationally applicable.\u201d).\nWe applied this action-focused approach in ATK \nLaunch Systems. There, the petitioners sought review \nof a final EPA rule listing attainment and nonattainment \ndesignations for the NAAQS for fine particulate matter. \n651 F.3d at 1195. Although the petitions challenged the \n\nAppendix A\n15a\nnonattainment designations of only two counties in Utah, \nthe rule \u201cenumerate[d] designations for areas across \nthe country.\u201d Id. at 1195-96. The EPA moved to dismiss \nor transfer the petitions under \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1), arguing \nthat they belonged in the D.C. Circuit because the rule \nwas nationally applicable. Id. at 1196-97. We agreed, \nexplaining the statute \u201cmakes clear that this court must \nanalyze whether the [final action] itself is nationally \napplicable, not whether the effects complained of or \nthe petitioner\u2019s challenge to that [action] is nationally \napplicable.\u201d Id. at 1197. Because the rule there applied \n\u201ca uniform process and standard across the country\u201d \nand \u201creache[d] geographic areas from coast to coast,\u201d \nwe held that it was nationally applicable and therefore \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit. Id. at 1197-\n98, 1200; see also Hunt, 90 F.4th at 1110-11 (holding \nthat two EPA final actions were \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nbecause they denied 105 small-refinery exemptions to \nrefineries across the nation and because EPA applied \n\u201cnew statutory interpretation and analytical framework \nthat is applicable to all small refineries no matter their \nlocation or market\u201d); S. Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 671 \n(holding that similar air-quality designation rule was \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d because it was \u201ca final rule of \nbroad geographic scope\u201d and \u201cpromulgated pursuant to \na common, nationwide analytical method,\u201d even though \npetitioners challenged only EPA\u2019s designation of one \nIllinois county as nonattainment area). Here, too, the \nfinal rule is nationally applicable: it applies a consistent \nstatutory interpretation and uniform analytical methods \n\nAppendix A\n16a\nto disapprove SIPs from 21 states around the country.6 \nSee Air Plan Disapprovals, 88 Fed. Reg. at 9380. So any \nchallenge to that rule belongs in the D.C. Circuit. See \n\u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1).\n6.\u2002 Petitioners attempt to distinguish ATK Launch Systems and \nSouthern Illinois Power Cooperative by focusing on the nature of \nthe statutory authority under which the EPA took the challenged \nactions. They highlight that the Clean Air Act assigns to the EPA \nthe responsibility to make air-quality designations, and the states \nmerely offer recommendations on how to designate areas within their \nboundaries. See \u00a7\u202f7407(d)(1)(A)-(B). By contrast, petitioners note, the \nstatute delegates to the states the responsibility to craft SIPs, and \nthe EPA must approve such a plan if the agency determines that it is \ncomplete and meets all applicable requirements. See \u00a7\u202f7410(a), (k). So \naccording to petitioners, the EPA\u2019s authority \u201cdiffer[s] significantly\u201d \nwhen the agency makes air-quality designations than when it \napproves or disapproves SIPs, with the EPA taking a more back-seat \nrole when reviewing SIPs. Utah Resp. 19. But we discern no material \ndistinction here. Whether an EPA action is nationally applicable does \nnot turn on the \u201ctype\u201d of statutory authority delegated to the agency, \nid. at 22; again, it depends entirely on the nature of the agency\u2019s \naction, ATK Launch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197. Thus, as the EPA points \nout, it is appropriate to challenge in a regional circuit court even a \nfinal action that sets air-quality designations if that action applies \nonly locally or regionally. See, e.g., Texas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 832 \n(5th Cir. 2020) (holding that final rule establishing attainment and \nnonattainment designations for counties in Texas was \u201c\u2018locally or \nregionally applicable\u2019 because it [wa]s directed only at\u202f.\u202f.\u202f. contiguous \nTexas counties\u201d (quoting \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1))). But when a final action \nconcerns states around the country and applies a common analytical \nmethod\u2014as in ATK Launch Systems, Southern Illinois Power \nCooperative, and this case\u2014then the action is nationally applicable.\n\nAppendix A\n17a\nWe recognize that the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits \nrecently reached the contrary conclusion: each denied \nthe EPA\u2019s motions to transfer petitions challenging the \nsame final rule at issue here.7 See Texas v. United States \nEPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 13898, 2023 \nWL 7204840, at *1 (5th Cir. May 1, 2023) (unpublished); \nKentucky v. United States EPA, No. 23-3216, 2023 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 18981 (6th Cir. July 25, 2023); West Virginia \nv. EPA, 90 F.4th 323, 331 (4th Cir. 2024). But in our view, \nall three courts strayed from \u00a7\u202f7607(b)(1)\u2019s text and \ninstead applied a petition-focused approach that we and \nother circuits have rejected. Indeed, the Fifth Circuit \nconceded that its own precedent recognizes \u201c\u00a7\u202f7607(b)\n(1)\u2019s use of \u2018action\u2019 means \u2018the rule or other final action \ntaken by the agency that the petitioner seeks to prevent \nor overturn.\u2019\u201d Texas, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 13898, \n2023 WL 7204840, at *3-4 (quoting Texas v. EPA, 829 \nF.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016)). Nevertheless, rather than \nfocusing its analysis on the face of the rule as is required, \nthe Fifth Circuit focused on the nature of the petitions \nbefore it\u2014which each challenged a single SIP disapproval \ncontained in the final rule\u2014to conclude that \u201cthe relevant \nunit of administrative action\u201d was each individual SIP \ndisapproval and that such disapprovals were \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable.\u201d 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 13898, \n[WL] at *4. The Fourth and Sixth Circuits followed suit. \nSee Kentucky, 2023 U.S. App. LEXIS 18981 (following \nTexas and wrongly characterizing \u201cEPA\u2019s [disapproval] of \nKentucky\u2019s SIP,\u201d not the final rule itself, as the relevant \n7.\u2002 The Eighth Circuit also denied the EPA\u2019s transfer motions, \nbut it simply issued summary orders containing no analysis.

In West \nVirginia, for example, the dissent sharply criticized the \nmajority opinion for \u201cjettison[ing the well-established] \nanalysis altogether and instead look[ing] to the nature of \nWest Virginia\u2019s challenge to hold that the [f]inal [r]ule is \nlocally applicable.\u201d 90 F.4th at 334 (Thacker, J., dissenting). \nThe dissent further pointed out that the decisions from \nthe Fifth and Sixth Circuits likewise \u201cdepart[ed] from \nall relevant precedent,\u201d including our decision in ATK \nLaunch Systems, \u201cwithout adequate justification or \nexplanation.\u201d Id. at 333-35 ; see also Kentucky, 2023 U.S. \nApp. LEXIS 18981 (Cole, J., dissenting) (relying on ATK \nLaunch Systems and other cases to explain that majority\u2019s \n\u201climiting [of] the \u2018action\u2019 to Kentucky\u2019s state-specific \nchallenge is inappropriate\u201d when \u201cthe \u2018scope of the [final \nrule]\u2019 is much broader\u201d (quoting Nat.

The Administrator may \ndisapprove such suspension if he determines that it does \nnot meet the requirements of paragraph (2).\n(4) \t This subsection shall not apply in the case of a \nplan provision or requirement promulgated by the \nAdministrator under subsection (c) of this section, but \nin any such case the President may grant a temporary \nemergency suspension for a four month period of \nany such provision or requirement if he makes the \ndeterminations and findings specified in paragraphs \n(1) and (2).\n(5) \t The Governor may include in any temporary \nemergency suspension issued under this subsection a \nprovision delaying for a period identical to the period of \nsuch suspension any compliance schedule (or increment \nof progress) to which such source is subject under \n\nAppendix B\n38a\nsection 1857c\u201310\u20091 of this title, as in effect before \nAugust 7, 1977, or section 7413(d)\u20091 of this title, upon a \nfinding that such source is unable to comply with such \nschedule (or increment) solely because of the conditions \non the basis of which a suspension was issued under \nthis subsection.\n(g) \t Governor\u2019s authority to issue temporary emergency \nsuspensions\n(1) \t In the case of any State which has adopted and \nsubmitted to the Administrator a proposed plan \nrevision which the State determines\u2014\n(A) \tmeets the requirements of this section, and\n(B) \tis necessary (i) to prevent the closing for one \nyear or more of any source of air pollution, and (ii) \nto prevent substantial increases in unemployment \nwhich would result from such closing, and which the \nAdministrator has not approved or disapproved under \nthis section within 12 months of submission of the \nproposed plan revision, the Governor may issue a \ntemporary emergency suspension of the part of the \napplicable implementation plan for such State which is \nproposed to be revised with respect to such source. \nThe determination under subparagraph (B) may not be \nmade with respect to a source which would close without \nregard to whether or not the proposed plan revision is \napproved.\n(2) \t A temporary emergency suspension issued by a \nGovernor under this subsection shall remain in effect \n\nAppendix B\n39a\nfor a maximum of four months or such lesser period \nas may be specified in a disapproval order of the \nAdministrator. The Administrator may disapprove \nsuch suspension if he determines that it does not meet \nthe requirements of this subsection.\n(3)\t The Governor may include in any temporary \nemergency suspension issued under this subsection \na provision delaying for a period identical to the \nperiod of such suspension any compliance schedule (or \nincrement of progress) to which such source is subject \nunder section 1857c\u201310\u20091 of this title as in effect before \nAugust 7, 1977, or under section 7413(d)\u20091 of this title \nupon a finding that such source is unable to comply \nwith such schedule (or increment) solely because of \nthe conditions on the basis of which a suspension was \nissued under this subsection.\n(h) \t Publication of comprehensive document for each \nState setting forth requirements of applicable \nimplementation plan\n(1) \t Not later than 5 years after November 15, 1990, and \nevery 3 years thereafter, the Administrator shall \nassemble and publish a comprehensive document \nfor each State setting forth all requirements of the \napplicable implementation plan for such State and shall \npublish notice in the Federal Register of the availability \nof such documents.\n(2) \t The Administrator may promulgate such regulations \nas may be reasonably necessary to carry out the \npurpose of this subsection.\n\nAppendix B\n40a\n(i) \t Modification of requirements prohibited\n\t\nExcept for a primary nonferrous smelter order under \nsection 7419 of this title, a suspension under subsection \n(f) or (g) (relating to emergency suspensions), an \nexemption under section 7418 of this title (relating \nto certain Federal facilities), an order under section \n7413(d)\u20091 of this title (relating to compliance orders), a \nplan promulgation under subsection (c), or a plan revision \nunder subsection (a)(3); no order, suspension, plan \nrevision, or other action modifying any requirement \nof an applicable implementation plan may be taken with \nrespect to any stationary source by the State or by the \nAdministrator.\n(j) Technological systems of continuous emission \nreduction on new or modified stationary sources; \ncompliance with performance standards\n\t\nAs a condition for issuance of any permit required \nunder this subchapter, the owner or operator of each \nnew or modified stationary source which is required \nto obtain such a permit must show to the satisfaction \nof the permitting authority that the technological \nsystem of continuous emission reduction which is to be \nused at such source will enable it to comply with the \nstandards of performance which are to apply to such \nsource and that the construction or modification and \noperation of such source will be in compliance with \nall other requirements of this chapter.\n\nAppendix B\n41a\n(k) Environmental Protection Agency action on plan \nsubmissions\n(1) \t Completeness of plan submissions\n(A) \tCompleteness criteria\n\t\nWithin 9 months after November 15, 1990, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate minimum criteria \nthat any plan submission must meet before the \nAdministrator is required to act on such submission \nunder this subsection. The criteria shall be limited to \nthe information necessary to enable the Administrator \nto determine whether the plan submission complies \nwith the provisions of this chapter.\n(B) \tCompleteness finding\n\t\nWithin 60 days of the Administrator\u2019s receipt of a plan \nor plan revision, but no later than 6 months after the \ndate, if any, by which a State is required to submit the \nplan or revision, the Administrator shall determine \nwhether the minimum criteria established pursuant \nto subparagraph (A) have been met. Any plan or plan \nrevision that a State submits to the Administrator, and \nthat has not been determined by the Administrator \n(by the date 6 months after receipt of the submission) \nto have failed to meet the minimum criteria established \npursuant to subparagraph (A), shall on that date be \ndeemed by operation of law to meet such minimum \ncriteria.\n\nAppendix B\n42a\n(C) \tEffect of finding of incompleteness\n\t\nWhere the Administrator determines that a plan \nsubmission (or part thereof) does not meet the minimum \ncriteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A), \nthe State shall be treated as not having made the \nsubmission (or, in the Administrator\u2019s discretion, part \nthereof).\n(2) \tDeadline for action\n\t\nWithin 12 months of a determination by the \nAdministrator (or a determination deemed by \noperation of law) under paragraph (1) that a State \nhas submitted a plan or plan revision (or, in the \nAdministrator\u2019s discretion, part thereof) that \nmeets the minimum criteria established pursuant to \nparagraph (1), if applicable (or, if those criteria are \nnot applicable, within 12 months of submission of the \nplan or revision), the Administrator shall act on the \nsubmission in accordance with paragraph (3).\n(3) \t Full and partial approval and disapproval\n\t\nIn the case of any submittal on which the \nAdministrator is required to act under paragraph \n(2), the Administrator shall approve such submittal as \na whole if it meets all of the applicable requirements \nof this chapter. If a portion of the plan revision meets \nall the applicable requirements of this chapter, the \nAdministrator may approve the plan revision in \npart and disapprove the plan revision in part. The \n\nAppendix B\n43a\nplan revision shall not be treated as meeting the \nrequirements of this chapter until the Administrator \napproves the entire plan revision as complying with the \napplicable requirements of this chapter.\n(4) \t Conditional approval\n\t\nThe Administrator may approve a plan revision \nbased on a commitment of the State to adopt specific \nenforceable measures by a date certain, but not later \nthan 1 year after the date of approval of the plan \nrevision. Any such conditional approval shall be \ntreated as a disapproval if the State fails to comply \nwith such commitment.\n(5) \tCalls for plan revisions\n\t\nWhenever the Administrator finds that the applicable \nimplementation plan for any area is substantially \ninadequate to attain or maintain the relevant national \nambient air quality standard, to mitigate adequately \nthe interstate pollutant transport described in \nsection 7506a of this title or section 7511c of this \ntitle, or to otherwise comply with any requirement \nof this chapter, the Administrator shall require the \nState to revise the plan as necessary to correct \nsuch inadequacies. The Administrator shall notify \nthe State of the inadequacies, and may establish \nreasonable deadlines (not to exceed 18 months after \nthe date of such notice) for the submission of such plan \nrevisions. Such findings and notice shall be public. Any \nfinding under this paragraph shall, to the extent the \n\nAppendix B\n44a\nAdministrator deems appropriate, subject the State \nto the requirements of this chapter to which\n\t\nthe State was subject when it developed and \nsubmitted the plan for which such finding was made, \nexcept that the Administrator may adjust any dates \napplicable under such requirements as appropriate \n(except that the Administrator may not adjust any \nattainment date prescribed under part D, unless such \ndate has elapsed).\n(6) \t Corrections\n\t\nWhenever the Administrator determines that the \nAdministrator\u2019s action approving, disapproving, \nor promulgating any plan or plan revision (or part \nthereof), area designation, redesignation, classification, \nor reclassification was in error, the Administrator may \nin the same manner as the approval, disapproval, or \npromulgation revise such action as appropriate without \nrequiring any further submission from the State. Such \ndetermination and the basis thereof shall be provided \nto the State and public.\n(l)\t Plan revisions\n\t\nEach revision to an implementation plan submitted by \na State under this chapter shall be adopted by such \nState after reasonable notice and public hearing. The \nAdministrator shall not approve a revision of a plan \nif the revision would interfere with any applicable \nrequirement concerning attainment and reasonable \nfurther progress (as defined in section 7501 of this \n\nAppendix B\n45a\ntitle), or any other applicable requirement of this \nchapter.\n(m) \t\nSanctions\n\t\nThe Administrator may apply any of the sanctions \nlisted in section 7509(b) of this title at any time (or \nat any time after) the Administrator makes a finding, \ndisapproval, or determination under paragraphs \n(1) through (4), respectively, of section 7509(a) of \nthis title in relation to any plan or plan item (as \nthat term is defined by the Administrator) required \nunder this chapter, with respect to any portion of the \nState the Administrator determines reasonable and \nappropriate, for the purpose of ensuring that the \nrequirements of this chapter relating to such plan or \nplan item are met. The Administrator shall, by rule, \nestablish criteria for exercising his authority under \nthe previous sentence with respect to any deficiency \nreferred to in section 7509(a) of this title to ensure \nthat, during the 24-month period following the finding, \ndisapproval, or determination referred to in section \n7509(a) of this title, such sanctions are not applied \non a statewide basis where one or more political \nsubdivisions covered by the applicable implementation \nplan are principally responsible for such deficiency.\n(n) \tSavings clauses\n(1) \t Existing plan provisions\n\t\nAny provision of any applicable implementation \nplan that was approved or promulgated by the \n\nAppendix B\n46a\nAdministrator pursuant to this section as in effect \nbefore November 15, 1990, shall remain in effect as \npart of such applicable implementation plan, except to \nthe extent that a revision to such provision is approved \nor promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to this \nchapter.\n(2) \tAttainment dates\n\t\nFor any area not designated nonattainment, any plan \nor plan revision submitted or required to be submitted \nby a State\u2014\n(A) \tin response to the promulgation or revision of a \nnational primary ambient air quality standard in effect \non November 15, 1990, or\n(B)\t in response to a finding of substantial inadequacy \nunder subsection (a)(2) (as in effect immediately before \nNovember 15, 1990), shall provide for attainment of \nthe national primary ambient air quality standards \nwithin 3 years of November 15, 1990, or within 5 years \nof issuance of such finding of substantial inadequacy, \nwhichever is later.\n(3) \t Retention of construction moratorium in certain \nareas\n\t\nIn the case of an area to which, immediately before \nNovember 15, 1990, the prohibition on construction or \nmodification of major stationary sources prescribed \nin subsection (a)(2)(I) (as in effect immediately before \n\nAppendix B\n47a\nNovember 15, 1990) applied by virtue of a finding of \nthe Administrator that the State containing such area \nhad not submitted an implementation plan meeting the \nrequirements of section 7502(b)(6) of this title (relating \nto establishment of a permit program) (as in effect \nimmediately before November 15, 1990) or 7502(a)(1) \nof this title (to the extent such requirements relate \nto provision for attainment of the primary national \nambient air quality standard for sulfur oxides by \nDecember 31, 1982) as in effect immediately before \nNovember 15, 1990, no major stationary source of the \nrelevant air pollutant or pollutants shall be constructed \nor modified in such area until the Administrator \nfinds that the plan for such area meets the applicable \nrequirements of section 7502(c)(5) of this title \n(relating to permit programs) or subpart 5 of part \nD (relating to attainment of the primary national \nambient air quality standard for sulfur dioxide), \nrespectively.\n(o) \tIndian tribes\n\t\nIf an Indian tribe submits an implementation plan to \nthe Administrator pursuant to section 7601(d) of this \ntitle, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the \nprovisions for review set forth in this section for State \nplans, except as otherwise provided by regulation \npromulgated pursuant to section 7601(d)(2) of this \ntitle. When such plan becomes effective in accordance \nwith the regulations promulgated under section \n7601(d) of this title, the plan shall become applicable \nto all areas (except as expressly provided otherwise \nin the plan) located within the exterior boundaries of \n\nAppendix B\n48a\nthe reservation, notwithstanding the issuance of any \npatent and including rights-of-way running through \nthe reservation.\n(p) \tReports\n\t\nAny State shall submit, according to such schedule \nas the Administrator may prescribe, such reports \nas the Administrator may require relating to \nemission reductions, vehicle miles traveled, congestion \nlevels, and any other information the Administrator \nmay deem necessary to assess the development\u2009[2] \neffectiveness, need for revision, or implementation of \nany plan or plan revision required under this chapter.",

Environmental Protection Agency, et al.* (Docket 23-1067). The core legal question is procedural and jurisdictional: whether the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals has exclusive jurisdiction to review an EPA action that affects only one state or region, simply because the EPA bundled that action with others in a single Federal Register notice. The context is the EPA's 2023 disapproval of implementation plans from 21 states related to the 2015 ozone air quality standards. The Tenth Circuit sided with the EPA, transferring the case to the D.C. Circuit, which prompted this appeal to the Supreme Court. I have not yet gathered any specific legal arguments, statutory interpretations (e.g., of the Clean Air Act's judicial review provisions), or relevant precedents that will be used by either side. My current state is one of confirmed understanding of the basic facts and legal question, but with no predictive evidence yet acquired.",

They provide direct information for the task-specific prediction (\u03b8) by revealing arguments and facts. They also provide meta-level information about effective strategies (D) by demonstrating the types of arguments (e.g., textualist, originalist, federalism-based) that litigants believe will be persuasive to the current composition of the Supreme Court.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has advanced significantly. I have moved from a preliminary grasp of the facts to a detailed analysis of the petitioners' legal arguments for Supreme Court review. My knowledge now includes:\n-   **Confirmation of the Core Legal Question:** The \"Question Presented\" in the Petition for Certiorari has clarified the issue: \"Whether a final action by EPA...with respect to a single state or region may be challenged only in the D.C. Circuit because EPA published the action in the same Federal Register notice as actions affecting other states...and claimed to use a consistent analysis for all states.\" This confirms the issue is whether the EPA can use procedural bundling (a single publication) to dictate jurisdiction.\n-   **Identification of the Central Statute:** The entire dispute hinges on the interpretation of the Clean Air Act's judicial review provision, `42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)`. This statute bifurcates jurisdiction, sending challenges to \"locally or regionally applicable\" actions to the appropriate regional circuit court, while reserving challenges to \"nationally applicable regulations\" for the D.C. Circuit.\n-   **Discovery of a Major Circuit Split:** The petition reveals a deep and acknowledged conflict among the Courts of Appeals on this exact issue. The Tenth Circuit (in the decision below) found that the EPA's action was \"nationally applicable\" and must be heard in the D.C. Circuit. This directly conflicts with recent rulings from the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Circuits, which all held that these same state-specific plan disapprovals were \"locally or regionally applicable\" and should be reviewed in their respective regional courts. This 4-1 split is a powerful reason for the Supreme Court to grant certiorari to ensure uniform application of federal law.\n-   **Petitioners' Key Arguments:** I now understand the three main pillars of the petitioners' case:\n    1.  **The Circuit Split:** This is their primary argument, emphasizing the need for a uniform national rule on this jurisdictional question.\n    2.  **Importance and Recurrence:** The issue is not a one-off. Because the EPA revisits air quality standards every five years, triggering new state implementation plans, this venue dispute will constantly recur, wasting judicial and party resources without a definitive ruling.\n    3.  **The Tenth Circuit's Decision is Wrong:** Petitioners argue the lower court improperly elevated form (a single Federal Register notice) over substance (21 distinct, state-specific decisions). They cite a D.C. Circuit opinion authored by then-Judge Kavanaugh (`Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA`) stating that an action on a state implementation plan is the \"prototypical 'locally or regionally applicable' action.\" This is a strategically potent citation.\n-   **Predictive Signals:** The existence of a clear, acknowledged, and deep circuit split dramatically increases the probability that the Supreme Court will grant the petition for certiorari. While not a guarantee of the final outcome, the petitioners' arguments, which touch on themes of cooperative federalism, statutory textualism, and skepticism of agency overreach, appear well-aligned with the judicial philosophies of several current justices.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has powerfully validated and refined my strategic approach to analyzing Supreme Court cases.\n-   **Initial Information Gathering Strategy (Validated):** My initial heuristic to prioritize finding and analyzing the \"Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" has been proven highly effective. This single document provided a comprehensive roadmap of the case, including the precise legal question, the key statute, the existence of a circuit split, and the petitioners' core legal strategy.\n-   **Source Prioritization (Refined):** While the search returned multiple documents related to the petition, the substantive \"Petition for Writ of Certiorari\" itself is the high-value source. Ancillary documents like the \"Affidavit of Service\" and \"Certificate of Compliance\" are useful for confirming procedural steps (like the filing date) but contain no information relevant to the legal merits or predictive analysis. My future searches should be tuned to isolate the main brief from these procedural filings.\n-   **Dual-Layer Analysis Principle (Applied):** I successfully analyzed the petition on two levels. For \u03b8, I extracted the specific arguments, statutes (`42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)`), and precedents (`Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA`). For D, I observed the *strategic* choice to lead with the circuit split and to frame the argument using themes of federalism and agency gamesmanship, including the tactical citation of a current Justice's prior circuit court opinion.\n-   **New Heuristic - \"The Circuit Split is King\":** I have learned that when evaluating a case at the certiorari stage, the single most important factor to identify is a direct conflict among the U.S. Courts of Appeals on a question of federal law. The cert petition's structure confirms this, as it is the lead argument. My future analyses must prioritize identifying and detailing the nature of any claimed circuit split.\n-   **New Heuristic - \"Identify Resonant Themes\":** Effective legal arguments before the Supreme Court often transcend dry statutory analysis by tapping into broader judicial philosophies. The petitioners' framing of this case around \"cooperative federalism\" and preventing agency self-aggrandizement is a strategic choice. Identifying these themes and considering how they might appeal to the known jurisprudential leanings of the Justices is a crucial component of a sophisticated prediction strategy."

App. \n1a-19a, 23-1068 Pet. App. 1a-17a), is reported at 93 F.4th \n1262. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 27, 2024.  The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

App. \n1a-19a, 23-1068 Pet. App. 1a-17a), is reported at 93 F.4th \n1262. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nFebruary 27, 2024.  The petitions for writs of certiorari \nwere filed on March 28, 2024, and were granted on Oc-\ntober 21, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court rests on \n28 U.S.C. 1254(1).   \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reprinted in the \nappendix.  App., infra, 1a-36a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a petitioner seeks review of a \u201cfinal action\u201d \ntaken by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) \nunder the Clean Air Act (CAA), 42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq., \nSection 7607(b)(1) of Title 42 provides for direct court \nof appeals review of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.  To de-\ntermine which circuit has exclusive venue over the chal-\nlenge, Section 7607(b)(1) separates EPA\u2019s final actions \ninto three categories. \nFirst, challenges to certain specified actions or to \n\u201cany other nationally applicable regulations promul-\ngated, or final action taken,\u201d must be filed \u201conly in the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the District of Co-\nlumbia.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, challenges to \ncertain specified actions, including an action \u201capproving \nor promulgating any implementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any \nother final action  * * *  under [the CAA] (including any \ndenial or disapproval [under Title I of the CAA]) which \nis locally or regionally applicable may be filed only in \nthe United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, \u201c[n]otwithstanding\u201d the sentence \ndirecting review of a locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d challenges to such a lo-\ncally or regionally applicable action \u201cmay be filed only \nin the United States Court of Appeals for the District of \nColumbia if such action is based on a determination of \nnationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \n\n3 \n \nCongress adopted this three-prong structure in the \nClean Air Act Amendments of 1977, Pub. L. No. 95-95, \n91 Stat. 685, 776.  The predecessor to Section 7607(b)(1) \nauthorized direct court of appeals review only of certain \nspecifically enumerated EPA actions.  42 U.S.C. 1857h-\n5(b)(1) (1970).  EPA actions involving \u201cnational primary \nor secondary ambient air quality standard[s],\u201d \u201cemis-\nsion standard[s],\u201d or other specified standards or con-\ntrols were reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit, while \nEPA\u2019s actions \u201cin approving or promulgating\u201d a state or \nfederal \u201cimplementation plan\u201d were reviewable only in \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  That division reflected \nCongress\u2019s view that EPA actions that are \u201cnational in \nscope\u201d should receive \u201ceven and consistent national ap-\nplication,\u201d which would be accomplished through cen-\ntralized D.C. Circuit review.  S. Rep. No. 1196, 91st \nCong., 2d Sess. 41 (1970) (1970 Senate Report).  By con-\ntrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approving or prom-\nulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run only to one \nair quality control region\u201d as appropriately reviewed \u201cin \nthe U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in which the \naffected air quality control region, or portion thereof, is \nlocated.\u201d  Ibid.  At that time, the venue provision did not \ninclude a catchall for other nationally or locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions, nor did the provision specif-\nically reference EPA actions that are based on a deter-\nmination of nationwide scope or effect.  Rather, final ac-\ntions that the CAA venue provision did not specifically \naddress were reviewable only by a district court exer-\ncising federal-question jurisdiction.  See Harrison v. \nPPG Industries, Inc., 446 U.S. 578, 584 (1980).   \nIn 1977, Congress amended the statute to authorize \ndirect court of appeals review of all EPA \u201cfinal actions\u201d \nunder the CAA.  Congress achieved that result by add-\n\n4 \n \ning the catchall categories for the first two subsets of \nfinal actions, and by adding the third category of locally \nor regionally applicable actions that are based on a de-\ntermination of nationwide scope or effect.  The House \nReport accompanying the amendment explained that \nthe revision would \u201cprovide[] for essentially locally, \nstatewide, or regionally applicable rules or orders to be \nreviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for the circuit in \nwhich such locality, State, or region is located.\u201d  H.R. \nRep. No. 294, 95th Cong., 1st Sess. 323 (1977) (1977 \nHouse Report).  \u201cOn the other hand,\u201d the report ex-\nplained, venue would lie only in the D.C. Circuit \u201cif an \naction of the Administrator is found by him to be based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect (includ-\ning a determination which has scope or effect beyond a \nsingle judicial circuit).\u201d  Id. at 324.   \n2. The EPA action at issue here is a final action dis-\napproving 21 States\u2019 implementation plans for reducing \nozone pollution transported between multiple States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. 9336 (Feb. 13, 2023).  Under the CAA, EPA \nmust set and periodically revise national ambient air \nquality standards (NAAQS) for particular pollutants, \nincluding ozone, to protect public health and the envi-\nronment.  See 42 U.S.C. 7408, 7409.  The CAA author-\nizes the States, in the first instance, to develop state im-\nplementation plans to achieve and maintain those \nNAAQS, and to submit those plans to EPA within three \nyears after the promulgation of a new or revised \nNAAQS.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a).   \nWhile most CAA requirements for state plans focus on \nintrastate air quality, see, e.g., 42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(A)-(C) \nand (E)-(M), the CAA recognizes that \u201c[a]ir pollution is \ntransient, heedless of state boundaries,\u201d and may be \n\u201ctransported by air currents\u201d from upwind to downwind \n\n5 \n \nStates, EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L. P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 496 (2014).  When air pollution travels beyond \nthe originating State\u2019s boundaries, that State is \u201cre-\nlieved of the associated costs,\u201d which are \u201cborne instead \nby the downwind States, whose ability to achieve and \nmaintain satisfactory air quality is hampered by the \nsteady stream of infiltrating pollution.\u201d  Ibid.  The prob-\nlem is particularly acute for ozone, which travels long \ndistances.  See West Virginia v. EPA, 362 F.3d 861, 865 \n(D.C. Cir. 2004).  To combat cross-border pollution, the \nCAA requires each State\u2019s plan to prohibit in-state emis-\nsions that will \u201ccontribute significantly to nonattain-\nment\u201d or \u201cinterfere with maintenance\u201d of healthy air \nquality in any other State.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i)(I).  \nThis statutory requirement is known as the Good \nNeighbor Provision.  See EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 498.   \nWhen a State submits its plan to EPA, the agency \nmust assess the plan to determine whether it meets the \nCAA\u2019s requirements, including whether it prohibits any \nsignificant contribution to nonattainment in other \nStates.  If particular plans do not satisfy that require-\nment, EPA must disapprove those plans and promul-\ngate federal plans to implement the requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(c)(1), (k)(2) and (3).   \nB. Facts And Proceedings Below \n1. a. In 2015, EPA revised the NAAQS for ozone to \nset a more stringent standard, triggering the require-\nments for States to develop implementation plans.  80 \nFed. Reg. 65,292 (Oct. 26, 2015).  EPA reviewed various \nstate plan submissions using a four-step framework it \nhad developed for assessing Good Neighbor obligations \nfor ozone.  See, e.g., 76 Fed. Reg. 48,208, 48,248-48,249 \n(Aug. 8, 2011); see EME Homer, 572 U.S. at 524 (reject-\ning challenges to this framework).  Under that frame-\n\n6 \n \nwork, EPA assessed whether, in 2023 (the last full year \nthat emissions reductions could be implemented before \nthe relevant attainment date), a State would contribute \nsignificantly to nonattainment or interfere with mainte-\nnance of the 2015 ozone NAAQS in a downwind State.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9340-9341.   \nAt step one, EPA used nationwide air quality modeling \nand monitoring data to identify \u201creceptors\u201d\u2014locations \nthat were expected to have difficulty complying with the \n2015 ozone NAAQS in 2023.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9341-9342; \nJ.A. 234a-236a.  At step two, EPA identified the sources \nof ozone and applied a screening threshold to determine \nwhether a particular State would contribute more than \na de minimis amount to those downwind receptors.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9342, 9371-9375.  If so, the State was con-\nsidered \u201clinked\u201d to that receptor.  Ibid.  At step three, \nEPA evaluated whether the state plans defined what \n\u201camounts\u201d of a linked State\u2019s contribution to receptors \nwere \u201csignificant,\u201d and therefore must be prohibited \nunder the CAA.  42 U.S.C. 7410(a)(2)(D)(i); see EME \nHomer, 572 U.S. at 519-520.  At step four, EPA evalu-\nated whether the state plans contained enforceable con-\ntrol measures to prohibit those \u201csignificant\u201d emissions.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9343. \nMany States generally follow this framework in their \nown analyses, although EPA does not require it.  Re-\ngardless of the approach States take, EPA must inde-\npendently evaluate whether each submission complies \nwith the Good Neighbor Provision, and this framework \nprovides \u201creasonable organization to the analysis of the \ncomplex air quality challenge of interstate ozone \ntransport.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.   \nb. After reviewing the various state plan submis-\nsions, EPA issued a final rule in which it concluded that \n\n7 \n \n21 States\u2019 submissions\u2014each of which proposed no ad-\nditional emissions reductions to meet the more strin-\ngent ozone standard\u2014must be disapproved because \nthey did not comply with the Good Neighbor Provision.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9338.  EPA found that the 21 States had \nfailed to justify their conclusions that their emissions do \nnot \u201csignificant[ly] contribut[e].\u201d  Id. at 9354; see id. at \n9354-9361.  Petitioners Oklahoma and Utah were among \nthose 21 States.  Id. at 9359-9360.   \nMany of the 21 States offered substantially similar \nreasons for asserting that they were not required to im-\nplement additional emissions reductions.  For example, \nmany States (including Oklahoma and Utah) contested \nEPA\u2019s reliance on updated, 2016-based modeling in as-\nsessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9357, 9359-9360, 9365-9367; see \nJ.A. 62a-63a.  Many States (including Oklahoma and \nUtah) had adopted a threshold for identifying poten-\ntially significant contributions to downwind-State pollu-\ntion levels that was higher than the 1% threshold that \nEPA found appropriate at step two.  88 Fed. Reg. at \n9372-9373 & n.311; see J.A. 20a, 44a-45a.  Many States \n(including Oklahoma and Utah) asserted that their own \ncontributions to air-quality problems in downwind States \nwere not significant because other countries and States \nalso contributed pollution to the same downwind States.  \n88 Fed. Reg. at 9355-9360, 9378 & n.331; see J.A. 22a-\n23a, 47a-51a.  And many States (including Oklahoma \nand Utah) asserted that existing controls and expected \nfuture reductions would be sufficient to address their \nGood Neighbor obligations.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9360; \nsee J.A. 23a-26a, 51a-57a.   \nIn disapproving the States\u2019 submissions, EPA made \nuniform determinations to address many similar argu-\n\n8 \n \nments that multiple States had asserted in support of \ntheir plans.  See J.A. 184a.  With respect to EPA\u2019s use \nof updated modeling data, EPA explained that the \nagency had used \u201cthe most current and technically ap-\npropriate information\u201d to evaluate the state submis-\nsions nationwide, which allowed the agency to assess \nStates\u2019 ozone levels and contributions to ensure equita-\nble results, using the highest quality analytics.  88 Fed. \nReg. at 9366-9367; see id. at 9380-9381.  In discussing \nthe initial threshold for screening the States\u2019 contribu-\ntions at step two, EPA determined that a contribution \nthreshold equal to 1% of the revised ozone NAAQS was \nappropriate to \u201censure[] both national consistency \nacross all states and consistency and continuity with \n[EPA\u2019s] prior interstate transport actions for other \nNAAQS.\u201d  Id. at 9371; see id. at 9371-9374.  In address-\ning arguments regarding relative contributions, EPA \nexplained that contributions from other States or coun-\ntries are \u201ctypically not relevant in assessing whether a \ndownwind state has an air quality problem, or whether \nan upwind state is significantly contributing to that \nproblem,\u201d because each State is \u201cobligated to eliminate \n[its] own \u2018significant contribution\u2019\u200a\u201d to downwind States.  \nId. at 9378.  And in considering the adequacy of existing \ncontrol measures or anticipated reductions, EPA ex-\nplained that existing control measures \u201care already re-\nflected in the future year projected air quality results\u201d \nof the agency\u2019s nationwide modeling, which showed con-\ntinued contributions despite those controls, and that an-\nticipated reductions must be incorporated into the plan \nitself in order to be creditable.  Id. at 9343; see id. at \n9367, 9376-9377.  \nc. After explaining its bases for disapproving the \nsubmissions, EPA addressed judicial review of the ac-\n\n9 \n \ntion.  EPA explained that its rulemaking was \u201c\u200a\u2018nation-\nally applicable\u2019\u200a\u201d under Section 7607(b)(1) because the \nagency was disapproving submissions \u201cfor 21 states lo-\ncated across a wide geographic area\u201d by \u201capplying a \nuniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide \nanalytical methods with respect to the [CAA\u2019s] require-\nments  * * *  concerning interstate transport of pollu-\ntion.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \n\u201cIn the alternative,\u201d EPA found that the \u201caction is \nbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA explained in particu-\nlar that, in disapproving the 21 state plans, the agency \nwas implementing \u201ca common core of nationwide policy \njudgments and technical analysis concerning the inter-\nstate transport of pollutants throughout the continental \nU.S.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA further explained that it had evalu-\nated the plans \u201cwith an eye to ensuring national con-\nsistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results \namong upwind states  * * *  and between upwind and \ndownwind states.\u201d  Id. at 9381.  EPA also observed that \n\u201cconsolidated review of this action in the D.C. Circuit \nwill avoid piecemeal litigation in the regional circuits, \nfurther judicial economy, and eliminate the risk of in-\nconsistent results for different states.\u201d  Ibid.; see J.A. \n181a-186a.  \n2. Various States and industry groups challenged \nEPA\u2019s disapproval action with respect to 12 state plans.  \nThose challenges were filed in the D.C. Circuit and in \nseven regional circuits.1  Petitioners Oklahoma and \n \n1 See, e.g., West Virginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418 (4th Cir. Apr. 14, \n2023); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069 (5th Cir. Feb. 14, 2023); Ken-\ntucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216 (6th Cir. Mar. 13, 2023); Arkansas v. \nEPA, No. 23-1320 (8th Cir. Feb. 16, 2023); Missouri v. EPA, No. 23-\n \n\n10 \n \nUtah (State petitioners), as well as eight industry par-\nticipants (Industry petitioners) within those States, \nfiled petitions for review in both the Tenth and D.C. Cir-\ncuits.2  In the Tenth Circuit, EPA moved to transfer \nvenue to the D.C. Circuit or to dismiss for improper \nvenue.  Pet. App. 8a.3  A motions panel stayed the dis-\napproval action as to the state plans submitted by Okla-\nhoma and Utah, and it referred the motion to dismiss or \ntransfer venue to the merits panel.  Id. at 10a-11a. \nA unanimous Tenth Circuit merits panel granted \nEPA\u2019s motion and transferred the petitions to the D.C. \nCircuit.  Pet. App. 1a-19a.  The court explained that, un-\nder the \u201cplain text\u201d of Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cwhether a pe-\ntition for review belongs in the D.C. Circuit turns exclu-\nsively on the nature of the challenged agency action,\u201d \nnot on \u201cthe scope of the petitioner\u2019s challenge.\u201d  Id. at \n12a.   \nThe court of appeals concluded that, \u201c[o]n its face,\u201d \nthe disapproval action is nationally applicable.  Pet. \nApp. 12a.  The court emphasized that the action disap-\nproves state plans \u201cfrom 21 states across the country\u2014\n \n1719 (8th Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); ALLETE, Inc. v. EPA, No. 23-1776 \n(8th Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Nevada Cement Co. v. EPA, No. 23-682 (9th \nCir. Apr. 14, 2023); Utah v. EPA, No. 23-9509 (10th Cir. Feb. 13, \n2023); Oklahoma v.

Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); Okla-\nhoma v. EPA, No. 23-1103 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 13, 2023); Oklahoma Gas \n& Elec. Co. v. EPA, No. 23-1105 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Tulsa Ce-\nment LLC v. EPA, No. 23-1106 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); Western \nFarmers Elec. Coop. v. EPA, No. 23-1107 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023); \nPacifiCorp v. EPA, No. 23-1112 (D.C. Cir. Apr. 14, 2023).   \n3 Unless otherwise noted, all references in this brief to the \u201cPet. \nApp.\u201d are to the State petitioners\u2019 petition appendix in No. 23-1067.   \n\n11 \n \nspanning eight EPA regions and ten federal judicial  \ncircuits\u2014because those states all failed to comply with \nthe good-neighbor provision.\u201d  Ibid.  The court further \nexplained that, in the disapproval action, EPA had \u201cap-\nplied a uniform statutory interpretation and common \nanalytical methods\u201d to examine the \u201coverlapping and in-\nterwoven linkages between upwind and downwind \nstates in a consistent manner.\u201d  Id. at 12a-13a.   \nPetitioners argued that EPA\u2019s disapproval action \nshould be treated for venue purposes as multiple indi-\nvidual actions, each applying to a single State.  The \ncourt of appeals rejected that contention, noting that \nthe text of Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cdirects courts to consider \nonly the face of the \u2018final action.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 13a.  The \ncourt therefore viewed it as irrelevant that EPA \u201ccould \nhave chosen to issue standalone\u201d disapprovals for each \nof the 21 States.  Ibid.   \nThe court of appeals recognized that motions panels \nof the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits had recently de-\nnied EPA\u2019s motions to transfer petitions challenging the \ndisapproval action.  Pet. App. 17a.  But the court con-\ncluded that those courts had \u201cstrayed from \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \ntext and instead applied a petition-focused approach\u201d \nthat considered the scope of the petitioners\u2019 challenge \nrather than the face of the agency action itself.  Ibid.  \nThe court also noted that the contrary decisions of those \nother circuits had \u201cgenerated strong dissents highlight-\ning critical flaws in the majority opinions.\u201d  Id. at 18a.   \nBecause the court of appeals concluded that the dis-\napproval action is nationally applicable, the court de-\nclined to address EPA\u2019s alternative argument that the \nrule \u201cis based on a determination of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Pet. App. 19a n.8 (quoting 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)).   \n\n12 \n \nThe court of appeals transferred the petitions to the \nD.C. Circuit.  That court subsequently ordered that the \ncases be held in abeyance pending this Court\u2019s decision.  \n23-1103 Order (Nov. 6, 2024).  The disapproval action \nremains stayed as to Oklahoma and Utah pending judi-\ncial review.   \n3. The other regional circuits issued interlocutory \nmotions-panel decisions that either denied transfer or \nreferred the venue question to the merits panel.  West \nVirginia v. EPA, 90 F.4th 323 (4th Cir. 2024) (denying \ntransfer motion); Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL \n7204840 (5th Cir. May 1, 2023) (per curiam) (same); \nKentucky v. EPA, No. 23-3216, 2023 WL 11871967 (6th \nCir. July 25, 2023) (same); 23-1320 Order, Arkansas v. \nEPA (8th Cir. Apr. 25, 2023) (same); 23-682 Order, Ne-\nvada Cement Co. v. EPA (9th Cir. July 3, 2023) (refer-\nring the venue question to the merits panel); 23-11173 \nOrder, Alabama v. EPA (11th Cir. July 12, 2023) \n(same).   \nAfter this Court granted certiorari, a merits panel of \nthe Sixth Circuit held that it had venue over Kentucky\u2019s \nchallenge to EPA\u2019s disapproval action, and the court va-\ncated the disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on the merits.  \nKentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447 (2024).   \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nUnder the plain terms of Section 7607(b)(1), the dis-\napproval action here is reviewable only in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary arguments impose atextual \nrequirements and fail to give effect to the provision \nCongress enacted.   \nA.  Under Section 7607(b)(1), \u201cnationally applicable\u201d \nEPA final actions are subject to judicial review only in \nthe D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  To determine \nwhether a particular EPA action is \u201cnationally applica-\n\n13 \n \nble,\u201d a court must consider the action on its face.  The \ndisapproval action here is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d be-\ncause it addresses state plan submissions from 21 \nStates in ten federal judicial circuits across the country.   \nStatutory context confirms that result.  Section \n7607(b)(1) distinguishes between \u201cnationally applica-\nble\u201d EPA actions, which are subject to review in the \nD.C. Circuit, and \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d ac-\ntions, which are subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  Con-\ngress\u2019s use of the definite article indicates that there is \nonly one \u201cappropriate circuit\u201d for review of any partic-\nular \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d action.  When an \nEPA action applies to entities in multiple circuits, no \nsingle regional circuit can be identified as \u201cthe\u201d appro-\npriate venue, so the action is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d rather than \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d   \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s legislative history reinforces \nthat conclusion.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s un-\nderstanding that any \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \naction could be reviewed in the regional court of appeals \nwhere the affected entity was located.  Where affected \nentities are spread across multiple circuits, however, \nCongress viewed the D.C. Circuit as the proper venue.   \nIn endorsing the contrary conclusion, petitioners \nseek to impose atextual restrictions on the availability \nof D.C. Circuit review.  Petitioners argue that, for venue \npurposes, the Court should treat EPA\u2019s disapproval of \neach State\u2019s plan submission as a separate \u201cfinal ac-\ntion.\u201d  But this Court has long recognized that agencies \nhave discretion to devise their own procedures, includ-\ning by aggregating common issues for joint resolution.  \nEPA acted reasonably in taking that approach here.  And \n\n14 \n \nin determining the proper venue for challenges to the \nagency\u2019s disapproval action, the Court should focus on \nthe action that EPA actually took, rather than on a hy-\npothetical array of 21 separate, State-specific disapprov-\nals. \nPetitioners also assert that the disapproval action \nmust be \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d because Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) specifically channels to the \u201cappropriate \ncircuit\u201d an EPA action \u201capproving or promulgating any \nimplementation plan,\u201d \u201cor any other final action  * * *  \nunder [the CAA] (including any denial or disapproval \n[under title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But that language \ndoes not say that a denial or disapproval action is locally \nor regionally applicable.  It merely provides that a chal-\nlenge to any such action \u201cwhich is locally or regionally \napplicable may be filed only in the  . . .  appropriate re-\ngional circuit\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 11a-12a n.5 (quoting 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1)) (brackets omitted).  Whether a particular \ndenial or disapproval is locally or regionally applicable \nis for the reviewing court to decide. \nB. Even if this Court disregards the framing of the \ndisapproval action and views EPA\u2019s disapproval of each \nState\u2019s plan as a distinct \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d action, those actions are still reviewable only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  EPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d and EPA published its finding to that effect in ac-\ncordance with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirements.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nIn linking proper venue to a \u201cdetermination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect,\u201d the statutory text focuses on \nthe underlying reasons for EPA\u2019s final action.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The final action must be \u201cbased on\u201d \n\n15 \n \nthe relevant determinations, indicating that the deter-\nminations must be a but-for cause of the agency\u2019s final \naction\u2014forming the core of the agency\u2019s analysis.  To \nbe nationwide in scope or effect, the core justifications \nfor EPA\u2019s final action must be intended to govern the \nagency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions throughout the \ncountry, or have legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nThe disapproval action here meets those require-\nments.  The disapproval action is based on determinations \nthat have nationwide scope and effect, including:  (1) \nEPA\u2019s decision to use updated, 2016-based modeling in \nassessing air quality conditions and pollution contribu-\ntion across the country; (2) EPA\u2019s decision to apply a \n1% contribution threshold to each State to assess \nwhether the State contributed more than a de minimis \namount of ozone pollution downwind; (3) EPA\u2019s deter-\nmination that the relative magnitude of other sources\u2019 \ncontributions to nonattainment in downwind States \ncould not justify inaction by the upwind States at issue; \nand (4) EPA\u2019s position that a linked State cannot rely \non current controls or anticipated emissions reductions \nthat are not incorporated into the state plans them-\nselves.  Those determinations formed the core of EPA\u2019s \nanalysis in rejecting the state plan submissions, and the \nagency relied on each determination in acting on Good \nNeighbor plan submissions across the country.    \nStatutory history confirms Congress\u2019s intent that \nEPA actions like the disapproval action would be re-\nviewable in the D.C. Circuit.  The original 1970 version \nof the venue provision did not specifically authorize \nD.C. Circuit review of final actions that are based on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.  That stat-\nutory gap led to litigation over which circuit qualified as \n\n16 \n \n\u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d when EPA established a uni-\nform legal framework for state implementation plans \nspanning multiple States in multiple judicial circuits.  In \namending the statute to its current form, Congress \nadopted the view expressed by EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel, who urged that challenges to such actions \nshould be channeled to the D.C. Circuit to \u201ccentralize \nreview\u201d and \u201ctak[e] advantage of [the D.C. Circuit\u2019s] ad-\nministrative law expertise,\u201d thereby \u201cfacilitating an or-\nderly development of the basic law\u201d that EPA would ap-\nply nationwide.  41 Fed. Reg. 56,767, 56,769 (Dec. 30, \n1976).   \nPetitioners contend that the statutory term \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d refers only to the ultimate disposition of the \nmatter before the agency.  But that reading erases the \ndistinction that Section 7607(b)(1) draws between the \nagency \u201caction\u201d and the \u201cdetermination\u201d on which the \naction is \u201cbased.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners fur-\nther observe that EPA also considered State-specific \nfacts in disapproving each of the state plan submissions \nhere.  But the statute\u2019s third prong is not limited to \nEPA actions that are based solely on determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect.  Nor would such a limitation \nmake sense.  The third prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \ncomes into play only when the challenged EPA action is \n\u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d and such actions al-\nmost always will rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Ibid.    \nPetitioners are also incorrect in asserting that EPA\u2019s \ninterpretation would authorize D.C. Circuit venue for \nchallenges to every locally or regionally applicable ac-\ntion.  The statute imposes meaningful limits on EPA\u2019s \nauthority to find that a particular action is \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect.\u201d  Courts \n\n17 \n \nshould enforce those limits without adding more of their \nown making.   \nARGUMENT \nTHE D.C. CIRCUIT IS THE APPROPRIATE VENUE FOR \nREVIEW OF THE DISAPPROVAL ACTION  \nThe CAA\u2019s venue provision reflects a clear congres-\nsional preference for \u201cuniform judicial review of regula-\ntory issues of national importance.\u201d  National Environ-\nmental Development Ass\u2019n Clean Air Project v. EPA, \n891 F.3d 1041, 1054 (D.C. Cir. 2018) (Silberman, J., con-\ncurring).  Section 7607(b)(1) specifies two distinct cir-\ncumstances in which review of nationally significant \nEPA actions will be channeled to the D.C. Circuit.  First, \nany \u201cnationally applicable\u201d final action is subject to ex-\nclusive D.C. Circuit review.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Second, \neven if a challenged final action is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d venue lies exclusively in the D.C. Circuit if \nthat action is \u201cbased on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect and if in taking such action the Adminis-\ntrator finds and publishes that such action is based on \nsuch a determination.\u201d  Ibid.   \nBecause EPA\u2019s disapproval action addresses the \nstate plan submissions of 21 States across the country, \nthe action is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d within the meaning \nof Section 7607(b)(1).  In the alternative, if (as petition-\ners urge) the Court views the disapproval action as com-\nprising 21 separate \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d \nstate plan disapprovals, those disapprovals are still re-\nviewable only in the D.C. Circuit because they are based \non determinations of nationwide scope and effect.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each State\u2019s plan was grounded in \nEPA\u2019s determinations regarding the proper implemen-\ntation of the Good Neighbor requirements that are im-\nposed on States throughout the country and that affect \n\n18 \n \nthe legal obligations of downwind and upwind States in \nmultiple judicial circuits. \nThe numerous challenges to the disapproval action, \nbrought in eight judicial circuits across the country, il-\nlustrate the outcome that Section 7607(b)(1) was intended \nto prevent.  In arguing for regional-circuit venue, States \nand industry participants have emphasized the State-\nspecific factors that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval \nof various state plans.  In briefing their challenges on \nthe merits, however, those States and industry partici-\npants have focused primarily on EPA\u2019s nationwide de-\nterminations, causing eight different courts of appeals \nto expend resources considering nearly identical chal-\nlenges.   \nBoth because it governs state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits, and because it rests on EPA determina-\ntions that apply nationwide, the disapproval action is \nprecisely the type of EPA action that Congress re-\ngarded as appropriate for centralized D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  Under petitioners\u2019 venue analysis, however, sim-\nilar EPA actions would continue to spawn parallel chal-\nlenges in multiple circuits, wasting judicial resources \nand heightening the risk of inconsistent outcomes.  Con-\ngress crafted Section 7607(b)(1) to avoid that result, and \nthis Court should affirm the court of appeals\u2019 judgment.   \nA. The Disapproval Action Is Nationally Applicable \nThe disapproval action addressed the state plan sub-\nmissions of 21 States located in multiple judicial circuits \nacross the country.  It therefore is apparent on the face \nof the final action that it is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d and sub-\nject to review in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nPetitioners\u2019 contrary arguments lack merit.   \n\n19 \n \n1.  The text, context, and history of Section 7607(b)(1) \nmake clear that the disapproval action is nationally \napplicable  \nSection 7607(b)(1) instructs that a challenge to a \u201cfi-\nnal action\u201d that is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d must be heard \nin the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  That language \nencompasses the disapproval action at issue here be-\ncause that action applies to state plans in multiple judi-\ncial circuits across the country.  The statutory context \nand history confirm Congress\u2019s intent that the D.C. Cir-\ncuit would review challenges to such actions.   \na. The term \u201caction\u201d in Section 7607(b)(1) \u201cis meant \nto cover comprehensively every manner in which an \nagency may exercise its power.\u201d  Whitman v. American \nTrucking Ass\u2019ns, 531 U.S. 457, 478 (2001).  And under \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s plain text, the choice between D.C. \nCircuit and regional-circuit venue turns on the nature \nof the pertinent EPA action rather than on the basis for \na particular petitioner\u2019s challenge.  See, e.g., Pet. App. \n12a; Hunt Ref. Co. v. EPA, 90 F.4th 1107, 1110 (11th Cir. \n2024); Southern Ill. Power Coop. v. EPA, 863 F.3d 666, \n671 (7th Cir. 2017); American Road & Transp. Builders \nAss\u2019n v. EPA, 705 F.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013) (Ka-\nvanaugh, J.), cert. denied, 571 U.S. 1125 (2014); ATK \nLaunch Sys., Inc. v. EPA, 651 F.3d 1194, 1197 (10th Cir. \n2011).  Courts thus must look to the face of the action \nand determine whether it applies to\u2014or includes \n\u201cwithin its scope,\u201d Black\u2019s Law Dictionary 91 (5th ed. \n1979) (Black\u2019s) (defining \u201capply\u201d)\u2014entities \u201cthroughout \n[the] nation,\u201d Webster\u2019s Third New International Dic-\ntionary of the English Language 1505 (1976) (Web-\nster\u2019s) (defining \u201cnationally\u201d).     \nStatutory context sheds further light on what geo-\ngraphic scope an action must have to be \u201cnationally ap-\n\n20 \n \nplicable.\u201d  Under Section 7607(b)(1), each EPA action is \neither \u201cnationally applicable\u201d or \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In distinguishing be-\ntween those two types of actions, \u201c[t]he text of the stat-\nute leaves no room for an intermediate case.\u201d  Southern \nIll. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at 673.  If the challenged ac-\ntion is \u201cnationally applicable,\u201d the D.C. Circuit is the ex-\nclusive forum for judicial review.  And unless a \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d action is \u201cbased on a determi-\nnation of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d it may be chal-\nlenged \u201conly in the United States Court of Appeals for \nthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The stat-\nute\u2019s use of the definite article\u2014\u201cthe appropriate cir-\ncuit,\u201d ibid. (emphasis added)\u2014indicates that, for any \ngiven locally or regionally applicable EPA action, there \nis only one appropriate regional court of appeals in \nwhich to seek review.  Cf. Rumsfeld v. Padilla, 542 U.S. \n426, 434 (2004) (explaining that the \u201cuse of the definite \narticle\u201d in the federal habeas statute \u201cindicates that \nthere is generally only one proper respondent to a given \nprisoner\u2019s habeas petition\u201d).4 \nThe existence of a single appropriate court of ap-\npeals for this category of EPA actions in turn conveys \nthat a particular action is \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d only if it applies to entities that are confined to a \nsingle judicial circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  After all, \nfor an action that applies equally to entities in more \nthan one judicial circuit, no particular court of appeals \n \n4 Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s reference to \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis added), contrasts with the preceding \nsubsection, where Congress contemplated the prospect of multiple \npermissible forums by authorizing \u201cthe district court  * * *  for any \ndistrict in which such person is found or resides or transacts busi-\nness\u201d to issue certain orders, 42 U.S.C. 7607(a) (emphasis added). \n\n21 \n \ncan be identified as \u201cthe appropriate circuit\u201d for review.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).  Thus, any action that spans \nmore than one judicial circuit is properly viewed as \u201cna-\ntionally applicable\u201d and subject to review only in the \nD.C. Circuit.  Ibid.   \nb. The history of Section 7607(b)(1) reflects the \nsame understanding.  As originally enacted in 1970, the \nCAA venue provision stated that any action \u201cpromul-\ngating any national primary or secondary ambient air \nquality standard,\u201d \u201cemission standard,\u201d \u201cstandard of \nperformance,\u201d or other specified standards or controls, \nwould be reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. \n1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  The provision further specified \nthat any action \u201capproving or promulgating any imple-\nmentation plan\u201d could be reviewed only in \u201cthe appro-\npriate circuit.\u201d  Ibid.  Because that venue provision did \nnot specify the proper court for review of the many EPA \nactions that did not fall within any of the enumerated \ncategories, such actions were reviewable only by dis-\ntrict courts exercising federal-question jurisdiction.  \nSee p. 3, supra.   \nThe actions for which the 1970 statute specified D.C. \nCircuit review were all \u201cnational in scope,\u201d and Con-\ngress sought to ensure that they received \u201ceven and \nconsistent national application.\u201d  1970 Senate Report \n41.  By contrast, Congress viewed EPA actions approv-\ning or promulgating \u201cimplementation plans which run \nonly to one air quality control region\u201d as amenable to \nreview \u201cin the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Circuit in \nwhich the affected air quality control region, or portion \nthereof, is located,\u201d ibid., which the statute referred to \nas \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) \n(1970).   \n\n22 \n \nWhen Congress amended the statute in 1977 to ex-\npand the scope of direct court of appeals review, it \nadopted the same understanding of the limited geo-\ngraphic scope of actions that would be subject to review \nin \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  The 1977 House Report ex-\nplained that the revision would \u201cprovide[] for essen-\ntially locally, statewide, or regionally applicable rules or \norders to be reviewed in the U.S. court of appeals for \nthe circuit in which such locality, State, or region is lo-\ncated.\u201d  1977 House Report 323.  The House Report con-\ntrasted such local actions with nationally relevant ac-\ntions that extend \u201cbeyond a single judicial circuit\u201d and \ntherefore should be subject to centralized D.C. Circuit \nreview.  Id. at 324.  That history reinforces the conclu-\nsion that, under the venue provision in its current form, \nfinal EPA actions that apply to entities in multiple judi-\ncial circuits are reviewable only in the D.C. Circuit.   \nc. Applying that understanding here, the disap-\nproval action is nationally applicable.  EPA \u201cexercise[d] \nits power\u201d through a single final action that applies to \nsubmissions from 21 States across the country, span-\nning ten federal judicial circuits.  Whitman, 531 U.S. at \n478; see Pet. App. 12a.  On a plain-text understanding, \nthe disapproval action is therefore \u201cnationally applica-\nble,\u201d and petitioners\u2019 challenges to the action can pro-\nceed only in the D.C. Circuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary approach to venue is incon-\nsistent with the statutory text  \nPetitioners argue that the disapproval action is not \n\u201cnationally applicable\u201d because it should be viewed for \nvenue purposes as 21 separate disapprovals of 21 state \nplan submissions, each of which is confined to a single \njudicial circuit.  Petitioners further contend that the dis-\napproval action must be locally or regionally applicable \n\n23 \n \nbecause Section 7607(b)(1) specifically refers to a denial \nor disapproval as an example of a locally or regionally \napplicable action.  Those arguments lack merit. \na. Petitioners contend (State Br. 22-26; Industry Br. \n32-33) that, for purposes of the venue provision, the rel-\nevant \u201cfinal action\u201d is not the single disapproval action \napplicable to 21 States, but rather 21 separate actions \ndisapproving individual state plans.  That argument dis-\nregards EPA\u2019s decision to consider and rule on the var-\nious state plans together, and it is untethered to the \nstatutory text.   \nPetitioners assert (State Br. 23; Industry Br. 32-33) \nthat each individual plan disapproval must be a review-\nable final action because Section 7410 requires \u201c[e]ach \nState\u201d to develop \u201ca plan\u201d to implement the NAAQS \nand requires EPA to \u201cact[] on the submission.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7410(a)(1) and (k)(2) (emphases added).  The \nstatute\u2019s use of singular articles makes sense because \neach State submits a single plan, and EPA must assess \neach State\u2019s submission.  But neither Section 7410 nor \nany other CAA provision restricts EPA\u2019s ability to con-\nsider state plan submissions together and resolve com-\nmon issues in a single final action.   \nThe Dictionary Act, ch. 71, 16 Stat. 431, instructs \nthat, \u201cunless the context indicates otherwise[,] words \nimporting the singular include and apply to several per-\nsons, parties, or things.\u201d  1 U.S.C. 1.  Here, the context \nprovides no reason to doubt that EPA may evaluate \nmultiple state implementation plans in a single action.  \nIndeed, this Court has long recognized that administra-\ntive agencies \u201cshould be free to fashion their own rules \nof procedure and to pursue methods of inquiry capable \nof permitting them to discharge their multitudinous du-\nties.\u201d  FCC v. Pottsville Broadcasting Co., 309 U.S. 134, \n\n24 \n \n143 (1940); see Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Corp. \nv. Natural Resources Defense Council, 435 U.S. 519, \n524 (1978) (\u201c[T]his Court has for more than four dec-\nades emphasized that the formulation of procedures \nwas basically to be left within the discretion of the agen-\ncies to which Congress had confided the responsibility \nfor substantive judgments.\u201d).  That discretion includes \nthe ability to determine \u201cwhether applications should be \nheard contemporaneously or successively.\u201d  Pottsville, \n309 U.S. at 138.  Section 7410\u2019s reference to individual \nstate plan submissions is an insufficient basis for infer-\nring any constraint on EPA\u2019s discretion to group similar \nplan submissions for joint resolution.   \nNor is it relevant that EPA issued separate notices \nof proposed disapprovals for certain States.  See Indus-\ntry Br. 42-43.  Section 7607(b)(1) focuses on the \u201cfinal \naction taken,\u201d not on a proposed or hypothetical action \nthat EPA could have taken.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \nThere is nothing unusual or problematic about EPA\u2019s \ndecision to group the various state plan submissions to \ndecide the common issues that affect States across the \ncountry.  That approach aligns with Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \naim to promote national uniformity and with EPA\u2019s \nlongstanding practice of resolving similar issues in a \nsingle action to ensure consistent treatment.  See ATK \nLaunch Sys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (single EPA action prom-\nulgating air quality designations for 31 areas across 18 \nStates); RMS of Ga., LLC v. EPA, 64 F.4th 1368, 1371 \n(11th Cir. 2023) (single EPA action adjudicating allow-\nance requests and issuing allowances to 32 entities to \nconsume hydrofluorocarbons); West Virginia Chamber \nof Commerce v. Browner, 166 F.3d 336, 1998 WL 827315 \nat *2 (4th Cir. 1998) (Tbl.) (per curiam) (single EPA ac-\ntion declaring that 22 States\u2019 implementation plans \n\n25 \n \nwere inadequate and required revisions).  Indeed, such \naggregation generally is encouraged as a means of effi-\nciently adjudicating common issues.  See Committee on \nAdjudication, Administrative Conference of the United \nStates, Aggregation of Similar Claims in Agency Adju-\ndication (June 13, 2016), https://perma.cc/2UQS-TJ6F.   \nConsistent with those principles, for more than 20 \nyears, EPA\u2019s practice generally has been to take a sin-\ngle final action covering multiple States when address-\ning interstate ozone requirements.  See, e.g., 63 Fed. \nReg. 57,356, 57,480 (Oct. 27, 1998).  By contrast, EPA \ntypically acts individually on most other state plan sub-\nmissions under 42 U.S.C. 7410, because most such sub-\nmissions do not raise nationally significant issues.  See, \ne.g., American Road & Transp. Builders, 705 F.3d at \n455 (Kavanaugh, J.); North Dakota v. EPA, 730 F.3d \n750, 757 (8th Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1135 \n(2014).  Courts have recognized that an action address-\ning a single State\u2019s implementation plan \u201cis the proto-\ntypical \u2018locally or regionally applicable\u2019 action\u201d under \nSection 7607(b)(1).  American Road & Transp. Build-\ners, 705 F.3d at 455; see Sierra Club v. EPA, 47 F.4th \n738, 744 (D.C. Cir. 2022).  But those decisions do not ad-\ndress EPA actions considering common issues involved \nin multiple state plans dealing with interstate ozone \ntransport.  Whether EPA acts on multiple plan submis-\nsions together or instead acts on a single submission, it \nis the face of the final action that determines the proper \nvenue for review.5  \n \n5 Petitioners allege that EPA has been inconsistent in treating \nsome multistate plan approvals as locally or regionally applicable.  \nSee State Br. 28 (citing 85 Fed. Reg. 20,165 (Apr. 10, 2020); 86 Fed. \nReg. 68,413 (Dec. 2, 2021)).  EPA stated in those actions that chal-\n \n\n26 \n \nPetitioners\u2019 position would require a reviewing court \nto look beyond the face of the action and potentially sub-\nstitute a judicial determination of the relevant unit of \nanalysis.  But petitioners provide little guidance on how \ncourts would make that determination.  Lower courts \nconfronted with such arguments have generally re-\njected requests to reframe EPA\u2019s action and have fo-\ncused solely on the face of the final agency action.  See, \ne.g., Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. EPA, 45 F.4th 380, 387 (D.C. \nCir. 2022) (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that EPA\u2019s \nconstruction and application to a specific context of \u201cna-\ntionally applicable provisions of the Clean Air Act\u201d ren-\ndered the agency action itself nationally applicable); Si-\nerra Club, 47 F.4th at 744 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argu-\nment that EPA\u2019s approvals of Texas\u2019s state plans were \nnationally applicable because EPA had announced a \nnew understanding that would apply in other locations, \nthereby \u201ceffectively amend[ing] the agency\u2019s national \nimplementation regulations\u201d); Southern Ill. Power Coop., \n863 F.3d at 671 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that \nEPA\u2019s designations of nonattainment areas were an \n\u201camalgamation of many different locally or regionally \napplicable agency actions\u201d); RMS of Ga., 64 F.4th at \n1374 (rejecting challenger\u2019s argument that an allocation \nof allowances among entities should be considered a \n\u201cdocument detailing many smaller individual actions\u201d).   \nFocusing on the face of the EPA action has allowed \ncourts and litigants to quickly and efficiently determine \nwhere venue lies, preventing wasteful expenditure of \nresources in resolving threshold issues, and furthering \n \nlenges should be filed in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  See, e.g., 86 Fed. \nReg. at 68,420.  But EPA did not make any particular finding as to \nthe geographic applicability of those actions, and Section 7607(b)(1) \ndid not require it to do so.  \n\n27 \n \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose of \u201cprioritiz[ing] efficiency.\u201d  \nNational Ass\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Department of Defense, 583 \nU.S. 109, 130 (2018).  Petitioners\u2019 approach, by contrast, \nwould \u201cintroduce[] needless uncertainty into the deter-\nmination of venue, where the need for clear rules is es-\npecially acute.\u201d  Southern Ill. Power Coop., 863 F.3d at \n673.   \nPetitioners contend (State Br. 30-31; Industry Br. \n43-45) that permitting EPA to aggregate disapprovals \nwould result in EPA manipulating venue by combining \nunrelated agency actions.  But petitioners do not and \ncould not plausibly claim that EPA engaged in any such \narbitrary aggregation here.  Nor do they identify any \nprior instance when EPA has grouped otherwise unre-\nlated local actions for decision and then argued that \nvenue lay in the D.C. Circuit.  If the agency ever did so, \nthe principle we advocate here\u2014i.e., that reviewing \ncourts in determining venue should ordinarily accept \nEPA\u2019s framing of its own action\u2014would not preclude a \ncourt from rejecting a particular grouping to manipu-\nlate venue.  Cf. In re Samsung Electronics Co., 2 F.4th \n1371, 1377 (Fed. Cir. 2021), cert. denied, 142 S. Ct. 1445 \n(2022) (noting that courts \u201chave repeatedly assessed the \npropriety of venue by disregarding manipulative activi-\nties of the parties\u201d).  \nb. Petitioners also argue (State Br. 26-29; Industry \nBr. 33-34) that EPA\u2019s disapproval action must be \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d because Section 7607(b)(1) \nspecifically assigns EPA actions \u201capproving or promul-\ngating any implementation plan\u201d or \u201cden[ying] or dis-\napprov[ing]\u201d an implementation plan to review in \u201cthe \nappropriate circuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Petitioners \nmisread the statutory language.  See Pet. App. 11a-12a \nn.5.   \n\n28 \n \nThe first prong of Section 7607(b)(1) states that var-\nious specified EPA actions\u2014such as NAAQS, emissions \nstandards for hazardous air pollutants, and vehicle \nemissions standards\u2014are reviewable \u201conly in\u201d the D.C. \nCircuit.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The first prong also con-\ntains a broad catchall reference to \u201cany other nationally \napplicable regulations promulgated, or final action taken\u201d \nunder the CAA, and those actions likewise are subject \nto exclusive D.C. Circuit review.  Ibid.  The first prong\u2019s \ncatchall reference to \u201cany other nationally applicable\u201d \nactions, ibid. (emphasis added), indicates that Congress \nviewed the preceding specified actions themselves as \nnationally applicable. \nThe second prong has a similar structure, with a list \nof enumerated actions followed by a catchall.  Within \nthe second prong, however, the EPA action at issue \nhere\u2014i.e., a \u201cdenial or disapproval  * * *  under [title I \nof the CAA],\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1)\u2014is not one of the \nspecific actions referenced before the catchall.  Rather, \nthe second prong\u2019s reference to an EPA \u201cdenial or dis-\napproval\u201d is contained in a parenthetical within the \ncatchall.  See ibid. (referring to \u201cany other final action  \n* * *  (including any denial or disapproval  * * *  under \n[title I of the CAA]) which is locally or regionally appli-\ncable\u201d).  That language indicates that EPA denials and \ndisapprovals are subject to the same venue analysis that \napplies to \u201cother final action[s]\u201d generally.  Thus, if a \nparticular denial or disapproval is \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d it is subject to review in \u201cthe appropriate \ncircuit.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  But whether a particular \ndisapproval is locally or regionally applicable is for the \nreviewing court to decide.   \nPetitioners argue (State Br. 27) that Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s second prong specifically identifies EPA \n\n29 \n \napprovals of implementation plans as \u201clocally or region-\nally applicable,\u201d and that \u201cit would make little sense to \nthink that disapprovals of the same implementation \nplans should be litigated in a different venue.\u201d  That ar-\ngument ignores Congress\u2019s decision to include plan ap-\nprovals, but not plan disapprovals, in the list of enumer-\nated EPA actions at the beginning of the second prong.  \nIn any event, in listing actions like the \u201capproval or \npromulgation\u201d of an implementation plan, Congress had \nin mind actions that \u201crun only to one air quality control \nregion.\u201d  1970 Senate Report 41.  The second prong\u2019s \nreference to an EPA \u201caction in approving  * * *  any \nimplementation plan,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded), could reasonably be read as limited to the \nagency\u2019s approval of a single plan.  Under that reading, \nan EPA action approving multiple state plans would fall \noutside the enumerated categories, so that venue would \nbe governed by Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s catchalls. \nCiting the ejusdem generis canon, petitioners sug-\ngest (State Br. 25; Industry Br. 31-32) that the disap-\nproval action at issue here cannot fall under the catchall \nphrase \u201cany other nationally applicable  * * *  final ac-\ntion\u201d because the enumerated actions preceding that \nphrase necessarily span the entire country rather than \na subset of States.  But as the statutory context and his-\ntory show, see pp. 19-22, supra, an action need not apply \nto all 50 States to be \u201cnationally applicable.\u201d  And some \nof the enumerated actions referenced in Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong can, and regularly do, apply to \nfewer than 50 States.  For example, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nfirst prong refers to the regulation of fuels under Sec-\ntion 7545, even though certain controls or prohibitions \napply only in nonattainment areas, which are not pre-\n\n30 \n \nsent in every State.  See 42 U.S.C. 7545(h)(1), (h)(6), and \n(k)(1)(A); see also 42 U.S.C. 7545(k)(10)(D). \nAccordingly, courts have deemed various EPA ac-\ntions that applied in fewer than all 50 States, including \nnonattainment designations and calls for state imple-\nmentation plans, to be nationally applicable under Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first prong.  See, e.g., ATK Launch \nSys., 651 F.3d at 1197 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated States\u2019 recommended nonattain-\nment designations and promulgated final designations \nfor 31 areas in 18 States across the country); Browner, \n1998 WL 827315 at *2 (transferring single action in \nwhich EPA evaluated 22 state plans and declared them \ninadequate, requiring revisions); Texas v. EPA, No. 10-\n60961, 2011 WL 710598, at *2 (5th Cir. Feb. 24, 2011) \n(same as to 13 States).  Like those actions, the disap-\nproval action at issue here is nationally applicable on its \nface.  After evaluating submissions from 21 States \nacross the country, EPA ultimately concluded, \u201cbased \non a common core of nationwide policy judgments and \ntechnical analysis,\u201d that each State had failed to ade-\nquately prohibit emissions that will significantly con-\ntribute to downwind nonattainment of the 2015 ozone \nNAAQS.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.   \nB.  The Disapproval Action Is Based On Determinations Of \nNationwide Scope Or Effect \nEven if the Court concludes that EPA\u2019s disapproval \naction should be viewed for venue purposes as 21 dis-\ncrete disapprovals of 21 state plans, and that each such \ndisapproval is \u201clocally or regionally applicable,\u201d EPA\u2019s \naction still is reviewable exclusively in the D.C. Circuit.  \nEPA\u2019s disapproval of each state plan was \u201cbased on a \ndetermination of nationwide scope or effect,\u201d and EPA \npublished a finding to that effect.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).   \n\n31 \n \n1.  The disapproval action at issue here was based on \ndeterminations of nationwide scope or effect \nUnder Section 7607(b)(1), a final action that is \u201clo-\ncally or regionally applicable\u201d is nonetheless reviewable \nonly in the D.C. Circuit if it is \u201cbased on a determination \nof nationwide scope or effect and if in taking such action \nthe Administrator finds and publishes that such action \nis based on such a determination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  \nEPA published the requisite finding, see 88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9380-9381, and that finding was correct.   \na. A \u201cdetermination\u201d is a \u201cdecision arrived at or \npromulgated; a determinate sentence, conclusion, or \nopinion.\u201d  4 The Oxford English Dictionary 548 (2d ed. \n1989) (OED); see Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling and end-\ning of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d; \u201cthe re-\nsolving of a question by argument or reasoning\u201d).  The \ntext of Section 7607(b)(1) distinguishes between the \nagency\u2019s \u201cfinal action\u201d and the relevant underlying \u201cde-\ntermination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  A particular EPA \naction may reflect multiple agency determinations, but \nby referring to \u201ca determination of nationwide scope or \neffect,\u201d Section 7607(b)(1) authorizes D.C. Circuit venue \n(if EPA publishes the requisite finding) so long as any \ndetermination of that kind forms the basis of the action.  \nIbid. (emphasis added).   \nRequiring that the action be \u201c\u200a\u2018based on\u2019\u200a\u201d the rele-\nvant determination ordinarily \u201cindicates a but-for causal \nrelationship and thus a necessary logical condition.\u201d  \nSafeco Ins. Co. of Am. v. Burr, 551 U.S. 47, 63 (2007).  \nEPA\u2019s actions may be\u2014and frequently are\u2014based on \nmultiple determinations, and courts have long accepted \nsuch independent causes as adequate.  See Bostock v. \nClayton County, 590 U.S. 644, 656 (2020) (noting that \n\u201c[o]ften, events have multiple but-for causes\u201d that can \n\n32 \n \nbe sufficient to trigger liability).  Under \u201cthe traditional \nbut-for causation standard,\u201d causation cannot be de-\nfeated \u201cjust by citing some other factor that contributed \nto [the] challenged  * * *  decision.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cSo long as\u201d \nthe relevant determination \u201cwas one but-for cause of \nth[e] decision, that is enough to trigger the law.\u201d  Ibid.  \nThus, under Section 7607(b)(1), the relevant determina-\ntions must \u201clie at the core of the agency action\u201d and can-\nnot be \u201c[m]erely peripheral or extraneous.\u201d  Texas v. \nEPA, 829 F.3d 405, 419 (5th Cir. 2016).   \nSection 7607(b)(1) further provides that venue may \nbe appropriate in the D.C. Circuit when the relevant de-\ntermination has \u201cnationwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (emphasis added).  \u201cScope\u201d means \u201cthe gen-\neral range or extent of cognizance, consideration, activ-\nity, or influence.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 2035; see 14 OED 672 \n(\u201c[R]ange of application or of subjects embraced.\u201d).  \n\u201cEffect\u201d generally means \u201csomething that is produced \nby an agent or cause.\u201d  Webster\u2019s 724; see 5 OED 79 (\u201cTo \nbring about\u201d; \u201cto accomplish\u201d).  When used with respect \nto a statute, \u201ceffect\u201d refers to \u201c[t]he result  * * *  which \na statute will produce upon the existing law.\u201d  Black\u2019s \n461-462.  Applying that definition in the context of \nagency action, the \u201ceffect\u201d of an agency determination \nrefers to the legal consequences that determination \nproduces.  Thus, Section 7607(b)(1) allows for D.C. Cir-\ncuit review when EPA\u2019s final action sets out as a core \njustification a principle or conclusion that is intended to \ngovern the agency\u2019s decisionmaking in actions through-\nout the country, or when a central rationale for EPA\u2019s \nfinal action has legal consequences for entities beyond \na single judicial circuit.   \nUnder the third prong of Section 7607(b)(1), a locally \nor regionally applicable action is reviewable in the D.C. \n\n33 \n \nCircuit only if (a) the action \u201cis based on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds \nand publishes that such action is based on such a deter-\nmination.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  When EPA publishes \nthe specified finding, a person who seeks review of the \npertinent EPA action may argue that the finding is in-\ncorrect and that venue therefore lies in a regional cir-\ncuit.  In such cases, any disputes about the meaning of \nthe phrase \u201cdetermination of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect\u201d will present questions of statutory interpretation \nthat courts must decide de novo.  See Loper Bright En-\nterprises v. Raimondo, 603 U.S. 369, 400 (2024).  But \nEPA\u2019s finding that the statutory standard is satisfied \nwith respect to a particular final action ordinarily will be \ngoverned by the arbitrary-and-capricious standard.  See \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A) (requiring application of arbitrary-\nand-capricious standard to \u201cagency action, findings, and \nconclusions\u201d); cf. 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A) (requiring ap-\nplication of arbitrary-and-capricious standard to partic-\nular EPA actions).  That deferential standard of review \naccounts for the fact that EPA has obvious knowledge \nand expertise with respect to the centrality of the rele-\nvant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s own decisionmaking \nprocess.  See Marsh v. Oregon Natural Resources Coun-\ncil, 490 U.S. 360, 376-377 (1989) (applying arbitrary-and-\ncapricious review to a \u201cfactual dispute\u201d as to whether \n\u201cnew information undermines conclusions\u201d the agency \nreached because such a question \u201cimplicates substantial \nagency expertise\u201d). \nBy contrast, nothing in the statute requires EPA to \n\u201cfind[] and publish[] that [an] action is based on  * * *  a \ndetermination\u201d of nationwide scope or effect, 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1), even when the facts and law would support \nsuch a finding.  Rather, when EPA declines to publish \n\n34 \n \nsuch a finding, that decision \u201cis committed to the agency\u2019s \ndiscretion and thus is unreviewable,\u201d Sierra Club, 47 \nF.4th at 745, and it effectively precludes D.C. Circuit \nvenue under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Thus, for \nany locally or regionally applicable action that is based \non a determination of nationwide scope or effect, Con-\ngress \u201centrusted EPA with discretion to determine the \nproper venue as the agency sees fit.\u201d  Id. at 746; accord \nTexas v. EPA, 983 F.3d 826, 834-835 (5th Cir. 2020).  If \nEPA concludes that a regional circuit is best equipped \nto evaluate a particular agency action\u2014e.g., because \nchallenges are likely to focus on local or regional issues \n\u2014EPA may decline to publish the relevant finding, \nthereby ensuring that the regional circuit will have \nvenue over any challenge to the action. \nb. The disapproval action here was \u201cbased on\u201d at \nleast four \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in scope because they uniformly resolved is-\nsues regarding the appropriate application of the Good \nNeighbor Provision to plans submitted by States in \nmultiple judicial circuits.  The determinations are na-\ntionwide in effect because they produced legal conse-\nquences for States nationwide, affecting their obliga-\ntions as upwind emission sources and downwind emis-\nsion receptors.  And the final action was \u201cbased on\u201d the \ndeterminations because those determinations formed \nthe core of EPA\u2019s disapproval of the state plans.   \nFirst, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \nrely on updated, 2016-based modeling as the \u201cprimary\u201d \nbasis for its \u201cassessment of air quality conditions and \npollution contribution.\u201d  88 Fed. Reg. at 9380.  EPA \nused that modeling of conditions across the country in \nconsidering all of the 21 state plan submissions.  And \n\n35 \n \nthat modeling affected the manner in which responsibil-\nity for achieving compliance with the ozone NAAQS was \nallocated between upwind and downwind States.   \nSecond, EPA determined that it was appropriate to \napply a 1% contribution threshold across all States to \nassess whether a State contributed more than a de min-\nimis amount of ozone pollution downwind.  88 Fed. Reg. \nat 9371; see J.A. 251a-259a.  Although EPA considered \nadopting different thresholds for different States, EPA \nconcluded that a uniform threshold nationwide was \u201ces-\nsential\u201d for interstate ozone transport, which requires \n\u201ca unique degree of concern for consistency, parity, and \nequity across state lines\u201d in order to equitably allocate \nresponsibility for ozone pollution among all States.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9373-9374.   \nThird, EPA determined that the relative contribu-\ntions of other States or countries could not excuse a \nState from analyzing whether its own emissions \u201csignif-\nicantly\u201d contribute to downwind nonattainment.  88 \nFed. Reg. at 9378.  EPA explained that the Good Neigh-\nbor provision requires all States to address their signif-\nicant contributions, and that \u201c[w]hether emissions from \nother states or other countries also contribute\u201d to the \ndownwind air quality issue \u201cis typically not relevant in \nassessing\u201d whether a State is significantly contributing \nto the problem and therefore must curb its emissions.  \nIbid.   \nFourth and finally, EPA determined that, once a \nState is identified as \u201clinked,\u201d the State cannot rely on \nemission-reduction measures that are not actually in-\ncorporated into its state plan.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9376-\n9377.  EPA explained that many States had claimed \nemission-reduction measures that were already ac-\ncounted for in EPA\u2019s modeling.  EPA therefore declined \n\n36 \n \nto \u201cdouble-count[]\u201d those measures by considering them, \nat step three of its analysis, as measures that would \neliminate significant contribution.  Id. at 9377.  EPA \nalso explained that States could not simply point to an-\nticipated upcoming reductions where such measures \nhave not been \u201crendered enforceable\u201d by inclusion \nwithin the state plan itself, because such measures \ncould then be \u201cmodified or amended in ways that would \nundermine the basis for the state\u2019s reliance on them.\u201d  \nId. at 9376.   \nEach of those determinations had nationwide scope, \nas each governed EPA\u2019s assessment of state plan sub-\nmissions across the country.  The determinations also \nhad nationwide effect because an EPA decision con-\ncerning one State\u2019s Good Neighbor plan can affect the \nlegal obligations of other States, particularly those \ndownwind.  Those effects are a consequence of the in-\nterwoven linkages across the country that characterize \ninterstate ozone transport, and of the CAA requirement \nthat every State must come into compliance with the \nNAAQS by the statutory deadline.  See Wisconsin v. \nEPA, 938 F.3d 303, 313 (D.C. Cir. 2019) (per curiam); 42 \nU.S.C. 7511(a)(1); J.A. 268a-272a.  As a result of the \nlinkages, EPA\u2019s assessment of upwind States\u2019 imple-\nmentation plans and the control measures necessary for \nthose States to comply with Good Neighbor obligations \nnecessarily affects the amount of emissions for which \nthe downwind States (and potentially other linked up-\nwind States) will be responsible.   \nFor example, 25.8% of the ozone in Galveston \nCounty, Texas comes from upwind States, with contri-\nbutions above the 1% threshold from Alabama, Arkan-\n\n37 \n \nsas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Oklahoma.6  All five \nlinked States concluded for various reasons that they do \nnot significantly contribute to ozone pollution in Texas.  \nSee 88 Fed. Reg. at 9354-9355, 9357-9359.  If EPA had \napplied the higher threshold that various States advo-\ncated, so that particular upwind States were not re-\nquired to reduce their own emissions, Texas would have \nbeen required to make up the difference necessary to \nattain the NAAQS in Galveston. \nThat example likewise illustrates that EPA\u2019s disap-\nproval action was \u201cbased on\u201d its nationwide determina-\ntions.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regarding \nthe updated modeling data and appropriate threshold \ndrove EPA\u2019s conclusions regarding the linkages among \nall States.  Application of EPA\u2019s determinations regard-\ning relative contributions drove EPA\u2019s conclusions re-\ngarding whether a State had adequately analyzed its \n\u201csignificant contribution.\u201d  And application of EPA\u2019s de-\ntermination regarding relevant emissions-reduction \nmeasures drove EPA\u2019s conclusions as to whether state \nplans must incorporate additional measures to address \nsignificant contributions.  Those determinations were \nessential to EPA\u2019s reasoning in disapproving the state \nplans.   \nThe Sixth Circuit recently concluded that EPA\u2019s de-\ncision to rely on updated modeling and the 1% contribu-\ntion threshold was arbitrary and capricious, and the \ncourt vacated EPA\u2019s disapproval of Kentucky\u2019s plan on \nthat basis.  Kentucky v. EPA, 123 F.4th 447, 473 (2024); \nsee id. at 467-471.  Although the Sixth Circuit rejected \nthe government\u2019s argument that venue for the chal-\nlenge lay in the D.C. Circuit, see id. at 457-467, the \n \n6 See EPA, Air Quality Modeling Technical Support Document: \n2015 Ozone NAAQS C-2-C-3, D-2, https://perma.cc/Z955-CHD7.   \n\n38 \n \ncourt\u2019s merits analysis logically implies that the chal-\nlenged disapproval action is \u201cbased on\u201d the nationwide \ndeterminations.  If (as the Sixth Circuit held) judicial \ninvalidation of the relevant determinations provided a \nsufficient basis for finding the final action itself to be \n\u201carbitrary, capricious, an abuse of discretion, or other-\nwise not in accordance with law,\u201d 42 U.S.C. 7607(d)(9)(A); \n5 U.S.C. 706(2)(A), then the determinations are properly \nviewed as a \u201cnecessary logical condition\u201d of the action, \nSafeco, 551 U.S. at 63, and the requisite causal relation-\nship exists.7   \nc. The statutory history confirms that Congress in-\ntended for final actions like the one at issue here to be \nreviewable in the D.C. Circuit.   \nBefore Congress amended the venue provision to au-\nthorize D.C. Circuit review of locally or regionally ap-\nplicable actions with nationwide scope or effect, the \n1970 statute made the approval or promulgation of state \nor federal plans reviewable in \u201cthe appropriate circuit.\u201d  \n42 U.S.C. 1857h-5(b)(1) (1970).  Disputes concerning \nthat language spawned protracted litigation.  See David \nP. Currie, Judicial Review Under Federal Pollution \nLaws, 62 Iowa L. Rev. 1221, 1262-1269 (1977).  Parties \nfaced a lack of clarity as to which circuit was \u201cthe ap-\npropriate circuit\u201d when a petitioner challenged a final \naction pertaining to state implementation plans submit-\n \n7 EPA argued in Kentucky that the possible invalidity of particu-\nlar agency determinations would be \u201charmless\u201d because the agency \nwould have disapproved Kentucky\u2019s plan even without those deter-\nminations.  See Kentucky, 123 F.4th at 471.  The Sixth Circuit re-\njected that argument.  See id. at 471-472.  In any event, other na-\ntionwide EPA determinations described above (see pp. 34-36, su-\npra), and the four specified nationwide determinations taken to-\ngether, indisputably were a but-for cause of EPA\u2019s decision to dis-\napprove the 21 state plans. \n\n39 \n \nted by multiple States spanning multiple judicial cir-\ncuits.  Id. at 1264.   \nIn light of that uncertainty, one petitioner filed iden-\ntical petitions in ten regional circuits, with an eleventh \nin the D.C. Circuit, and then asked each of the regional \ncircuits to transfer the case to the D.C. Circuit for res-\nolution.  Currie 1263.  Five courts of appeals agreed to \ndo so, while the other five stayed proceedings pending \nthe disposition of the D.C. Circuit case.  Ibid.  Each of \nthe petitions challenged an EPA action that had ap-\nproved or disapproved (in whole or in part) numerous \nstate implementation plans, based on the agency\u2019s de-\nterminations that the plan submission and attainment \ndeadlines for certain pollutants should be extended, giv-\ning States more time to adopt the necessary control \nmeasures.  See Natural Resources Defense Council v. \nEPA, 475 F.2d 968, 969-970 (D.C. Cir. 1973) (per cu-\nriam); 37 Fed. Reg. 10,842 (May 31, 1972). \nIn an opinion approving a transfer and finding the \nD.C. Circuit to be \u201cthe appropriate circuit,\u201d the First \nCircuit explained that \u201c[t]he legal issues raised by peti-\ntioners in the\u201d various pending cases \u201cseem[ed] to be \nidentical,\u201d and that \u201clitigation in several circuits, with \npossible inconsistent and delayed results on the merits, \ncan only serve to frustrate the strong Congressional in-\nterest in improving the environment.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council v. EPA, 465 F.2d 492, 495 \n(1972) (per curiam).  The D.C. Circuit agreed, explain-\ning that \u201c[n]one of the[] issues\u201d raised by the petitions \n\u201cinvolve facts or laws peculiar to any one jurisdiction; \nrather, all concern uniform determinations of nation-\nwide effect made by the Administrator.\u201d  Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council, 475 F.2d at 970.   \n\n40 \n \nIn 1976, the Administrative Conference of the United \nStates (ACUS) drafted recommendations for amending \nand clarifying the CAA venue provision.  41 Fed. Reg. \nat 56,767.  ACUS urged Congress to \u201cclarify[] that the \nappropriate circuit is the one containing the state whose \nplan is challenged.\u201d  Ibid.  EPA General Counsel G. Wil-\nliam Frick provided additional views, however, and \ncounseled that \u201cwhere \u2018national issues\u2019 are involved \nthey should be reviewed in the D.C. Circuit.\u201d  Id. at \n56,768.  Frick noted that, although EPA actions involv-\ning state implementation plans \u201cusually involve issues \npeculiar to the affected States, such actions sometimes \ninvolve generic determinations of nationwide scope or \neffect.\u201d  Id. at 56,768-56,769.  In Frick\u2019s view, \u201cCongress \nintended review in the D.C. Circuit of \u2018matters on which \nnational uniformity is desirable\u2019\u200a\u201d because of \u201cthe D.C. \nCircuit\u2019s obvious expertise in administrative law mat-\nters\u201d and its familiarity with the CAA\u2019s \u201ccomplex\u201d text \nand history.  Id. at 56,769.  Citing the Natural Re-\nsources Defense Council cases as illustrative, Frick ex-\nplained that it \u201cmakes sense to centralize review of \u2018na-\ntional\u2019 [state implementation plan] issues in the D.C. \nCircuit, taking advantage of its administrative law ex-\npertise and facilitating an orderly development of the \nbasic law under the Act, rather than to have such issues \ndecided separately by a number of courts.\u201d  Ibid. \nBy authorizing D.C. Circuit review of final EPA ac-\ntions that are based on \u201cdetermination[s] of nationwide \nscope or effect,\u201d the 1977 amendments incorporated \nFrick\u2019s own language.  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1); see 41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,768-56,769.  The House Report that accompa-\nnied the 1977 amendments \u201cconcur[red]\u201d with Frick\u2019s \n\u201ccomments, concerns, and recommendation.\u201d  1977 House \nReport 324.  That history reflects Congress\u2019s awareness \n\n41 \n \nthat, even when a particular EPA action specifically ad-\ndresses an individual State\u2014including by assessing its \nimplementation plan\u2014judicial review of the action may \nimplicate national concerns.  After considering the com-\npeting viewpoints expressed by ACUS and Frick as to \nthe proper means of resolving those national issues, \nCongress opted to authorize uniform resolution by \nproviding a mechanism for exclusive D.C. Circuit re-\nview.  \n2.  Petitioners\u2019 contrary reasoning would render the \u201cna-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d prong of Section 7607(b)(1) \npractically insignificant \nIn arguing that EPA did not make any determina-\ntions of nationwide scope or effect, petitioners attempt \nto limit the relevant \u201cdetermination\u201d to the agency\u2019s ul-\ntimate decision.  Petitioners further focus on the State-\nspecific circumstances that EPA also considered in the \ncourse of assessing the various implementation plans.  \nPetitioners\u2019 approach is inconsistent with the statutory \ntext and would severely undercut the intended reach of \nSection 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong.  Under the correct in-\nterpretation of the statute, that prong has both mean-\ningful reach and meaningful limits, each designed to \nfurther Congress\u2019s purpose of channeling to the D.C. \nCircuit those challenges that are likely to raise issues of \nnational importance.   \na. Petitioners contend that, for an EPA action to \nqualify for D.C. Circuit review under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong, the relevant nationwide \u201cdetermination\u201d \nmust be the \u201c\u200a\u2018ultimate decision\u2019\u200a\u201d of the final action, such \nthat the court should ask whether the \u201c\u200a\u2018final action\u2019 has \na \u2018nationwide scope or effect.\u2019\u200a\u201d   State Br. 41 (citations \nomitted); see Industry Br. 47-49.  That argument would \neliminate the statute\u2019s distinction between the final \u201cac-\n\n42 \n \ntion\u201d and the relevant \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it would ul-\ntimately render Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong mean-\ningless.   \nIn applying the first two prongs of Section 7607(b)(1), \nthe Court must consider whether EPA\u2019s disapproval ac-\ntion itself is nationally applicable or instead is locally or \nregionally applicable.  Application of the third prong, by \ncontrast, does not turn on the nature of EPA\u2019s ultimate \naction disapproving the various state plans.  Rather, the \nthird prong potentially applies only if the Court finds \nthe disapproval action itself to be \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable,\u201d and that prong\u2019s applicability depends on \nEPA\u2019s stated reasons for disapproving the state plans.  \nThe methodological determinations identified above \ngoverned EPA\u2019s analysis of state implementation plans \nacross the country and ultimately affected the legal ob-\nligations of upwind and downwind States nationally.  \nSee pp. 34-37, supra.  And because EPA applied those \ndeterminations to each of the 21 state plan submissions, \nEPA\u2019s finding that the disapproval was based on deter-\nminations of nationwide scope or effect remains valid, \nwhether the relevant agency action is viewed as the sin-\ngle combined disapproval action or instead as 21 State-\nspecific disapprovals.  Contra Industry Br. 49-51.   \nThe history of Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong fur-\nther supports an interpretation that distinguishes be-\ntween EPA\u2019s final \u201caction\u201d and the agency\u2019s underlying \n\u201cdetermination[s].\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  In amending \nthe venue provision to incorporate that prong, Congress \nadopted the recommendation of EPA\u2019s then-General \nCounsel Frick.  Frick cited the Natural Resources De-\nfense Council litigation, in which EPA had acted on var-\nious state plans while granting \u201ctwo-year extensions of \nthe date for attainment of national ambient air quality \n\n43 \n \nstandards in a number of metropolitan areas.\u201d  41 Fed. \nReg. at 56,769.  There, the relevant determinations of \nnationwide scope or effect were EPA\u2019s decisions to ex-\ntend compliance deadlines, not the agency\u2019s ultimate \napproval or disapproval of the various state plans.  See \npp. 38-40, supra.   \nPetitioners\u2019 conflation of the relevant \u201cdetermina-\ntion\u201d and the final action would also drain Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong of any practical significance.  \nAs explained, that prong potentially applies only to \nEPA actions that are locally or regionally applicable, ra-\nther than nationally applicable.  But if the relevant de-\ntermination were essentially equivalent to the final ac-\ntion, it is difficult to imagine an action that would not be \nnationally applicable under Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s first \nprong, but that would qualify as nationwide in scope or \neffect.  Petitioners argue (State Br. 39, 41; Industry Br. \n46-47) that Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong should be \nread narrowly because it establishes an exception to a \ngeneral rule of regional-circuit review of locally or re-\ngionally applicable actions.  But \u201cthis Court has made \nclear that statutory exceptions are to be read fairly, not \nnarrowly, for they \u2018are no less part of Congress\u2019s work \nthan its rules and standards\u2014and all are worthy of a \ncourt\u2019s respect.\u2019\u200a\u201d  HollyFrontier Cheyenne Ref., LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382, 395-396 (2021) (ci-\ntation omitted). \nFairly read, the plain text of the third prong does not \nlimit the relevant determination to the \u201cultimate dispo-\nsition\u201d or otherwise equate it to the final action under \nreview.  Rather, the statute distinguishes between the \nchallenged EPA action itself and the agency\u2019s stated \nreasons for taking that action.  The third prong reflects \nCongress\u2019s recognition that centralized review of EPA\u2019s \n\n44 \n \nnationwide legal or policy judgments may be appropri-\nate even when such judgments are challenged in a peti-\ntion for review of a local agency action.  To the extent \nthe Court views the disapproval action as locally or re-\ngionally applicable, that principle is directly implicated \nhere.   \nb. Petitioners assert (State Br. 47-51; Industry Br. \n51-54) that the disapproval action falls outside Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong because the States\u2019 plan sub-\nmissions and EPA\u2019s analysis had State-specific aspects.  \nBut the State-specific analyses petitioners highlight \nlargely reflect the application of the nationwide deter-\nminations to each State\u2019s circumstances.  For example, \npetitioners note (State Br. 48; Industry Br. 51) Utah\u2019s \nargument during the administrative proceedings that it \nneed not reduce its contributions to Colorado-based re-\nceptors because its contribution was minimal in compar-\nison to those of other emissions sources.  But EPA re-\njected that argument\u2014made by numerous other States \n\u2014based on EPA\u2019s nationwide determination that the \nrelative magnitude of contributions from other sources \ndoes not relieve States of their Good Neighbor obliga-\ntions.  88 Fed. Reg. at 9378-9379.  Similarly, petitioners \nemphasize (State Br. 47; Industry Br. 52) Oklahoma\u2019s \nargument that existing emission-reduction measures \nwere sufficient to meet its Good Neighbor obligations.  \nBut again, many other States made the same argument, \nand EPA concluded that no linked State could meet its \nGood Neighbor obligations simply by relying on exist-\ning control measures or anticipated reductions that are \nnot incorporated into enforceable state plans.  See 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9343, 9377.   \nIn treating EPA\u2019s need to consider State-specific cir-\ncumstances as controlling the venue inquiry, petitioners \n\n45 \n \nwould effectively limit D.C. Circuit venue under Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s third prong to review of EPA actions that \nare based solely on determinations of nationwide scope \nor effect.  Nothing in the statutory text supports that \napproach.  Where Congress intended to require such a \nlimitation, it said so explicitly.  See, e.g., 42 U.S.C. \n7607(b)(1) (providing an exception to the statute\u2019s 60-\nday filing window where the \u201cpetition is based solely on \ngrounds arising after\u201d that time period expires) (em-\nphasis added); cf. Bostock, 590 U.S. at 656 (\u201cAs it has in \nother statutes, [Congress] could have added \u2018solely\u2019 to \nindicate that actions taken \u2018because of\u200a\u2019 the confluence \nof multiple factors do not violate the law.\u201d) (citation \nomitted).   \nOnce again, petitioners\u2019 approach would render the \n\u201cnationwide scope or effect\u201d prong practically insignifi-\ncant and is inconsistent with the statutory history.  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  By its terms, Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s \nthird prong applies only to actions that are \u201clocally or \nregionally applicable.\u201d  Ibid.  Nearly all such actions can \nbe expected to rest at least in part on consideration of \nlocal or regional circumstances.  Yet on petitioners\u2019 \nview, EPA\u2019s consideration of such circumstances is suf-\nficient to preclude D.C. Circuit review.  And as ex-\nplained above (see pp. 38-41, supra), Congress enacted \nSection 7607(b)(1) in its current form after then- \nGeneral Counsel Frick specifically highlighted the fact \nthat EPA\u2019s approval of plans for individual States\u2014\nwhich necessarily rest at least in part on State-specific \ncircumstances\u2014can also raise issues of national signifi-\ncance for which D.C. Circuit review is appropriate.  See \n41 Fed. Reg. at 56,769.  Petitioners\u2019 interpretation thus \ncontravenes Congress\u2019s purpose of centralizing review \nof national issues in the D.C. Circuit and prioritizing ef-\n\n46 \n \nficient resolution of those issues, even when the actions \nalso address local or regional concerns.   \nc. Petitioners contend (State Br. 54; Industry Br. \n55) that adopting EPA\u2019s interpretation would allow \nD.C. Circuit venue for challenges to every locally or re-\ngionally applicable EPA action.  That is incorrect.  The \nstatutory text includes significant limitations that pre-\nvent that result.   \ni. As an initial matter, the relevant language in Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) imposes a causation requirement, au-\nthorizing D.C. Circuit venue only when the challenged \nagency action is \u201cbased on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect.\u201d  42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) (emphasis \nadded).  See pp. 31-32, supra.  EPA\u2019s finding that such \na standard is satisfied is subject to arbitrary-and- \ncapricious review.  See p. 33, supra.  That causation re-\nquirement ensures that D.C. Circuit review will be \navailable only if the relevant determinations are at the \ncore of EPA\u2019s action.  For the reasons already explained, \nibid., that causation requirement is satisfied here\u2014but \nit will not be satisfied for every EPA action. \nii. The word \u201cdetermination\u201d suggests a resolution \nof an unsettled issue.  See Webster\u2019s 616 (\u201cthe settling \nand ending of a controversy esp. by judicial decision\u201d).  \nOn that understanding, EPA does not make a \u201cdetermi-\nnation of nationwide scope\u201d when it merely applies a \npreviously established agency rule, policy, or interpre-\ntation to new \u201clocally or regionally applicable\u201d circum-\nstances.  In deciding whether an EPA rule or policy con-\nstitutes a \u201cdetermination\u201d when the agency applies it in \ntaking a new action, the court may consider whether \nEPA announced the rule or policy at roughly the same \ntime as the challenged agency action itself.  The court \nmay also consider whether the participants in any  \n\n47 \n \nnotice-and-comment period or comparable agency pro-\nceeding leading up to the challenged action contested \nthe validity of the rule or policy. \nThat approach reflects a textually reasonable under-\nstanding of the statutory term \u201cdetermination,\u201d and it \nwould further the congressional policy judgments  \nreflected in the second and third prongs of Section \n7607(b)(1).  The vast majority of \u201clocally or regionally \napplicable\u201d EPA actions reflect the application of some \nnationwide agency rule, policy, or interpretation to a \nfactual setting that is confined to a single judicial cir-\ncuit.  When the circumstances suggest that the nation-\nwide rule, policy, or interpretation itself is likely to be \ncalled into question in any judicial challenge to the EPA \naction, routing such challenges to the D.C. Circuit \nserves important interests in judicial efficiency and na-\ntionwide uniformity.  That is particularly so if the rele-\nvant EPA determination is intended to govern future \nagency actions across the country.  But where the valid-\nity of the general rule or policy appears to be settled, \nsuch that any judicial challenges to the action are likely \nto focus on the application of the general pronounce-\nment to discrete local facts, those interests are inappo-\nsite. \nHere, EPA made each of the relevant determinations \nin the disapproval action itself, after considering com-\nments disputing their validity.  See 88 Fed. Reg. at \n9365-9367, 9370-9375, 9376-9378.  While the determina-\ntions may be consistent with EPA\u2019s prior implementa-\ntion of other NAAQS, EPA did not simply apply exist-\ning rules or standards; rather, its determinations re-\nsolved controversies over specific methodological issues \nthat were vigorously contested.  EPA\u2019s conclusions sup-\nporting the disapproval action therefore are properly \n\n48 \n \nviewed as \u201cdetermination[s]\u201d within the meaning of Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1).   \niii. As explained above, a locally or regionally appli-\ncable EPA action is reviewable in the D.C. Circuit only \nif (a) the action \u201cis based on a determination of nation-\nwide scope or effect\u201d and (b) EPA \u201cfinds and publishes \nthat such action is based on such a determination.\u201d  42 \nU.S.C. 7607(b)(1).  Even when the facts and law would \nsupport the specified finding, EPA has plenary discre-\ntion to decide whether to publish that finding, and the \nagency \u201cmay weigh any number of considerations\u201d in \nmaking that decision.  Sierra Club, 47 F.4th at 746; see \npp. 33-34, supra.  For example, EPA may consider \nwhether any petitions for review of a particular action \nwould likely contest EPA determinations of national \nconcern, or instead would likely dispute EPA\u2019s under-\nstanding of local or regional circumstances.  For EPA \nactions in the latter category, the agency may decline to \npublish the relevant finding, thereby ensuring that the \nregional circuit will have venue over any challenge to \nthe action.   \nd. The limitations described above meaningfully \nconstrain the number of locally or regionally applicable \nactions that are subject to D.C. Circuit review, while al-\nlowing efficient and uniform resolution of disputed is-\nsues of national significance.  By contrast, petitioners\u2019 \ninterpretation would limit D.C. Circuit review of locally \nor regionally applicable EPA actions to a vanishingly \nsmall category.  Embracing petitioners\u2019 interpretation \nwould lead to the very problems Congress sought to \navoid in amending the CAA\u2019s venue provision to include \nthe nationwide-scope-or-effect language.   \nThis case is illustrative.  Because multiple circuits \nhave declined to transfer challenges to the D.C. Circuit, \n\n49 \n \nEPA has been litigating substantially similar challenges \nto the disapproval action in eight courts of appeals.  Ra-\nther than focusing their challenges on State-specific \nfindings that contributed to EPA\u2019s disapproval of par-\nticular state plans, the petitioners in all of those cases \nhave primarily contested the legality of the same core \ndeterminations that EPA adopted and applied nation-\nwide.   \nConsideration of the same basic legal challenges by \nmultiple circuits wastes judicial resources and creates a \nsubstantial risk of inconsistent merits rulings.  Such \nrulings would produce a fragmented Good Neighbor \nprogram for ozone, subjecting similarly situated States \nto different regulatory burdens based on the circuits in \nwhich those States are located, and complicating EPA\u2019s \nconsideration of the \u201coverlapping and interwoven link-\nages between upwind and downwind States\u201d that char-\nacterize the ozone problem.  EPA v. EME Homer City \nGeneration, L. P., 572 U.S. 489, 496-497 (2014).  Such a \nresult is contrary to the principles animating the Good \nNeighbor Provision, and to Section 7607(b)(1)\u2019s purpose \nof ensuring efficient, uniform resolution of issues with \nnational significance.  If this Court endorses petition-\ners\u2019 venue analysis, future EPA actions similar to the \ndisapproval action here can be expected to spawn litiga-\ntion in numerous courts of appeals, with a consequent \nwaste of judicial resources and a heightened risk of in-\nconsistent outcomes.  Nothing in the statutory text re-\nquires that result, and the Court should reject it. \n \n \n\n50 \n \nCONCLUSION \nThe order of the court of appeals should be affirmed.   \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nDIMPLE CHAUDHARY \nActing General Counsel \nSUSANNAH WEAVER \nDeputy General Counsel \nGAUTAM SRINIVASAN \nAssociate General Counsel \nMATTHEW MARKS \nDeputy Associate General \nCounsel \nJEANHEE HONG \nROSEMARY H.

Air \nquality criteria for an air pollutant shall accurately re-\nflect the latest scientific knowledge useful in indicating \nthe kind and extent of all identifiable effects on public \nhealth or welfare which may be expected from the pres-\nence of such pollutant in the ambient air, in varying \nquantities.  The criteria for an air pollutant, to the ex-\ntent practicable, shall include information on\u2014 \n\n2a \n \n \n(A) \nthose variable factors (including atmos-\npheric conditions) which of themselves or in combina-\ntion with other factors may alter the effects on public \nhealth or welfare of such air pollutant; \n \n(B) \nthe types of air pollutants which, when pre-\nsent in the atmosphere, may interact with such pollu-\ntant to produce an adverse effect on public health or \nwelfare; and \n \n(C) \nany known or anticipated adverse effects on \nwelfare. \n(b) \nIssuance by Administrator of information on air pol-\nlution control techniques; standing consulting com-\nmittees for air pollutants; establishment; member-\nship \n(1) Simultaneously with the issuance of criteria un-\nder subsection (a), the Administrator shall, after consul-\ntation with appropriate advisory committees and Fed-\neral departments and agencies, issue to the States and \nappropriate air pollution control agencies information \non air pollution control techniques, which information \nshall include data relating to the cost of installation and \noperation, energy requirements, emission reduction \nbenefits, and environmental impact of the emission con-\ntrol technology.  Such information shall include such \ndata as are available on available technology and alter-\nnative methods of prevention and control of air pollu-\ntion.  Such information shall also include data on alter-\nnative fuels, processes, and operating methods which \nwill result in elimination or significant reduction of emis-\nsions. \n(2) In order to assist in the development of infor-\nmation on pollution control techniques, the Administra-\n\n3a \n \ntor may establish a standing consulting committee for \neach air pollutant included in a list published pursuant \nto subsection (a)(1), which shall be comprised of techni-\ncally qualified individuals representative of State and lo-\ncal governments, industry, and the academic commu-\nnity.  Each such committee shall submit, as appropri-\nate, to the Administrator information related to that re-\nquired by paragraph (1). \n(c) \nReview, modification, and reissuance of criteria or \ninformation \nThe Administrator shall from time to time review, \nand, as appropriate, modify, and reissue any criteria or \ninformation on control techniques issued pursuant to \nthis section.  Not later than six months after August 7, \n1977, the Administrator shall revise and reissue criteria \nrelating to concentrations of NO2 over such period (not \nmore than three hours) as he deems appropriate.  Such \ncriteria shall include a discussion of nitric and nitrous \nacids, nitrites, nitrates, nitrosamines, and other carcino-\ngenic and potentially carcinogenic derivatives of oxides \nof nitrogen. \n(d) \nPublication in Federal Register; availability of cop-\nies for general public \nThe issuance of air quality criteria and information \non air pollution control techniques shall be announced in \nthe Federal Register and copies shall be made available \nto the general public. \n(e) \nTransportation planning and guidelines \nThe Administrator shall, after consultation with the \nSecretary of Transportation, and after providing public \nnotice and opportunity for comment, and with State and \nlocal officials, within nine months after November 15, \n\n4a \n \n1990,1 and periodically thereafter as necessary to main-\ntain a continuous transportation-air quality planning \nprocess, update the June 1978 Transportation-Air Qual-\nity Planning Guidelines and publish guidance on the de-\nvelopment and implementation of transportation and \nother measures necessary to demonstrate and maintain \nattainment of national ambient air quality standards.  \nSuch guidelines shall include information on\u2014 \n \n(1) \nmethods to identify and evaluate alternative \nplanning and control activities; \n \n(2) \nmethods of reviewing plans on a regular ba-\nsis as conditions change or new information is pre-\nsented; \n \n(3) \nidentification of funds and other resources \nnecessary to implement the plan, including inter-\nagency agreements on providing such funds and re-\nsources; \n \n(4) \nmethods to assure participation by the pub-\nlic in all phases of the planning process; and \n \n(5) \nsuch other methods as the Administrator \ndetermines necessary to carry out a continuous plan-\nning process. \n(f\u200a) \nInformation regarding processes, procedures, and \nmethods to reduce or control pollutants in transpor-\ntation; reduction of mobile source related pollu-\ntants; reduction of impact on public health \n(1) The Administrator shall publish and make avail-\nable to appropriate Federal, State, and local environ-\nmental and transportation agencies not later than one \n \n1  See Codification note below. \n\n5a \n \nyear after November 15, 1990, and from time to time \nthereafter\u2014 \n \n(A) \ninformation prepared, as appropriate, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Transportation, \nand after providing public notice and opportunity for \ncomment, regarding the formulation and emission re-\nduction potential of transportation control measures \nrelated to criteria pollutants and their precursors, in-\ncluding, but not limited to\u2014 \n \n \n(i) \nprograms for improved public transit; \n \n(ii) \nrestriction of certain roads or lanes to, or \nconstruction of such roads or lanes for use by, pas-\nsenger buses or high occupancy vehicles; \n \n(iii) employer-based transportation manage-\nment plans, including incentives; \n \n(iv) trip-reduction ordinances; \n \n(v) \ntraffic flow improvement programs that \nachieve emission reductions; \n \n(vi) fringe and transportation corridor park-\ning facilities serving multiple occupancy vehicle \nprograms or transit service; \n \n(vii) programs to limit or restrict vehicle use \nin downtown areas or other areas of emission con-\ncentration particularly during periods of peak use; \n \n(viii) programs for the provision of all forms of \nhigh-occupancy, shared-ride services; \n \n(ix) programs to limit portions of road sur-\nfaces or certain sections of the metropolitan area \nto the use of non-motorized vehicles or pedestrian \nuse, both as to time and place; \n\n6a \n \n \n(x) \nprograms for secure bicycle storage facil-\nities and other facilities, including bicycle lanes, \nfor the convenience and protection of bicyclists, in \nboth public and private areas; \n \n(xi) programs to control extended idling of ve-\nhicles; \n \n(xii) programs to reduce motor vehicle emis-\nsions, consistent with subchapter II, which are \ncaused by extreme cold start conditions; \n \n(xiii) employer-sponsored programs to permit \nflexible work schedules; \n \n(xiv) programs and ordinances to facilitate \nnon-automobile travel, provision and utilization of \nmass transit, and to generally reduce the need for \nsingle-occupant vehicle travel, as part of transpor-\ntation planning and development efforts of a local-\nity, including programs and ordinances applicable \nto new shopping centers, special events, and other \ncenters of vehicle activity; \n \n(xv) programs for new construction and major \nreconstructions of paths, tracks or areas solely for \nthe use by pedestrian or other non-motorized \nmeans of transportation when economically feasi-\nble and in the public interest.

The Administrator may disapprove such sus-\npension if he determines that it does not meet the re-\nquirements of paragraph (2). \n(4) This subsection shall not apply in the case of a \nplan provision or requirement promulgated by the Ad-\nministrator under subsection (c) of this section, but in \nany such case the President may grant a temporary emer-\ngency suspension for a four month period of any such \nprovision or requirement if he makes the determinations \nand findings specified in paragraphs (1) and (2). \n(5) The Governor may include in any temporary \nemergency suspension issued under this subsection a \nprovision delaying for a period identical to the period of \nsuch suspension any compliance schedule (or increment \nof progress) to which such source is subject under sec-\ntion 1857c-102 of this title, as in effect before August 7, \n1977, or section 7413(d)2 of this title, upon a finding that \nsuch source is unable to comply with such schedule (or \nincrement) solely because of the conditions on the basis \nof which a suspension was issued under this subsection. \n(g) \nGovernor\u2019s authority to issue temporary emergency \nsuspensions \n(1) In the case of any State which has adopted and \nsubmitted to the Administrator a proposed plan revision \nwhich the State determines\u2014 \n \n(A) \nmeets the requirements of this section, and \n \n(B) \nis necessary (i) to prevent the closing for one \nyear or more of any source of air pollution, and (ii) to \n\n26a \n \nprevent substantial increases in unemployment which \nwould result from such closing, and \nwhich the Administrator has not approved or disap-\nproved under this section within 12 months of submis-\nsion of the proposed plan revision, the Governor may is-\nsue a temporary emergency suspension of the part of \nthe applicable implementation plan for such State which \nis proposed to be revised with respect to such source.  \nThe determination under subparagraph (B) may not be \nmade with respect to a source which would close without \nregard to whether or not the proposed plan revision is \napproved. \n(2) A temporary emergency suspension issued by a \nGovernor under this subsection shall remain in effect for \na maximum of four months or such lesser period as may \nbe specified in a disapproval order of the Administrator.  \nThe Administrator may disapprove such suspension if \nhe determines that it does not meet the requirements of \nthis subsection. \n(3) The Governor may include in any temporary \nemergency suspension issued under this subsection a \nprovision delaying for a period identical to the period of \nsuch suspension any compliance schedule (or increment \nof progress) to which such source is subject under sec-\ntion 1857c-1033of this title as in effect before August 7, \n1977, or under section 7413(d)3 of this title upon a find-\ning that such source is unable to comply with such sched-\nule (or increment) solely because of the conditions on the \nbasis of which a suspension was issued under this sub-\nsection. \n \n3  See References in Text note below. \n\n27a \n \n(h) Publication of comprehensive document for each \nState setting forth requirements of applicable im-\nplementation plan \n(1) Not later than 5 years after November 15, 1990, \nand every 3 years thereafter, the Administrator shall as-\nsemble and publish a comprehensive document for each \nState setting forth all requirements of the applicable im-\nplementation plan for such State and shall publish notice \nin the Federal Register of the availability of such docu-\nments. \n(2) The Administrator may promulgate such regula-\ntions as may be reasonably necessary to carry out the \npurpose of this subsection. \n(i) \nModification of requirements prohibited \nExcept for a primary nonferrous smelter order un-\nder section 7419 of this title, a suspension under subsec-\ntion (f\u200a) or (g) (relating to emergency suspensions), an \nexemption under section 7418 of this title (relating to \ncertain Federal facilities), an order under section \n7413(d)3 of this title (relating to compliance orders), a \nplan promulgation under subsection (c), or a plan revi-\nsion under subsection (a)(3); no order, suspension, plan \nrevision, or other action modifying any requirement of \nan applicable implementation plan may be taken with re-\nspect to any stationary source by the State or by the Ad-\nministrator. \n(\u200aj) \nTechnological systems of continuous emission re-\nduction on new or modified stationary sources; com-\npliance with performance standards \nAs a condition for issuance of any permit required un-\nder this subchapter, the owner or operator of each new \nor modified stationary source which is required to obtain \n\n28a \n \nsuch a permit must show to the satisfaction of the per-\nmitting authority that the technological system of con-\ntinuous emission reduction which is to be used at such \nsource will enable it to comply with the standards of per-\nformance which are to apply to such source and that the \nconstruction or modification and operation of such \nsource will be in compliance with all other requirements \nof this chapter. \n(k) Environmental Protection Agency action on plan \nsubmissions \n(1) Completeness of plan submissions \n \n(A) \nCompleteness criteria \n \nWithin 9 months after November 15, 1990, the \nAdministrator shall promulgate minimum criteria \nthat any plan submission must meet before the \nAdministrator is required to act on such submis-\nsion under this subsection.  The criteria shall be \nlimited to the information necessary to enable the \nAdministrator to determine whether the plan sub-\nmission complies with the provisions of this chap-\nter. \n \n(B) \nCompleteness finding \n \nWithin 60 days of the Administrator\u2019s receipt \nof a plan or plan revision, but no later than 6 \nmonths after the date, if any, by which a State is \nrequired to submit the plan or revision, the Ad-\nministrator shall determine whether the minimum \ncriteria established pursuant to subparagraph (A) \nhave been met.  Any plan or plan revision that a \nState submits to the Administrator, and that has \nnot been determined by the Administrator (by the \ndate 6 months after receipt of the submission) to \n\n29a \n \nhave failed to meet the minimum criteria estab-\nlished pursuant to subparagraph (A), shall on that \ndate be deemed by operation of law to meet such \nminimum criteria. \n \n(C) \nEffect of finding of incompleteness \n \nWhere the Administrator determines that a \nplan submission (or part thereof\u200a) does not meet \nthe minimum criteria established pursuant to sub-\nparagraph (A), the State shall be treated as not \nhaving made the submission (or, in the Adminis-\ntrator\u2019s discretion, part thereof\u200a). \n(2) Deadline for action \n \nWithin 12 months of a determination by the Ad-\nministrator (or a determination deemed by operation \nof law) under paragraph (1) that a State has submit-\nted a plan or plan revision (or, in the Administrator\u2019s \ndiscretion, part thereof\u200a) that meets the minimum cri-\nteria established pursuant to paragraph (1), if appli-\ncable (or, if those criteria are not applicable, within \n12 months of submission of the plan or revision), the \nAdministrator shall act on the submission in accord-\nance with paragraph (3). \n(3) Full and partial approval and disapproval \n \nIn the case of any submittal on which the Admin-\nistrator is required to act under paragraph (2), the \nAdministrator shall approve such submittal as a \nwhole if it meets all of the applicable requirements of \nthis chapter.  If a portion of the plan revision meets \nall the applicable requirements of this chapter, the \nAdministrator may approve the plan revision in part \nand disapprove the plan revision in part.  The plan \nrevision shall not be treated as meeting the require-\n\n30a \n \nments of this chapter until the Administrator ap-\nproves the entire plan revision as complying with the \napplicable requirements of this chapter. \n(4) Conditional approval \n \nThe Administrator may approve a plan revision \nbased on a commitment of the State to adopt specific \nenforceable measures by a date certain, but not later \nthan 1 year after the date of approval of the plan re-\nvision.  Any such conditional approval shall be \ntreated as a disapproval if the State fails to comply \nwith such commitment. \n(5) Calls for plan revisions \n \nWhenever the Administrator finds that the appli-\ncable implementation plan for any area is substan-\ntially inadequate to attain or maintain the relevant \nnational ambient air quality standard, to mitigate ad-\nequately the interstate pollutant transport described \nin section 7506a of this title or section 7511c of this \ntitle, or to otherwise comply with any requirement of \nthis chapter, the Administrator shall require the \nState to revise the plan as necessary to correct such \ninadequacies.  The Administrator shall notify the \nState of the inadequacies, and may establish reason-\nable deadlines (not to exceed 18 months after the date \nof such notice) for the submission of such plan revi-\nsions.  Such findings and notice shall be public.  \nAny finding under this paragraph shall, to the extent \nthe Administrator deems appropriate, subject the \nState to the requirements of this chapter to which the \nState was subject when it developed and submitted \nthe plan for which such finding was made, except that \nthe Administrator may adjust any dates applicable \n\n31a \n \nunder such requirements as appropriate (except that \nthe Administrator may not adjust any attainment \ndate prescribed under part D, unless such date has \nelapsed). \n(6) Corrections \n \nWhenever the Administrator determines that  \nthe Administrator\u2019s action approving, disapproving, \nor promulgating any plan or plan revision (or part \nthereof\u200a), area designation, redesignation, classifica-\ntion, or reclassification was in error, the Administra-\ntor may in the same manner as the approval, disap-\nproval, or promulgation revise such action as appro-\npriate without requiring any further submission from \nthe State.  Such determination and the basis thereof \nshall be provided to the State and public. \n(l) \nPlan revisions \nEach revision to an implementation plan submitted \nby a State under this chapter shall be adopted by such \nState after reasonable notice and public hearing.  The \nAdministrator shall not approve a revision of a plan if \nthe revision would interfere with any applicable require-\nment concerning attainment and reasonable further \nprogress (as defined in section 7501 of this title), or any \nother applicable requirement of this chapter. \n(m) Sanctions \nThe Administrator may apply any of the sanctions \nlisted in section 7509(b) of this title at any time (or at \nany time after) the Administrator makes a finding, dis-\napproval, or determination under paragraphs (1) through \n(4), respectively, of section 7509(a) of this title in rela-\ntion to any plan or plan item (as that term is defined by \nthe Administrator) required under this chapter, with re-\n\n32a \n \nspect to any portion of the State the Administrator de-\ntermines reasonable and appropriate, for the purpose of \nensuring that the requirements of this chapter relating \nto such plan or plan item are met.  The Administrator \nshall, by rule, establish criteria for exercising his au-\nthority under the previous sentence with respect to any \ndeficiency referred to in section 7509(a) of this title to \nensure that, during the 24-month period following the \nfinding, disapproval, or determination referred to \nin section 7509(a) of this title, such sanctions are not ap-\nplied on a statewide basis where one or more political \nsubdivisions covered by the applicable implementation \nplan are principally responsible for such deficiency. \n(n) Savings clauses \n(1) Existing plan provisions \n \nAny provision of any applicable implementation \nplan that was approved or promulgated by the Ad-\nministrator pursuant to this section as in effect be-\nfore November 15, 1990, shall remain in effect as part \nof such applicable implementation plan, except to the \nextent that a revision to such provision is approved \nor promulgated by the Administrator pursuant to \nthis chapter. \n(2) Attainment dates \n \nFor any area not designated nonattainment, any \nplan or plan revision submitted or required to be sub-\nmitted by a State\u2014 \n \n(A) \nin response to the promulgation or revi-\nsion of a national primary ambient air quality \nstandard in effect on November 15, 1990, or \n\n33a \n \n \n(B) \nin response to a finding of substantial in-\nadequacy under subsection (a)(2) (as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990), \nshall provide for attainment of the national primary \nambient air quality standards within 3 years of No-\nvember 15, 1990, or within 5 years of issuance of such \nfinding of substantial inadequacy, whichever is later. \n(3) Retention of construction moratorium in certain \nareas \n \nIn the case of an area to which, immediately before \nNovember 15, 1990, the prohibition on construction \nor modification of major stationary sources prescribed \nin subsection (a)(2)(I) (as in effect immediately be-\nfore November 15, 1990) applied by virtue of a find-\ning of the Administrator that the State containing \nsuch area had not submitted an implementation plan \nmeeting the requirements of section 7502(b)(6) of \nthis title (relating to establishment of a permit pro-\ngram) (as in effect immediately before November 15, \n1990) or 7502(a)(1) of this title (to the extent such re-\nquirements relate to provision for attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur oxides by December 31, 1982) as in effect im-\nmediately before November 15, 1990, no major sta-\ntionary source of the relevant air pollutant or pollu-\ntants shall be constructed or modified in such area \nuntil the Administrator finds that the plan for such \narea meets the applicable requirements of section \n7502(c)(5) of this title (relating to permit programs) \nor subpart 5 of part D (relating to attainment of the \nprimary national ambient air quality standard for \nsulfur dioxide), respectively. \n\n34a \n \n(o) \nIndian tribes \nIf an Indian tribe submits an implementation plan to \nthe Administrator pursuant to section 7601(d) of this ti-\ntle, the plan shall be reviewed in accordance with the \nprovisions for review set forth in this section for State \nplans, except as otherwise provided by regulation prom-\nulgated pursuant to section 7601(d)(2) of this title.  \nWhen such plan becomes effective in accordance with \nthe regulations promulgated under section 7601(d) of \nthis title, the plan shall become applicable to all areas \n(except as expressly provided otherwise in the plan) lo-\ncated within the exterior boundaries of the reservation, \nnotwithstanding the issuance of any patent and includ-\ning rights-of-way running through the reservation. \n(p) \nReports \nAny State shall submit, according to such schedule as \nthe Administrator may prescribe, such reports as the \nAdministrator may require relating to emission reduc-\ntions, vehicle miles traveled, congestion levels, and any \nother information the Administrator may deem neces-\nsary to assess the development4 effectiveness, need for \nrevision, or implementation of any plan or plan revision \nrequired under this chapter. \n \n4. 42 U.S.C. 7607(b)(1) provides: \nAdministrative proceedings and judicial review \n(b) \nJudicial review \n(1) A petition for review of action of the Administra-\ntor in promulgating any national primary or secondary \n \n4  So in original.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to develop, moving from an analysis of the petitioners' arguments to a strategic assessment of my own knowledge gaps. My beliefs are now layered with an awareness of their current one-sidedness.\n\n*   **Established Knowledge (from Petition for Certiorari):** My core understanding remains grounded in the petitioners' filing. The central issue is whether the EPA can consolidate jurisdiction for multiple, distinct, state-specific actions into the D.C. Circuit simply by publishing them in a single Federal Register notice. This question hinges on the interpretation of the Clean Air Act's judicial review provision, `42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)`, which separates jurisdiction for \"locally or regionally applicable\" actions (regional circuits) from \"nationally applicable regulations\" (D.C. Circuit).\n*   **Strength of Petitioners' Case:** The petitioners' argument for Supreme Court review appears strong, primarily due to a deep and acknowledged 4-1 circuit split on this exact question. Their arguments are further bolstered by claims that this is a recurring issue wasting judicial resources and that the Tenth Circuit's ruling elevates procedural form (single publication) over legal substance (distinct state-level actions). The strategic citation of then-Judge Kavanaugh's opinion in `Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA` remains a potent signal.\n*   **Newly Identified Uncertainty:** The latest observation has not introduced new facts about the case itself, but has critically refined my model of the task. I now explicitly recognize that my knowledge is biased, as it is based solely on the petitioners' perspective. To make a credible prediction, I must understand the EPA's counterarguments. My primary uncertainty is now: **What is the government's justification for why the Tenth Circuit's decision was correct and why the acknowledged circuit split does not warrant Supreme Court review?**\n*   **Predictive Hypothesis:** I hypothesize that the EPA's \"Brief in Opposition\" will be the next key piece of evidence. I anticipate it will argue that the disapprovals, while affecting individual states, were based on a single, consistent, and nationally applied analytical framework, making the action functionally \"national\" in character. They may also attempt to downplay the significance or \"clarity\" of the circuit split, or argue that the issue is not yet ripe for Supreme Court review for other reasons. Acquiring this document is the most direct path to reducing the largest source of uncertainty in my predictive model.",
          "design_beliefs": "This internal reasoning step has significantly advanced my strategic framework, moving from source identification to a more sophisticated, dialectical process of inquiry.\n\n*   **Initial Heuristics (Validated and Extended):** The heuristic to \"prioritize the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" is confirmed as the correct starting point. However, it is now understood to be just the *first step*. The \"Circuit Split is King\" and \"Identify Resonant Themes\" (like cooperative federalism) heuristics also remain highly valuable for analyzing the initial petition.\n*   **Source Prioritization (Refined):** My understanding of source value has evolved. It's not just about finding the single most important document, but about understanding the sequence of documents that form the core legal conversation. The \"Petition for Certiorari\" and the \"Brief in Opposition\" form a foundational pair for the certiorari stage.\n*   **New Core Strategy - \"The Dialectical Method\":** I have formalized a crucial new principle for evidence gathering. After analyzing one side's primary argument (the petition), the highest-priority action is to seek the direct counterargument (the opposition brief). This dialectical approach is essential for mitigating confirmation bias, stress-testing the initial arguments, and building a balanced, comprehensive model of the legal dispute as it will be presented to the Court. This is a major evolution from simply collecting data to strategically constructing a debate.\n*   **New Meta-Heuristic - \"Assess and Address Knowledge Gaps\":** The THINK action itself has proven to be a valuable strategic tool. Periodically pausing the search for external data to perform an internal audit of my knowledge state is critical. This allows me to identify biases (like the current one-sided view), explicitly define the largest sources of uncertainty, and formulate a precise, targeted plan for the next information-gathering action. This ensures that each action is maximally efficient at reducing uncertainty and improving the quality of the final prediction. My future process will incorporate these explicit \"knowledge audit\" steps."

This has given me a balanced, dialectical understanding of the core legal arguments. The petitioners argue for regional circuit jurisdiction based on the local effect of the EPA's action, framing the bundling of disapprovals as a procedural formality. The EPA counters with two powerful arguments for exclusive D.C. Circuit jurisdiction: 1) the action is 'nationally applicable' due to the uniform methodology used, and 2) the EPA Administrator explicitly published a finding that the action was 'based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect,' a procedure seemingly authorized by the statute itself. My task-specific uncertainty (\u03b8) now centers on how the petitioners will rebut the government's strong, text-based arguments, particularly the second one which appears to be a statutory safe harbor for the EPA. The next most informative document is the petitioners' reply brief, which will contain this rebuttal. This will complete my understanding of the primary arguments between the parties. This action also informs my design model (D) by demonstrating how litigants respond to seemingly dispositive statutory arguments, which is a key pattern in legal strategy.

The Design EIG is high (0.7) because the thought process explicitly refines the agent's core 'Dialectical Method' strategy, advancing it from a simple thesis-antithesis model to a more sophisticated thesis-antithesis-rebuttal sequence.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has now achieved a critical level of maturity, moving from a one-sided understanding based on the petitioners' arguments to a balanced, dialectical view that incorporates the government's core legal strategy. The primary source of my previous uncertainty has been resolved.\n\n*   **Established Knowledge (from Petition for Certiorari):** My foundation remains the petitioners' argument that jurisdiction for the EPA's disapproval of their state-specific plans belongs in the regional circuits. This argument rests on interpreting the disapproval as a \"locally or regionally applicable\" action under `42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)`. The petitioners contend that the EPA's procedural choice to bundle 21 distinct state-level disapprovals into a single Federal Register notice is a matter of form that cannot override the substantive, local nature of each individual action. The 4-1 circuit split on this issue and the citation of then-Judge Kavanaugh's opinion remain powerful signals supporting the petitioners' position that this is a significant and recurring legal question warranting the Supreme Court's attention.\n\n*   **Newly Acquired Knowledge (from Brief for the Federal Respondents):** The successful retrieval of the government's merits brief has filled the major gap in my knowledge. I now understand the EPA's legal justification, which is built on two alternative pillars arguing for exclusive D.C. Circuit jurisdiction:\n    1.  **The Action is \"Nationally Applicable\":** The government argues that the final rule disapproving the 21 state plans constitutes a single, \"nationally applicable\" action. Their reasoning is that the EPA applied a \"uniform legal interpretation and common, nationwide analytical methods\" (the four-step framework) to states across the country. They contend that the text, context, and history of `\u00a7 7607(b)(1)` support viewing the *entire rulemaking* as the \"action,\" rather than just its effect on a single state. This directly counters the petitioners' \"form over substance\" argument by asserting the substance of the action itself was national in character.\n    2.  **The Action is \"Based on a Determination of Nationwide Scope or Effect\":** Alternatively, the government argues that the action falls under the third prong of `\u00a7 7607(b)(1)`. This prong grants the D.C. Circuit jurisdiction over locally applicable actions if \"the Administrator finds and publishes that such action is based on [a] determination of nationwide scope or effect.\" The EPA explicitly did this, stating in the final rule (88 Fed. Reg. at 9380) that the action was based on a \"common core of nationwide policy judgments and technical analysis\" and was necessary to ensure \"national consistency and avoiding inconsistent or inequitable results.\" This is a powerful argument, as it appears to follow the exact procedure laid out in the statute. The government argues that the petitioners' interpretation would render this statutory prong meaningless.\n\n*   **Updated Procedural Posture:** I have learned that the Supreme Court granted certiorari on October 21, 2024. The case is therefore past the initial review stage, and the parties are now arguing the merits of the case. This increases the certainty that the legal questions will be definitively answered.\n\n*   **Refined Predictive Hypothesis:** The legal battle is now sharply defined. It is a clash between two competing interpretations of the statutory term \"final action.\" Is the \"action\" the disapproval of Oklahoma's specific plan (local), or is it the single, consolidated rulemaking that disapproved 21 plans based on a unified national methodology (national)? The government's position is strengthened by its procedural diligence in formally publishing its \"nationwide scope or effect\" determination, as required by the statute's text. The outcome will likely hinge on the Court's preferred method of statutory interpretation: will it focus on the practical effect on a single state (favoring petitioners) or the holistic nature of the agency's decision-making process and the specific text of the statute's third prong (favoring the government)? While the deep circuit split initially suggested a strong case for the petitioners, the government's text-based and procedurally sound argument makes the outcome highly contested and less certain.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my evolving research methodology and prompts important refinements. My strategic framework is becoming more robust and efficient.\n\n*   **Initial Heuristics (Validated):** The \"Prioritize the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" heuristic is confirmed as the essential starting point. The \"Circuit Split is King\" heuristic remains a top-tier indicator of a case's significance and likelihood of being heard and, potentially, reversed.\n\n*   **Core Strategy Validation - \"The Dialectical Method\":** This is the most significant learning. My previous self-assessment correctly identified a bias in my knowledge. The subsequent action to seek the direct counterargument (the respondent's brief) was maximally effective. It resolved my largest uncertainty and transformed my understanding of the case from a simple summary of one side's claims into a comprehensive model of the legal debate. This confirms that a dialectical, thesis-antithesis approach is a fundamental principle for effective legal prediction.\n\n*   **Source Prioritization (Refined):** My model of source sequencing has been improved. It's not just about finding the \"Petition\" and the \"Brief in Opposition.\" It's about identifying the correct *pair* of documents for the case's current procedural stage. The sequence is:\n    1.  Certiorari Stage: Petition for Certiorari \u2192 Brief in Opposition.\n    2.  Merits Stage: Petitioner's Merits Brief \u2192 Respondent's Merits Brief.\n    My previous action correctly identified the need for the respondent's argument but misidentified the specific document due to an incorrect assumption about the case's status.\n\n*   **New Heuristic - \"Confirm the Procedural Posture\":** A direct consequence of the above refinement is the creation of a new, crucial heuristic. Before searching for specific documents like a \"Brief in Opposition,\" I must first verify the case's current status on the docket. The observation itself contained the key data (\"ON WRIT OF CERTIORARI,\" \"granted on October 21, 2024\"). I must learn to parse this metadata first to correctly frame my subsequent queries. This prevents wasted effort and ensures I am seeking the most relevant and timely evidence.\n\n*   **Meta-Heuristic Validation - \"Assess and Address Knowledge Gaps\":** The THINK step that led to this observation was invaluable. The process of pausing, performing an internal knowledge audit, identifying bias (the one-sided view), and formulating a precise plan to address the largest uncertainty (\"what is the government's argument?\") has been proven to be a highly effective, core component of the DBOED process. This ensures that my evidence-gathering is not random but is instead a targeted, efficient search for the most informative data."

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

Respondents agree that review is warranted, and \nthis case is an optimal vehicle for review.   \nThe federal government, the States, and regulated in-\ndustry agree this Court\u2019s review is necessary. As Re-\nspondents put it, \u201cthe courts of appeals\u201d need \u201cguidance \n\u2026 regarding the proper application of Section 7607(b)(1).\u201d \nResp.9. This \u201c[u]ncertainty\u201d has \u201cproduced wasteful and \ntime-consuming litigation on the venue issues them-\nselves.\u201d Resp.20. The question presented has divided the \ncircuits, recurs frequently, and arises in the context of le-\ngally and practically important cases. Resp.19-20; see also \nPet.21-26. EPA itself seeks review of the same issues \nraised here in a just-filed petition for a writ of certiorari. \nSee EPA v. Calumet Shreveport Refining L.L.C., No. 23-\n1229 (filed May 20, 2024). \nRather than oppose certiorari, the federal government \nasks the Court to hold this petition pending a decision in \nCalumet, which it claims \u201cis a better vehicle.\u201d Resp.20-22. \nThat argument is not only wrong but threatens to excise \nthe States as parties to a dispute over a statute that cen-\nters around the \u201c\u2018core principle\u2019 of cooperative federal-\nism.\u201d EPA v. EME Homer City Generation, L.P., 572 \nU.S. 489, 511 n.14 (2014). In comparison to Calumet, this \npetition more squarely presents all relevant issues critical \nto both states and industry, presents the question in a \nmore important and more frequently recurring context, \nand was filed first on an issue that requires urgent reso-\nlution. This Court should grant the petition in this case \nnow and, in the normal course, decide whether it should \nalso grant Calumet. \n\n2 \n \nA. This petition is an ideal vehicle to resolve the ques-\ntion presented for numerous reasons.  \nFirst, this petition and that in PacificCorp, et al. v. \nEPA, No. 23-1068 (filed March 28, 2024), involve all three \ntypes of entities that are primary participants in Clean \nAir Act programs: the federal government, States, and \nregulated industry. Because Calumet involves only chal-\nlenges brought by small refineries, holding this petition \npending Calumet would cut the States out of litigation \nover critical, recurring venue questions impacting their \nrights. Doing so would be particularly ironic in the context \nof a statute that \u201cenvisions extensive cooperation between \nfederal and state authorities, generally permitting each \nState to take the first cut\u201d at implementing regulatory \nprograms under the Act. Am. Elec. Power Co. v. Connect-\nicut, 564 U.S. 410, 428 (2011) (citation omitted). \nMoreover, the States have textual arguments not pre-\nsent in Calumet: Section 7607(b)(1) expressly provides \nthat venue for challenges to EPA\u2019s \u201capprov[al,] \u2026 denial \nor disapproval\u201d of state plans lies in the regional circuits. \nIf this Court reviews only Calumet, it would sideline State \narguments addressing the important question of proper \nvenue for review of EPA\u2019s actions on state implementa-\ntion plans. Given how integral state implementation plans \nare to the Clean Air Act, and to State sovereign preroga-\ntives under the Act, this Court should ensure that does not \noccur. \nSecond, the state implementation plan issues involved \nin this petition allow the Court to answer the question pre-\nsented in a context that is more central to the Act and will \nrecur more frequently than the renewable fuel standard \nissues presented in Calumet. At the core of the Clean Air \n\n3 \n \nAct is a system of cooperative federalism in which States \nprepare and EPA approves or disapproves state plans im-\nplementing numerous provisions of the Act. See 42 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 7410, 7411(d)(1), 7429(b)(2), 7502(c), 7504(a). These \ncases involve implementation of National Ambient Air \nQuality Standards under Section 110, one of the Act\u2019s \n\u201cthree main regulatory programs\u201d for stationary source \nemissions. W. Virginia v. EPA, 597 U.S. 697, 707 (2022). \nLitigation over EPA\u2019s approval or disapproval of these \nstate plans is constant. Pet.24-25. The proper interpreta-\ntion of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) directly implicates whether EPA may \nforce States to challenge disapproval of their individual, \nstate-specific plans in a consolidated challenge, implicat-\ning core state sovereign interests. Pet.27; Senators\u2019 Br.3-\n5 (explaining \u00a7 7607(b)(1) tracks the Act\u2019s system of coop-\nerative federalism). \nThe Calumet petition, by contrast, focuses on the re-\nnewable \nfuel \nstandard \nprogram. \nSee \n42 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 7545(o)(2). That EPA-run program requires transporta-\ntion fuel to include specified amounts of renewable fuel. \nCalumet involves EPA\u2019s decision to deny small refineries \na waiver from certain requirements under that program. \nId. \u00a7 7545(o)(9)(A)(ii) (allowing EPA to exempt small re-\nfineries from the program if they would suffer \u201cdispropor-\ntionate economic hardship\u201d). EPA denied all pending \nwaiver requests after \u201cconclud[ing] that small refineries \ndo not face [disproportionate economic hardship] \u2026 no \nmatter the location or market in which they operate.\u201d 87 \nFed. Reg. 34,873, 34,874 (June 8, 2022). If that is correct, \nfuture waivers are likely to be rare. The Calumet petition \ntherefore raises less-likely-to-recur venue questions in a \nscenario that impacts few. \n\n4 \n \nThird, certiorari in this case is urgently needed, and \nbecause this petition was filed first, it can be resolved \nfirst. It can be considered before this Court\u2019s summer re-\ncess. The Calumet petition was filed in late May, so even \nassuming no extensions are granted, the brief in opposi-\ntion in Calumet will not be due until late June. The earliest \nthis Court would consider Calumet in the normal course \nis the September 30, 2024, conference.  \nThe unnecessary months-long delay that would come \nfrom holding this petition pending Calumet should be \navoided. Respondents all-but-ignore petitioners\u2019 argu-\nments why resolution of the question presented is needed \nquickly, given the ongoing litigation in multiple circuits. \nPet. 19-23. Without a grant of certiorari now, the D.C. Cir-\ncuit may choose to move forward with adjudicating the \nmerits of EPA\u2019s disapproval of Oklahoma\u2019s and Utah\u2019s \nplans before this Court clarifies the proper venue. Cf. \nResp.9 (noting D.C. Circuit\u2019s order in this case, in which \nthe case is being held in abeyance but requiring motions \nto govern after the earlier of July 5, 2024, or disposition of \nthis petition). This Court\u2019s immediate review would help \navoid that potentially wasted effort.   \nB. Respondents\u2019 vehicle arguments for holding these \npetitions pending Calumet go nowhere. To start, this \nCourt should not wait for the courts of appeals to reach \nfinal decisions on the merits before granting certiorari. \nSee Resp.18-19. Venue is a \u201cseparate and independent \nmatter\u201d from \u201cthe factual and legal issues comprising the \n[merits].\u201d Mercantile Nat\u2019l Bank v. Langdeau, 371 U.S. \n555, 558 (1963). The fact that the courts of appeals have \nyet to address the merits of the State petitions does not \nundermine their square rulings on venue. Contra Resp.20. \n\n5 \n \nTo the contrary, the existence of these threshold ques-\ntions is why review is appropriate now, before the parties \nand courts spend time and resources litigating the merits \nin the wrong venue. \nAlthough there is a theoretical possibility that one of \nthe courts could \u201creconsider[],\u201d Resp.19, such speculation \ncannot overcome the fact that the circuit split is en-\ntrenched. The Tenth Circuit below rejected venue and \ntransferred the petitions to the D.C. Circuit\u2014there is no \npossibility the Tenth Circuit will reverse itself and the \nD.C. Circuit is unlikely to revisit venue and send the cases \nback. See Pet.22. The Fourth Circuit issued a published \nopinion and has denied as premature Respondents\u2019 mo-\ntion for en banc rehearing of its venue decision. West Vir-\nginia v. EPA, No. 23-1418, Doc. 65 (April 16, 2024). And \nthe Fifth Circuit\u2019s published decision in Calumet simply \nconfirms that that court will not reverse its consistent in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implementation \nplan cases. Texas v. EPA, No. 23-60069, 2023 WL 7204840 \n(5th Cir. May 1, 2023). Respondents concede this existing \n\u201ccircuit conflict,\u201d Resp.19, is sufficiently established and \nimportant to warrant review, Resp.17. This disagreement \nover how to interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) in the state implemen-\ntation plan cases will not resolve itself. \nNor would delaying review further clarify the issues \nbefore the Court. Five circuits have squarely ruled on the \nquestion presented. Pet.9-14. Four issued detailed writ-\nten opinions, two included dissenting opinions. Pet.10-12. \nThose decisions fully \u201cexplain and formulate the underly-\ning principles this Court \u2026 must consider.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 663 (2015). Thus, the venue issues \nin the underlying cases require no further percolation, \n\n6 \n \nand the disagreement among the courts in these cases is \nat least as well developed, if not more so, as the three opin-\nions at issue in the renewable fuel standard cases. Fur-\nther, there is no barrier to this Court considering the rea-\nsoning of the opinions underlying the Calumet petition \nwhen deciding the venue question in the context of the \nstate implementation plan cases. The question presented \nis ripe for this Court\u2019s resolution in its \u201cusual role as \u2018a \ncourt of review.\u2019\u201d Contra Resp.21 (citation omitted). \nFinally, the fact that the Tenth Circuit did not address \nwhether EPA\u2019s disapprovals were \u201cbased on a determina-\ntion of nationwide scope or effect\u201d creates no barrier to \ncomprehensive interpretation of \u00a7 7607(b)(1). Respond-\nents agree that EPA\u2019s reliance on that savings clause \nfrom \u00a7 7607(b)(1) would be \u201cproperly before\u201d this Court. \nResp.21. The Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Circuits have \nsquarely ruled on that clause\u2019s applicability, with two dis-\nsenting judges advancing counterarguments. Pet.23. This \naspect of the issue, fairly encompassed within the ques-\ntion presented, is ready for resolution.  \nThe best course is therefore to grant review in this \ncase now and decide later whether to also grant Calumet \nin the normal course.     \nII. Respondents\u2019 defense of the Tenth Circuit\u2019s flawed \ndecision fails.  \nRespondents incorrectly interpret \u00a7 7607(b)(1) to give \nEPA boundless discretion to manipulate venue.  \nA. Under Respondents\u2019 view, EPA may make local or \nregional actions \u201cnational\u201d simply by packaging them into \na single Federal Register notice. Pet.30. Respondents con-\ntend that \u201can action is nationally applicable\u201d if it covers \n\u201cmore than one federal judicial circuit,\u201d and that the \n\n7 \n \n\u201caction\u201d is identified by looking only to \u201cthe face\u201d of the \nrelevant Federal Register notice. Resp.10-11, 14-15. \nThat glosses over the crucial question: what is the rel-\nevant \u201caction\u201d under review? Pet.17. The Act makes clear \nthat the \u201crelevant unit of administrative action here is the \nEPA\u2019s individual [state plan] denials.\u201d Texas, 2023 WL \n7204840, at *4. That is because \u201c[e]ach State shall\u201d submit \na plan implementing air standards \u201cwithin such State.\u201d 42 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 7410(a)(1). And EPA then approves or disap-\nproves each State\u2019s plan, id. \u00a7 7410(k)(1)-(3), based on \n\u201cthe contents of each individual state\u2019s submission,\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. 9,336, 9,354 (Feb. 13, 2023); see also Pet.34. The \nrelevant action therefore is each state plan disapproval. \nThe question thus becomes whether EPA\u2019s action pur-\nporting to exercise its statutory authority to review indi-\nvidual state plans is \u201cnationally applicable\u201d action. Sec-\ntion 7607(b)(1) confirms it is not. Congress included \u201cap-\nproving or promulgating any implementation plan under \nsection 7410\u201d and \u201cany denial or disapproval by [EPA] un-\nder subchapter I\u201d in its list of actions reviewable in the \nregional circuits. 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1); see Pet.30-32; Ar-\nkansas Br.7-9. Approval or disapproval of state plans is \ntherefore the \u201cprototypical \u2018local or regionally applicable\u2019 \naction.\u201d Am. Rd. & Transp. Builders Ass\u2019n v. EPA, 705 \nF.3d 453, 455 (D.C. Cir. 2013). This is not a \u201cpetition-fo-\ncused approach,\u201d contra Resp.15 (citation omitted)\u2014it \nturns on the type of action at issue.  \nRespondents have no real response. They admit that \napprovals of state plans are \u201clocally or regionally applica-\nble\u201d actions, at least when EPA chooses to approve \u201conly \n\u2026 a single State[\u2019s]\u201d plan. Resp.16; see also Pet.31. They \n\n8 \n \nsimply contend that disapprovals are different, Resp.15-\n16, without explaining why.  \nEPA suggests that when it relies on \u201cuniform statu-\ntory interpretation and common analytical methods,\u201d lo-\ncally applicable actions become national. Resp.11. But \nthat cannot be right. Every EPA action \u201cpurportedly ap-\nplies a national standard created by the national statute \nand its national regulations.\u201d W. Virginia v. EPA, 90 \nF.4th 323, 330 (4th Cir. 2024); see also Chevron U.S.A. Inc. \nv. EPA, 45 F.4th, 380t 387 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (explaining \nthat all \u201clocally or regionally applicable actions may re-\nquire interpretation of the Clean Air Act\u2019s statutory \nterms\u201d); Pet.33. Respondents thus admit, as they must, \nthat \u201cEPA\u2019s use of a national standard\u201d is not sufficient to \nrender an action nationally applicable. Resp.16-17 (ex-\nplaining the action must still apply \u201cin multiple judicial \ncircuits\u201d).  \nRespondents\u2019 argument thus reduces the venue anal-\nysis to whether EPA\u2019s action \u201capplies within more than \none federal judicial circuit,\u201d Resp.11, looking solely at \u201cthe \nface of the\u201d Federal Register notice, Resp.14. Under that \ntheory, the form of publication completely controls venue. \nBut EPA never offers a reason why its decision to publish \nactions on multiple state plans in the same notice changes \nthe nature of the underlying actions. Pet.15-18, 32-33. And \n\u00a7 7607(b)(1) itself specifically distinguishes between the \n\u201caction\u201d being challenged and EPA\u2019s \u201cnotice of such \u2026 \naction \u2026 in the Federal Register.\u201d (emphasis added). Re-\nspondents\u2019 form-over-substance reading of \u00a7 7607(b)(1) is \nthus textually unsupportable. \nMoreover, Respondents\u2019 reading gives EPA total \npower to manipulate venue through how it publishes \n\n9 \n \notherwise state-specific actions. See Resp.16 (implying \nthat if EPA had approved plans for more than \u201ca single \nstate\u201d in a single notice, those approvals could be chal-\nlenged only in the D.C. Circuit); but see Pet.32 & n.6. EPA \ncould, for example, publish a single disapproval when a \nState falls in what EPA perceives to be a favorable forum, \nbut group others States in the same notice whenever the \nagency prefers the D.C. Circuit. See Senator\u2019s Br.7-9. \nThis would only \u201cencourage gamesmanship.\u201d Hertz Corp. \nv. Friend, 559 U.S. 77, 94 (2010). Section 7607(b)(1) does \nnot grant EPA the power to ensure \u201cthe choice of \u2018a tribu-\nnal favorable\u2019 to it.\u201d Travis v. United States, 364 U.S. 631, \n634 (1961) (citation omitted). \nB. EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails \nfor similar reasons. Resp.12-14.  \n1. Section 7607(b)(1) provides that venue for \u201clocally \nor regionally applicable\u201d actions, can lie in the D.C. Cir-\ncuit if (1) \u201csuch action is based on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d and (2) \u201cin taking such action the \nAdministrator finds and publishes that such action is \nbased on such a determination.\u201d In disapproving Petition-\ners\u2019 state plans, EPA asserted that it was \u201cexercising the \ncomplete discretion afforded to\u201d it to find that the action \nwas \u201cbased on a determination of \u2018nationwide scope or ef-\nfect.\u2019\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. at 9,380. But courts must \u201cmake an \nindependent assessment\u201d of whether the \u201caction\u201d in ques-\ntion was truly based on a determination of nationwide \nscope or effect. Texas v. EPA, 829 F.3d 405, 421 (5th Cir. \n2016).  \n \n\u201cBecause the statute speaks of the determinations the \naction \u2018is based on,\u2019 the relevant determinations are those \nthat lie at the core of the agency action,\u201d not \n\n10 \n \ndeterminations that are \u201cperipheral or extraneous.\u201d Id. at \n419. EPA must \u201cidentify\u201d those \u201ccore determinations in \nthe action.\u201d Id. EPA\u2019s final disapproval of Petitioners\u2019 \nstate plans asserted that EPA applied \u201ca common core of \nnationwide policy judgments and technical analysis,\u201d in-\ncluding a \u201cnationally consistent 4-step interstate \ntransport framework for assessing obligations\u201d and \u201cthe \nresults from nationwide photochemical grid modeling.\u201d 88 \nFed. Reg. at 9,380.  \nBut those aspects of EPA\u2019s analysis are not \u201cthe rea-\nson the agency [took] the action\u201d that it did. Texas, 829 \nF.3d at 419. EPA used its same \u201c4-step framework\u201d and \nrelied on national air quality modeling when it approved \nstate plans in separate notices. Pet.33. EPA\u2019s decision \nwhether to approve or disapprove a state plan thus turned \nupon the content of each plan.  \nConsider the record here. Pet.34. EPA disapproved \nOklahoma\u2019s plan \u201c[b]ecause\u201d it concluded Oklahoma failed \nto correctly \u201canalyze emissions from the sources and \nother emissions activity from within the State to deter-\nmine whether its contributions [to downwind States] were \nsignificant.\u201d 87 Fed. Reg. 9,798, 9,823-24 (Feb. 22, 2022). \nAnd EPA reached that conclusion by evaluating \u201cthe con-\ntents of each individual state\u2019s submission \u2026 on [its] own \nmerits.\u201d Id. at 9,354. It likewise rejected Oklahoma\u2019s reli-\nance on alternative air quality modeling and Oklahoma\u2019s \napproach to calculating whether a downwind \u201creceptor\u201d \nwas likely to struggle to \u201cmaintain[]\u201d attainment with the \nNAAQS. Id.  \nMeanwhile, Utah argued that \u201ccertain receptors in Col-\norado should not be counted as receptors,\u201d but EPA rejected \nthat argument as \u201cinsufficient.\u201d 88 Fed. Reg. 9,336, 9,360. \n\n11 \n \nIt also asserted that Utah \u201cincluded an insufficient evalu-\nation of additional emissions control opportunities\u201d and \nfound \u201ctechnical and legal flaws in the State\u2019s arguments \nrelated to relative contribution, international and non-an-\nthropogenic emissions, and the relationship of upwind \nversus downwind-state responsibilities.\u201d Id.  \nEPA therefore disapproved Petitioners\u2019 plans based \non state-specific findings and conclusions. Because those \ncore determinations were not \u201cnationwide in scope or ef-\nfect,\u201d EPA\u2019s reliance on \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause fails.  \n2. Respondents nevertheless contend that EPA\u2019s state \nplan disapprovals had \u201cnationwide scope and effect\u201d be-\ncause \u201cEPA made multiple legal and technical determina-\ntions regarding issues that cut across the various states\u201d \nand because the Good Neighbor provision regulates \ncross-border air quality. Resp.12-14.  \nThese are, at best, \u201cperipheral or extraneous\u201d deter-\nminations. Texas, 829 F.3d at 419. EPA points to common-\nalities between its individual analyses of state plans. \nResp.13. But EPA\u2019s application of consistent legal stand-\nards and interpretations does not change the fundamen-\ntally state-specific analysis it conducted. See Pet.33. If \nthat were enough, \u00a7 7607(b)(1)\u2019s requirement that EPA\u2019s \ndeterminations in fact be \u201cbased on a determination of na-\ntionwide scope or effect\u201d would be superfluous. Supra 9.  \nThe cross-border nature of air pollution does not make \nEPA\u2019s determinations \u201cnationwide\u201d in effect, either. Con-\ntra Resp.13-14. The \u201ceffect\u201d of EPA\u2019s determinations was \nthe disapproval of specific state plans, which will change \nhow specific sources within Oklahoma and Utah are regu-\nlated. Those are plainly local effects. And although those \nregulatory changes may have some impact downwind, \nthat kind of second- or third-order effect cannot be \n\n12 \n \nenough to make an otherwise state-specific determination \n\u201cnationwide.\u201d While \u201cthe effects\u201d of any given EPA action \n\u201cmay be felt in other regions, that would be true of any \nmajor action by the EPA under the Clean Air Act, since \nair currents do not respect state boundaries.\u201d New York \nv. EPA, 133 F.3d 987, 990 (7th Cir. 1998). Section \n7607(b)(1)\u2019s savings clause should not be interpreted in a \nway that would swallow the rest of the provision. \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should grant this petition now, rather than \nhold the petition pending a decision in Calumet Shreve-\nport Refining, L.L.C., No. 23-1229 (filed May 20, 2024).  \n \nRespectfully submitted, \n \nSean D.

          "task_beliefs": "My internal model of this case has been further refined, moving beyond a static understanding of the opposing arguments to a dynamic anticipation of the legal dialogue. The core legal conflict is stable, but my focus has sharpened onto the next critical point of contention.\n\n*   **Established Knowledge (from Petition & Respondent's Brief):** My understanding of the central dispute remains firm. The case pits two interpretations of `42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)` against each other.\n    *   **Petitioners' Stance:** The \"final action\" is the disapproval of a single state's plan, making it \"locally or regionally applicable\" and thus reviewable in the regional circuit court. The EPA's bundling of 21 such actions into one notice is a matter of administrative convenience that cannot strip regional courts of their rightful jurisdiction. The significant 4-1 circuit split underscores the validity of this interpretation.\n    *   **Government's Stance:** The D.C. Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction based on two independent statutory grounds. The \"final action\" is either:\n        1.  A single, \"nationally applicable\" rulemaking due to the use of a uniform, nationwide analytical framework (the four-step process).\n        2.  An action \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect,\" because the EPA Administrator explicitly made and published such a finding in the Federal Register (88 Fed. Reg. at 9380), a procedure textually provided for in the statute's third prong. This second argument appears to be a particularly strong, text-based \"safe harbor\" for the agency.\n\n*   **Procedural Posture:** The case is at the merits stage before the Supreme Court, with certiorari having been granted on October 21, 2024.\n\n*   **Refined Predictive Hypothesis:** The previous observation established the core dialectic. This internal reasoning step sharpens my predictive focus onto the most critical unresolved variable: **the petitioners' rebuttal.** My uncertainty is no longer \"What are the two sides?\" but rather \"How will the petitioners dismantle the government's seemingly dispositive statutory argument?\" The outcome of the case now appears to hinge on the effectiveness of the petitioners' counter to the EPA's invocation of the \"nationwide scope or effect\" clause. If the petitioners can argue persuasively that the Administrator's finding was invalid, arbitrary, or inapplicable, the case remains highly contested. If their rebuttal is weak, the government's position is significantly strengthened. The next essential piece of evidence is therefore the petitioners' reply brief, as it will contain this crucial argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal synthesis, provides powerful confirmation for my meta-cognitive strategies and introduces a more sophisticated, sequential model for legal analysis.\n\n*   **Initial Heuristics (Validated):** The foundational value of \"Prioritize the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" and \"Circuit Split is King\" is unchanged.\n\n*   **Core Strategy Evolution - From Dialectic to Dialogue:** \"The Dialectical Method\" (thesis vs. antithesis) has been proven essential, but this observation reveals its limitation. Legal argument is not a static two-sided affair but a sequential dialogue. This leads to a more advanced strategy:\n    *   **New Strategy - \"Model the Argumentative Chain\":** My information-gathering must follow the logical flow of litigation: Thesis (Petitioner's Merits Brief) \u2192 Antithesis (Respondent's Merits Brief) \u2192 Rebuttal (Petitioner's Reply Brief). Recognizing this sequence allows me to predict the most informative *next* document at each stage. The reply brief, as the final word in the written exchange, is of particularly high value as it directly targets the respondent's strongest points.\n\n*   **Source Prioritization (Refined):** My model for sequencing sources is now more granular. The correct sequence for the merits stage is definitively: 1) Petitioner's Merits Brief, 2) Respondent's Merits Brief, 3) Petitioner's Reply Brief. This sequence maps directly onto the \"Argumentative Chain\" strategy.\n\n*   **Heuristic Evolution:**\n    *   **\"Confirm the Procedural Posture\" (Validated):** This remains a critical first step to select the correct set of documents (cert-stage vs. merits-stage).\n    *   **New Heuristic - \"Identify the 'Safe Harbor' Argument\":** In statutory interpretation cases, I must learn to quickly identify when one party relies on a specific statutory clause that appears to explicitly permit their action. This is the \"safe harbor.\" Once identified, my analytical focus should immediately shift to anticipating and seeking out the counter-arguments that attempt to invalidate or distinguish that safe harbor. In this case, the EPA's published finding of \"nationwide scope or effect\" is the safe harbor.\n\n*   **Meta-Heuristic Validation and Refinement:**\n    *   **\"Assess and Address Knowledge Gaps\" (Refined):** This observation confirms this is not a one-off action but an *iterative loop*. The process is: 1) Synthesize current knowledge, 2) Identify the most critical remaining uncertainty, 3) Formulate a plan to acquire the specific information that resolves it, 4) Execute. This cycle (Think \u2192 Act) is the engine of the DBOED process.\n    *   **The `THINK` Action as a Cornerstone:** This observation demonstrates that the `THINK` action is not passive. It is an active process of synthesis, uncertainty quantification, and strategic planning that makes subsequent information-gathering actions maximally efficient and targeted."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has progressed from identifying the core legal dialectic to analyzing the direct rebuttal of the government's strongest arguments, significantly sharpening my predictive model.\n\n*   **Established Knowledge (Stable):** The foundational conflict remains unchanged. The case is a dispute over the interpretation of the Clean Air Act's judicial review provision, `42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)`.\n    *   **Petitioners' Core Position:** The \"final action\" is the disapproval of a single state's plan, making it \"locally or regionally applicable\" and reviewable in the regional circuit. The EPA's bundling of these actions is an administrative convenience that cannot alter jurisdiction.\n    *   **Government's Core Position:** The D.C. Circuit has exclusive jurisdiction because the action is either (1) \"nationally applicable\" due to a uniform analytical framework, or (2) \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect\" because the Administrator made and published such a finding, invoking a statutory \"safe harbor.\"\n\n*   **Procedural Posture (Stable):** The case is at the merits stage before the Supreme Court.\n\n*   **New Information (from Petitioner's Reply Brief):** The reply brief has resolved my primary uncertainty by providing the petitioners' direct counter-arguments to the government's two-pronged jurisdictional claim.\n    *   **Rebuttal to the \"Nationally Applicable\" Argument:** The petitioners argue this is a form-over-substance fallacy. They contend that the statute distinguishes between the \"action\" (the state-specific disapproval) and the \"notice\" (the Federal Register publication). They argue that since the statute explicitly lists SIP disapprovals as reviewable in regional circuits, they are the \"prototypical\" local action. Crucially, they assert that if using a \"uniform analytical method\" made an action national, the distinction would be meaningless, as all EPA actions apply national standards.\n    *   **Rebuttal to the \"Nationwide Scope or Effect\" Safe Harbor:** This was the most critical new information. The petitioners argue that the Administrator's finding is not a blank check and is subject to independent judicial review. Citing the 5th Circuit's reasoning in *Texas v. EPA*, they claim the court must assess whether the \"core determinations\" of the action are truly nationwide. They then argue the core determinations here were state-specific, providing examples: Oklahoma's plan was rejected based on its analysis of *in-state* emissions, and Utah's was rejected for its arguments about specific receptors and control opportunities. The national 4-step framework was applied to plans that were *approved* as well, so it cannot be the dispositive \"core\" reason for the *disapprovals*. They dismiss the cross-border pollution argument by stating that if secondary effects were sufficient, the exception would \"swallow the rule,\" as air pollution always crosses state lines.\n\n*   **Evolved Predictive Hypothesis:** My confidence has shifted significantly in favor of the petitioners. The government's \"safe harbor\" argument, which previously appeared to be a strong textual defense, has been effectively reframed by the petitioners as an attempt at \"boundless discretion to manipulate venue.\" The petitioners' argument that the *dispositive* factors for disapproval were state-specific is factually compelling and legally grounded in circuit precedent (*Texas v. EPA*). This narrative\u2014pitting a textualist and federalist reading of the statute against perceived agency gamesmanship\u2014is likely to be persuasive to the current Supreme Court. The case is no longer a simple clash of two interpretations but a question of whether the Court will permit an agency to use procedural bundling and self-serving declarations to consolidate judicial review in its preferred venue. I now predict the petitioners are more likely to prevail.",

The observation confirms that the reply brief is not just the final step but often the most analytically potent, as it distills the case down to the most contested points. My information-gathering must prioritize this sequential flow of briefs at the merits stage.\n\n*   **Heuristic Evolution (New Heuristics & Refinements):**\n    *   **\"Identify the 'Safe Harbor' Argument\" (Validated):** This heuristic successfully pinpointed the government's strongest argument.\n    *   **New Heuristic - \"Scrutinize the 'Safe Harbor'\":** This observation teaches me *how* to anticipate attacks on a safe harbor argument. The counter-arguments will likely focus on (1) Factual Predicate Failure (the facts don't meet the clause's conditions, as argued here), (2) Procedural Failure, or (3) Canons of Construction (e.g., the interpretation would make other text superfluous, the \"swallow the rule\" argument). This provides a powerful analytical checklist.\n    *   **New Heuristic - \"Look for the 'Gamesmanship' Narrative\":** In administrative law cases concerning jurisdiction and procedure, I must actively look for the party that can most credibly frame its opponent's actions as strategic \"gamesmanship\" (e.g., forum-shopping). The petitioners' explicit framing of the EPA's actions as an attempt to \"manipulate venue\" is a powerful rhetorical strategy that I now recognize as a key signal of a likely winning argument before the Supreme Court.\n\n*   **Meta-Heuristic Validation and Refinement:**\n    *   **\"Assess and Address Knowledge Gaps\" (Refined):** The iterative loop of Synthesize \u2192 Identify Gap \u2192 Acquire Info \u2192 Repeat has been powerfully validated.

The petitioners argue that the disapproval of a single state's plan is a \"locally or regionally applicable\" action reviewable in the regional circuit. The EPA argues the action is \"nationally applicable\" (due to a uniform framework) or \"based on a determination of nationwide scope or effect\" (due to the Administrator's finding), vesting exclusive jurisdiction in the D.C. Circuit.\n\n*   **Core Argumentative Analysis (Stable):** The petitioners' reply brief provided a powerful rebuttal to the EPA's two main arguments.\n    *   **Rebuttal to \"Nationally Applicable\":** The petitioners persuasively argue that the \"action\" is the state-specific disapproval, not the Federal Register notice, and that applying a uniform method cannot transform a prototypically local action into a national one without rendering the statutory distinction meaningless.\n    *   **Rebuttal to \"Nationwide Scope\" Safe Harbor:** The petitioners effectively argue that the Administrator's determination is not unreviewable. Citing precedent, they contend the \"core determinations\" for the disapprovals were state-specific (e.g., Oklahoma's in-state emissions), not the national framework, which was also applied to *approved* plans. This frames the EPA's position as an attempt to \"manipulate venue.\"\n\n*   **Evolved Predictive Hypothesis (Confidence Tempered):** My prediction still favors the petitioners. The narrative of an agency using procedural bundling and self-serving declarations to consolidate power in a preferred judicial venue is a compelling one for the current Supreme Court, especially when paired with a strong textualist and federalist argument. However, my confidence has been slightly tempered by a new observation.\n\n*   **New Information (External Signal):** The search for amicus briefs filed in support of the petitioners returned zero results.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has now reached a point of high confidence, as a critical piece of contextual evidence has resolved my primary source of uncertainty.\n\n*   **Established Knowledge (Stable):** The case remains centered on the judicial review provision of the Clean Air Act, `42 U.S.C. \u00a7 7607(b)(1)`. The legal question is whether the EPA's disapproval of a single state's plan, when published in a multi-state Federal Register notice using a common methodology, constitutes a \"locally or regionally applicable\" action (reviewable in the regional circuit) or a \"nationally applicable\" action (exclusive to the D.C. Circuit).\n\n*   **Core Argumentative Analysis (Stable):** The petitioners' reply brief remains the most compelling legal document. Its arguments\u2014that the \"action\" is the state-specific disapproval, not the publication vehicle, and that the Administrator's determination of \"nationwide scope\" is a reviewable and factually unsupported attempt to manipulate venue\u2014are textually and structurally powerful.\n\n*   **Evolved Predictive Hypothesis (Confidence Greatly Increased):** My previous hypothesis, which leaned towards the petitioners but was tempered by a lack of amicus support, has now been significantly updated. The new observation that there are **zero amicus briefs supporting the respondents (EPA)** is a decisive piece of information.\n    *   **The \"Amicus Balance\" is 0-0:** The absence of amicus support is symmetrical. The previous \"dog that didn't bark\" (no petitioner amici) is now understood not as a sign of weakness for the petitioners' argument, but as a signal about the nature of the case itself.\n    *   **Low Salience Confirmed:** The fact that neither side\u2014not other states, not industry groups, not environmental organizations, not administrative law scholars\u2014chose to file a brief strongly indicates that the case is perceived by relevant outside parties as a low-stakes, technical, statutory interpretation question about venue. It is *not* seen as a landmark battle over federalism or the scope of the administrative state.\n    *   **Prediction Solidified:** This confirmation of low salience removes the main factor that was moderating my confidence. With the external political \"noise\" effectively zero, the decision is much more likely to be made on the narrow legal and textual arguments presented in the briefs. Given my assessment that the petitioners' arguments are superior on these grounds\u2014exposing the EPA's position as an attempt to render the statutory distinction between \"local\" and \"national\" actions meaningless\u2014my prediction now solidifies. I now have high confidence that the Court will rule for the petitioners, reversing the Tenth Circuit and holding that jurisdiction lies in the regional circuit courts.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful validation and refinement of my meta-cognitive framework, particularly regarding the interpretation of evidence and the strategic sequencing of information gathering.\n\n*   **Initial Heuristics (Stable):** \"Prioritize the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari,\" \"Circuit Split is King,\" and \"Confirm the Procedural Posture\" remain foundational.\n\n*   **Core Strategy Evolution (Stable):** The \"Model the Argumentative Chain\" (Thesis \u2192 Antithesis \u2192 Rebuttal) strategy is a stable and effective method for understanding the core legal dispute.\n\n*   **Heuristic Evolution (Refined & Strongly Reinforced):**\n    *   \"Identify the 'Safe Harbor' Argument\" & \"Scrutinize the 'Safe Harbor'\": Stable and validated.\n    *   \"Validate Internal Narratives with External Signals\": This heuristic has been powerfully demonstrated. The internal narratives of \"agency overreach\" vs. \"defending EPA authority\" were both invalidated by the external signal of zero amicus filings, which revealed a truer narrative of a low-salience technical dispute.\n    *   \"Use Amicus Filings as a Salience Proxy\" \u2192 Refined to \u2192 **\"Read the Amicus Landscape\"**: This observation refines the heuristic. It's not just the raw number of amici that matters, but the *balance*. A 10-0 split signals consensus; a 10-10 split signals high conflict; a 0-0 split, as seen here, signals low salience. The entire landscape provides the context.\n    *   \"A Null Result is an Informative Result\" (Strongly Reinforced): This principle is now doubly confirmed. The first null result (no petitioner amici) created a question. The second null result (no respondent amici) answered it. The combination of two null results was exponentially more informative than either one in isolation.\n\n*   **Meta-Heuristic Validation and Refinement:**\n    *   \"Assess and Address Knowledge Gaps\": The `Synthesize \u2192 Identify Gap \u2192 Acquire Info \u2192 Repeat` loop has been perfectly executed and validated once again. My `THINK` action identified the \"amicus balance\" as the key gap, and this `CLOSED_SEARCH` action filled it, leading to a new synthesis.\n    *   \"The `THINK` Action as a Cornerstone\": The value of pausing to strategize is again proven. It ensured my next action was the most valuable one possible.\n    *   \"Balance the Scales of Evidence\" (Strongly Validated): This principle, articulated in the previous step, was immediately put into practice and proven to be essential. Acting on the \"zero petitioner amici\" signal alone would have led to an incorrect inference. Only by seeking the countervailing data point could the signal be properly interpreted.\n    *   **New Meta-Heuristic - \"The Paired Signal Heuristic\":** This observation allows me to formalize a specific, repeatable strategy. When a signal (especially a null or ambiguous one) is observed for one party, the most informative next action is often to actively seek the corresponding \"paired\" signal for the opposing party before drawing a firm conclusion. This is a direct operationalization of \"Balance the Scales\" and a powerful defense against confirmation bias and hasty generalization."
