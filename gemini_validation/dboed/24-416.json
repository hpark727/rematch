    "facts_of_the_case": "In 2010 and 2011, while still married, Jennifer Zuch and Patrick Gennardo made two estimated tax payments totaling $50,000 for their 2010 taxes, without specifying how to allocate the payments between them. In September 2012, after filing separate tax returns, Gennardo reported owing $385,393 while Zuch reported an overpayment. The IRS applied the entire $50,000 in estimated payments to Gennardo\u2019s liability. When Zuch later filed an amended return reporting additional income and claiming her share of the $50,000, the IRS assessed the additional tax but did not credit her for any portion of the estimated payments, even after Gennardo filed his own amended return indicating the payments should be allocated to Zuch.\n\nIn August 2013, the IRS notified Zuch of its intent to levy her property to collect approximately $36,000 in unpaid 2010 taxes. During the ensuing Collection Due Process hearing, Zuch challenged her underlying tax liability, arguing she was entitled to credit for the estimated payments. Meanwhile, over several years while Zuch was disputing her 2010 liability, the IRS repeatedly took her tax refunds from other years and applied them to what it calculated as her 2010 liability, eventually reducing the balance to zero by April 2019.\n\nThe case went through the Tax Court, which initially denied summary judgment and remanded to the IRS Office of Appeals. When the balance was reduced to zero through the IRS\u2019s seizure of Zuch's later tax refunds, the Tax Court dismissed the case as moot. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding that the IRS cannot eliminate Tax Court jurisdiction over a disputed tax liability simply by seizing a taxpayer\u2019s refunds to cover the contested debt.",

It directly provides one half of the adversarial argument. For design, this action directly tests the hypothesis that starting with the cert petition is an efficient and effective strategy for case analysis.

A petition for rehearing was denied on \nJune 26, 2024 (App., infra, 68a-69a).  On September 12, \n2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which to \nfile a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \n\n2 \n \nOctober 11, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is in-\nvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 76a-84a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a taxpayer who is \u201cliable to pay any tax ne-\nglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) may (with certain exceptions) \u201ccollect such tax\u201d \nby \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s property.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a).  Before 1998, the Internal Revenue Code au-\nthorized the IRS to levy upon taxpayer property with-\nout any prior opportunity for a hearing or other pre- \ncollection process, so long as there were adequate post-\ndeprivation procedures.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931).  In 1998, however, Congress es-\ntablished various procedures that the IRS generally \nmust follow before levying.  See Taxpayer Bill of Rights \n3, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-\n749 (codified at 26 U.S.C. 6330). \nUnder those procedures, a taxpayer whose property \nthe IRS seeks to take by levy generally must be notified \nat least 30 days before the levy of the right to request a \nhearing before the IRS Independent Office of Appeals \n(Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  A taxpayer\u2019s \nrequest for such a hearing\u2014sometimes called a \u201ccollec-\ntion due process hearing[],\u201d App., infra, 2a\u2014generally \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nAt the hearing itself, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed \n\n3 \n \nlevy,\u201d including \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of \ncollection actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii).  The taxpayer may \nalso challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of the underly-\ning tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did \nnot otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe Appeals Office then issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d to \nsustain or reject the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  \nThe taxpayer may petition the United States Tax Court \n\u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, in turn, is \nsubject to review by a federal court of appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n7482(a)(1). \n2. When a taxpayer overpays her taxes for a partic-\nular year, the IRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such over-\npayment\u201d against the taxpayer\u2019s existing tax \u201cliability\u201d \ninstead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  26 \nU.S.C. 6402(a).  That credit is known as an \u201coffset.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 42a.  A taxpayer may challenge the credit through \nthe traditional mechanism for disputing the collection of \na federal tax: a post-deprivation refund suit.  See 26 \nU.S.C. 7422(a).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must \nfirst request a refund from the IRS.  26 U.S.C. 6511, \n7422(a).  If the refund is denied, the taxpayer may sue \nto recover the disputed amount in federal district court \nor the Court of Federal Claims.  26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1). \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Respondent and Patrick Gennardo were married \nfrom 1993 to 2014.  C.A. App. 273-274.  In 2010 and 2011, \nrespondent and Gennardo paid $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n4 \n \nto the IRS for tax year 2010.  App., infra, 8a.  One pay-\nment was a check for $20,000 that listed both respond-\nent and Gennardo as account holders.  C.A. App. 314.  \nThe other was a check for $30,000 that listed only Gen-\nnardo as an account holder.  Id. at 315. \nIn September 2012, respondent and Gennardo filed \nseparate (and late) federal income-tax returns for tax \nyear 2010.  App., infra, 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Re-\nspondent\u2019s return showed a small overpayment and \nmade no mention of the estimated payments.  C.A. App. \n317.  In contrast, Gennardo\u2019s return showed a liability of \n$385,393 and claimed $10,000 of the estimated payments.  \nId. at 331.  The IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated \npayments toward Gennardo\u2019s 2010 tax liability.  App., \ninfra, 8a; see C.A. App. 473.  Gennardo applied for, and \nultimately obtained, a compromise settlement that re-\nsolved his share of joint tax liabilities for tax years 2007, \n2008, and 2009, as well as his separate liabilities for tax \nyears 2010 and 2011, based in part on those payments.  \nC.A. App. 277-278, 311, 460, 466, 468. \nMeanwhile, respondent realized that her 2010 return \nhad omitted her income from a retirement distribution.  \nC.A. App. 279, 477.  In November 2012, respondent filed \nan amended return showing additional tax due of $27,682, \nclaiming the full $50,000 in estimated payments, and re-\nquesting a refund of the remainder.  Id. at 475.  Because \nthe IRS had already allocated the $50,000 to Gennardo, \nthe IRS declined to apply the estimated payments to re-\nspondent\u2019s account.  Id. at 280.  Instead, the IRS assessed \nthe additional tax due of $27,682 as reported on her \namended return, along with a late-filing penalty of $7020.  \nId. at 305. \n2. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and de-\nmand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \n\n5 \n \nAfter she failed to pay, the IRS sent her a notice of in-\ntent to levy on her property to collect her unpaid taxes.  \nApp., infra, 70a-75a.  Respondent requested a pre-levy \nhearing before the Appeals Office under Section 6330.  \nC.A. App. 567.  She contended that the IRS should have \napplied the full $50,000 in estimated payments to her \naccount, making her underlying tax liability $0.  Ibid.; \nsee App., infra, 10a. \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the proposed levy, explaining \nthat the estimated payments could not be applied to re-\nspondent\u2019s account because they had already been ap-\nplied to Gennardo\u2019s account.  App., infra, 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned for review, and the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office in 2016 for clarification of \nseveral issues.  C.A. App. 16; App., infra, 50a-60a.  On \nremand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its prior deter-\nmination to sustain the proposed levy, explaining in a \n2017 supplemental notice of determination that the es-\ntimated payments had been properly allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 44a-49a.  The case returned to the \nTax Court.  Id. at 12a. \nWhile respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were pend-\ning before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, re-\nspondent overpaid her taxes for tax year 2013 and sub-\nsequent tax years.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The IRS exer-\ncised its authority under Section 6402(a) to credit her \noverpayments in those years against her 2010 tax liabil-\nity.  Ibid.  By April 15, 2019, those offsets had reduced \nrespondent\u2019s 2010 balance due to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat because \u201cthe underlying liability\u201d had been paid, \nthe IRS \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue the proposed \n\n6 \n \n[levy].\u201d  App., infra, 42a; see C.A. Doc. 5-4, at 445-458 \n(July 21, 2022).  In April 2022, the Tax Court granted \nthe motion and dismissed respondent\u2019s Section 6330 \ncase seeking review of the proposed levy.  App., infra, \n40a-43a.  The court explained that \u201c[b]ecause there is no \nunpaid liability for the determination year upon which a \nlevy could be based, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing \nthe proposed [levy], this case is moot.\u201d  Id. at 43a. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 1a-39a.   \nWhile acknowledging that \u201cthe Tax Court need not \nhear a moot case,\u201d App., infra, 16a, the court of appeals \nheld that the proceedings before the Tax Court were \n\u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part of its opinion joined by \nonly two members of the panel, the court of appeals con-\ncluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax liability,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 26a (cita-\ntion omitted), even if \u201cthe levy is no longer being en-\nforced or the tax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 27a; see id. at 25a-\n39a.  In so concluding, the court of appeals acknowl-\nedged that it was \u201cpart[ing] ways  * * *  with the Fourth \nand D.C. Circuits,\u201d which have held that a Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot when the IRS no longer seeks to \nlevy on a person\u2019s property.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane \nv. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \n143 S. Ct. 408 (2022), and Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  The court of appeals took \nthe view that even though the IRS no longer sought to \ntake respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court still \nhad jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that she had a right to the \nestimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a. \n\n7 \n \nIn a part of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion joined by all \nthree members of the panel, the court concluded that the \nTax Court also retained jurisdiction to review whether \nthe IRS had validly exercised its authority under Sec-\ntion 6402 to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  App., infra, 19a-25a.  The court \nacknowledged that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not \nexplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d to review \noffset decisions.  Id. at 20a.  But the court of appeals \nviewed such power as \u201cimplicit\u201d in Section 6402.  Id. at \n20a; see id. at 20a-21a.  The court itself then went on to \nconsider the merits of the offset issue, concluding that \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s setoffs were invalid and without legal effect.\u201d  \nId. at 25a.  The court further concluded that because re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was not properly set off,\u201d \u201cshe \ncan challenge the IRS\u2019s application of the estimated pay-\nments.\u201d  Id. at 19a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nWhen respondent failed to pay the taxes she owed \nfor a particular tax year, the IRS notified her that it in-\ntended to levy on her property to satisfy her tax liabil-\nity.  Respondent invoked her right to challenge the pro-\nposed levy in a pre-deprivation hearing under 26 U.S.C. \n6330, and the hearing officer sustained the proposed \nlevy.  But while the Section 6330 proceeding was pend-\ning, respondent overpaid her taxes in other tax years, \nand the IRS exercised its statutory authority to credit \nthose overpayments against her outstanding liability\u2014\nreducing her balance due to $0 and eliminating the need \nto levy on her property.  The IRS therefore abandoned \nits proposed levy, and the Tax Court dismissed the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding as moot. \nThe court of appeals disagreed, holding that the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is not moot.  The court of appeals \n\n8 \n \nconcluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction under \nSection 6330 to consider respondent\u2019s challenge to her \ntax liability, even though there is no longer a live dis-\npute over the proposed levy that prompted the Section \n6330 proceeding in the first place.  And the court of ap-\npeals concluded that the Tax Court also has jurisdiction \nto review the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments \nto offset her liability, even though Congress has not \u201cex-\nplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  App., infra, 20a (emphasis omitted). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 decision has no basis in the stat-\nute Congress enacted.  It conflicts with the decisions of \nother circuits, as the court itself acknowledged.  And ab-\nsent this Court\u2019s review, the decision below could be used \nto transform the nature of a Section 6330 proceeding\u2014\nexpanding the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction far beyond the \npre-levy proceeding that Congress contemplated.  For \nall of those reasons, the petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Decision Is Wrong \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder Section 6330 is not moot even when there is no \nlonger a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  App., infra, 16a-39a.  That hold-\ning is incorrect. \n1. A pre-levy proceeding under Section 6330 is moot when \nthere is no longer a live dispute over the proposed levy \nthat gave rise to the proceeding \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to provide a mecha-\nnism for pre-deprivation review of an IRS levy to collect \nunpaid taxes.  See p. 2, supra.  Under that provision, a \ntaxpayer is entitled to notice and an opportunity for a \nhearing before the IRS proceeds with a proposed levy \n\n9 \n \non her property.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  And if a hear-\ning officer \u201cdetermin[es]\u201d that the proposed levy may \ngo forward, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3), the taxpayer may pe-\ntition the Tax Court for review of that \u201cdetermination,\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1). \nWhen the IRS declares that it no longer needs or in-\ntends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by levy, a pre-levy \nproceeding under Section 6330 becomes moot.  After all, \nthe point of the proceeding is to \u201cdetermin[e]\u201d whether \nthe IRS may proceed with the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When the IRS declares that it no \nlonger has any basis for a levy, the issue that prompted \nthe proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live\u2019\u200a\u201d:  The IRS has ceased \nto have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a determi-\nnation sustaining the proposed levy, and the taxpayer \nhas ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a \ndetermination rejecting the proposed levy.  Chafin v. \nChafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) (citation and some in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, the IRS initially pursued a levy to collect re-\nspondent\u2019s balance due for tax year 2010, prompting re-\nspondent to request a pre-levy proceeding under Sec-\ntion 6330.  C.A. App. 563, 567.  But when respondent \noverpaid her taxes in subsequent tax years, the IRS ex-\nercised its statutory authority to credit those overpay-\nments against her 2010 tax liability\u2014thereby reducing \nher balance due to $0 and eliminating the previous need \nto take her property by levy.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The \nIRS thus informed the Tax Court that it \u201cno longer in-\ntend[ed] to pursue the proposed [levy],\u201d id. at 42a, and \nthe Tax Court correctly deemed the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding \u201cmoot,\u201d id. at 43a. \n\n10 \n \n2. The court of appeals erred in holding that a Section \n6330 proceeding may go on without a live dispute \nover the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  App., infra, 16a.  The court \nof appeals also acknowledged that the IRS had \u201cwith-\ndr[awn] its levy\u201d on respondent\u2019s property.  Id. at 25a.  \nThe court nevertheless concluded that the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is \u201cnot moot.\u201d  Id. at 16a (capi-\ntalization omitted).  That was error. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals reasoned that the Section 6330 \nproceeding is not moot because respondent still dis-\nputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously allocated\u201d the es-\ntimated payments to Gennardo.  App., infra, 19a.  But \nSection 6330 empowers the Tax Court to review only the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination to sustain or reject the \nproposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When there is no \nlonger a live dispute over whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed, the pre-levy proceeding \u201cis moot notwith-\nstanding the existence of other live controversies be-\ntween the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall within \nthe tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  Will-\nson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThe court of appeals took the view that Section 6330 \ndoes grant the Tax Court jurisdiction to decide whether \nthe IRS properly allocated the estimated payments to \nGennardo.  App., infra, 25a-39a.  The court cited Section \n6330(c)(2)(B), which allows a taxpayer to \u201craise at [a \nSection 6330] hearing the existence or amount of the un-\nderlying tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability \n\n11 \n \nor did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see App., infra, \n26a.  But a taxpayer may challenge the existence or \namount of her underlying tax liability under Section \n6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014and may raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)\u2014\u201conly \nin the context of determining whether\u201d the proposed \nlevy may \u201cproceed,\u201d McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th \n316, 319 (4th Cir.) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 143  \nS. Ct. 408 (2022).  When the \u201cproposed levy is moot,\u201d a \ntaxpayer \u201chas no independent basis to challenge the ex-\nistence or amount of her underlying tax liability in [a \nSection 6330] proceeding,\u201d Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006)\u2014just as she could not have \nused Section 6330 to seek those findings if no levy had \nbeen proposed in the first place. \nThat conclusion follows from the statutory text, which \nrefers to \u201cthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \nliability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added)\u2014\ni.e., the tax liability \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed levy.  \nThat language presupposes the existence of a proposed \nlevy, for there is otherwise nothing relevant to Section \n6330 with respect to which the tax liability is \u201cunderly-\ning.\u201d  Ibid.  Section 6330(c)(2)(B) thus allows a taxpayer \nto challenge the existence or amount of her tax liability \n\u201conly in connection with her challenge to the proposed \n[levy].\u201d  Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8.  Here, because \nthe IRS no longer wishes (nor has any need) to pursue \nthe proposed levy, the court of appeals erred in conclud-\ning that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to consider re-\nspondent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \n\n12 \n \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nThe court of appeals also reasoned that the Section \n6330 proceeding is \u201cnot moot because the IRS\u2019s setoffs \nwere invalid.\u201d  App., infra, 19a (capitalization omitted).  \nBut \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d  \nCommissioner v.

The decisions of the \nUnited States Tax Court (App., infra, 40a-43a, 50a-60a) \nand the Internal Revenue Service Independent Office of \nAppeals (App., infra, 44a-49a, 61a-67a) are unreported. \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nMarch 22, 2024.  A petition for rehearing was denied on \nJune 26, 2024 (App., infra, 68a-69a).  On September 12, \n2024, Justice Alito extended the time within which to \nfile a petition for a writ of certiorari to and including \n\n2 \n \nOctober 11, 2024.  The jurisdiction of this Court is in-\nvoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATUTORY PROVISIONS INVOLVED \nPertinent statutory provisions are reproduced in an \nappendix to this petition.  App., infra, 76a-84a. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal Background \n1. When a taxpayer who is \u201cliable to pay any tax ne-\nglects or refuses to pay,\u201d the Internal Revenue Service \n(IRS) may (with certain exceptions) \u201ccollect such tax\u201d \nby \u201clevy[ing] upon\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s property.  26 U.S.C. \n6331(a).  Before 1998, the Internal Revenue Code au-\nthorized the IRS to levy upon taxpayer property with-\nout any prior opportunity for a hearing or other pre- \ncollection process, so long as there were adequate post-\ndeprivation procedures.  See Phillips v. Commissioner, \n283 U.S. 589, 595 (1931).  In 1998, however, Congress es-\ntablished various procedures that the IRS generally \nmust follow before levying.  See Taxpayer Bill of Rights \n3, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), 112 Stat. 747-\n749 (codified at 26 U.S.C. 6330). \nUnder those procedures, a taxpayer whose property \nthe IRS seeks to take by levy generally must be notified \nat least 30 days before the levy of the right to request a \nhearing before the IRS Independent Office of Appeals \n(Appeals Office).  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  A taxpayer\u2019s \nrequest for such a hearing\u2014sometimes called a \u201ccollec-\ntion due process hearing[],\u201d App., infra, 2a\u2014generally \nsuspends \u201cthe levy actions which are the subject of the \nrequested hearing\u201d as well as the running of specified \nlimitations periods.  26 U.S.C. 6330(e)(1). \nAt the hearing itself, the taxpayer may raise \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed \n\n3 \n \nlevy,\u201d including \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of \ncollection actions\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alternatives.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)(ii) and (iii).  The taxpayer may \nalso challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of the underly-\ning tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any \nstatutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability or did \nnot otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax \nliability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \nThe Appeals Office then issues a \u201cdetermination\u201d to \nsustain or reject the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3).  \nThe taxpayer may petition the United States Tax Court \n\u201cfor review of such determination (and the Tax Court \nshall have jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s decision, in turn, is \nsubject to review by a federal court of appeals.  26 U.S.C. \n7482(a)(1). \n2. When a taxpayer overpays her taxes for a partic-\nular year, the IRS \u201cmay credit the amount of such over-\npayment\u201d against the taxpayer\u2019s existing tax \u201cliability\u201d \ninstead of refunding that amount to the taxpayer.  26 \nU.S.C. 6402(a).  That credit is known as an \u201coffset.\u201d  App., \ninfra, 42a.  A taxpayer may challenge the credit through \nthe traditional mechanism for disputing the collection of \na federal tax: a post-deprivation refund suit.  See 26 \nU.S.C. 7422(a).  To bring a refund suit, a taxpayer must \nfirst request a refund from the IRS.  26 U.S.C. 6511, \n7422(a).  If the refund is denied, the taxpayer may sue \nto recover the disputed amount in federal district court \nor the Court of Federal Claims.  26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1). \nB. Factual And Procedural Background \n1. Respondent and Patrick Gennardo were married \nfrom 1993 to 2014.  C.A. App. 273-274.  In 2010 and 2011, \nrespondent and Gennardo paid $50,000 in estimated tax \n\n4 \n \nto the IRS for tax year 2010.  App., infra, 8a.  One pay-\nment was a check for $20,000 that listed both respond-\nent and Gennardo as account holders.  C.A. App. 314.  \nThe other was a check for $30,000 that listed only Gen-\nnardo as an account holder.  Id. at 315. \nIn September 2012, respondent and Gennardo filed \nseparate (and late) federal income-tax returns for tax \nyear 2010.  App., infra, 7a; see C.A. App. 316-381.  Re-\nspondent\u2019s return showed a small overpayment and \nmade no mention of the estimated payments.  C.A. App. \n317.  In contrast, Gennardo\u2019s return showed a liability of \n$385,393 and claimed $10,000 of the estimated payments.  \nId. at 331.  The IRS applied the full $50,000 in estimated \npayments toward Gennardo\u2019s 2010 tax liability.  App., \ninfra, 8a; see C.A. App. 473.  Gennardo applied for, and \nultimately obtained, a compromise settlement that re-\nsolved his share of joint tax liabilities for tax years 2007, \n2008, and 2009, as well as his separate liabilities for tax \nyears 2010 and 2011, based in part on those payments.  \nC.A. App. 277-278, 311, 460, 466, 468. \nMeanwhile, respondent realized that her 2010 return \nhad omitted her income from a retirement distribution.  \nC.A. App. 279, 477.  In November 2012, respondent filed \nan amended return showing additional tax due of $27,682, \nclaiming the full $50,000 in estimated payments, and re-\nquesting a refund of the remainder.  Id. at 475.  Because \nthe IRS had already allocated the $50,000 to Gennardo, \nthe IRS declined to apply the estimated payments to re-\nspondent\u2019s account.  Id. at 280.  Instead, the IRS assessed \nthe additional tax due of $27,682 as reported on her \namended return, along with a late-filing penalty of $7020.  \nId. at 305. \n2. In 2013, the IRS sent respondent a notice and de-\nmand for payment of her balance due.  C.A. App. 280.  \n\n5 \n \nAfter she failed to pay, the IRS sent her a notice of in-\ntent to levy on her property to collect her unpaid taxes.  \nApp., infra, 70a-75a.  Respondent requested a pre-levy \nhearing before the Appeals Office under Section 6330.  \nC.A. App. 567.  She contended that the IRS should have \napplied the full $50,000 in estimated payments to her \naccount, making her underlying tax liability $0.  Ibid.; \nsee App., infra, 10a. \nIn 2014, after a hearing, the Appeals Office issued a \ndetermination sustaining the proposed levy, explaining \nthat the estimated payments could not be applied to re-\nspondent\u2019s account because they had already been ap-\nplied to Gennardo\u2019s account.  App., infra, 61a-67a.  Re-\nspondent petitioned for review, and the Tax Court re-\nmanded to the Appeals Office in 2016 for clarification of \nseveral issues.  C.A. App. 16; App., infra, 50a-60a.  On \nremand, the Appeals Office reaffirmed its prior deter-\nmination to sustain the proposed levy, explaining in a \n2017 supplemental notice of determination that the es-\ntimated payments had been properly allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 44a-49a.  The case returned to the \nTax Court.  Id. at 12a. \nWhile respondent\u2019s pre-levy proceedings were pend-\ning before the Appeals Office and the Tax Court, re-\nspondent overpaid her taxes for tax year 2013 and sub-\nsequent tax years.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The IRS exer-\ncised its authority under Section 6402(a) to credit her \noverpayments in those years against her 2010 tax liabil-\nity.  Ibid.  By April 15, 2019, those offsets had reduced \nrespondent\u2019s 2010 balance due to $0.  Id. at 13a. \nIn March 2020, the IRS moved to dismiss as moot the \npre-levy proceeding before the Tax Court, explaining \nthat because \u201cthe underlying liability\u201d had been paid, \nthe IRS \u201cno longer intend[ed] to pursue the proposed \n\n6 \n \n[levy].\u201d  App., infra, 42a; see C.A. Doc. 5-4, at 445-458 \n(July 21, 2022).  In April 2022, the Tax Court granted \nthe motion and dismissed respondent\u2019s Section 6330 \ncase seeking review of the proposed levy.  App., infra, \n40a-43a.  The court explained that \u201c[b]ecause there is no \nunpaid liability for the determination year upon which a \nlevy could be based, and [the IRS] is no longer pursuing \nthe proposed [levy], this case is moot.\u201d  Id. at 43a. \n3. The court of appeals vacated the Tax Court\u2019s or-\nder of dismissal and remanded for the Tax Court to de-\ntermine whether respondent was entitled to the esti-\nmated tax payments that the IRS had allocated to Gen-\nnardo.  App., infra, 1a-39a.   \nWhile acknowledging that \u201cthe Tax Court need not \nhear a moot case,\u201d App., infra, 16a, the court of appeals \nheld that the proceedings before the Tax Court were \n\u201cnot moot,\u201d id. at 2a.  In a part of its opinion joined by \nonly two members of the panel, the court of appeals con-\ncluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to review re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax liability,\u2019\u200a\u201d id. at 26a (cita-\ntion omitted), even if \u201cthe levy is no longer being en-\nforced or the tax is satisfied,\u201d id. at 27a; see id. at 25a-\n39a.  In so concluding, the court of appeals acknowl-\nedged that it was \u201cpart[ing] ways  * * *  with the Fourth \nand D.C. Circuits,\u201d which have held that a Section 6330 \nproceeding is moot when the IRS no longer seeks to \nlevy on a person\u2019s property.  Id. at 27a (citing McLane \nv. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, \n143 S. Ct. 408 (2022), and Willson v. Commissioner, 805 \nF.3d 316 (D.C. Cir. 2015)).  The court of appeals took \nthe view that even though the IRS no longer sought to \ntake respondent\u2019s property by levy, the Tax Court still \nhad jurisdiction to \u201cdeclare that she had a right to the \nestimated payments.\u201d  Id. at 37a. \n\n7 \n \nIn a part of the court of appeals\u2019 opinion joined by all \nthree members of the panel, the court concluded that the \nTax Court also retained jurisdiction to review whether \nthe IRS had validly exercised its authority under Sec-\ntion 6402 to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset \nher 2010 tax liability.  App., infra, 19a-25a.  The court \nacknowledged that \u201c[i]t may be that Congress has not \nexplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d to review \noffset decisions.  Id. at 20a.  But the court of appeals \nviewed such power as \u201cimplicit\u201d in Section 6402.  Id. at \n20a; see id. at 20a-21a.  The court itself then went on to \nconsider the merits of the offset issue, concluding that \n\u201cthe IRS\u2019s setoffs were invalid and without legal effect.\u201d  \nId. at 25a.  The court further concluded that because re-\nspondent\u2019s \u201ctax obligation was not properly set off,\u201d \u201cshe \ncan challenge the IRS\u2019s application of the estimated pay-\nments.\u201d  Id. at 19a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE PETITION \nWhen respondent failed to pay the taxes she owed \nfor a particular tax year, the IRS notified her that it in-\ntended to levy on her property to satisfy her tax liabil-\nity.  Respondent invoked her right to challenge the pro-\nposed levy in a pre-deprivation hearing under 26 U.S.C. \n6330, and the hearing officer sustained the proposed \nlevy.  But while the Section 6330 proceeding was pend-\ning, respondent overpaid her taxes in other tax years, \nand the IRS exercised its statutory authority to credit \nthose overpayments against her outstanding liability\u2014\nreducing her balance due to $0 and eliminating the need \nto levy on her property.  The IRS therefore abandoned \nits proposed levy, and the Tax Court dismissed the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding as moot. \nThe court of appeals disagreed, holding that the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is not moot.  The court of appeals \n\n8 \n \nconcluded that the Tax Court has jurisdiction under \nSection 6330 to consider respondent\u2019s challenge to her \ntax liability, even though there is no longer a live dis-\npute over the proposed levy that prompted the Section \n6330 proceeding in the first place.  And the court of ap-\npeals concluded that the Tax Court also has jurisdiction \nto review the IRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments \nto offset her liability, even though Congress has not \u201cex-\nplicitly granted the Tax Court such power\u201d in a Section \n6330 proceeding.  App., infra, 20a (emphasis omitted). \nThe court of appeals\u2019 decision has no basis in the stat-\nute Congress enacted.  It conflicts with the decisions of \nother circuits, as the court itself acknowledged.  And ab-\nsent this Court\u2019s review, the decision below could be used \nto transform the nature of a Section 6330 proceeding\u2014\nexpanding the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction far beyond the \npre-levy proceeding that Congress contemplated.  For \nall of those reasons, the petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \nA. The Court Of Appeals\u2019 Decision Is Wrong \nThe court of appeals held that a pre-levy proceeding \nunder Section 6330 is not moot even when there is no \nlonger a live dispute over the proposed levy that gave \nrise to the proceeding.  App., infra, 16a-39a.  That hold-\ning is incorrect. \n1. A pre-levy proceeding under Section 6330 is moot when \nthere is no longer a live dispute over the proposed levy \nthat gave rise to the proceeding \nCongress enacted Section 6330 to provide a mecha-\nnism for pre-deprivation review of an IRS levy to collect \nunpaid taxes.  See p. 2, supra.  Under that provision, a \ntaxpayer is entitled to notice and an opportunity for a \nhearing before the IRS proceeds with a proposed levy \n\n9 \n \non her property.  26 U.S.C. 6330(a) and (b).  And if a hear-\ning officer \u201cdetermin[es]\u201d that the proposed levy may \ngo forward, 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3), the taxpayer may pe-\ntition the Tax Court for review of that \u201cdetermination,\u201d \n26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1). \nWhen the IRS declares that it no longer needs or in-\ntends to take the taxpayer\u2019s property by levy, a pre-levy \nproceeding under Section 6330 becomes moot.  After all, \nthe point of the proceeding is to \u201cdetermin[e]\u201d whether \nthe IRS may proceed with the proposed levy.  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When the IRS declares that it no \nlonger has any basis for a levy, the issue that prompted \nthe proceeding is no longer \u201c\u200a\u2018live\u2019\u200a\u201d:  The IRS has ceased \nto have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a determi-\nnation sustaining the proposed levy, and the taxpayer \nhas ceased to have any \u201clegally cognizable interest\u201d in a \ndetermination rejecting the proposed levy.  Chafin v. \nChafin, 568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013) (citation and some in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \nHere, the IRS initially pursued a levy to collect re-\nspondent\u2019s balance due for tax year 2010, prompting re-\nspondent to request a pre-levy proceeding under Sec-\ntion 6330.  C.A. App. 563, 567.  But when respondent \noverpaid her taxes in subsequent tax years, the IRS ex-\nercised its statutory authority to credit those overpay-\nments against her 2010 tax liability\u2014thereby reducing \nher balance due to $0 and eliminating the previous need \nto take her property by levy.  App., infra, 12a-13a.  The \nIRS thus informed the Tax Court that it \u201cno longer in-\ntend[ed] to pursue the proposed [levy],\u201d id. at 42a, and \nthe Tax Court correctly deemed the Section 6330 pro-\nceeding \u201cmoot,\u201d id. at 43a. \n\n10 \n \n2. The court of appeals erred in holding that a Section \n6330 proceeding may go on without a live dispute \nover the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals recognized that \u201cthe Tax Court \nneed not hear a moot case.\u201d  App., infra, 16a.  The court \nof appeals also acknowledged that the IRS had \u201cwith-\ndr[awn] its levy\u201d on respondent\u2019s property.  Id. at 25a.  \nThe court nevertheless concluded that the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is \u201cnot moot.\u201d  Id. at 16a (capi-\ntalization omitted).  That was error. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nThe court of appeals reasoned that the Section 6330 \nproceeding is not moot because respondent still dis-\nputes whether the IRS \u201cerroneously allocated\u201d the es-\ntimated payments to Gennardo.  App., infra, 19a.  But \nSection 6330 empowers the Tax Court to review only the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination to sustain or reject the \nproposed levy.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1).  When there is no \nlonger a live dispute over whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed, the pre-levy proceeding \u201cis moot notwith-\nstanding the existence of other live controversies be-\ntween the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall within \nthe tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  Will-\nson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 320 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nThe court of appeals took the view that Section 6330 \ndoes grant the Tax Court jurisdiction to decide whether \nthe IRS properly allocated the estimated payments to \nGennardo.  App., infra, 25a-39a.  The court cited Section \n6330(c)(2)(B), which allows a taxpayer to \u201craise at [a \nSection 6330] hearing the existence or amount of the un-\nderlying tax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liability \n\n11 \n \nor did not otherwise have an opportunity to dispute such \ntax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see App., infra, \n26a.  But a taxpayer may challenge the existence or \namount of her underlying tax liability under Section \n6330(c)(2)(B)\u2014and may raise \u201cany relevant issue relat-\ning to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A)\u2014\u201conly \nin the context of determining whether\u201d the proposed \nlevy may \u201cproceed,\u201d McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th \n316, 319 (4th Cir.) (citation omitted), cert. denied, 143  \nS. Ct. 408 (2022).  When the \u201cproposed levy is moot,\u201d a \ntaxpayer \u201chas no independent basis to challenge the ex-\nistence or amount of her underlying tax liability in [a \nSection 6330] proceeding,\u201d Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006)\u2014just as she could not have \nused Section 6330 to seek those findings if no levy had \nbeen proposed in the first place. \nThat conclusion follows from the statutory text, which \nrefers to \u201cthe existence or amount of the underlying tax \nliability,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added)\u2014\ni.e., the tax liability \u201cunderlying\u201d the proposed levy.  \nThat language presupposes the existence of a proposed \nlevy, for there is otherwise nothing relevant to Section \n6330 with respect to which the tax liability is \u201cunderly-\ning.\u201d  Ibid.  Section 6330(c)(2)(B) thus allows a taxpayer \nto challenge the existence or amount of her tax liability \n\u201conly in connection with her challenge to the proposed \n[levy].\u201d  Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8.  Here, because \nthe IRS no longer wishes (nor has any need) to pursue \nthe proposed levy, the court of appeals erred in conclud-\ning that the Tax Court has jurisdiction to consider re-\nspondent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B). \n\n12 \n \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nThe court of appeals also reasoned that the Section \n6330 proceeding is \u201cnot moot because the IRS\u2019s setoffs \nwere invalid.\u201d  App., infra, 19a (capitalization omitted).  \nBut \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction.\u201d  \nCommissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. 3, 7 (1987) (per cu-\nriam).  And nothing in Section 6330 grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of authority \nunder Section 6402(a) to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpay-\nments against her tax liability.  See 26 U.S.C. 6330(c) \nand (d). \nThe court of appeals did not suggest otherwise.  In-\nstead, the court pointed to Section 6402(a) itself, which \nauthorizes the IRS to \u201ccredit the amount of [an] over-\npayment, including any interest allowed thereon, against \nany liability in respect of an internal revenue tax on the \npart of the person who made the overpayment.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6402(a); see App., infra, 20a-21a.  The court of appeals \nreasoned that even if Section 6402(a) does \u201cnot explicitly \ngrant[]\u201d the Tax Court jurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s \ncrediting of overpayments against a taxpayer\u2019s liability, \nthat provision should be read to contain \u201can implicit \ngrant\u201d of such power.  App., infra, 20a.  As a court of lim-\nited jurisdiction, however, the Tax Court possesses only \nthe jurisdiction that Congress has \u201cexpressly author-\nized.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320 (citation omitted).  And \nbecause Congress has not expressly authorized the Tax \nCourt to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding, the \ncourt of appeals erred in concluding that the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction.1 \n \n1 In reaching out to decide the issue that it mistakenly found to be \nwithin the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction, the court of appeals also erred \nin concluding that the offsets against respondent\u2019s tax liability were \n\n13 \n \nMoreover, even if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to \nreview offsets in a Section 6330 proceeding, the court of \nappeals still erred in concluding that this Section 6330 \nproceeding is not moot.  The court of appeals assumed \nthat if the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nIRS\u2019s use of respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her \ntax liability, and if those offsets were invalid, the Tax \nCourt would then have jurisdiction to consider respond-\nent\u2019s challenge to \u201cthe IRS\u2019s application of the esti-\nmated payments.\u201d  App., infra, 19a.  But the Tax Court \nwould have jurisdiction under Section 6330 to consider \nsuch a challenge only in connection with a live dispute \nover a proposed levy.  See pp. 10-11, supra.  And a court \ncannot manufacture such a dispute merely by deeming \nthe offsets invalid.  After all, the IRS has no basis for pur-\nsuing a levy so long as the overpayments that respond-\nent made remain \u201cin the government\u2019s pocket.\u201d  App., in-\nfra, 25a.  And not even the court of appeals suggested that \nthe Tax Court would be able to order the IRS to refund \nthose overpayments.2  Cf. Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8 \n \ninvalid.  App., infra, 22a-25a.  The court took the view that the off-\nsets violated the common-law rule that \u201ca creditor cannot set off a \ndisputed debt with an undisputed one.\u201d  Id. at 22a.  But that rule has \nno application under Section 6402(a), which authorizes the IRS to \n\u201ccredit the amount of [an] overpayment  * * *  against any liability,\u201d \nundisputed or not.  26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  The court also believed that \nthe offsets violated \u201cArticle III mootness principles.\u201d  App., infra, \n25a.  But no such principles limit the IRS\u2019s exercise of its authority \nunder Section 6402(a). \n2 Although the court of appeals declined to \u201creach any conclusion \nabout whether the Tax Court has overpayment or refund jurisdic-\ntion in a context like this,\u201d App., infra, 34a n.38, the court of appeals \ndid suggest that the Tax Court could \u201cdeclare that [respondent] had \na right to the estimated payments,\u201d id. at 37a.  But Congress has \nexpressly barred \u201cany court of the United States\u201d from issuing de-\nclaratory relief \u201cwith respect to Federal taxes.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2201(a).  \n\n14 \n \n(holding that the Tax Court lacks \u201cjurisdiction\u201d under \nSection 6330 to \u201corder a refund or credit of taxes paid\u201d).  \nThus, even if the offsets were invalid, the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case would still be moot. \nNone of this is to say that taxpayers may not chal-\nlenge the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments or its \nuse of overpayments to offset their liability.  Taxpayers \nmay do so through a post-deprivation suit for a refund\u2014\nthe traditional mechanism for disputing the assessment \nor collection of a federal tax.  See 26 U.S.C. 7422(a); 28 \nU.S.C. 1346(a)(1), 1491(a)(1).  The proceeding at issue \nhere, however, is a pre-deprivation proceeding for chal-\nlenging a particular method of collection: a proposed \nlevy.  Because the IRS no longer seeks to deprive re-\nspondent of any property by levy, the pre-deprivation \nproceeding in this case is moot. \nB. The Question Presented Warrants This Court\u2019s Review  \n1. As the court of appeals acknowledged, its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways  * * *  with the Fourth and \nD.C. Circuits.\u201d  App., infra, 27a.   \nIn an opinion by Judge Henderson, joined by then-\nJudge Kavanaugh and Judge Pillard, the D.C. Circuit in \nWillson held that a Section 6330 proceeding is \u201c\u200a\u2018moot\u2019\u200a\u201d \nwhen \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy on [the tax-\npayer\u2019s] property.\u201d  805 F.3d at 321 (citation omitted).  \nThe IRS in that case had \u201cabandoned its levy\u201d after de-\ntermining that the taxpayer had no \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax li-\nability.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 320-321.  The D.C. Circuit explained that \nthe absence of a pending levy was \u201cthe very relief [that \nthe taxpayer] ostensibly sought when he requested a \n[Section 6330] hearing to challenge the proposed levy in \n \nThe only relief that Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a pro-\nposed levy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321. \n\n15 \n \nthe first place.\u201d  Id. at 321.  And the D.C. Circuit con-\ncluded that because the taxpayer had \u201creceived all the \nrelief that section 6330 authorize[d] the tax court to \ngrant him,\u201d \u201c\u200a\u2018there was no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss [his case] as \nmoot.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (brackets and citation omitted); see Byers \nv. Commissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 679 (D.C. Cir.) (simi-\nlarly concluding that the IRS\u2019s decision to abandon its \npursuit of a proposed levy meant that the Section 6330 \nproceeding that the taxpayer had requested was \u201cmoot\u201d), \ncert. denied, 574 U.S. 872 (2014). \nIn McLane, the Fourth Circuit reached the same con-\nclusion, holding that a Section 6330 proceeding is \u201cmoot\u201d \nwhen the IRS has \u201calready conceded that a taxpayer \nhas no tax liability\u201d and the taxpayer \u201cno longer faces\u201d \na levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  The taxpayer in that case had \nargued that even though the IRS had abandoned its levy, \n\u201cthe phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] \njurisdiction on the Tax Court to determine that he [had] \noverpaid [his taxes in a particular year] and order a re-\nfund.\u201d  Id. at 318.  The Fourth Circuit rejected that con-\ntention, explaining that \u201cthe phrase \u2018underlying tax liabil-\nity\u2019\u200a\u201d must be read in \u201c\u200a\u2018the specific context in which that \nlanguage is used.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 319 (citation omitted).  View-\ning that context as \u201cthe IRS\u2019s attempt to collect via lien \nor levy,\u201d the Fourth Circuit concluded that \u201cthe \u2018tax-\npayer was permitted to challenge the amount of his un-\nderlying liability in the [Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only \nin the context of determining whether the collection ac-\ntion could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Ibid. (citation omitted).  And be-\ncause the taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d \nibid., the Fourth Circuit affirmed the Tax Court\u2019s deci-\nsion to dismiss the taxpayer\u2019s case, see id. at 318-319. \n\n16 \n \nThe court of appeals in this case correctly recognized \nthat its decision conflicts with Willson and McLane.  \nApp., infra, 27a.  Unlike the D.C. and Fourth Circuits, \nthe court of appeals in this case held that a Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cnot moot\u201d even though the IRS no longer \nseeks to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property.  Id. at 16a (cap-\nitalization omitted); see id. at 16a-39a.  Contrary to the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s decision in McLane, the court of ap-\npeals in this case also held that a taxpayer may continue \nto challenge her \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d under Section \n6330(c)(2)(B) even after the IRS has abandoned its levy.  \nId. at 27a; see ibid. (declining to read \u201c\u200a\u2018underlying tax \nliability\u2019\u200a\u201d as \u201cnarrowly\u201d as the Fourth Circuit).  This \nCourt\u2019s review is warranted to resolve the conflict be-\ntween the decision below and the decisions of the D.C. \nand Fourth Circuits. \n2. The decision below also conflicts with the deci-\nsions of other circuits recognizing that the Tax Court \npossesses only that jurisdiction \u201cexpressly authorized \nby Congress.\u201d  Willson, 805 F.3d at 320 (D.C. Cir.) (ci-\ntation omitted); see Borenstein v. Commissioner, 919 \nF.3d 746, 749 (2d Cir. 2019); McLane, 24 F.4th at 318 \n(4th Cir.); Sanders v. Commissioner, 813 F.2d 859, 861 \n(7th Cir. 1987); see also Brown v. Commissioner, 58 \nF.4th 1064, 1067 (9th Cir. 2023) (recognizing that the \nTax Court \u201chas only the jurisdiction specifically granted \nby statute and lacks the authority to expand upon that \nstatutory grant\u201d).  Despite acknowledging that principle, \nApp., infra, 14a, the decision below departed from it in \nconcluding that the Tax Court had \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdic-\ntion \u201cto review setoffs\u201d and in rejecting the need to point \nto any \u201cexplicit[]\u201d grant of such authority, id. at 20a. \n3. Finally, the decision below threatens significant \npractical consequences.  There are tens of thousands of  \n\n17 \n \nSection 6330 proceedings each year.  See Treasury In-\nspector Gen. for Tax Admin., U.S. Dep\u2019t of the Treas-\nury, Report No. 2023-10-038, Review of the IRS Inde-\npendent Office of Appeals Collection Due Process Pro-\ngram 7 (July 21, 2023), perma.cc/DVL7-9HA8 (report-\ning 28,349 closed Section 6330 cases in 2023).  Absent this \nCourt\u2019s review, the decision below could be invoked to \nconvert many of those proceedings from a limited op-\nportunity for pre-deprivation review into a more gen-\neral forum for considering challenges to tax liability\u2014\nexpanding the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction under Section \n6330 far beyond what Congress contemplated.  See App., \ninfra, 28a.  Review of the court of appeals\u2019 decision trans-\nforming the nature of Section 6330 proceedings, and de-\nparting from Congress\u2019s intent and the decisions of \nother circuits, is warranted. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH B.

Carluzzo \n \nBefore:  JORDAN, KRAUSE, and BIBAS*, Circuit Judges \nOPINION OF THE COURT1 \nJORDAN, Circuit Judge. \nWhen Congress grants taxpayers the right to chal-\nlenge what the Internal Revenue Service says is owed to \nthe government, Congress\u2019s will prevails.  The IRS \ncannot say that such a right exists only under the cir-\n \n* We requested briefing on certain issues from Audrey Patten, Es-\nquire, of the Harvard Law Tax Litigation Clinic, whom we appointed \nas Amicus Curiae. We are grateful for the thoughtful insights pro-\nvided by Ms. Patten and the Clinic. \n1  Judge Bibas joins the opinion in full except for Section II.C.3. \n\n2a \n \ncumstances it prescribes.  That ought to go without \nsaying, but this case requires us to say it. \nThe IRS sent Jennifer Zuch a notice informing her \nthat it intended to levy on her property to collect unpaid \ntax.  She challenged the levy, arguing that she had pre-\npaid the tax.  The IRS Independent Office of Appeals \n(the \u201cIRS Office of Appeals\u201d) sustained the levy, and \nZuch petitioned the United States Tax Court for review \nof that decision.  While the issue was being litigated in \nthat Court over several years, the IRS withheld tax re-\nfunds owed to Zuch and applied them to what it said was \nher unpaid balance, satisfying it in full.  When, accord-\ning to the IRS\u2019s accounting, there was no more tax to be \npaid, the IRS filed a motion to dismiss the Tax Court \nproceeding for mootness, and the Court granted the mo-\ntion. \nBecause Zuch\u2019s claim is not moot, we will vacate the \ndismissal and remand this matter to the Tax Court to \ndetermine whether Zuch\u2019s petition is meritorious. \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nA. \nOverview of Tax Court Proceedings \nSome understanding of tax procedure is essential to \nthe consideration of this case, so we begin with a brief \nsummary of the two basic pathways by which taxpayers \ncan dispute what they owe the government before the \nIRS collects:  deficiency proceedings and collection \ndue process hearings.2  After addressing a key ques-\ntion related to these pathways\u2014the distinction between \n \n2  If a taxpayer wishes to dispute what he owes after the IRS col-\nlects, he must file a refund action in a federal district court or the \nCourt of Federal Claims.  26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422. \n\n3a \n \nunpaid tax and tax liability\u2014we turn to the factual and \nprocedural background that led to this appeal. \n1.  Deficiency Proceedings \nWhen the IRS decides that a taxpayer owes more \nthan the amount reported on her tax return, it mails the \ntaxpayer a \u201cnotice of  . . .  deficiency.\u201d3  26 U.S.C.  \n\u00a7 6212(a).4  The taxpayer may challenge the IRS\u2019s tax \ndetermination before collection by filing a petition in the \nTax Court within ninety days after the mailing of the \nnotice of deficiency.  \u00a7 6213(a).  Such a petition com-\nmences a \u201cdeficiency proceeding[].\u201d  Cooper v. Comm\u2019r, \n718 F.3d 216, 223 (3d Cir. 2013).  Deficiency proceed-\nings are \u201c[t]he Tax Court\u2019s principal basis for jurisdic-\ntion[.]\u201d  Sunoco Inc. v. Comm\u2019r, 663 F.3d 181, 187 (3d \nCir. 2011).  In a deficiency proceeding, the Tax Court \nhas jurisdiction to determine the correct amount of tax \nowed, \u00a7 6214(a), and to order that any overpayments be \nrefunded to a taxpayer, \u00a7 6512(b)(1).  The Tax Court\u2019s \nfinal order in a deficiency proceeding is subject to re-\nview by an Article III court.  \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \n2.  Collection Due Process Proceedings \nIf a taxpayer does not pay the amount the IRS says \nis due, the IRS can levy\u2014that is, seize and sell\u2014a tax-\n \n3  A notice of deficiency is a \u201cjurisdictional prerequisite\u201d to liti-\ngate the merits of the IRS\u2019s deficiency determination in the Tax \nCourt.  Laing v. United States, 423 U.S. 161, 165 n.4 (1976).  We \nhave called the notice of deficiency the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cticket to the Tax \nCourt[.]\u201d  Robinson v. United States, 920 F.2d 1157, 1158 (3d Cir. \n1990) (internal quotation marks omitted). \n4  Unless otherwise indicated, all section references in the remain-\nder of this opinion are to the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as \namended, 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq. \n\n4a \n \npayer\u2019s property to satisfy the tax liability.  \u00a7 6331(a).  \nBut, before it does so, it must provide the taxpayer no-\ntice and an opportunity for a hearing to contest the levy. \n\u00a7 6330(a)(1).  After the IRS sends notice to the tax-\npayer of its intent to levy, the taxpayer has thirty days \nto request a hearing.  \u00a7 6330(a)(3)(B).  That hearing, \nknown as a Collection Due Process (\u201cCDP\u201d) hearing, is \n\u201can administrative proceeding before an appeals officer \nwith the [IRS Office of Appeals] in which a taxpayer may \nraise \u2018any relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the \nproposed levy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  United States v. Weiss, 52 F.4th 546, \n548 (3d Cir. 2022) (quoting \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A)).  Under  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), the taxpayer \nmay also raise at the [CDP] hearing challenges to the \nexistence or amount of [his or her] underlying tax li-\nability for any tax period if [he or she] did not receive \nany statutory notice of deficiency for such tax liabil-\nity or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability. \nThis scheme makes good sense in light of potential \ndue process concerns.  \u201c[S]ome form of hearing is re-\nquired before an individual is finally deprived of a prop-\nerty interest[,]\u201d Mathews v. Eldridge, 424 U.S. 319, 333 \n(1976), and a taxpayer who cannot challenge a levy  \nbefore seizure and sale may wrongfully lose property \nwithout notice or the opportunity to be heard, see  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  Similarly, and particularly relevant \nhere, a taxpayer who cannot challenge her underlying \nliability before collection may wrongfully lose money \nwithout notice or a hearing.  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); see gener-\nally S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67 (1998) (\u201c[T]he IRS should \nafford taxpayers adequate notice of collection activity \n\n5a \n \nand a meaningful hearing before the IRS deprives them \nof their property.\u201d). \nSo, to recap:  If the taxpayer could have commenced \na deficiency proceeding before the CDP hearing, the \nhearing provides a forum to challenge the unpaid tax \nand proposed levy only.  But if the taxpayer had no op-\nportunity to commence a deficiency proceeding, the CDP \nhearing provides a forum to challenge the unpaid tax, \nthe proposed levy, and the underlying tax liability. \nOnce the IRS Office of Appeals makes a determina-\ntion on the taxpayer\u2019s challenges, the taxpayer has thirty \ndays to petition the Tax Court to review any issues that \nwere properly raised at the CDP hearing.  \u00a7 6330(d)(1).  \nAgain, the Tax Court\u2019s final order is subject to review \nby an Article III court.  \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \n3.  Unpaid Tax Versus Tax Liability \nSection 6330(c)(2)(B) of the Internal Revenue Code \nraises an important question:  What is the difference \nbetween unpaid tax and tax liability?  There must be \nsome distinction, or else the language in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nallowing a challenge to liability would be superfluous.5  \nCongress confined the right to raise a liability challenge \nto taxpayers who did not have a previous opportunity to \ndo so, while at the same time granting all taxpayers in a \nCDP hearing the ability to raise issues relating to the \nunpaid tax or proposed levy.  Hence, it is evident that \nCongress intended to grant to qualifying taxpayers \n \n5  Section 6330(c)(2)(A) authorizes a taxpayer to raise \u201cany rele-\nvant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the proposed levy,\u201d while  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) grants qualifying taxpayers an opportunity to raise \n\u201cchallenges to the existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity.\u201d \n\n6a \n \nsome right in addition to the rights given to all taxpay-\ners in a CDP hearing.  See infra section II.C.3.  On \nthat basis, \u201cunpaid tax\u201d cannot be synonymous with \u201ctax \nliability.\u201d  See also United States v. Yung, 37 F.4th 70, \n79 (3d Cir. 2022) (\u201cNormally, where Congress uses dif-\nferent words, we read those words to have different \nmeanings.\u201d). \nThere is indeed a distinction:  West\u2019s Tax Law Dic-\ntionary defines \u201ctax liability\u201d as the \u201c[t]otal amount of \ntax owed to the I.R.S. after the allowance of any proper \ncredits.\u201d  Tax Liability, West\u2019s Tax Law Dictionary  \n\u00a7 T830 (emphasis added).  And it defines credit as \u201can \nallowance against the tax itself [including] [i]ncome tax \nwithheld on wages, prepaid estimated taxes, [etc.]\u201d \nCredit, West\u2019s Tax Law Dictionary \u00a7 C4530 (emphasis \nadded).  Tax liability is therefore the net amount owed \nto the IRS:  If you owe $20 to the IRS and have prepaid \nthat $20, your tax liability\u2014at least on these simple facts \n\u2014is $0.  Understanding \u201ctax liability\u201d in this way ac-\ncords with the plain meaning of \u201cliability.\u201d  To say, \u201cI \nhave no liability\u201d is to say, in effect, \u201cI owe nothing.\u201d  A \n\u201cchallenge\u201d to liability under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) means the \ntaxpayer disputes what the IRS says he owes. \nIn contrast, \u201cissue[s] relating to the unpaid tax\u201d un-\nder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) do not directly concern the amount \nand existence of the liability.  Instead, such issues con-\ncern the IRS\u2019s proposed collection activity, as illus-\ntrated by the three examples Congress provides in the \nstatute:  \u201c(i) appropriate spousal defenses [for a spouse \nwho filed a joint tax return]; (ii) challenges to the appro-\npriateness of collection actions; and (iii) offers of collec-\ntion alternatives.\u201d  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  In each case, the \nfocus is not on the liability itself, but is rather on the \n\n7a \n \nmethod the IRS will use to collect what it says is due to \nthe government.  See Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6330-1(e)(3), \nQ&A (E)(3) (2006) (\u201cWhen a taxpayer asserts a spousal \ndefense, the taxpayer is not disputing the amount or ex-\nistence of the liability itself\u200a[.]\u201d). \nStrictly speaking, then, unpaid tax means something \ndifferent than tax liability.  For example, assuming \nthat the IRS has assessed $20 in taxes, your unpaid tax \nis just that:  the $20 the IRS says you owe.  But fur-\nther proceedings can change that number.  If a defi-\nciency proceeding or a challenge under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nin a CDP hearing establishes that the IRS should have \ncredited $5 toward the $20 balance, your liability is $15, \nand, once fixed by those further proceedings, that sum \nalso becomes your unpaid tax. \nB. \nFactual Background6 \nZuch and Patrick Gennardo7 were married from 1993 \nto 2014.  On September 12, 2012, they filed separate, \nuntimely tax returns for the 2010 tax year, each electing \nmarried-filing-separately status. 8  Zuch\u2019s tax return \n \n6  Unless otherwise noted, the facts are undisputed.  They are \ntaken primarily from the stipulated factual record submitted to the \nTax Court. \n7  Gennardo is not a party in this proceeding. \n8  A taxpayer must elect one of several filing statuses when sub-\nmitting an individual income tax return.  See IRS, 1040 (and 1040-\nSR): Instructions 13 (2023), https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/i1040gi. \npdf [https://perma.cc/X76A-GVKC].  Unmarried taxpayers who \ndo not have a qualifying dependent must elect \u201cSingle\u201d status.  Id.  \nUnmarried taxpayers who have a qualifying dependent may elect \n\u201cHead of Household\u201d status.  Id. at 14-15.  Married taxpayers have \nthe option to elect either \u201cMarried Filing Jointly\u201d or \u201cMarried Fil-\ning Separately\u201d status.  Id. at 13-14.  Unmarried persons whose \n \n\n8a \n \nshowed adjusted gross income of $74,493 and an over-\npayment of tax of $731.9  Gennardo\u2019s tax return showed \nadjusted gross income of $1,077,213 and tax due of \n$385,393.  On that same day, Gennardo filed an offer-\nin-compromise to settle his tax debts for the 2007 to 2011 \ntax years.10 \nAll of this had been preceded in 2010 and 2011 by two \nprepayments of the couple\u2019s estimated tax liability for \n2010.  More specifically, in June of 2010, the couple \nsubmitted an estimated tax payment of $20,000 to the \nIRS for the 2010 tax year.11  Gennardo then, in January \nof 2011, sent an estimated tax payment of $30,000 for the \n2010 tax year.12  When they made the payments, Zuch \nand Gennardo did not specify how they wanted to have \nthe IRS allocate those payments to their respective tax \nliabilities, and Zuch\u2019s late-filed 2010 tax return did not \nmention the estimated payments.  After processing \nGennardo\u2019s return, the IRS sent him a notice, in October \nof 2012, that showed it had applied the full $50,000 in \nestimated payments to offset the tax due on his individ-\nual 2010 return. \n \nspouse died during the previous two tax years and who have a qual-\nifying dependent may elect \u201cQualifying Surviving Spouse\u201d status.  \nId. at 15. \n9  The IRS applied that overpayment to the couple\u2019s 2008 unpaid \ntax liability. \n10 An offer-in-compromise allows a taxpayer to settle tax debts for \nless than the total amount of the outstanding liability.  \u00a7 7122(a). \n11 The check was drawn from a bank account that listed both \nZuch\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s names.  The accompanying Form 1040-ES \nalso listed both of their names. \n12 The check Gennardo used to make the payment listed only his \nname.  The cover letter accompanying the check, however, listed \nboth Zuch\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s names. \n\n9a \n \nLater, in November of 2012, Zuch filed an amended \n2010 tax return to report additional income of $71,000 \nfrom a retirement account distribution, causing addi-\ntional tax due of $27,682.  On that return, she claimed \nthe benefit of the same $50,000 in estimated payments \nand requested a refund of $21,918.  The IRS assessed \nZuch the additional tax she reported, but it did not re-\nfund or otherwise credit her for the $50,000 in estimated \npayments that she claimed.  It also allegedly sent her \na notice and demand for payment of her additional tax \ndue, but she disputes ever having been sent such a no-\ntice.13 \nSoon after, in March of 2013, Gennardo filed an \namended tax return for the 2010 tax year.  He included \na statement that he was amending his return in part to \nnotify the IRS that there were estimated payments of \n$50,000 that should be allocated to Zuch,14 apparently \nshowing his approval of Zuch\u2019s previously filed amended \n \n13 Before the Tax Court, the IRS and Zuch jointly stipulated that \nthe IRS had sent her a notice of tax due and demand for payment.  \nIn her briefing, Zuch now asserts that the IRS never notified her.  \nA notice of tax due and demand for payment is not to be confused \nwith a notice of deficiency; the IRS uses the former to notify the \ntaxpayer of an unpaid tax and to demand payment, Notice CP14, \nTaxpayer Advoc. Serv. (updated July 11, 2023), https://www. \ntaxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/notices/notice-cp14/[https://perma.cc/H92Z-\nM9QM], while the IRS uses the latter to notify a taxpayer that it is \nproposing to increase the total amount of tax due for a particular \ntax year, 90 Day Notice of Deficiency, Taxpayer Advoc. Serv. (up-\ndated Dec. 6, 2023), https://www.taxpayeradvocate.irs.gov/notices/ \nexam-90-day-notice-of-deficiency/ [https://perma.cc/VZX2-84JZ].  \nIt is undisputed that Zuch never received a notice of deficiency. \n14 Gennardo did not mention on his tax return that the IRS had al-\nready allocated the $50,000 in estimated payments to him or that he \nhad an offer-in-compromise pending. \n\n10a \n \nreturn in which she claimed the benefit of the estimated \npayments.15  But the IRS did not adjust the allocation \nof the $50,000 from Gennardo to Zuch.  In June of 2013, \nGennardo submitted an amended offer-in-compromise \nto increase the amount of his offer, which the IRS ac-\ncepted the next month.  Despite his earlier direction \nthat the estimated payments should be allocated to \nZuch, the IRS gave him a document showing it had cred-\nited the $50,000 in estimated payments to his outstand-\ning tax liability. \nC. \nProcedural Background \n \n1. \nZuch\u2019s CDP Hearing \nOn August 31, 2013, the IRS sent Zuch a \u201cFinal No-\ntice of Intent to Levy and Notice of your Right to a \nHearing.\u201d  (App. at 563.)  That notice informed her \nthat the IRS intended to levy on her property for failing \nto pay her remaining 2010 tax liability of approximately \n$36,000 and that she had thirty days to appeal the levy \nby requesting a CDP hearing with the IRS Office of Ap-\npeals.  Zuch timely requested a CDP hearing, and be-\ncause she did not receive a notice of deficiency or \u201coth-\nerwise have an opportunity to dispute [her] tax liabil-\nity,\u201d she exercised her right to challenge \u201cthe existence \nor amount of the underlying tax liability\u201d in the CDP \nproceedings.  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  Specifically, Zuch al-\nleged that the $50,000 of estimated tax payments cred-\nited to Gennardo should have been credited to her, mak-\ning her underlying tax liability $0.16  Prior to the hear-\n \n15 Zuch\u2019s and Gennardo\u2019s amended tax returns were prepared by \nthe same tax preparer. \n16 Zuch also requested that the IRS abate any underpayment pen-\nalties against her because she was going through a divorce with Gen-\n \n\n11a \n \ning, Zuch\u2019s counsel submitted a signed declaration from \nGennardo directing the IRS to apply the $50,000 to \nZuch\u2019s personal tax liability.17 \nThe CDP hearing was held via telephone on July 29, \n2014.  During the hearing, an IRS officer told Zuch\u2019s \ncounsel that he did not believe that the IRS could credit \nany of the estimated payments to Zuch\u2019s liability because \nthey had already been credited to Gennardo\u2019s account, \nwhich had been subject to an offer-in-compromise.  On \nSeptember 25, 2014, the IRS Office of Appeals sent Zuch \na Notice of Determination sustaining the IRS\u2019s pro-\nposed levy and stating it was \u201cnot in a position\u201d to move \ncredits from Gennardo\u2019s account to hers.  (App. at 294.)  \nThat notice also informed Zuch that she had thirty days \nto dispute the IRS\u2019s determination by filing a petition \nwith the Tax Court. \n \n2. \nZuch\u2019s Tax Court Proceedings \nZuch did petition the Tax Court for relief.  She \nasked the Court to conduct a de novo review of her un-\nderlying tax liability and conclude that the $50,000 in es-\ntimated tax payments should be applied to her individ-\nual account.  The IRS moved for summary judgment, \nwhich the Tax Court denied in December 2016.  It \nmade three observations at that time.  First, it stated \nthat the initial $20,000 estimated payment appeared to \nbe a joint estimated tax payment and that it was unclear \nwhy the IRS had applied the payment to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s \n \nnardo and collection would create an undue hardship for her.  The \nIRS denied that request. \n17 The IRS notes in its briefing that the declaration was signed in \nMarch 2014, nearly eight months after Gennardo had received \ncredit for the estimated payments pursuant to his amended offer-\nin-compromise. \n\n12a \n \ntax liabilities.  Second, the Court explained that it was \n\u201cunclear whether the [later] $30,000 payment was a sep-\narate payment or a joint payment.\u201d  (App. at 264.)  \nAnd third, it noted that the \u201ccircumstances surrounding \nMr. Gennardo\u2019s [offer-in-compromise were] not clear[,]\u201d \nincluding whether that offer-in-compromise satisfied \nZuch and Gennardo\u2019s joint tax liabilities for any years \nthey filed a joint tax return and, if so, whether Zuch was \ninvolved in the offer-in-compromise process.  (App. at \n264.) \nThe Tax Court then granted the IRS\u2019s unopposed \nmotion to remand the case to the IRS Office of Appeals.  \nIn June 2017, the IRS issued a Supplemental Notice of \nDetermination, confirming its prior determination to \nsustain the levy and stating that it received no new in-\nformation that would compel it to change its prior deci-\nsion.  The case returned to the Tax Court and was ini-\ntially set for trial.  Instead, the parties agreed to forgo \ntrial and proceed on a stipulated factual record.18 \n \n3. \nCredit Setoffs \nThroughout the several years Zuch was arguing with \nthe IRS about her 2010 tax liability, including in the \nCDP hearing and in the Tax Court, the IRS was taking \ntax refunds that Zuch was owed in later tax years and \napplying them to what it calculated to be her 2010 tax \nliability.  It did this six times\u2014once each in 2013, 2014, \n \n18 Tax Court Rule 122(a) provides, \u201cAny case not requiring a trial \nfor the submission of evidence (as, for example, where sufficient \nfacts have been admitted [or] stipulated  . . . )  may be submitted  \n. . .  by motion of the parties filed with the Court.\u201d \n\n13a \n \n2015, and 2019, and twice in 2016.19  On April 15, 2019, \nthe IRS used a refund to set off the remainder of Zuch\u2019s \n2010 unpaid tax, reducing the balance due to $0. \nWith no remaining unpaid tax on which to execute a \nlevy, the IRS moved to dismiss the Tax Court proceed-\ning as moot.  Zuch opposed the motion, but the Tax \nCourt granted it and dismissed the petition.  In a short \norder, the Court held that the case was moot.  Without \nacknowledging \u00a7 6330(c)(2)\u2019s distinction between unpaid \ntax and underlying tax liability, the Court found there \nwas no longer a live controversy because there was \u201cno \nunpaid liability  . . .  upon which a levy could be \nbased\u201d and the IRS was \u201cno longer pursuing the pro-\nposed collection action[.]\u201d  (App. at 7-8.)  It also ex-\nplained that the Tax Court was not the proper forum to \ndetermine whether Zuch had overpaid because it lacked \n\u201cjurisdiction to determine an overpayment or to order a \nrefund or credit of tax paid in a [CDP] proceeding[.]\u201d  \n(App. at 7.) \nZuch timely appealed the Tax Court\u2019s order. \nII. DISCUSSION20 \nThe dispute comes down to this:  whether, in the \nmidst of litigation over a contested tax liability, the IRS \n \n19 In its briefing and at oral argument, the IRS alleged that Zuch \nshould have received notice of the setoffs.  But it provided no evi-\ndentiary support that notice was sent to her. \n20 The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7\u00a7 6330(d)(1) and 7442.  \nWe have jurisdiction pursuant to \u00a7 7482(a)(1).  We exercise \u201cde novo \nreview over the Tax Court\u2019s findings of law, including its construc-\ntion and application of the Internal Revenue Code.\u201d  DeNaples v. \nComm\u2019r, 674 F.3d 172, 176 (3d Cir. 2012).  We review factual find-\nings for clear error.  Id. \n\n14a \n \nis free to deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction by the \nexpedient of taking the taxpayer\u2019s tax refunds and ap-\nplying them to that liability.  The answer is no.  The \nIRS\u2019s arrogation to itself of the power to eliminate pre-\ndeprivation judicial review of liability by seizing a tax-\npayer\u2019s money to cover a disputed debt is not supported \nby relevant statute, common law (incorporated into stat-\nute), or mootness principles. \nA. \nThe Tax Court Originally Had Jurisdiction to \nHear Zuch\u2019s Claim. \nThe Tax Court is a tribunal of limited jurisdiction.  \nSunoco, 663 F.3d at 187.  Being organized under Arti-\ncle I of the Constitution, it possesses only the power \u201cex-\npressly conferred by Congress.\u201d  Id.  Congress has \ngranted the Tax Court jurisdiction to review decisions \nmade by the IRS Office of Appeals in CDP hearings.   \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1).  Specifically, the Tax Court is to consider \n\u201cany relevant issue [raised by the taxpayer] relating to \nthe unpaid tax or the proposed levy[.]\u201d  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A).  \nIf the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any statutory notice of \ndeficiency for [his or her] tax liability or did not other-\nwise have an opportunity to dispute such tax liability[,]\u201d \nthe Court must, in addition, consider any challenge \u201cto \nthe existence or amount of the underlying tax liabil-\nity[.]\u201d  \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nZuch fell into the latter category, disputing her 2010 \ntax liability at the CDP hearing by arguing that the \n$50,000 provided by her and Gennardo as estimated tax \npayments should have been applied to satisfy her tax li-\nability instead of Gennardo\u2019s.  Because Zuch had nei-\nther received a notice of deficiency nor had an oppor-\ntunity to contest the allocation of the tax payments prior \n\n15a \n \nto her CDP hearing,21 the IRS was required to consider \nher challenge.  The IRS did so, finding that the $50,000 \ncould not be credited to Zuch and sustaining the levy.  \nAccordingly, the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review \nthat determination, including whether the estimated \npayments were allocated correctly.22 \nB. \nThe Tax Court Applies Article III Case or Contro-\nversy Principles to Determine Mootness. \n\u201cArticle III of the Constitution restricts the power of \nfederal courts to \u2018Cases\u2019 and \u2018Controversies.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Chafin \nv. Chafin, 568 U.S. 165, 171 (2013).  As an Article I tri-\nbunal, however, the Tax Court \u201cis not fully constrained \nby Article III\u2019s case or controversy limitation.\u201d  Bar-\nanowicz v. Comm\u2019r, 432 F.3d 972, 975 (9th Cir. 2005).  \nNevertheless, the Tax Court wisely applies that con-\nstraint to itself, Battat v. Comm\u2019r, 148 T.C. 32, 46 (2017) \n(\u201cThe case or controversy requirement under Article III \npresumptively applies in the Tax Court.\u201d), and, of course, \nis free to do so for prudential reasons, cf. Zevalkink v. \nBrown, 102 F.3d 1236, 1243 (Fed. Cir. 1996) (\u201cAs a court \nestablished under Article I of the U.S. Constitution, the \nCourt of Veterans Appeals  . . .  has decided, based \non the same prudential considerations behind the \u2018case \nor controversy\u2019 requirement,  . . .  that it would re-\n \n21 Zuch did not receive a notice of deficiency because the amount \nof tax due that she reported, without taking any payments into ac-\ncount, is not in dispute.  See supra note 13. \n22 The IRS does not dispute that the Tax Court originally had ju-\nrisdiction to review the proper allocation of the estimated tax pay-\nments.  (Supp. Br. at 15 (\u201cIf Zuch\u2019s tax liability for 2010 had not \nbeen fully satisfied by the credit offsets, we agree that the case \nwould not be moot and that the Tax Court could review the proper \nallocation of the estimated tax payments.\u201d).) \n\n16a \n \nfrain from deciding cases that do not present an actual \ncase or controversy.\u201d).  Zuch and the IRS agree that \nthe Tax Court need not hear a moot case.  Accordingly, \nfor purposes of this matter, we discuss and apply Article \nIII mootness principles to determine whether Zuch\u2019s \nclaim is moot. \nArticle III permits federal courts to \u201centertain ac-\ntions only if [those actions] present live disputes, ones in \nwhich both sides have a personal stake.\u201d  Hartnett v. \nPa.

Thus, a case becomes moot, and a fed-\neral court is deprived of jurisdiction to hear that case, \nwhen there is no longer a live case or controversy be-\ntween the litigants.  Id.  \u201cAs long as the parties have \na concrete interest, however small, in the outcome of the \nlitigation, the case is not moot.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  Therefore, a case \u201cbecomes moot only \nwhen it is impossible for a court to grant any effectual \nrelief whatever to the prevailing party.\u201d  Knox v. Serv. \nEmps. Int\u2019l Union, Loc. 1000, 567 U.S. 298, 307 (2012) \n(cleaned up).  A defendant faces a \u201cheavy burden\u201d \nwhen trying to persuade a court that there is no longer \na live controversy.  Hartnett, 963 F.3d at 305-06 (inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted). \nC. \nZuch\u2019s Claim Is Not Moot. \nThe parties dispute whether Zuch\u2019s claim falls under \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) or \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  We therefore first \naddress how Zuch\u2019s claim should be characterized, be-\nfore turning to the question of mootness. \n\n17a \n \n \n1. The Characterization of Zuch\u2019s Claim. \nIn the Notice of Determination that Zuch received, \nthe IRS listed her challenge to the allocation of the esti-\nmated payments under the heading \u201cChallenges to the \nLiability.\u201d  (App. at 298.)  Now, however, it argues \nthat a challenge to the allocation of estimated tax pay-\nments is not a challenge to the \u201cunderlying liability,\u201d \nwhich involves \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), but is rather a challenge \n\u201crelating to the unpaid tax\u201d under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). 23  \nSee supra section I.A.3.  It says that Zuch\u2019s claim \nshould be understood not as involving the net amount \nshe owes to the IRS, but rather the amount of tax she \nself-reported on her amended return, separate from any \npayments she reported or paid to satisfy that tax.  \nThus, the IRS asserts that once there is no levy and no \nunpaid tax, the challenge to the proper allocation of the \npayments is extinguished because Zuch\u2019s underlying tax \nliability, as the IRS defines it, is not disputed. \nThis is, to be frank, nothing but self-serving word \nplay.  The IRS says an \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must \nbe understood by looking only at the \u201ctotal tax\u201d line on \na return, while turning a blind eye to estimated tax pay-\nments listed on the very same return.  But Zuch\u2019s \u201ctax \nliability\u201d did not exist in a vacuum, separate from pay-\n \n23 See also I.R.S. Notice CC-2014-002 (May 5, 2014), 2014 WL \n2003048 (explaining the IRS\u2019s view that a challenge to whether the \nIRS properly applied a payment is a challenge to the unpaid tax \nunder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), subject to abuse-of-discretion review, rather \nthan a challenge to the underlying tax liability under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), \nsubject to de novo review). \n\n18a \n \nments she made on that liability.24  She would only have \nan underlying liability if the tax was unpaid after she \nfiled her amended return. \nPerhaps because its meaning is clear, the term \u201cun-\nderlying tax liability\u201d is not defined by statute, nor is \nthere any reference to its meaning in the relevant legis-\nlative history.  Montgomery v. Comm\u2019r, 122 T.C. 1, 7 \n(2004).  Yet, the Tax Court has been inconsistent in \ntreating challenges to the IRS\u2019s application of payments \nand credits toward tax as, in some instances, falling  \nunder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), and in others as under  \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  Compare Landry v. Comm\u2019r, 116 T.C. \n60, 62 (2001) (\u201c[T]he validity of the underlying tax liabil-\nity, i.e., the amount unpaid after application of credits \nto which petitioner is entitled, is properly at issue[.]\u201d  \n(emphasis added)), Boyd v. Comm\u2019r, 117 T.C. 127, 131 \n(2001) (same), and Dysle v. Comm\u2019r, T.C.M. (RIA) 2004-\n285, at 3 (same), with Melasky v. Comm\u2019r, 151 T.C. 89, \n92 (2018) (\u201cA question about whether the IRS properly \n \n24 Even the Greene-Thapedi court, see infra section II.C.3, ac-\nknowledged that the Tax Court may need to consider tax payments \nin reviewing a challenge to the underlying tax liability:   \nWe do not mean to suggest that this Court is foreclosed from \nconsidering whether the taxpayer has paid more than was owed, \nwhere such a determination is necessary for a correct and com-\nplete determination of whether the proposed collection action \nshould proceed.  Conceivably, there could be a collection action \nreview proceeding where  . . .  the proposed collection action \nis not moot and where pursuant to sec. 6330(c)(2)(B), the tax-\npayer is entitled to challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  In such a case, the validity of the pro-\nposed collection action might depend upon whether the taxpayer \nhas any unpaid balance, which might implicate the question of \nwhether the taxpayer has paid more than was owed.   \nGreene-Thapedi v. Comm\u2019r, 126 T.C. 1, 11 n.19 (2006). \n\n19a \n \ncredited a payment is not a challenge to a tax liability; \ni.e., the amount of tax imposed by the Code for a partic-\nular year.  It is instead a question of whether the liabil-\nity remains unpaid.\u201d  (emphases omitted)). \nThe inconsistency is puzzling since it seems obvious \nthat a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cchallenge[] to the existence or amount \nof the underlying tax liability\u201d involves whether and  \nhow much the taxpayer has paid on that liability.   \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  A dispute over whether the IRS ap-\npropriately credited a taxpayer\u2019s account with esti-\nmated tax payments is, at bottom, a dispute over the tax-\npayer\u2019s underlying tax liability.  The point is one of \nplain English.  Therefore, Zuch\u2019s argument that her \nestimated tax payments were erroneously allocated to \nher ex-husband is a challenge to her underlying tax lia-\nbility under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). \nNonetheless, even if the IRS is correct that Zuch\u2019s \nclaim is properly characterized as a challenge to unpaid \ntax under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), the IRS still loses. \n \n2.  Zuch\u2019s Claim Is Not Moot Because the IRS\u2019s \nSetoffs Were Invalid. \nBecause, as explained below, the Tax Court retains \njurisdiction to review setoffs, and the IRS cannot satisfy \na tax dispute by means of unlawful credit setoffs, Zuch\u2019s \ntax obligation was not properly set off, and she can chal-\nlenge the IRS\u2019s application of the estimated payments.25 \n \n25 As noted previously, the IRS does not dispute that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction to hear Zuch\u2019s claim regarding the estimated tax \npayments at issue prior to the IRS\u2019s credit setoffs, see supra note \n22, albeit under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). \n\n20a \n \n \na) The Tax Court has jurisdiction to review \nsetoffs. \nUnder \u00a7 6402(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, the \nIRS normally must refund to taxpayers any tax pay-\nments in excess of their liability for that taxable year.  \nBut \u00a7 6402(a) allows the IRS to apply any refund amount \nas a setoff against a taxpayer\u2019s unpaid tax debts, thus \nlowering or eliminating the amount of the refund. \nThe IRS contends that, in \u00a7 6512(b)(4), Congress af-\nfirmatively stripped the Tax Court of its jurisdiction to \nreview setoffs.  That provision says the \u201cTax Court \nshall have no jurisdiction under this subsection to re-\nstrain or review any credit or reduction made by the \nSecretary under section 6402.\u201d  \u00a7 6512(b)(4) (emphasis \nadded).  But, by its terms, subsection 6512(b) is limited \nto describing the Tax Court\u2019s overpayment and refund \njurisdiction in a deficiency proceeding.  See supra Sec-\ntion I.A.1.  It does not refer to CDP proceedings, so \nthat jurisdiction stripping provision is plainly inapplica-\nble.  It does not affect Zuch\u2019s case.26 \nThe IRS also asserts that Congress did not affirma-\ntively grant the Tax Court the power to review setoffs in \na CDP case.  It may be that Congress has not explicitly \ngranted the Tax Court such power, but an implicit grant \nallows the Court to review setoffs in any event. \nAs the Tax Court has recognized, \u201c[s]ection 6402(a) \ncontains a statutory counterpart\u201d to the common law \n \n26 In its opening brief and at oral argument, the IRS argued that  \n\u00a7 6402(g) also barred judicial review of tax setoffs under \u00a7 6402 \u201cin \nthe Tax Court or anywhere else.\u201d  (Answering Br. at 22; Oral Arg. \nTrans. at 85-87.)  It retreated from that position in its supplemental \nbriefing. \n\n21a \n \nright of offset.  Boyd v. Comm\u2019r, 124 T.C. 296, 300 \n(2005).  And the common law of setoffs \u201ccalls for judi-\ncial review of the merits of the claim being invoked as an \noffset of a government debt.\u201d  Agility Pub. Warehous-\ning Co. K.S.C.P. v. United States, 969 F.3d 1355, 1365 \n(Fed. Cir. 2020).  For example, the Federal Circuit has \n\u201cemphasized that the Debt Collection Act [of 1982, Pub. \nL. No. 97-365, 96 Stat. 1749,27] was intended to supple-\nment, and not displace, the government\u2019s pre-existing \noffset rights under the common law.\u201d  McCall Stock \nFarms, Inc. v. United States, 14 F.3d 1562, 1566 (Fed. \nCir. 1993).  \u201cCongress understood that to trigger the \n[Debt Collection Act\u2019s] offset provision, a pre-existing, \nvalid debt must first be owed to the United States.\u201d  \nAgility, 969 F.3d at 1364.  Accordingly, the court rea-\nsoned that the Act \u201ccannot be reasonably interpreted as \nshielding from judicial review the United States\u2019 deter-\nmination that a pre-[existing] debt is owed.\u201d  Id. \nBecause \u00a7 6402 carries forward the common law of \nsetoffs, and because that section says nothing about dis-\nallowing Tax Court offset review (as Congress has ex-\npressly and specifically stated elsewhere in the Tax \nCode), it follows that the Court has the power to review \nsetoffs in a CDP proceeding to determine whether there \nwas a pre-existing, valid debt that was owed to the IRS. \n \n \n \n27 Akin to \u00a7 6402(a), the Debt Collection Act provides, in relevant \npart, that the government may collect an outstanding debt owed to \nthe United States \u201cby [means of\u200a] administrative offset,\u201d 31 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 3716(a), which means to \u201cwithhold[] funds payable by the United \nStates  . . .  to  . . .  a person to satisfy\u201d a debt that the per-\nson owes the government, id. \u00a7 3701(a)(1). \n\n22a \n \n \nb) The IRS setoffs violated setoff common \nlaw and Article III mootness principles \nand are thus invalid. \nThe \u201cright of setoff (also called \u2018offset\u2019) allows [par-\nties] that owe each other money to apply their mutual \ndebts against each other, thereby avoiding \u2018the absurd-\nity of making A pay B when B owes A.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Citizens Bank \nof Md. v. Strumpf, 516 U.S. 16, 18 (1995) (quoting \nStudley v. Boylston Nat\u2019l Bank of Bos., 229 U.S. 523, 528 \n(1913)).  The right to apply mutual debts to offset each \nother does not apply when the debts are disputed.  Ac-\ncordingly, a creditor cannot set off a disputed debt with \nan undisputed one.  That is a matter of black letter law.  \nSetoff, Black\u2019s Law Dictionary (11th ed. 2019) (\u201cSet off \nis a mode of defence by which the defendant acknowl-\nedges the justice of the plaintiff\u200a\u2019s demand, but sets up a \ndemand of his own against the plaintiff, to counter- \nbalance it either in whole or in part.\u201d  (emphasis added) \n(quoting Oliver L. Barbour, A Treatise on the Law of Set \nOff 3 (1841))); 15 Williston on Contracts \u00a7 44:34 (West \n2023) (explaining that \u201cmutual debts do not extinguish \none another  . . .  either automatically or by an elec-\ntion or other action by one party; rather, the agreement \nof the parties or judicial action is required\u201d).  As the \nSeventh Circuit has noted: \nCourts regularly require the payment of undisputed \ndebts while the parties litigate their genuine dis-\nputes.  This reflects the limits of the common law \nright of set-off between debts.  Setoffs are permit-\nted only when the debts are \u201cmutual\u201d, and debts aris-\ning at different times out of different circumstances \nare not mutual. \n\n23a \n \nSoo Line R.R. Co. v. Escanaba & Lake Superior R.R. \nCo., 840 F.2d 546, 551 (7th Cir. 1988) (internal citation \nomitted) (Easterbrook, J.). \nTo the extent that the IRS\u2019s argument is that  \n\u00a7 6402(a) rescinds the common law governing setoffs, \nthe answer is no, it does not.  Nowhere in the text is \nthere any indication of that, and even the IRS did not \nseem to think it so until the middle of this appeal.  It \nexplained in its initial brief that \u00a7 6402(a) \u201cis a tax- \nspecific codification of the common-law right of setoff\u200a[.]\u201d  \n(Answering Br. at 21.)  Perhaps, as a result of being \npressed on that issue at oral argument, the IRS now pro-\nfesses a different view\u2014that \u201csetoffs authorized by  \n\u00a7 6402(a) do not need to follow any common-law princi-\nples regarding setoffs[.]\u201d  (Supp. Br. at 13.)  The change \nin position may be convenient but it is ill-considered and \nunpersuasive. \nA \u201clongstanding [rule] is  . . .  that statutes which \ninvade the common law are to be read with a presumption \nfavoring the retention of long-established and familiar \nprinciples, except when a statutory purpose to the con-\ntrary is evident.\u201d28  United States v. Texas, 507 U.S. 529, \n534 (1993) (cleaned up).  And to \u201cabrogate a common-\n \n28 Although it is not essential to our holding, nothing in the legisla-\ntive history of \u00a7 6402(a) suggests that its purpose was to overrule the \ncommon law.  Section 252 of the Revenue Act of 1918 appears to be \nthe earliest forerunner of the setoff provision that is now in \u00a7 6402(a), \nand only a single sentence, buried in a House Ways and Means Com-\nmittee Report for that old act, suggests the purpose for the provi-\nsion:  \u201cIt is believed that this provision will materially assist in the \nsettlement of transactions between the taxpayer and the Govern-\nment.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 65-767, at 15 (1918).  If anything, allowing \nthe government to set off disputed debts hinders, rather than as-\nsists, settlements, as this case demonstrates. \n\n24a \n \nlaw principle, the statute must speak directly to the ques-\ntion addressed by the common law.\u201d  Id. (internal quo-\ntation marks omitted).  Section 6402(a) does not do that. \nAlthough \u00a7 6402(a) allows the IRS to credit overpay-\nments to \u201cany liability\u201d of the taxpayer, reading that \nprovision to allow a disputed debt to be set off has the \ninfirmity of presupposing that the taxpayer in fact has \nsome liability.  In other words, the reading that the \nIRS pushes is an exercise in pure bootstrapping.  Zuch \nalleges that she does not have any liability, and it does \nnothing to advance the analysis of this case for the IRS \nto simply declare that she does and then say it is accord-\ningly allowed to effect a setoff.  The law is exactly to \nthe contrary.  The whole point of Congress\u2019s authoriza-\ntion of CDP hearings is to give taxpayers \u201cprotections \nin dealing with the IRS that are similar to those they \nwould have in dealing with any other creditor.\u201d  S. Rep. \nNo. 105-174, at 67.  Allowing offsets such as the ones \nhere would be an affront to the entire purpose of CDP \nhearings.  We instead \u201ctake it as given that Congress \nhas legislated with an expectation that the [common law] \nprinciple[s] [of setoff\u200a] will apply[.]\u201d 29   Astoria Fed. \nSav. & Loan Ass\u2019n v. Solimino, 501 U.S. 104, 108 (1991) \n(cleaned up). \n \n29 Treas. Reg. \u00a7 301.6330-1(g)(2), Q&A (G)(3) (2006) provides that \nthe IRS may offset overpayments against the unpaid tax in a CDP \nproceeding during the pendency of the CDP hearing and appeals \nprocess.  To the extent that regulation provides that the IRS can \ntake an undisputed debt (i.e., an overpayment of taxes, giving rise to \nan obligation by the government to provide a refund) and apply it \nagainst a disputed one (like the alleged tax liability here), such an \ninterpretation of the statute is untenable.  Nothing in the plain text \nof \u00a7 6402(a) allows for such a meaning. \n\n25a \n \nBeyond violating the common law and the clear leg-\nislative intent to preserve taxpayer rights in CDP hear-\nings, the setoffs here violate Article III mootness prin-\nciples.  \u201cOne scenario in which we are reluctant to de-\nclare a case moot is when the defendant argues moot-\nness because of some action it took unilaterally after  \nthe litigation began.\u201d  Hartnett, 963 F.3d at 306; see \nalso Vigon v. Comm\u2019r, 149 T.C. 97, 104 n.3 (2017) (the \nIRS \u201cmay not unilaterally oust the Tax Court from  \njurisdiction\u2014neither in a deficiency case nor in a CDP \ncase\u201d (internal quotation marks omitted)).  That is \nwhat we are faced with here.  It is well established that \n\u201ca defendant\u2019s voluntary cessation of a challenged prac-\ntice does not deprive [us] of [our] power to determine \nthe legality of the practice.\u201d  Friends of the Earth, Inc. \nv. Laidlaw Env\u2019t Servs. (TOC), Inc., 528 U.S. 167, 189 \n(2000) (internal quotation marks omitted) (emphasis \nadded).  It is no stretch to likewise conclude that, as a \ngeneral matter, and when an avenue of relief remains, a \ndefendant cannot unilaterally complete a challenged \npractice to moot a case either. \nIn short, because the IRS\u2019s setoffs were invalid and \nwithout legal effect, Zuch\u2019s claims are not moot,  \nalthough Zuch\u2019s money is, at least for the time being, in \nthe government\u2019s pocket. \n \n3. Zuch\u2019s Claim Is Also Live Under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nBecause the Tax Court Retained Jurisdiction \nto Review Her Liability. \nIf we view Zuch\u2019s claim as a challenge to liability un-\nder \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), we reach the same conclusion. \nZuch\u2019s underlying tax liability was very much in dispute \nwhen the IRS withdrew its levy because it had already \ntaken her money without her consent, and it remained a \n\n26a \n \nlive issue based on (1) a plain reading of the statute,  \n(2) properly read (and non-erroneous) Tax Court prece-\ndent, (3) the Tax Court\u2019s independent jurisdiction over \nliability, (4) the Tax Court\u2019s ability to declare Zuch\u2019s \nrights, and (5) the potential preclusive effect of such a \ndeclaration.  We address each issue in turn.30 \na) Nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 6330 sug-\ngests a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to tax liabil-\nity under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) can be rendered \nmoot by the unilateral action of the IRS. \nSection 6330 allows a taxpayer to raise two categories \nof issues at a CDP hearing.  First, \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A) per-\nmits a taxpayer to raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to \nthe unpaid tax or the proposed levy[.]\u201d  Issues under \nthat provision, accordingly, must relate to a tax that is \ncurrently unpaid or a levy that is still being proposed.  \nBut \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), the provision under which Zuch \nbrought her challenge, permits a taxpayer to \u201calso raise \nat the hearing challenges to the existence or amount of \nthe underlying tax liability  . . .  if the person did not \nreceive any statutory notice of deficiency for such tax \nliability or did not otherwise have an opportunity to dis-\npute such tax liability.\u201d  (emphasis added).  Zuch \nmeets those prerequisites, as the IRS has admitted.  \nUnlike challenges under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A), the rights pro-\nvided under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) are not restricted by any re-\nquirement that they relate to an unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy.  Consequently, there is nothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) \nto suggest that a taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the exist-\nence or amount of her underlying tax becomes moot \n \n30 This discussion is only applicable to taxpayers who did not re-\nceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have a previous opportunity \nto challenge their underlying tax liability. \n\n27a \n \nonce the levy is no longer being enforced or the tax is \nsatisfied. \nWe part ways here with the Fourth and D.C. Circuits.  \nThe Fourth Circuit has held that the phrase \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) must be read in the \u201cspe-\ncific context [of\u200a] the IRS\u2019s attempt to collect via lien or \nlevy.\u201d  McLane v. Comm\u2019r, 24 F.4th 316, 319 (4th Cir. \n2022) (internal quotation marks omitted).  With that \nlimitation in mind, it reasoned that the Tax Court does \nnot have jurisdiction \u201cover independent overpayment \nclaims when the collection action no longer exists.\u201d  Id.  \nSimilarly, the D.C. Circuit reasoned that \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant\u201d is \nrelief from levy and that, consequently, there is \u201cno ap-\npropriate course of action for the Tax Court to take but \nto dismiss [a case] as moot\u201d when the IRS withdraws its \nproposed levy.  Willson v. Comm\u2019r, 805 F.3d 316, 321 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015) (internal quotation marks omitted).31 \nWhile it is true that the \u201cplainness or ambiguity of \nstatutory language is determined by reference to  . . .  \nthe specific context in which that language is used, and \nthe broader context of the statute as a whole[,]\u201d Robin-\nson v. Shell Oil Co., 519 U.S. 337, 341 (1997), we do not \nread \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d so narrowly.  Section \n6330 is not directed toward helping the IRS collect taxes \n \n31 In addition to McLane and Willson, the IRS also relies on \nRuesch v. Commissioner, 805 F. App\u2019x 12, 14 (2d Cir. 2020), to ar-\ngue that a taxpayer can challenge her underlying tax liability only \nwhen the IRS is actively seeking to levy.  But in Ruesch, the issue \nbefore us was never in play.  The Tax Court there held that it \nlacked jurisdiction over the dispute because the IRS had not issued \nthe taxpayer a valid notice of determination, not because of its in-\nterpretation of \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).  Id. \n\n28a \n \nvia lien or levy.  On the contrary, by its terms it pro-\nvides taxpayers a forum to challenge a lien or levy and \naccounts for different circumstances in which that need \nmay arise\u2014including the circumstance in which the tax-\npayer had no opportunity to challenge her underlying li-\nability. \nAs the Tax Court has explained, the broader purpose \nof \u00a7 6330 in the overall statutory scheme is rather \nstraightforward\u2014to \u201ccollect the correct amount of tax.\u201d  \nMontgomery, 122 T.C. at 10 (emphasis added) (\u201cIn view \nof the statutory scheme as a whole, we think the sub-\nstantive and procedural protections contained in sec-\ntions 6320 and 6330 reflect congressional intent that the \nCommissioner should collect the correct amount of tax, \nand do so by observing all applicable laws and adminis-\ntrative procedures.\u201d); see also S. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67 \n(\u201c[F]ollowing procedures designed to afford taxpayers \ndue process in collections will increase fairness to tax-\npayers.\u201d).  Allowing a taxpayer to challenge her under-\nlying tax liability in a context like the present case, even \nafter the IRS ceases collection, not only comports with \nthe text of \u00a7 6330 but supports that objective.  It also \ncomports with fundamental notions of due process, as \nthe taxpayer in that scenario necessarily has an inde-\npendent right to challenge her tax liability in a CDP \nhearing.32  See supra section I.A.2. \n \n32 If the IRS could impose liability without sending a notice of defi-\nciency, and could both offset the purported liability so as to cease \ncollection and moot any CDP challenge based on its cessation, that \ntaxpayer would be denied any pre-deprivation opportunity to con-\ntest what the IRS says she owes.  Because that taxpayer may not \nbe able to initiate a deficiency proceeding or carry forward her CDP \naction, she also could be denied any Article III forum in which to \n \n\n29a \n \nAfter the IRS Office of Appeals considers the tax-\npayer\u2019s challenges at the CDP hearing and issues its de-\nterminations as to the levy and the taxpayer\u2019s liability, \nthe Tax Court obtains jurisdiction to review those deter-\nminations.  \u00a7 6330(d)(1) (\u201cThe person may  . . .  pe-\ntition the Tax Court for review of such determination \n(and the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction with respect \nto such matter).\u201d  (emphasis added)).  Accordingly, \nthe Tax Court\u2019s \u201cjurisdiction is not limited to the notice \nof [the proposed collection action] that triggered th[e] \ncollection proceeding but rather comprehends all the is-\nsues that Congress allowed to be included in \u2018such mat-\nter.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Vigon, 149 T.C. at 107.  \u201c[S]uch matter\u201d in-\ncludes a challenge to what the IRS asserts to be the un-\nderlying tax liability.33  Id.   \nIn short, there is nothing in the plain text of \u00a7 6330 \nthat suggests a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to the tax liability \nat issue in an action under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) can be ren-\ndered moot by the unilateral action of the IRS. \n \nb) Greene-Thapedi\u2019s reasoning was faulty. \nNevertheless, the Tax Court here held otherwise.  \nIt dismissed Zuch\u2019s case as moot \u201c[b]ecause there [was] \nno unpaid liability for the determination year upon \nwhich a levy could be based, and [the IRS was] no longer \npursuing the proposed collection action[.]\u201d  (App. at 7-\n \ncontest her liability.  This is true before collection, and it may also \nbe true as a general matter.  Here, for example, it is not clear \nwhether Zuch would be able to challenge her tax liability at all (out-\nside of a live CDP proceeding) because her post-collection claim \nmight be time-barred.  See infra note 41. \n33 When \u201cthe validity of the underlying tax liability is properly at \nissue, the Court will review the matter on a de novo basis.\u201d  Sego \nv. Comm\u2019r, 114 T.C. 604, 610 (2000). \n\n30a \n \n8.)  That dismissal followed the reasoning of an earlier \ncase called Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 T.C. \n1 (2006), with facts very similar to the case before us \nnow.  There, the IRS notified a taxpayer that it in-\ntended to levy on her property to collect a disputed tax \nliability.  Id. at 2-3.  The taxpayer then challenged the \ntax liability in a CDP hearing.  Id. at 3.  The IRS Of-\nfice of Appeals sustained the levy, and the taxpayer pe-\ntitioned the Tax Court for review.  Id.  After she filed \nher petition, the IRS used the taxpayer\u2019s overpayment \nin a later year to fully satisfy the disputed tax liability.  \nId. at 4.  The Tax Court then dismissed the taxpayer\u2019s \nproceeding as moot, holding that \u201cwhatever right peti-\ntioner may have to challenge the existence and amount \nof her underlying tax liability in this proceeding arises \nonly in connection with her challenge to the proposed \ncollection action.\u201d  Id. at 8.  And if \u201cthe proposed levy \nis moot,\u201d then the taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis to \nchallenge the existence or amount of her underlying tax \nliability\u201d in her proceeding at the Tax Court.34  Id. \nTo arrive at that conclusion, the Greene-Thapedi \nCourt relied on two inapposite and non-precedential Tax \nCourt cases, Chocallo v. Commissioner, T.C.M. (RIA) \n2004-152, and Gerakios v. Commissioner, T.C.M. (RIA) \n2004-203.35  See id. at 7-8.  In both of those cases, the \ntaxpayer was not asserting any ongoing challenge to the \n \n34 The Tax Court also denied a refund to the taxpayer because \n\u201csection 6330 does not expressly give [the Tax Court] jurisdiction \nto determine an overpayment or to order a refund or credit of taxes \npaid.\u201d  Greene-Thapedi, 126 T.C. at 8. \n35 The Tax Court issues memorandum opinions, like Chocallo and \nGerakios, which are considered non-binding precedent.  See Duna-\nway v. Comm\u2019r, 124 T.C. 80, 87 (2005) (\u201c[M]emorandum opinions of \nthis Court are not regarded as binding precedent.\u201d). \n\n31a \n \ntax liability underlying the CDP proceeding when the \nTax Court declared the matter moot.  In Chocallo, the \nIRS discovered during the CDP hearing that it had in-\ncorrectly assessed the taxpayer\u2019s liability and so it re-\nfunded the amount already collected.  Chocallo at 2.  \nAt that point, the IRS moved to dismiss the case as \nmoot.  Id.  The taxpayer then filed a \u201cSupplemental \nMotion for Sanctions, Contempt and For Other Re-\nlief[,]\u201d requesting that the IRS employees who handled \nher case be criminally prosecuted and claiming damages \nfor alleged wrongs committed by IRS employees.  Id.  \nThus, the taxpayer was seeking damages; she was no \nlonger contesting the underlying tax liability that gave \nrise to the suit.  In Gerakios, the taxpayer voluntarily \npaid his tax liabilities after a CDP hearing.  Gerakios \nat 1.  He \u201cdid not dispute his underlying liabilities.\u201d  \nId. at 1 n.1.  He paid the tax because the tax lien was \nhindering his ability to refinance his home.  Id. at 1.  \nHe sought review in the Tax Court claiming only that \nIRS \u201cemployees mistreated him [and] violated his civil \nrights, and that his credit rating was adversely affected \nby the filing of the lien.\u201d  Id.  Since neither case in-\nvolved a taxpayer who was then challenging an underly-\ning tax liability, as is the case here and was in Greene-\nThapedi, the Greene-Thapedi court\u2019s reliance on Cho-\ncallo and Gerakios was misplaced. \nThe Tax Court\u2019s own precedent since Greene-\nThapedi suggests that the case was wrongly decided.  \nIn Vigon v. Commissioner, decided in 2017, the Tax \nCourt held that the IRS cannot unilaterally moot a case \nby withdrawing its proposed collection activity if the \nTax Court has already \u201cobtained jurisdiction of a liabil-\nity challenge when the petition was filed.\u201d  149 T.C. at \n107.  That\u2019s because the \u201cliability issue may remain \n\n32a \n \neven after the collection issues have been resolved or be-\ncome moot.\u201d  Id. at 105.  To be sure, a footnote in Vi-\ngon distinguished it from Greene-Thapedi because \nGreene-Thapedi \u201cinvolved a liability that had been sat-\nisfied\u201d and \u201cnot merely abated,\u201d as in Vigon.  Id. at 105 \nn.4.  But there is nothing in \u00a7 6330 to suggest that dis-\ntinction.  Once the Tax Court has jurisdiction to re-\nsolve a disputed tax liability, it does not lose that juris-\ndiction simply because the IRS decides to satisfy the as-\nserted liability with the taxpayer\u2019s own funds. \nIndeed, even the IRS used to recognize that.  In a \nnotice to its attorneys in 2003, it explained that \u201c[a] mo-\ntion to dismiss for mootness is inappropriate if peti-\ntioner is disputing the existence or amount of the liabil-\nity  . . . .  Even if the liability has been paid, peti-\ntioner may still dispute the liability[.]\u201d  I.R.S. Notice \nCC-2003-016 (May 29, 2003), 2003 WL 24016801 (empha-\nsis added). 36  That is the correct view, and the IRS \n \n36 The IRS \u201cChief Counsel is appointed by the President of the \nUnited States\u201d and is the \u201cchief legal advisor to the IRS Commis-\nsioner on all matters pertaining to the interpretation, administration \nand enforcement of the Internal Revenue Laws[.]\u201d  Office of Chief \nCounsel At-a-Glance, IRS, https://www.irs.gov/about-irs/office- \nof-chief-counsel-at-aglance [https://perma.cc/63NC-KGG9].

Greene-Thapedi\u2019s holding \nthat a taxpayer may only challenge her underlying tax \nliability if there remains an unpaid tax or a proposed \nlevy is erroneous.37 \nc) \nThe Tax Court need not have repayment \nor refund jurisdiction for there to be a \nlive dispute. \nIn Greene-Thapedi, the Tax Court said that, once a \nlevy was removed and the tax was paid, it could not pro-\nvide any other relief to the taxpayer because \u201csection \n6330 does not expressly give [the] Court jurisdiction to \ndetermine an overpayment or to order a refund or credit \nof taxes paid.\u201d  126 T.C. at 8.  It reasoned that full \npayment rendered any conclusion it might make as to \nliability \u201cat best,  . . .  an advisory opinion.\u201d  Id. at \n13. \nA leading tax-procedure treatise, noting that \u201c[m]any \nscholars and practitioners believe that Greene-Thapedi \nreached an incorrect conclusion[,]\u201d explains how the Tax \nCourt got it wrong: \n[A] [t]axpayer\u2019s full payment of the previously unpaid \ntax liability should not render the entire case \u201cmoot\u201d \nif the Tax Court otherwise has jurisdiction over the \nunderlying liability.  Full payment does not neces-\n \napplied incorrectly is certainly a relevant issue to whether the Tax \nCourt CDP proceeding should remain open. \n37 In a footnote in Ahmed v. Commissioner, 64 F.4th 477, 487 n.10 \n(3d Cir. 2023), we stated that a petitioner\u2019s lien-withdrawal request \nwas moot because the IRS had already released its liens once the \ntaxpayer remitted a deposit to the IRS.  But the taxpayer in Ahmed \nnever challenged his underlying tax liability in the CDP hearing, so \nthat case has no bearing here. \n\n34a \n \nsarily resolve the dispute as the Tax Court held.  \nThe question of whether a dispute remains is sepa-\nrate from the question of whether the Tax Court can \ngrant a refund.  Even if granting a refund is barred, \nthe Tax Court could still determine the correct liabil-\nity as part of its CDP determination. \nMichael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, IRS Practice & Pro-\ncedure \u00b6 14B.16[4][a] (West 2023). \nWe agree.  Notwithstanding any overpayment or \nrefund jurisdiction, a live dispute as to underlying liabil-\nity does not become moot based upon payment of the \n\u201cunpaid\u201d tax.  Section 6330 grants the Tax Court juris-\ndiction to review a CDP determination regarding a tax-\npayer\u2019s properly raised challenge to the existence or \namount of her underlying tax liability, full stop.  That \njurisdiction does not change until the dispute is re-\nsolved.  See Naf\u200atel v. Comm\u2019r, 85 T.C. 527, 530 (1985) \n(\u201c[G]enerally, once a petitioner invokes the jurisdiction \nof the Court, jurisdiction lies with the Court and re-\nmains unimpaired until the Court has decided the con-\ntroversy.\u201d).  Therefore, overpayment or refund juris-\ndiction is not essential to having a live controversy.38 \n \nd) A Tax Court determination of Zuch\u2019s \nright to the estimated payments would \nnot be an impermissible declaratory \njudgment. \nDespite all of the foregoing, the IRS argues that a \nTax Court determination of the proper allocation of the \ntax payments in a CDP hearing would be an improper \n \n38 Accordingly, we need not, and do not, reach any conclusion about \nwhether the Tax Court has overpayment or refund jurisdiction in a \ncontext like this. \n\n35a \n \ndeclaratory judgment.  (Supp. Br. at 15 (\u201cNothing in \nthe Code or Section 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to \nissue advisory opinions or declaratory judgments in \nCDP cases.\u201d).)  The Declaratory Judgment Act allows \nany United States court to render a declaratory judg-\nment when there is a case or controversy, \u201cexcept with \nrespect to Federal taxes[.]\u201d39  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a).  If \nthat were all that one knew of the Act, the IRS\u2019s argu-\nment would be more persuasive.  But, although the Act \nis broadly worded, courts have traditionally construed it \nto be coterminous with the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, and \nthat undermines the agency\u2019s position.40 \nThe Tax Anti-Injunction Act generally provides that \nthere can be \u201cno suit for the purpose of restraining the \nassessment or collection of any tax[.]\u201d  \u00a7 7421(a).  But \nit also provides an exception for a request under  \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1) to enjoin a levy via a CDP hearing and any \nappeals.  Id. (prohibiting suits to restrain assessment \nor collection of a tax \u201c[e]xcept as provided in section[]  \n. . .  6330(e)(1),\u201d among others).  Consequently, the \nTax Anti-Injunction Act is not violated when a levy is \nstayed during the pendency of a CDP hearing.  Fur-\nthermore, because the Tax Anti-Injunction Act and the \nDeclaratory Judgment Act are coterminous, the phrase \n\u201c\u200a\u2018with respect to Federal taxes\u2019 [in the Declaratory \nJudgment Act] means \u2018with respect to the assessment or \ncollection of taxes.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Cohen v. United States, 650 F.3d \n717, 727 (D.C. Cir. 2011). \n \n39 The Declaratory Judgment Act carves out some tax exceptions \nthat are not relevant here. \n40 See Z St., Inc. v. Koskinen, 44 F. Supp. 3d 48, 56 (D.D.C. 2014) \n(collecting cases from the Fourth, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth, and \nD.C. Circuits). \n\n36a \n \nThus, when a court has the power to enjoin a levy un-\nder the Tax Anti-Injunction Act, it also has the power to \ndeclare the rights of the parties in that proceeding with-\nout violating the Declaratory Judgment Act.  As the \nD.C. Circuit has explained, \na functional concern exists with construing the [De-\nclaratory Judgment Act]\u2019s exception to bar relief oth-\nerwise allowed under the [Tax Anti-Injunction Act].  \nThe court would have jurisdiction to enjoin the par-\nties appearing before it, but not to declare their \nrights.  This defies common sense, however, \u201csince \nan injunction of a tax and a judicial declaration that a \ntax is illegal have the same prohibitory effect on the \nfederal government\u2019s ability to assess and collect \ntaxes.\u201d \nId. at 730 (quoting Wyoming Trucking Ass\u2019n, Inc. v. \nBentsen, 82 F.3d 930, 933 (10th Cir. 1996)); see also \nTomlinson v. Smith, 128 F.2d 808, 811 (7th Cir. 1942) \n(\u201c[T]he jurisdiction of the court to issue a restraining or-\nder is  . . .  determinative of its jurisdiction to de-\nclare the rights of the parties relative thereto.  It is un-\nreasonable to think that a court with authority to issue \na restraining order is without power to declare the \nrights of the parties in connection therewith.\u201d). \nBecause the Declaratory Judgment Act does not bar \nthe Tax Court from declaring the rights to estimated \npayments at issue in a CDP hearing, there is a live case \nand controversy, and a Tax Court determination of \nZuch\u2019s tax liability would not be an improper declara-\ntory judgment. \n \n\n37a \n \n \ne) The IRS has not met its burden to show \nthat no relief would be available to Zuch \nif the Tax Court declared she had a right \nto the estimated payments. \nTo show mootness, the IRS must prove that Zuch \ncould have no relief whatsoever if the Tax Court were to \ndeclare that she had a right to the estimated payments.  \nGiven what we have already said here, to carry its heavy \nburden, the IRS must prove that a declaration by the \nTax Court of Zuch\u2019s rights in her CDP case would not \nhave preclusive effect on a future refund claim.  In a \nsupplemental brief, the IRS has taken the position that \nsuch a determination would not have any preclusive ef-\nfect, but it cites no relevant authority to support that \nproposition.  And, indeed, the IRS Office of Chief \nCounsel has at least twice issued notices indicating the \nopposite.  See I.R.S. Notice CC-2006-005 (Nov. 21, \n2005), 2005 WL 3272051 (\u201cA judicial determination in a \nCDP case of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liability for a \ntaxable year (which may be less than the taxpayer\u2019s pay-\nments for that year) may be subject to estoppel princi-\nples in a subsequent refund action[.]\u201d); I.R.S. Notice \nCC-2009-010 (Feb. 13, 2009), 2009 WL 497736 (\u201cA judi-\ncial determination of the amount of the underlying tax \nliability in a CDP case may, however, estop both parties \nfrom contesting the amount of that same liability in a \nsubsequent refund action[.]\u201d).41  Accordingly, the IRS \n \n41 At argument, the IRS asserted that any refund claim Zuch had \nis barred by the statute of limitations in \u00a7 6511.  But in its supple-\nmental brief, the IRS now says that it \u201chas determined that she \nmay still be able to file a refund suit in the district court or Court \nof Federal Claims.\u201d  (Supp. Br. at 3.)  It explains that Zuch did \nnot receive the required two-year notice of disallowance that would \nhave triggered the two-year limitations period for filing a refund \n \n\n38a \n \nhas not met its heavy burden to show that Zuch would \nhave no relief whatsoever if the Tax Court were to de-\nclare she has a right to the estimated tax payments.  \nAnd, of course, an agency of the United States, having \nreceived a court order declaring a citizen\u2019s rights, is ex-\npected to either appeal it or abide by it.42 \n \nsuit under \u00a7 6532(a)(1).  Because of the Tucker Act, however, it is \nunclear whether a court will hear Zuch\u2019s refund claim.  That Act \nbars any suit against the United States \u201cunless the complaint is \nfiled within six years after the right of action first accrues.\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2401(a).  The Court of Federal Claims has longstanding \nprecedent that \u00a7 6532 preempts the Tucker Act\u2019s general statute \nof limitations.  Detroit Tr. Co. v. United States, 130 F. Supp. 815, \n818 (Ct. Cl. 1955).  And the IRS has repeatedly opined that the \nTucker Act does not apply to tax refund claims.  Rev. Rul. 56-381, \n1956-2 C.B. 953; I.R.S. CCA 201044006 (Nov. 5, 2010), 2010 WL \n4384169; I.R.S. Notice CC-2012-012 (Jun. 1, 2012), 2012 WL \n2029785; I.R.S. IRM 34.5.2.2(5) (Apr. 22, 2021), https://www.irs.gov/ \nirm/part34/irm_34-005-002 [https://perma.cc/46FG-E3TE].  If \nthat were true, Zuch may not be barred from filing a refund claim \nbecause the two-year limitations period under \u00a7 6532 has not been \ntriggered.  But three district courts have held that the six-year \nlimitations period is the outer limit for any claims against the gov-\nernment.  See Breland v. United States, No. 10-cv-00007, 2011 \nWL 4345300, at *6-7 (N.D.N.Y Sept. 15, 2011); Wagenet v. United \nStates, No. 8-cv-00142, 2009 WL 4895363, at *3 (C.D. Cal. Sept. 14, \n2009); Finkelstein v. United States, 943 F. Supp. 425, 432 (D.N.J. \n1996).  Under that view, Zuch\u2019s refund suit would be time-barred \nbecause six years have passed since her right accrued to file a re-\nfund claim.  We do not reach any conclusion today concerning the \nviability of a refund claim.  She may have a viable claim, and that \nis enough for today\u2019s purposes. \n42 If enforcement were needed, requiring a taxpayer to go to a dif-\nferent court to enforce a right judicially determined in the Tax Court \nis consistent with historical practice.  In fact, for over sixty years, \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to determine a taxpayer\u2019s overpay-\nment in a deficiency proceeding but did not have authority to order \n \n\n39a \n \nIII. CONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, we will vacate the Tax \nCourt\u2019s order of dismissal and remand for that tribunal \nto determine whether Zuch is entitled to receive credit \nfor any amount of the estimated tax payments at issue. \n \n \na refund consistent with that determination.  See Greene-Thapedi, \n126 T.C. at 9 (explaining that the Tax Court had overpayment, but \nno refund, jurisdiction from 1926 until the enactment of \u00a7 6512(b) in \n1988). \n\n40a \n \nAPPENDIX B \n \nUNITED STATES TAX COURT \nWASHINGTON, DC 20217 \n \nDocket No. 25125-14L \nJENNIFER ZUCH, PETITIONER \nv. \nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT \n \nFiled:  Apr. 6, 2022 \n \nORDER OF DISMISSAL \n \nThis section 6330(d)1 case is before the Court on re-\nspondent\u2019s motion to dismiss on grounds of mootness, \nfiled March 6, 2020.  Petitioner\u2019s objection to respond-\nent\u2019s motion was filed on April 13, 2020. \nIn a Notice of Determination Concerning Collection \nAction(s) Under Section 6320 and/or 6330, dated Sep-\ntember 25, 2014 (notice), respondent determined that a \nlevy is an appropriate collection action with respect to \npetitioner\u2019s then outstanding 2010 Federal income tax \nliability (underlying liability).  The submissions of the \nparties show their agreement to the events, summarized \nbelow. \n \n1  Unless otherwise indicated, section references are to the Inter-\nnal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended. \n\n41a \n \nOn September 12, 2012, petitioner filed her 2010 Fed-\neral income tax return as a married person filing a sep-\narate return.  On the return, petitioner reported ad-\njusted gross income of $74,493, tax due of $7,736, and \nwithheld Federal tax of $8,607.  The return showed a \n$731 overpayment, which respondent applied to the 2008 \njoint tax liability of petitioner and her former spouse, \nPatrick Gennardo. \nPetitioner submitted an amended 2010 Federal in-\ncome tax return (amended return), filed November 14, \n2012.  On the amended return, as relevant, petitioner \nreported a $71,000 increase in adjusted gross income, \nadditional tax due of $27,682, estimated tax payments of \n$50,000, and a $21,918 overpayment.  Respondent as-\nsessed the additional tax due of $27,682 reported on the \namended return.  Respondent further assessed an ad-\ndition to tax under section 6651(a)(1) for failure to file a \ntimely return of $7,020.50. \nBy letter dated August 31, 2013, petitioner was ad-\nvised that respondent intended to levy (proposed collec-\ntion action) in order to collect the underlying liability.  \nThat letter also advised petitioner of her right to chal-\nlenge that proposed collection action by requesting an \nadministrative hearing, which she did.  See sec. 6330(a) \nand (b).  Respondent received petitioner\u2019s timely ad-\nministrative hearing request, dated September 27, 2013, \nin which petitioner alleged that the $50,000 of estimated \ntax payments should be credited to her 2010 income tax \naccount and further requested that any penalty should \nbe abated for reasonable cause.  Respondent\u2019s settle-\nment officer considered and rejected petitioner\u2019s re-\nquests, and because petitioner did not request a collec-\n\n42a \n \ntion alternative during the administrative hearing, the \nnotice was issued and this case ensued. \nThe petition in this case raises issues related exclu-\nsively to the amount of the underlying liability, including \npetitioner\u2019s entitlement to the abatement of penalties.  \nAccording to petitioner, (1) the underlying liability \nwould be eliminated if the estimated tax payments were \nproperly credited to petitioner\u2019s income tax account, and \n(2) she is entitled to the refund of the overpayment \nshown on her amended return.  After the petition in \nthis case was filed, on April 15, 2019, respondent cred-\nited petitioner\u2019s income tax account with a $14,883.19 \noffset arising from her income tax account for 2018, \nwhich resulted in the satisfaction of the underlying lia-\nbility.  The payment of the underlying liability, in turn, \nresulted in the motion here under consideration. \nRelying upon Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 126 \nT.C. 1 (2006), and pointing out that the underlying lia-\nbility has now been paid, respondent argues that the \ncase is moot because respondent no longer intends to \npursue the proposed collection action.  Petitioner ob-\njects to respondent\u2019s motion.  According to petitioner, \n\u201cbecause  * * *  [respondent] did not issue a valid no-\ntice of deficiency [with respect to the 2010 assessment]  \n* * *  [r]espondent\u2019s assessment is void\u201d.  Petitioner \nfurther contends that section 6330(c)(2)(B) obligates the  \nCourt to determine the existence or amount of the un-\nderlying liability and that she is due a refund for an \noverpayment for 2010.  That being so, petitioner ar-\ngues the case is not moot because the parties disagree \nover the amount of the overpayment of petitioner\u2019s 2010 \nFederal income tax liability.  \n\n43a \n \nPetitioner is concerned that unless the underlying is \ndetermined in this proceeding, she will be forced to pur-\nsue any refund to which she might be entitled through \ntraditional Federal income tax refund procedures, in-\ncluding if necessary, initiating a case in a different Fed-\neral court.  Petitioner\u2019s concerns, although well-founded, \nare insufficient to defeat respondent\u2019s motion.  Be-\ncause we do not have jurisdiction to determine an over-\npayment or to order a refund or credit of tax paid in a \nsection 6330 proceeding, this is not the proper forum to \ndetermine whether, and the extent to which, if any, the \nunderlying liability has been overpaid.  See Greene-\nThapedi v. Commissioner, 26 T.C. at 11.  Although we \nhave concerns about the merits of petitioner\u2019s position \non the point, see secs. 6201(1), 6665(b), under the circum-\nstances we need not address the validity of the assess-\nment as petitioner requests us to do. \nBecause there is no unpaid liability for the determi-\nnation year upon which a levy could be based, and re-\nspondent is no longer pursuing the proposed collection \naction, this case is moot.  See McClane v. Commissioner, \n24 F.4th 316 (4th Cir. 2022) aff\u200a\u2019g T.C. Memo. 2018-149; \nsee also Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner, 26 T.C. 1. \nPremises considered, it is \nORDERED that respondent\u2019s motion to dismiss on \ngrounds of mootness, filed March 6, 2020, is granted.  \nIt is further \nORDERED that this case is dismissed as moot. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Signed) Lewis R.

A \nNotice of Determination was issued by Appeals on \n09/25/2014, sustaining the action taken by Compliance. \nThe case went to Tax Court and was remanded back to \nAppeals on an order dated 12/29/2016.  No new infor-\nmation was presented to Appeals by the taxpayer.  The \noriginal decision to sustain the levy action taken by \nCompliance is being upheld by Appeals. \nBrief Background \nA telephonic conference was held with your POA on \n07/29/2014.  During that call, your request to have \n$50,000.00 in credits moved from your husband\u2019s ac-\ncount to your account was denied.  On 09/25/2014, you \nwere issued Letter 3193 (Notice of Determination) by \nAppeals.  Your POA petitioned Tax Court on your be-\nhalf.  The case was reviewed by the court and re-\nmanded back to Appeals in an order dated 12/29/2016.  \nThe court ordered that Appeals address several issues \nthat needed clarification (in the court\u2019s opinion) regard-\ning the aforementioned credits. \nSeveral calls between Appeals, IRS Area Counsel, and \nthe POA took place between February and May of 2017 \nwith the final call taking place on 05/26/2017.  All calls, \n\n47a \n \nexcept for the last call were made in an attempt to se-\ncure additional information in order for us to reconsider \nthe disposition of the payments at issue, but nothing new \nwas ever supplied to Appeals. \nOn 05/26/2017, it was determined that Appeals was not \nin a position to change our original determination to sus-\ntain Compliance\u2019s issuance of their final notice of intent \nto levy and that we would not move any credits to your \naccount from your husband\u2019s account. \nLegal and Procedural Requirements \nI, Mario C Tevis, verified the requirements of any appli-\ncable law or administrative procedure were met.  IRS \nrecords confirmed the proper issuance of the notice and \ndemand, Notice of Intent to Levy and/or Notice of Fed-\neral Tax Lien (NFTL) filing, and notice of a right to a \nCollection Due Process (CDP) hearing. \nAn assessment was properly made for each tax and pe-\nriod listed on the CDP notice.  \nNotice and demand for payment was mailed to your last \nknown address. \nThere was a balance due when the Notice of Intent to \nLevy was issued or when the NFTL filing was request-\ned. \nI had no prior involvement with respect to the specific \ntax periods either in Appeals or Compliance. \nI reviewed the Collection file, IRS records and infor-\nmation you provided.  My review confirmed that the \nIRS followed all legal and procedural requirements, and \nthe actions taken or proposed were appropriate under \nthe circumstances. \n\n48a \n \nIssues relating to the unpaid liability \nIn an order from Tax Court dated December 29, 2016, \nthe court remanded your case back to Appeals.  The \nTax Court questioned three (3) items: \n1. \nThe legal basis for which the $20,000.00 payment \nwas applied to the account of the Gennardo\u2019s. \nAppeals reviewed that the $20,000.00 payment in ques-\ntion was received as a joint 1040 ES payment (applied \non 06/19/2010).  It was applied to your husband\u2019s ac-\ncount, as he was the primary taxpayer on the joint ac-\ncount. \nAppeals reviewed that you and your husband then filed \nseparate income tax (1040) returns for the tax year \nended 12/31/2010.  Your initial tax liability was fully \nsatisfied with your withholdings, which subsequently \ngenerated a refund to you. \nThe $20,000.00 1040 ES payment in question was never \nan issue until an amended 1040X was filed and an addi-\ntional assessment was made.  That assessment was \nmade on 02/11/2013 in the amount of $27,682.00 (plus \nP&I). \n2. \nWhether the payment of $30,000.00 was a separate \nor joint payment. \nThe $30,000.00 payment was made by bank check, dated \n12/14/2010 and had only Mr. Gennardo\u2019s name on it.  It \nwas applied accordingly, to him. \n3. \nThe circumstances surrounding Gennardo\u2019s Offer in \nCompromise. \nMr. Gennardo has an accepted Offer in Compromise \n(OIC).  In accordance with the terms of any OIC filed \n\n49a \n \nat that time, Section 8 of OIC Form 656 (Rev. 5-2012), \nparagraph (d), states \u201cThe IRS will keep any monies it \nhas collected prior to this offer and any payments that I \nmake relating to this offer that I did not designate as a \ndeposit\u201d.  It should be known that his OIC was filed on \n09/18/2012 and accepted on 07/17/2013. \nIt should also be known that your denial for penalty \nabatement was never raised by the court and that our \ninitial determination to deny your request for abate-\nment still stands. \nBalancing efficient tax collection with concern regarding \nintrusiveness \nReview of your tax payment transfer request and your \nrequest for penalty abetment are both denied.  Ap-\npeals received no new information that would compel us \nto consider either of your two requests. \nTherefore, our determination is that the proposed levy \naction balances the need for efficient collection of taxes \nwith the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary.  The \naction taken by Compliance is being sustained by Ap-\npeals. \n\n50a \n \nAPPENDIX D \n \nUNITED STATES TAX COURT \nWASHINGTON, DC 20217 \n \nDocket No. 25125-14L \nJENNIFER ZUCH, PETITIONER(S) \nv. \nCOMMISSIONER OF INTERNAL REVENUE, RESPONDENT \n \nFiled:  Dec. 12, 2016 \n \nORDER \n \nThis collection review case is before the Court on re-\nspondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment filed on \nApril 29, 2015, pursuant to Rule 121.1  Respondent con-\ntends that the Court should affirm the determination of \nthe Internal Revenue Service Office of Appeals sustain-\ning a proposed levy to collect petitioner\u2019s unpaid Fed-\neral income tax for 2010.  Petitioner objects to the mo-\ntion for summary judgment. \nA. \nBackground \nThe record establishes and/or the parties do not dis-\npute the following facts. \n \n1  Rule references are to the Tax Court Rules of Practice and Pro-\ncedure and section references are to the Internal Revenue Code, \nas amended. \n\n51a \n \n \n1. \nEstimated Payments \nPetitioner resided in New Jersey when the petition \nin this case was timely filed.  Petitioner was married to \nPatrick J. Gennardo during the year in issue.  Peti-\ntioner and Mr. Gennardo elected married filing joint fil-\ning status for their Federal income tax returns for 2007, \n2008, and 2009.2 \nPetitioner and Mr. Gennardo mailed to the Internal \nRevenue Service (IRS or respondent) a 2010 Form 1040-\nES, Estimated Payment, with a $20,000 personal check \npayable to U.S. Treasury dated June 15, 2010.  The \nForm 1040-ES listed both Mr. Gennardo\u2019s and peti-\ntioner\u2019s names and social security numbers, and the check \nlisted both of their names on the account.  On June 19, \n2010, the IRS applied the $20,000 payment to peti-\ntioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s married filing joint account \nfor 2010. \nOn January 10, 2011, Mr. Gennardo sent a letter via \nFederal Express to the attention of Ms. L. Washington \nat the IRS office in Paramus, New Jersey.  The subject \nof the letter was \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jennifer \nZuch\u201d and Mr. Gennardo wrote \u201cEnclosed please find \nthe payments we discussed in December\u201d.  Included \nwith the letter was a $30,000 bank check payable to the \nU.S. Treasury dated December 14, 2010, which was \ndrawn from petitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s joint Citi-\nbank bank account.  On the bank check in the space for \n\u201cremitter\u201d only Mr. Gennardo\u2019 s name was listed.  On \nJanuary 11, 2011, the IRS applied the $30,000 payment \n \n2  Copies of IRS account transcripts reflect that as of July 23, \n2012, petitioner and Mr. Gennardo had outstanding liabilities and \npenalties for 2007, 2008, and 2009. \n\n52a \n \nto petitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s married filing joint \naccount for 2010. \n \n2. \nTax Returns \n \n \n \na. \nOriginal Tax Returns \nPetitioner and Mr. Gennardo each filed a Federal in-\ncome tax return electing married filing separate status \nfor 2010. \nPetitioner submitted a delinquent 2010 Form 1040, \nU.S. Individual Income Tax Return, dated September \n12, 2012, and filed October 29, 2012.3  On this return pe-\ntitioner reported $7,736 in tax due, federal tax withheld \nof $8,067, and $0 in estimated tax payments. \nMr. Gennardo also submitted a delinquent 2010 Form \n1040 on September 12, 2012, which was filed on October \n29, 2012.  On this return Mr. Gennardo reported $10,000 \nin estimated tax payments.  Mr. Gennardo\u2019s return re-\nflected a balance due and he did not remit payment. \nAt some point after Mr. Gennardo filed his 2010 Form \n1040 the IRS applied the $50,000 in estimated payments \nto his account as a married filing separate taxpayer.4 \n \n \n \nb. Amended Tax Returns \nPetitioner filed a 2010 Form 1040X, Amended U.S. \nIndividual Income Tax Return, dated November 14, \n2012.  Petitioner\u2019s power of attorney (POA) Lawrence \nBrody hand-delivered a copy of her 2010 Form 1040X to \nIRS Revenue Officer (RO) Robyn Scherzer on Novem-\n \n3  Petitioner did not request an extension of time to file her 2010 \nFederal income tax return. \n4  It is unclear from the record as to exactly when the two pay-\nments were applied to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s account. \n\n53a \n \nber 14, 2012.  On her amended return petitioner re-\nported additional income of $71,000 from a retirement \ndistribution and claimed an additional $50,000 in esti-\nmated tax payments, reporting additional tax due of \n$27,683 and requesting a refund of $22,649. \nAlong with petitioner\u2019s 2010 Form 1040X, Mr. Brody \nalso hand-delivered to RO Scherzer a copy of a 2010 \nForm 1040X for Mr. Gennardo, signed and dated No-\nvember 10, 2012.  Mr. Gennardo reported $0 in esti-\nmated tax payments on this 2010 Form 1040X. \nRespondent did not apply the $50,000 in estimated \npayments to petitioner\u2019s account and assessed addi-\ntional tax due of $27,682 based on her amended return \non February 11, 2013. \nMr. Gennardo submitted another 2010 Form 1040X \ndated March 13, 2013.  Mr. Gennardo reported $0 in es-\ntimated tax payments on this amended return, an ad-\njustment from the $10,000 in estimated payments origi-\nnally reported.  Mr. Gennardo attached to this amended \nreturn a \u201cstatement 1\u201d which asserted his reasons for \namending his 2010 return including:  (1) \u201cto show \n$10,000 payment on original tax return not paid\u201d and  \n(2) \u201cthere were estimated payments of $50,000 allocated \nto the spouse Jennifer Zuch\u201d.5  The IRS received Mr. \nGennardo\u2019s amended return prior to May 2013. \n \n5  It does not appear that Mr. Gennardo\u2019s 2010 Form 1040X pro-\nvided to Ms. Scherzer on November 14, 2012 (2012 version), was \nfiled with the IRS.  The Form 1040X filed by Mr. Gennardo in \n2013 (as filed version) differs in several ways from the 2012 version.  \nRelevant to the case before the Court, in the 2012 version Mr. Gen-\nnardo did not list the $10,000 in estimated payments as originally  \nclaimed on his 2010 Form 1040 and he did not include a statement 1.  \n\n54a \n \nBoth versions of Mr. Gennardo\u2019s Form 1040X and pe-\ntitioner\u2019s Form 1040X were prepared by the same certi-\nfied public accountant Steven Moses. \n \n3. \nMr. Gennardo\u2019 s Offer in Compromise \nOn September 18, 2012, 6 days after filing his original \n2010 Federal income tax return, Mr. Gennardo submit-\nted to the IRS an offer-in-compromise (OIC) relating to \nhis 2010 tax liability.  The IRS accepted Mr. Gennardo\u2019s \nOIC on July 17, 2013, and applied the $50,000 in esti-\nmated payments to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s outstanding 2010 \ntax liability as part of the agreement.6 \n \n 4. \nPetitioner\u2019s CDP Hearing \nOn August 31, 2013, the IRS issued to petitioner a \nFinal Notice of Intent to Levy and Notice of Your Right \nto a Hearing, informing her of the intent to collect the \nassessed balance of $31,802 for 2010 as well as a late pay-\nment penalty of $1,496 and interest.  On September 27, \n2013, petitioner\u2019s POA Frank Agostino timely submitted \non petitioner\u2019s behalf a Form 12153, Request for a Col-\nlection Due Process or Equivalent Hearing, and a cover \nletter.  Petitioner asserted in her Form 12153 and the \nattached letter that the $50,000 in estimated payments \nfor 2010 should have been applied to her tax due for 2010 \nand requested abatement of the late payment penalty \nfor reasonable cause.  Petitioner attached to the Form \n12153 a copy of the IRS account transcript for the 2010 \n \n6  The documents submitted by Mr. Gennardo for the Offer in Com-\npromise were not made part of the record.  At the hearing on the \nmotion for summary judgment respondent asserted that Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s OIC was for \u201chis tax liability for 2010 and other years\u201d. \n\n55a \n \nmarried filing joint showing the $50,000 in estimated \npayments and her 2010 Form 1040X. \nPetitioner\u2019s case was assigned to Settlement Officer \n(SO) Mario Tevis in the Newark, New Jersey Office.  \nSO Tevis and Mr. Brody had a telephone conversation \non March 10, 2014, during which Mr. Brody informed SO \nTevis that petitioner\u2019s husband Mr. Gennardo support-\nted petitioner\u2019s position regarding application of the es-\ntimated payments.  On March 17, 2014, Mr. Brody \nemailed to SO Tevis a declaration from Mr. Gennardo \nsigned under penalty of perjury and dated March 12, \n2014.  Mr. Gennardo asserted in this declaration that \nthe $50,000 in estimated tax payments for 2010 were in-\ntended to be joint estimated payments and he directed \nthat these payments be applied to petitioner\u2019s unpaid \ntax. \nOn July 29, 2014, SO Tevis and Mr. Brody conducted \na telephonic collection due process (CDP) hearing.  SO \nTevis informed Mr. Brody that he believed that the IRS \ncould not credit any of the $50,000 in estimated pay-\nments to petitioner\u2019s account because it had already \nbeen applied to Mr. Gennardo\u2019s account, which was  \nsubject to an OIC.  During this telephone conference \nSO Thompson also denied petitioner\u2019s request for abate-\nment of penalties. \nAfter the telephone conference Mr. Brody sent to SO \nThompson a letter dated July 29, 2014, via email, fax, \nand first class mail.  In his letter Mr. Brody argued \nagain that the $50,000 in estimated payments should be \ncredited to petitioner\u2019s 2010 account pursuant to her \nagreement with Mr. Gennardo, and for this reason any \npenalties for late payment should be abated.  Mr. \nBrody also stated that a penalty for late filing should be \n\n56a \n \nabated due to reasonable cause because petitioner \u201cwas \nunder extreme emotional distress due to her husband \nmoving out of the marital home to live with his boy-\nfriend\u201d and petitioner and Mr. Gennardo were \u201ccurrent-\nly in divorce proceedings.\u201d \nOn September 25, 2014, SO Thompson sent a Notice \nof Determination Concerning Collection Action(s) Un-\nder Section 6320 and/or 6330 of the Internal Revenue \nCode, sustaining the Final Notice of Intent to Levy (No-\ntice of Determination). \n \n 5. \nMotion for Summary Judgment \nOn October 22, 2014, petitioner timely filed a petition \ncommencing this case.  Petitioner asserts in her peti-\ntion that respondent should have allocated the $50,000 \nin estimated tax payments to her 2010 unpaid tax be-\ncause of her agreement with Mr. Gennardo and re-\nquested a refund of any overpayment.  Petitioner also \nrequested abatement of penalties.  \nOn April 29, 2015, respondent filed the Motion for \nSummary Judgment presently before the Court.  Re-\nspondent filed the Declaration of Mario C. Tevis in Sup-\nport of Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment.  \nOn June 25, 2015, petitioner filed a Notice of Objection \nto Motion for Summary Judgment, a Memorandum of \nLaw in Opposition to Respondent\u2019s Motion for Summary \nJudgment, and a Declaration of Lawrence M. Brody in \nSupport of Notice of Objection to Motion for Summary \nJudgment.  Petitioner\u2019s attorney Mr. Brody included \nwith his declaration as Exhibit C a copy of the Declara-\ntion of Patrick Gennardo, signed and dated June 24, \n2015.  On July 14, 2015, petitioner filed a Motion for \nLeave to File Out of Time Declaration of Jeffrey Dir-\n\n57a \n \nmann in Support for Notice of Objection, which the \nCourt granted. \nThe Court held a hearing on respondent\u2019s Motion at \nthe New York, New York trial session on October 31, \n2016. \nB. \nDiscussion \nSummary judgment serves to \u201cexpedite litigation \nand avoid unnecessary and expensive trials.\u201d  Florida \nPeach Corp. v. Commissioner, 90 T.C. 678, 681 (1988).  \nThe Court may grant summary judgment when there is \nno genuine dispute as to any material fact and a decision \nmay be rendered as a matter of law.  Rule 121(b); \nSundstrand Corp. v. Commissioner, 98 T.C. 518, 520 \n(1992), aff\u200a\u2019d, 17 F.3d 965 (7th Cir. 1994).  In deciding \nwhether to grant summary judgment, we construe  \nfactual materials and inferences drawn from them in  \nthe light most favorable to the nonmoving party. \nSundstrand Corp., 98 T.C. at 520.  Respondent, as the \nmoving party, bears the burden of proving that no gen-\nuine dispute or issue exists as to any material fact and \nthat respondent is entitled to judgment as a matter of \nlaw.  FPL Group, Inc. v. Commissioner, 115 T.C. 554, \n559 (2000); Bond v. Commissioner, 100 T.C. 32, 36 \n(1993); Naftel v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. 527, 529 (1985).  \nHowever, where the moving party properly makes and \nsupports a motion for summary judgment, the taxpayer \n\u201cmay not rest upon the mere allegations or denials of \nsuch party\u2019s pleading\u201d but must set forth specific facts \nshowing that there is a genuine dispute for trial.  Rule \n121(d); see also Naftel v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. at 529. \n \n\n58a \n \nSection 6331(a) authorizes the Secretary to levy upon \nproperty and property rights of a taxpayer liable for \ntaxes who fails to pay those taxes within 10 days after a \nnotice and demand for payment is made.  The taxpayer \nwho receives the notice can request a collection due pro-\ncess (CDP) hearing with an appeals officer.  Sec. \n6330(b).  The taxpayer can raise at the hearing \u201cany \nrelevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or proposed \nlevy\u201d including challenges to the appropriateness of the \ncollection action and an offer of a collection alternative.  \nSec. 6330(c)(2)(A).  If a CDP hearing is requested, the \nhearing is to be conducted by the IRS Office of Appeals, \nand, at the hearing, the officer conducting the confer-\nence must verify that the requirements of any applicable \nlaw or administrative procedure have been met.  Sec. \n6330(b)(1), (c)(1). \nThis Court has jurisdiction under section 6330 to re-\nview the Commissioner\u2019s administrative determina-\ntions.  Sec. 6330(d); see Iannone v. Commissioner, 122 \nT.C. 287,290 (2004).  Where the underlying tax liability \nis at properly at issue we review the determination de \nnovo.  Sego v. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 604, 610 (2000).  \nWhere the underlying tax liability is not at issue we re-\nview the determination for abuse of discretion.  Goza v. \nCommissioner, 114 T.C. 176, 182 (2000).  We need not \nand do not decide which standard to apply in the context \nof the motion for summary judgment.7  We conclude at \n \n7  See Freije v. Commissioner, 125 T.C. 14, 23, 26-27 (2005) (ap-\nplying abuse of discretion standard where taxpayer in CDP case \nchallenged IRS\u2019 failure to credit overpayments).  Compare \nLandry v. Commissioner, 116 T.C. 60, 62 (2001) (applying de novo \nstandard where taxpayer challenged application of overpayment \ncredits, reasoning that \u201cthe validity of the underlying tax liability, \ni.e., the amount unpaid after application of credits to which peti-\n \n\n59a \n \nthis juncture that respondent has not established that \nno genuine dispute exists as to material facts.  We do \nhowever make some observations based on the current \nstatus of the record. \nFirst, it would appear that the $20,000 estimated pay-\nment, accompanied with the Form 1040-ES listing both \npetitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gennardo\u2019s names and social secu-\nrity numbers, was a joint estimated tax payment.  We \ndo not fully understand the factual or legal basis upon \nwhich respondent applied the payment to Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax liabilities which was ultimately credited as \npart of the OIC. \nSecond, the status of the $30,000 estimated payment \nis even less clear.  Respondent asserts that the payment \nwas intended to be a separate payment, pointing to the \nfact that only Mr. Gennardo\u2019s name was written on the \ncheck.  Petitioner asserts that the payment was in-\ntended to be a joint payment, pointing to the fact that it \nwas made from the joint checking account she shared \nwith Mr. Gennardo, Mr. Gennardo\u2019s declaration that it \nwas intended to be an estimated payment, and Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s letter to the IRS that accompanied the payment \nwith the subject line \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and Jen-\nnifer Zuch\u201d.  We do not have further context regarding \nthis letter to Ms. Washington, such as her interactions \n \ntioner is entitled, [was] properly at issue\u201d), with Kovacevich v. \nCommissioner, T.C. Memo. 2009-160, 98 T.C.M. (CCH) 1, 4 & n.10 \n(applying abuse of discretion standard where taxpayer challenged \napplication of tax payments, reasoning that \u201cquestions about whether \na particular check was properly credited to a particular taxpayer\u2019s \naccount for a particular tax year are not challenges to his underly-\ning tax liability\u201d), and Orian v. Commissioner, T.C. Memo. 2010-\n234, 100 T.C.M. (CCH) 356, 359 (same). \n\n60a \n \nor conversation with Mr. Gennardo.  Nor do we know \nwhy only Mr. Gennardo\u2019 s name was written on the \ncheck.  It is also not clear from the record as to when \npetitioner and Mr. Gennardo decided to file their 2010 \nForm 1040s separately.  Thus, it is unclear whether the \n$30,000 payment was a separate payment or a joint pay-\nment. \nThird, circumstances surrounding Mr. Gennardo\u2019s \nOIC are not clear.  Issues that may be relevant include \nwhether the OIC included petitioner\u2019s and Mr. Gen-\nnardo\u2019s joint tax liabilities for 2007, 2008, and 2009 or \nany other joint liability tax year?  Further, if the OIC \ninvolved any joint tax liability year was petitioner in-\nvolved in the process? \nFor these reasons we find that respondent has not \nmet his burden of proving that no genuine dispute exists \nas to this material fact.  See FPL Group, Inc. v. Com-\nmissioner, 115 T.C. at 559; Bond v. Commissioner, 100 \nT.C. at 36; Naftel v. Commissioner, 85 T.C. at 529.  \nThus, we will deny respondent\u2019s motion for summary \njudgment.  See Rule 121(b); Sundstrand Corp. v. Com-\nmissioner, 98 T.C. at 520. \nUpon due consideration and for cause, it is \nORDERED that respondent\u2019s Motion For Summary \nJudgment, filed April 29, 2015, is denied. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n(Signed) Peter J.

The notice was issued out on 08/31/2013.  A \ntimely CDP request was received by Compliance on \n09/27/2013.  Appeals has determined to sustain the ac-\ntion (levy) taken by Compliance. \nBRIEF BACKGROUND \nAppeals issued letter 3855 to you on 11/20/2013.  Letter \n3855 requested that you provide Appeals with Form \n433-A.  Letter 3855 also set up for a phone conference \nto be held on 01/07/2014.  You were given 14 days, from \nthe date of Letter 3855 to provide Form 433-A.  Form \n433-A was provided and a face to face conference was \nrequested in the Newark Appeals office. \nOn 03/10/2014, S/O Tevis reviewed your case arid spoke \nwith your POA (Mr. Brody).  During that conversation, \nit was determined that a face to face conference was not \nnecessary. \nA telephonic conference was held on 07/29/2014 between \nS/O Tevis and POA Brody.  Your request to have the \n\n65a \n \npayment credits moved from your husband\u2019s account  \nto your account was denied.  Your request for penalty \nabatement was also denied.  It was agreed that you did \nnot want a collection alternative (i.e. installment agree-\nment, OIC) and that a Notice of Determination would be \nissued. \nLEGAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW \nI, Mario Tevis, verified the requirements of any applica-\nble law or administrative procedure were met.  IRS \nrecords confirmed the proper issuance of the notice and \ndemand, Notice of Intent to Levy and/or Notice of Fed-\neral Tax Lien (NFTL) filing, and notice of a right to a \nCollection Due Process (CDP) hearing. \nAn assessment was properly made for each tax and pe-\nriod listed on the CDP notice.   \nNotice and demand for payment was mailed to your last \nknown address. \nThere was a balance due when the Notice of Intent to \nLevy was issued or when the NFTL filing was request-\ned. \nI had no prior involvement with respect to the specific \ntax periods either in Appeals or Compliance. \nI reviewed the Collection file, IRS records and infor-\nmation you provided.  My review confirmed that the \nIRS followed all legal and procedural requirements and \nthe actions taken or proposed were appropriate under \nthe circumstances. \nISSUES YOU RAISED \nCollection Alternatives Requested \nYou offered no alternatives to collection. \n\n66a \n \nChallenges to the Liability \nYou disagree with your liability because you felt that \nyou should be given credit for the tax payments made to \nyour husband\u2019s account.  You also felt that you should \nbe granted penalty abatement. \nAppeals reviewed that you filed an original 1040 and \nthen an amended 1040 for the 12/31/2010 tax year.  The \noriginal 1040 showed that you were entitled to a refund.  \nThe subsequent (amended) return was filed with a tax \nbalance due. \nYou requested that the payments made on your hus-\nband\u2019s account be transferred to your account.  Ap-\npeals is not in a position to move credits from your hus-\nband\u2019s account to your account.  Your request is being \ndenied.  \nAppeals is also not in a position to grant your penalty \nabatement request because you have not demonstrated \n\u201creasonable cause\u201d for abatement.  You claim that you \nwere under duress from your divorce.  Appeals does \nnot agree that you should be granted penalty abatement \nbased upon the aforementioned reasoning. \n \nYou raised no other issues. \nBALANCING ANALYSIS \nAppeals reviewed both your tax payment transfer re-\nquest and your request for penalty abatement.  Ap-\npeals has determined that we cannot transfer any pay-\nments made to husband\u2019s account to your account.  Ap-\npeals has also determined that you do not qualify for \npenalty abatement (reasonable cause). \nTherefore, our determination is that the proposed levy \naction balances the need for efficient collection of taxes \n\n67a \n \nwith the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern that any collec-\ntion action be no more intrusive than necessary.

Based on my internal reasoning, my understanding has now been structured. I now believe the central issue of this case is the legal doctrine of **mootness**. The specific question is whether a taxpayer's pre-deprivation challenge to a proposed IRS levy, brought under the statute **26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330**, is rendered moot when the IRS subsequently collects the disputed tax through other means (in this instance, by seizing the taxpayer's refunds from other years). This situation directly implicates the **\"voluntary cessation\" exception** to the mootness doctrine. The core conflict appears to be whether the government's action of collecting the tax, which it controls, can unilaterally terminate a taxpayer's statutory right to challenge the underlying liability before the levy occurs. To form a prediction, I must investigate how the Supreme Court has previously applied the voluntary cessation doctrine, particularly in cases involving government action that resolves the immediate dispute but leaves the underlying legal question unresolved.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief was that I had no knowledge of effective strategies for predicting Supreme Court outcomes. My own reasoning process has now established a foundational heuristic. An effective initial strategy for analyzing a new Supreme Court case is to:\n1.  **Identify the core legal question and relevant statute:** Isolate the central legal doctrine at play (here, mootness) and the specific law being interpreted (26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330).\n2.  **Pinpoint key legal concepts:** Identify specific sub-doctrines or exceptions that will frame the arguments (the 'voluntary cessation' exception).\n3.  **Prioritize primary source documents:** Recognize that the most reliable and direct source of information for understanding the parties' legal positions are the briefs they file with the Court.\n4.  **Strategically select the first document:** The **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari** is a high-value starting point. It provides a concise and powerful summary of the petitioner's (in this case, the government's) argument, explaining why the lower court's decision was allegedly incorrect and why the issue is of national importance. Analyzing this document first is an efficient method for building a foundational understanding of one side of the case. This confirms that a document-centric approach, starting with the petition, is a valuable design for information gathering."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case continues to be structured around the legal doctrine of mootness as applied to 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330 proceedings. My initial belief that the \"voluntary cessation\" exception was central has been refined. The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, filed by the Solicitor General, reveals that the government's argument is more specifically focused on statutory and jurisdictional mootness. The government's core contention is that a \u00a7 6330 proceeding, which is a pre-deprivation challenge to a *proposed levy*, becomes moot once the levy is no longer necessary or intended. In this instance, the IRS used its separate statutory authority under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402(a) to offset Zuch's tax liability to zero using her subsequent overpayments, thereby eliminating the need for the levy.\n\nThe petition provides several critical new pieces of information that substantially shape my predictive model:\n1.  **The Petitioner's Argument is Two-Fold:**\n    *   First, the Tax Court's jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 is limited to reviewing the levy determination. Once the proposed levy is abandoned, the \"matter\" under review is gone, and the court's jurisdiction evaporates. The ability to challenge the \"underlying tax liability\" under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) is ancillary to a live levy dispute, not an independent grant of jurisdiction.\n    *   Second, the Tax Court has no jurisdiction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding to review the validity of offsets made under \u00a7 6402. The government argues that the proper venue for challenging an offset is a separate, post-deprivation refund suit in a federal district court or the Court of Federal Claims, as specified by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a).\n2.  **A Clear Circuit Split Exists:** This is a crucial development. The government's petition explicitly states that the Third Circuit's decision in *Zuch* creates a conflict with the Fourth Circuit (*McLane v. Commissioner*, 24 F.4th 316) and the D.C. Circuit (*Willson v. Commissioner*, 805 F.3d 316). Both of these circuits have held that a \u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot when the IRS no longer seeks to levy. The existence of a circuit split is a primary reason for the Supreme Court to grant certiorari and suggests that at least two other appellate courts find the government's position persuasive.\n3.  **Key Precedents Identified:** The government's case will rely heavily on the aforementioned circuit court decisions (*McLane*, *Willson*), as well as Tax Court precedent like *Greene-Thapedi v. Commissioner*, which supports the view that the challenge to the underlying liability is not an independent cause of action.\n\nMy prediction now leans more strongly toward the petitioner (the Commissioner). The argument that \u00a7 6330 provides a narrow, pre-levy remedy, and that other disputes (like the validity of offsets) must be handled through other statutory channels (refund suits), appears to be a classic jurisdictional argument that often appeals to the Supreme Court. The existence of a circuit split in the government's favor is a powerful signal. My next step must be to understand the respondent's counter-argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design, which prioritized identifying the core legal question and then analyzing the Petition for Certiorari, has been proven exceptionally effective. This single observation has provided a comprehensive map of the petitioner's legal strategy, the procedural posture, and the crucial context of a circuit split. My design principles have evolved and become more sophisticated:\n1.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Primacy of the Cert Petition:** The strategy of starting with the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is confirmed as a highly efficient method for building a foundational understanding of a case. It provides the legal question, one party's full argument, and the strategic reasons for Supreme Court review.\n2.  **New Heuristic - The \"Circuit Split\" Signal:** The most impactful piece of information for prediction was the existence of a circuit split. A new, high-priority design principle is: \"In the initial analysis of any Supreme Court case, the first objective after identifying the legal question is to determine if a circuit split exists. The cert petition is the most likely place to find this stated explicitly. The presence, nature, and direction of the split are first-order variables for predicting the case outcome.\"\n3.  **Refined Heuristic - Strategic Document Analysis:** I have learned to leverage the standardized structure of legal filings. For a cert petition, the \"Question Presented\" provides the issue, but the \"Reasons for Granting the Petition\" section provides the strategic context, such as circuit splits and national importance. My methodology is now refined to specifically target these sections for maximum efficiency.\n4.  **Iterative Information Gathering:** The cert petition, as an advocacy document, presents a one-sided view. This confirms that a robust design must be iterative and adversarial. The value of the petition lies in how clearly it frames the arguments that the respondent must now counter. Therefore, the next logical and most informative action is to seek out the opposing primary source: the **Brief in Opposition to the Petition for Certiorari**. This will allow me to directly compare the arguments, identify points of contention, and evaluate the strength of the respondent's position against the government's now well-understood case."

No. 105-174 (1998) .......................................... 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case doesn\u2019t warrant the Court\u2019s interven-\ntion. The court of appeals reached the correct result, \nand its decision does not conflict with any decision of \nthis Court or another court of appeals. And despite the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to frame a broad question pre-\nsented, the actual question presented is narrow and \narises rarely, and then only as a result of the govern-\nment\u2019s own choices to retain the taxpayer\u2019s money \ndespite a live dispute over liability. The Court should \ndeny review. \nThe petition arises from the IRS\u2019s continuing at-\ntempt to bar the Tax Court from reviewing the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals\u2019 (Appeals Office) \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d of \u201cthe existence or amount of\u201d Respondent \nJennifer Zuch\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (c)(3), (d)(1). By statute, \u201cthe Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe parties\u2019 liability dispute arises from the IRS\u2019s \nchoices about how to apply payments from Zuch and \nher ex-husband. The IRS and Zuch agree that Zuch \nowed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax year. After Zuch \nand her ex-husband made $50,000 in prepayments to \nthe IRS in 2010 and 2011, they asked the IRS to apply \nthose payments to Zuch\u2019s $27,000 balance. But the \nIRS refused. It instead applied the $50,000 to Zuch\u2019s \nex-husband\u2019s separate tax balance and sought to col-\nlect Zuch\u2019s balance by levying\u2014seizing\u2014her property.  \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330, challenging the proposed levy and her under-\nlying tax liability, and claiming that the IRS \nincorrectly applied the $50,000 to her ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance rather than hers. While her challenge was \n\n2 \n \n \npending, Zuch overpaid her taxes for later years, \nmeaning the IRS should have sent her refund pay-\nments. But the IRS kept the money instead, using the \noverpayments to offset the $27,000 balance it insisted \nthe $50,000 prepayments hadn\u2019t covered. And once it \nhad collected $27,000 in overpayments, the IRS asked \nthe Tax Court to dismiss the \u00a7 6330 proceeding as \nmoot. In the IRS\u2019s view, even though Zuch still dis-\nputed her underlying liability, it had taken her \nmoney, so the case was over. \nThe Tax Court granted the motion and dismissed \nZuch\u2019s petition. But the Third Circuit reversed. As the \ncourt of appeals explained, the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination \nregarding, and declare, Zuch\u2019s underlying liability be-\ncause the parties continued to dispute that liability. \nThat decision was correct and doesn\u2019t conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or any other court of appeals. \nThe D.C. Circuit and Fourth Circuit decisions that the \ngovernment claims create a circuit split found moot-\nness only where the parties no longer disputed the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability. The question here\u2014\nwhether the case is moot when the parties continue to \ndispute liability\u2014is narrow and rarely arises, and the \nThird Circuit\u2019s resolution of the question presents no \npractical concerns, especially since taxpayers can file \nrefund suits anyway. But there is no reason in judicial \neconomy or workable administration of the tax laws to \nforce taxpayers to do that rather than to allow the Tax \nCourt to decide the question. \n1. The decision below is correct. Under \u00a7 6330, \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d of Zuch\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax lia-\nbility,\u201d because she didn\u2019t have an earlier opportunity \nto dispute that liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). \n\n3 \n \n \nThat jurisdiction allows the Tax Court to declare that \nZuch does not in fact have any underlying liability\u2014\nbecause, for instance, the estimated payments should \nhave been credited to her account rather than her ex-\nhusband\u2019s. And if Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to \nsend her a refund. But even if it doesn\u2019t, the judgment \nwould have preclusive effect in a later tax refund suit \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a). The IRS\u2019s counterarguments\u2014\nthat once it no longer needs the levy, a \u00a7 6330 proceed-\ning is moot\u2014contradict the text of the statute, \ndiscount the role of declaratory relief, and misunder-\nstand mootness doctrine. \n2. The court of appeals\u2019 decision doesn\u2019t conflict \nwith any decision of this Court or any other court of \nappeals. The government claims that the Third Cir-\ncuit split from the D.C. and Fourth Circuits. But those \ncourts\u2019 decisions hold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability. The Third Circuit didn\u2019t answer \nthat question. And the D.C. and Fourth Circuits, con-\nversely, did not address the question presented here: \nwhether the Tax Court retains jurisdiction where \nthere is a live dispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying \nliability despite the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the \nlevy. There is no circuit conflict. \nThe IRS also claims that the Third Circuit\u2019s alter-\nnative holding that the Tax Court has \u201cimplicit\u201d \njurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings splits from a few decisions stating that the Tax \nCourt can exercise jurisdiction only when Congress \nexpressly grants it. But none of the decisions the IRS \ncites addresses that question\u2014indeed, two of the \nthree don\u2019t even involve \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And there \n\n4 \n \n \nis no reason to review an alternative holding that does \nnot change the outcome anyway. \n3. The decision below doesn\u2019t warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention for any other reason, either. The \nquestion presented doesn\u2019t arise in the vast majority \nof \u00a7 6330 proceedings. That\u2019s because it can arise only \nwhere the IRS itself decides to keep the taxpayer\u2019s \nmoney to satisfy a claimed liability, all while avoiding \njudicial review of that disputed liability. And contrary \nto the government\u2019s suggestion, the Third Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision doesn\u2019t open the canal lock doors, much less the \nfloodgates. After all, if the IRS wrongly withholds a \nrefund, the taxpayer can head to court under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422\u2014meaning that the government\u2019s approach ac-\ntually undermines judicial economy. Nor is there \nmerit to the IRS\u2019s argument that the decision below \nwill turn \u00a7 6330 proceedings into forums for general \ngrievances about tax liabilities. Section 6330 proceed-\nings necessarily start with a notice of levy, and the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under that statute is limited to re-\nviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c), (d)(1). Section 6330 is not, and will not be-\ncome, a general forum for tax-liability challenges.  \nThe Court should deny review. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background  \n1. Taxpayers have various ways to dispute the \namount of taxes the IRS claims they owe. If the IRS \ndetermines that a taxpayer owes more taxes than she \nreported on her tax return\u2014i.e., that there is a defi-\nciency\u2014the IRS typically sends her a notice of \ndeficiency. I.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the tax-\npayer may challenge the deficiency in Tax Court. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax \n\n5 \n \n \nCourt can determine the correct amount of tax owed \nand whether the taxpayer made overpayments, enti-\ntling the taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), 6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final order is \nreviewable by a federal court of appeals. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the taxpayer does not challenge the de-\nficiency, she can pay the disputed amount and seek a \nrefund in district court or the Court of Federal Claims. \nSee I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the IRS \nseeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a \ntax remains unpaid even after a taxpayer receives a \nnotice of deficiency. Or perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid \nthe amount the IRS claims she owes, but she didn\u2019t \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to dispute her liability. In either situation, \nthe IRS may pursue a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, P.C. v. Commis-\nsioner, \n596 \nU.S. \n199, \n202 \n(2022); \nByers \nv. \nCommissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nThis case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding where the par-\nties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability. \nThe issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection due \nprocess hearing depend in part on whether the tax-\npayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If not, she may \nraise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of her li-\nability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). In this way, a collection \n\n6 \n \n \ndue process hearing serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability. Indeed, the whole point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. \nS. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67 (1998); see Montgomery v. \nCommissioner, 122 T.C. 1, 10 (2004) (\u201c6330 reflect[s] \ncongressional intent that the Commissioner should \ncollect the correct amount of tax, and do so by observ-\ning \nall \napplicable \nlaws \nand \nadministrative \nprocedures\u201d). And liability challenges aside, all tax-\npayers in collection due process proceedings may raise \n\u201cany relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the \nproposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal de-\nfenses,\u201d \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of \ncollection actions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alterna-\ntives.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals Office then \nmakes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take into consid-\neration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to her underlying \nliability and other issues. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s decision is subject to re-\nview in a federal court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \n\n7 \n \n \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax liability rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of \ntheir divorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that \nthe IRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the \nIRS instead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1983 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. App. \n8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted an es-\ntimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn from \na bank account listing both their names. Pet. App. 8a \n& n.11. The form accompanying the check also listed \nboth names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January 2011, \nGennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. \nPet. App. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompany-\ning the check read \u201cRe: Patrick J.

See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330. At the hearing, the \ntaxpayer may raise \u201cany relevant issue relating to the \nunpaid \ntax \nor \nthe \nproposed \nlevy.\u201d \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The taxpayer may also challenge her \nunderlying tax liability if she did not previously have \nan opportunity to do so. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). After \nthe Appeals Office renders its decision, the taxpayer \nmay \u201cpetition the Tax Court for review of such deter-\nmination,\u201d \u201cand the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction \nwith respect to such matter.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe question presented is whether the Tax Court \nretains jurisdiction under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review and \nissue declaratory relief as to the Appeals Office\u2019s de-\ntermination of the taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nwhen, despite the parties\u2019 live dispute about that lia-\nbility, the IRS stops pursuing the levy. \n \n \n\nii \n \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nPetitioner\u2019s lists of the parties to the proceeding \nand directly related proceedings are complete and cor-\nrect.  \n \n \n\niii \n \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage \nQUESTION PRESENTED ........................................... i \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS ................................ ii \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES ........................................ v \nINTRODUCTION ........................................................ 1 \nSTATEMENT .............................................................. 4 \nA. Legal background ........................................... 4 \nB. Factual and procedural background .............. 7 \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION .......... 11 \nI. \nThe court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. ............ 14 \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review and declare \nZuch\u2019s tax liability. ....................................... 14 \n1. The Tax Court had, and retained, \njurisdiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s \ndetermination of Zuch\u2019s disputed \nunderlying tax liability. ......................... 14 \n2. The Tax Court had authority to declare \nwhether and to what extent Zuch was \nliable. ...................................................... 19 \nB. Zuch\u2019s case didn\u2019t become moot when \nthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the \nlevy, because the parties disputed, and \nthe Tax Court had the power to decide, \nZuch\u2019s underlying tax liability. .................... 20 \nC.

The Third Circuit\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t \nconflict with the decisions of the D.C. or \nFourth Circuits. ............................................ 25 \n1. The D.C. and Fourth Circuits hold that a \n\u00a7 6330 review proceeding is moot when \nthe IRS concedes that the taxpayer was \nnot liable and stops pursuing the levy. . 26 \n2. Those holdings that a \u00a7 6330 review \nproceeding is moot when there is no \nliability dispute do not conflict with the \nThird Circuit\u2019s holding that the Tax \nCourt retains jurisdiction where there is \na live liability dispute. ........................... 28 \nB.

No. 105-174 (1998) .......................................... 6 \n \n \n \n \n \n\n1 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nThis case doesn\u2019t warrant the Court\u2019s interven-\ntion. The court of appeals reached the correct result, \nand its decision does not conflict with any decision of \nthis Court or another court of appeals. And despite the \ngovernment\u2019s efforts to frame a broad question pre-\nsented, the actual question presented is narrow and \narises rarely, and then only as a result of the govern-\nment\u2019s own choices to retain the taxpayer\u2019s money \ndespite a live dispute over liability. The Court should \ndeny review. \nThe petition arises from the IRS\u2019s continuing at-\ntempt to bar the Tax Court from reviewing the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals\u2019 (Appeals Office) \u201cdeter-\nmination\u201d of \u201cthe existence or amount of\u201d Respondent \nJennifer Zuch\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (c)(3), (d)(1). By statute, \u201cthe Tax \nCourt shall have jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nThe parties\u2019 liability dispute arises from the IRS\u2019s \nchoices about how to apply payments from Zuch and \nher ex-husband. The IRS and Zuch agree that Zuch \nowed about $27,000 for the 2010 tax year. After Zuch \nand her ex-husband made $50,000 in prepayments to \nthe IRS in 2010 and 2011, they asked the IRS to apply \nthose payments to Zuch\u2019s $27,000 balance. But the \nIRS refused. It instead applied the $50,000 to Zuch\u2019s \nex-husband\u2019s separate tax balance and sought to col-\nlect Zuch\u2019s balance by levying\u2014seizing\u2014her property.  \nZuch exercised her right to a hearing under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330, challenging the proposed levy and her under-\nlying tax liability, and claiming that the IRS \nincorrectly applied the $50,000 to her ex-husband\u2019s \nbalance rather than hers. While her challenge was \n\n2 \n \n \npending, Zuch overpaid her taxes for later years, \nmeaning the IRS should have sent her refund pay-\nments. But the IRS kept the money instead, using the \noverpayments to offset the $27,000 balance it insisted \nthe $50,000 prepayments hadn\u2019t covered. And once it \nhad collected $27,000 in overpayments, the IRS asked \nthe Tax Court to dismiss the \u00a7 6330 proceeding as \nmoot. In the IRS\u2019s view, even though Zuch still dis-\nputed her underlying liability, it had taken her \nmoney, so the case was over. \nThe Tax Court granted the motion and dismissed \nZuch\u2019s petition. But the Third Circuit reversed. As the \ncourt of appeals explained, the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination \nregarding, and declare, Zuch\u2019s underlying liability be-\ncause the parties continued to dispute that liability. \nThat decision was correct and doesn\u2019t conflict with any \ndecision of this Court or any other court of appeals. \nThe D.C. Circuit and Fourth Circuit decisions that the \ngovernment claims create a circuit split found moot-\nness only where the parties no longer disputed the \ntaxpayer\u2019s underlying liability. The question here\u2014\nwhether the case is moot when the parties continue to \ndispute liability\u2014is narrow and rarely arises, and the \nThird Circuit\u2019s resolution of the question presents no \npractical concerns, especially since taxpayers can file \nrefund suits anyway. But there is no reason in judicial \neconomy or workable administration of the tax laws to \nforce taxpayers to do that rather than to allow the Tax \nCourt to decide the question. \n1. The decision below is correct. Under \u00a7 6330, \nthe Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d of Zuch\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax lia-\nbility,\u201d because she didn\u2019t have an earlier opportunity \nto dispute that liability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). \n\n3 \n \n \nThat jurisdiction allows the Tax Court to declare that \nZuch does not in fact have any underlying liability\u2014\nbecause, for instance, the estimated payments should \nhave been credited to her account rather than her ex-\nhusband\u2019s. And if Zuch prevails, the IRS is likely to \nsend her a refund. But even if it doesn\u2019t, the judgment \nwould have preclusive effect in a later tax refund suit \nunder I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a). The IRS\u2019s counterarguments\u2014\nthat once it no longer needs the levy, a \u00a7 6330 proceed-\ning is moot\u2014contradict the text of the statute, \ndiscount the role of declaratory relief, and misunder-\nstand mootness doctrine. \n2. The court of appeals\u2019 decision doesn\u2019t conflict \nwith any decision of this Court or any other court of \nappeals. The government claims that the Third Cir-\ncuit split from the D.C. and Fourth Circuits. But those \ncourts\u2019 decisions hold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability. The Third Circuit didn\u2019t answer \nthat question. And the D.C. and Fourth Circuits, con-\nversely, did not address the question presented here: \nwhether the Tax Court retains jurisdiction where \nthere is a live dispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying \nliability despite the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing the \nlevy. There is no circuit conflict. \nThe IRS also claims that the Third Circuit\u2019s alter-\nnative holding that the Tax Court has \u201cimplicit\u201d \njurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 proceed-\nings splits from a few decisions stating that the Tax \nCourt can exercise jurisdiction only when Congress \nexpressly grants it. But none of the decisions the IRS \ncites addresses that question\u2014indeed, two of the \nthree don\u2019t even involve \u00a7 6330 proceedings. And there \n\n4 \n \n \nis no reason to review an alternative holding that does \nnot change the outcome anyway. \n3. The decision below doesn\u2019t warrant this \nCourt\u2019s intervention for any other reason, either. The \nquestion presented doesn\u2019t arise in the vast majority \nof \u00a7 6330 proceedings. That\u2019s because it can arise only \nwhere the IRS itself decides to keep the taxpayer\u2019s \nmoney to satisfy a claimed liability, all while avoiding \njudicial review of that disputed liability. And contrary \nto the government\u2019s suggestion, the Third Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision doesn\u2019t open the canal lock doors, much less the \nfloodgates. After all, if the IRS wrongly withholds a \nrefund, the taxpayer can head to court under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422\u2014meaning that the government\u2019s approach ac-\ntually undermines judicial economy. Nor is there \nmerit to the IRS\u2019s argument that the decision below \nwill turn \u00a7 6330 proceedings into forums for general \ngrievances about tax liabilities. Section 6330 proceed-\nings necessarily start with a notice of levy, and the Tax \nCourt\u2019s jurisdiction under that statute is limited to re-\nviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. See I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c), (d)(1). Section 6330 is not, and will not be-\ncome, a general forum for tax-liability challenges.  \nThe Court should deny review. \nSTATEMENT \nA. Legal background  \n1. Taxpayers have various ways to dispute the \namount of taxes the IRS claims they owe. If the IRS \ndetermines that a taxpayer owes more taxes than she \nreported on her tax return\u2014i.e., that there is a defi-\nciency\u2014the IRS typically sends her a notice of \ndeficiency. I.R.C. \u00a7 6212(a). Within 90 days, the tax-\npayer may challenge the deficiency in Tax Court. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6213(a). In the deficiency proceeding, the Tax \n\n5 \n \n \nCourt can determine the correct amount of tax owed \nand whether the taxpayer made overpayments, enti-\ntling the taxpayer to a refund or credit. I.R.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 6214(a), 6512(b)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s final order is \nreviewable by a federal court of appeals. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7482(a)(1). If the taxpayer does not challenge the de-\nficiency, she can pay the disputed amount and seek a \nrefund in district court or the Court of Federal Claims. \nSee I.R.C. \u00a7 7422(a).  \n2. This case centers on a third way a taxpayer \ncan challenge the taxes the IRS assesses when the IRS \nseeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. Sometimes, a \ntax remains unpaid even after a taxpayer receives a \nnotice of deficiency. Or perhaps a taxpayer hasn\u2019t paid \nthe amount the IRS claims she owes, but she didn\u2019t \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to dispute her liability. In either situation, \nthe IRS may pursue a levy. I.R.C. \u00a7 6331(a), (b). \nIf the IRS issues a levy notice, the taxpayer has 30 \ndays to request an administrative hearing before the \nAppeals Office under I.R.C. \u00a7 6330, sometimes called \na \u201ccollection due process\u201d hearing, to challenge the \nproposed levy and her underlying tax liability. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(b), (c)(2)(B); see Boechler, P.C. v. Commis-\nsioner, \n596 \nU.S. \n199, \n202 \n(2022); \nByers \nv. \nCommissioner, 740 F.3d 668, 671-72 (D.C. Cir. 2014). \nThis case involves a \u00a7 6330 proceeding where the par-\nties dispute the taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability. \nThe issues a taxpayer may raise in a collection due \nprocess hearing depend in part on whether the tax-\npayer received a notice of deficiency or had another \nopportunity to dispute her liability. If not, she may \nraise \u201cchallenges to the existence or amount\u201d of her li-\nability. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). In this way, a collection \n\n6 \n \n \ndue process hearing serves as a backstop, ensuring \nthat a taxpayer has an opportunity to dispute her un-\nderlying tax liability. Indeed, the whole point of \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings is to \u201cincrease fairness to taxpayers\u201d be-\nfore the IRS deprives them of their property. \nS. Rep. No. 105-174, at 67 (1998); see Montgomery v. \nCommissioner, 122 T.C. 1, 10 (2004) (\u201c6330 reflect[s] \ncongressional intent that the Commissioner should \ncollect the correct amount of tax, and do so by observ-\ning \nall \napplicable \nlaws \nand \nadministrative \nprocedures\u201d). And liability challenges aside, all tax-\npayers in collection due process proceedings may raise \n\u201cany relevant issue relating to the unpaid tax or the \nproposed levy, including\u201d \u201cappropriate spousal de-\nfenses,\u201d \u201cchallenges to the appropriateness of \ncollection actions,\u201d and \u201coffers of collection alterna-\ntives.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(A). The Appeals Office then \nmakes a \u201cdetermination\u201d that \u201cshall take into consid-\neration\u201d the taxpayer\u2019s challenge to her underlying \nliability and other issues. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B). \nAlthough it is an important backstop, a collection \ndue process hearing \u201clacks the typical hallmarks of a \njudicial hearing\u201d and is \u201cfar from \u2026 a formal hearing.\u201d \nFarhy v. Commissioner, 100 F.4th 223, 227 (D.C. Cir. \n2024). \u201cThere are no formal discovery procedures, and \nthe taxpayer has no right to subpoena documents or \nwitnesses.\u201d Id. Rather, the hearing \u201cprovides the tax-\npayer \u2018an opportunity for an informal oral or written \nconversation with the IRS.\u2019\u201d Id. \nAfter the Appeals Office issues its \u201cdetermina-\ntion,\u201d the taxpayer may \u201cpetition the Tax Court for \nreview of such determination (and the Tax Court shall \nhave jurisdiction with respect to such matter).\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(d)(1). The Tax Court\u2019s decision is subject to re-\nview in a federal court of appeals. I.R.C. \u00a7 7482(a)(1). \n\n7 \n \n \nB. Factual and procedural background \nThis case arises from a dispute over whether the \nIRS properly credited $50,000 in overpayments from \nZuch and her ex-husband, Patrick Gennardo, to Gen-\nnardo\u2019s tax liability rather than Zuch\u2019s in the wake of \ntheir divorce. Both Zuch and Gennardo maintain that \nthe IRS should have credited Zuch\u2019s account, but the \nIRS instead credited Gennardo\u2019s, sought to levy Zuch\u2019s \nproperty, and unilaterally decided to withhold over-\npayments Zuch made in later tax years. \n1. Zuch and Gennardo were married from 1983 \nto 2014. Pet. App. 7a. They separated in 2010, and \nZuch initiated divorce proceedings in 2012. CA3 \nApp. A118. During that time, the IRS assessed sub-\nstantial taxes against Zuch and Gennardo, prompting \nyears of litigation. \na. In 2010 and 2011, Zuch and Gennardo submit-\nted $50,000 in prepayments to the IRS for what they \nestimated would be their 2010 tax liability. Pet. App. \n8a. In particular, in June 2010, they submitted an es-\ntimated payment of $20,000 using a check drawn from \na bank account listing both their names. Pet. App. 8a \n& n.11. The form accompanying the check also listed \nboth names. Pet. App. 8a n.11, 51a. In January 2011, \nGennardo sent the IRS a check for $30,000. \nPet. App. 8a. The subject line of the letter accompany-\ning the check read \u201cRe: Patrick J. Gennardo and \nJennifer Zuch,\u201d and although the check was from Zuch \nand Gennardo\u2019s joint bank account, the check listed \nonly Gennardo\u2019s name. Pet. App. 8a n.12, 51a. At the \ntime, Zuch and Gennardo didn\u2019t tell the IRS how to \nallocate the payments. Pet. App. 8a. \nb. In 2012 and 2013, Zuch and Gennardo filed \nuntimely, and later amended, tax returns for 2010, \n\n8 \n \n \nand the IRS applied the $50,000 in prepayments to \nGennardo\u2019s, rather than Zuch\u2019s, tax liabilities. \nPet. App. 7a-8a. The IRS\u2019s decision gave rise to the \nparties\u2019 dispute over Zuch\u2019s underlying tax liability. \nIn September 2012, Zuch and Gennardo filed sep-\narate married-filing-separately returns. Pet. App. 7a. \nZuch\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross income of \n$74,493 and a $731 overpayment, and didn\u2019t mention \nthe prepayments from 2010 and 2011. Pet. App. 7a-8a \n& n.9. Gennardo\u2019s return showed an adjusted gross in-\ncome of $1,077,213 and $385,393 in taxes owed. Pet. \nApp. 8a. The same day that Gennardo filed his return, \nhe also filed an offer-in-compromise, seeking to settle \nhis accumulated tax debts at less than the amount \ndue. Id.; see I.R.C. \u00a7 7122(a). The IRS later notified \nhim that it had applied the $50,000 in prepayments \ntowards the $385,393 in taxes he owed. Pet. App. 8a. \nZuch then filed an amended return for 2010 to re-\nport $71,000 in additional income from a retirement \naccount distribution. Pet. App. 9a. Zuch\u2019s amended re-\nturn showed that she owed the IRS $27,682. Id. She \nclaimed that the $50,000 in prepayments should be \ncredited to her and requested a refund of $21,918. Id. \nThe IRS assessed the additional $27,682 in taxes that \nZuch reported, but it refused to credit her for the \n$50,000 or issue any refund. Id. \nIn March 2013, while his offer-in-compromise was \npending, Gennardo filed an amended return for 2010. \nPet. App. 9a. He indicated that the $50,000 in prepay-\nments should be credited to Zuch, but the IRS still \nrefused to allocate it to her tax bill. Pet. App. 9a-10a; \nsee Pet. App. 55a. \nc. Gennardo later submitted an amended offer-\nin-compromise, which the IRS accepted. Pet. App. 10a. \n\n9 \n \n \nEven though Gennardo had asked the IRS to credit \nthe $50,000 to Zuch, the IRS credited the entire sum \nto him. Id. \n2. Zuch never received a notice of deficiency from \nthe IRS. Pet. App. 9a n.13. But in August 2013, the \nIRS notified her that it intended to levy her property \nbecause she had failed to pay her 2010 tax liability \nand explained that she had 30 days to request a col-\nlection due process hearing before the Appeals Office. \nPet. App. 10a. \n3. Zuch timely requested a hearing. Id. At the \nhearing, Zuch challenged her \u201cunderlying tax liabil-\nity\u201d because she did not receive a notice of deficiency \nor otherwise have an opportunity to dispute it. I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B); Pet. App. 10a. Zuch argued that the \n$50,000 in prepayments should have been credited to \nher, reducing her tax liability to $0 and entitling her \nto a refund. Pet. App. 10a. \nIn September 2014, the Appeals Office sustained \nthe proposed levy. It told Zuch that it was \u201cnot in a \nposition\u201d to credit her for the $50,000 because the IRS \nhad credited the money to Gennardo. Pet. App. 11a. \n4. Zuch petitioned the Tax Court for review. Id. \nShe sought review of her tax liability and a ruling that \nthe $50,000 should have been applied to her individ-\nual tax balance. Id. After the IRS moved for summary \njudgment, id., the Tax Court remanded to the Appeals \nOffice because it wasn\u2019t clear why the IRS had applied \nthe $50,000 towards Gennardo\u2019s liability rather than \nZuch\u2019s, Pet. App. 11a-12a. \n5. In June 2017, the Appeals Office again sus-\ntained the proposed levy. Pet. App. 12a. It reasoned \nthat the levy \u201cbalance[d] the need for efficient collec-\ntion of taxes with the taxpayer\u2019s legitimate concern \n\n10 \n \n \nthat any collection action be no more intrusive than \nnecessary.\u201d CA3 App. A270. \n6. The case returned to the Tax Court. Pet. App. \n12a. Meanwhile, over the course of the six years the \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings had been pending, Zuch kept pay-\ning her taxes for later years. In fact, she overpaid. But \nrather than issuing her refunds, the IRS kept Zuch\u2019s \noverpayments and used them to offset her claimed \n2010 liability. Pet. App. 12a-13a. The IRS did so six \ntimes: \u201conce each in 2013, 2014, 2015, and 2019, and \ntwice in 2016.\u201d Id. And in April 2019, after the case \nhad returned to the Tax Court, the IRS kept Zuch\u2019s \nmoney a final time to offset the rest of her claimed \n2010 tax balance, reducing it to $0. Pet. App. 13a. \nThe IRS then moved to dismiss the Tax Court pro-\nceedings as moot. Id. The Tax Court granted the \nmotion. Id. The Tax Court concluded that it lacked ju-\nrisdiction over the case and that the case was moot \nbecause \u201cthere [was] no unpaid liability \u2026 upon which \na levy could be based,\u201d and the IRS was no longer \nseeking to levy Zuch\u2019s property. Pet. App. 43a. \n7. The Third Circuit vacated the Tax Court\u2019s de-\ncision, held that the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to decide Zuch\u2019s challenge to her tax liability \nand that the case wasn\u2019t moot, and remanded for pro-\nceedings on the merits. Pet. App. 1a-39a. \nThe court first held that the Tax Court had juris-\ndiction to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination of \nZuch\u2019s liability. Because Zuch had neither received a \nnotice of deficiency nor had an opportunity to contest \nher liability before her collection due process hearing, \nZuch could challenge \u201cthe existence or amount of [her] \nunderlying \ntax \nliability\u201d \nduring \nthe \nhearing. \nPet. App. 14a-15a; see I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Tax \n\n11 \n \n \nCourt, in turn, had jurisdiction to consider the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s resolution of Zuch\u2019s challenge. Pet. App. \n14a-15a. Indeed, the IRS didn\u2019t dispute that the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction at the outset to review whether \nthe IRS improperly allocated the prepayments. Pet. \nApp. 15a n.22. And, the court explained, \u201cZuch\u2019s argu-\nment that her estimated tax payments were \nerroneously allocated to her ex-husband is a challenge \nto her underlying tax liability under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B).\u201d \nPet. App. 19a. \nThe court of appeals then held that the Tax Court \nhad jurisdiction over Zuch\u2019s challenge, and that Zuch\u2019s \nchallenge was not moot, for two independent reasons. \nPet. App. 19a-38a. First, the court held that Zuch \ncould continue challenging her underlying liability be-\ncause the IRS unlawfully offset it using her \noverpayments in later years. Pet. App. 19a-25a. The \nIRS\u2019s unilateral, illegal actions, the court held, could \nnot moot the case. Pet. App. 25a. Second, in a part of \nthe opinion joined by two panel members, the court \nheld that the Tax Court had jurisdiction to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s liability and \nissue a declaratory judgment because the parties con-\ntinued to dispute Zuch\u2019s tax liability. Pet. App. 25a-\n26a; see Pet. App. 25a-38a. And a declaratory judg-\nment, the court concluded, would redress Zuch\u2019s \ninjuries. Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n8. The IRS sought rehearing en banc, which the \ncourt of appeals denied. Pet. App. 68a-69a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nThe case doesn\u2019t warrant further review. The de-\ncision below is correct; there is no circuit split; and the \nnarrow question presented rarely arises and is of little \n\n12 \n \n \npractical importance to the workable administration \nof the tax laws. \n1. The court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. Sec-\ntion 6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review the \nAppeals Office\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s under-\nlying liability and to issue declaratory relief \naccordingly, notwithstanding the IRS\u2019s decision to \nstop pursuing a levy. Here, that means the Tax Court \ncan review Zuch\u2019s rights to the $50,000 estimated pay-\nments and whether, had those payments been \nproperly allocated, they would have eliminated Zuch\u2019s \n$27,000 liability. The case thus isn\u2019t moot. If the Tax \nCourt rules in Zuch\u2019s favor, the IRS is likely to abide \nby the judgment and issue her a refund. But even if it \ndoesn\u2019t, the judgment would have preclusive effect in \nany refund lawsuit Zuch could bring under \u00a7 7422 to \nforce the IRS to give her money back. \n2. There is no circuit split. The Third Circuit \nhere held that a \u00a7 6330 review proceeding isn\u2019t moot \nwhen the parties continue to dispute the taxpayer\u2019s li-\nability, even if the IRS decides to stop pursuing a levy. \nThe D.C. and Fourth Circuits have not addressed that \nquestion. Instead, those courts have held only that a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot if the IRS decides to \nstop pursuing the levy and no dispute about the tax-\npayer\u2019s liability remains. Indeed, in both cases, the \nIRS conceded that the taxpayer was not liable, so \nthere was no longer a live issue for the Tax Court\u2019s \ndetermination. The Third Circuit\u2019s holding thus \ndoesn\u2019t conflict with the holdings of the D.C. and \nFourth Circuits. Put differently, the Third Circuit is \nfree to agree with the D.C. and Fourth Circuits in a \nfuture case without a live liability dispute, and the \nD.C. and Fourth Circuits are likewise free to agree \nwith the Third Circuit in a future case with a liability \n\n13 \n \n \ndispute. And the IRS\u2019s one-paragraph backup argu-\nment about the Third Circuit\u2019s alternative holding on \noffsets doesn\u2019t move the needle both because that \nholding was unnecessary to the outcome and because \nnone of the decisions the IRS cites even addresses the \noffset question. Simply put, there is no split on the off-\nset question, much less a certworthy one. \n3. The petition doesn\u2019t warrant review for any \nother reason, either. To start, the question presented \nrarely arises\u2014and when it does, \u201cthe IRS\u2019s own recal-\ncitrance,\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. at 207, is to blame. The \nIRS cannot claim a floodgates problem just because it \nmust keep litigating an issue it raised in the first place \nby assessing the taxpayer\u2019s liability and then tried to \nmoot out by unilaterally keeping the taxpayer\u2019s \nmoney. And there is no credible floodgates concern an-\nyway. No matter whether the Tax Court retains \njurisdiction to review and declare a taxpayer\u2019s liability \nunder \u00a7 6330 if the IRS decides to stop pursuing the \nlevy, the taxpayer can separately sue the government \nfor a refund under \u00a7 7422. Thus, prematurely cutting \noff review under \u00a7 6330 serves only to multiply the \nproceedings and undermine judicial economy\u2014con-\ntrary to a 2006 amendment making clear that the Tax \nCourt, and not sometimes district courts instead, \ncould decide the underlying tax liability. And the \nIRS\u2019s claim that the decision below could transform \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings into general forums for tax liabil-\nity challenges is unmoored from the statute\u2019s text, \nwhich authorizes review of the Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s deter-\nmination, not any unrelated issue the taxpayer might \nwish to raise. \n\n14 \n \n \nI. \nThe court of appeals\u2019 decision is correct. \nA. The Tax Court had jurisdiction under \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330 to review and declare Zuch\u2019s \ntax liability.  \nThe court of appeals correctly held that the Tax \nCourt had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s challenge to her \ntax liability because the parties continued to dispute \nit. The Tax Court thus had authority to declare Zuch\u2019s \nright to have the estimated payments credited to her \nand thus whether she remained liable for $27,000. \n1. The Tax Court had, and retained, \njurisdiction to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \ndetermination \nof \nZuch\u2019s \ndisputed underlying tax liability. \na. Section 6330(d)\u2019s plain text makes clear that \nthe Tax Court has jurisdiction to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d of a taxpayer\u2019s challenge to \nher \u201cunderlying tax liability.\u201d \nDuring the collection due process hearing, the Ap-\npeals Office can determine a taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying \ntax liability\u201d if the taxpayer \u201cdid not receive any stat-\nutory notice of deficiency or did not otherwise have an \nopportunity to dispute [her] tax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The taxpayer may then \u201cpetition the \nTax Court for review of [the Appeals Office\u2019s] determi-\nnation,\u201d \u201cand the Tax Court shall have jurisdiction \nwith respect to such matter,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1)\u2014i.e., \nthe \u201cdetermination\u201d of all \u201cthe issues\u201d raised during \nthe hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2), (3)(B). So when the \nTax Court reviews the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, \nit can resolve any dispute about the taxpayer\u2019s under-\nlying tax liability that the taxpayer properly raised \nbefore the Appeals Office. \n\n15 \n \n \nThe Tax Court doesn\u2019t lose its jurisdiction to re-\nsolve the dispute just because the IRS decides to stop \npursuing the levy. Congress provided that the Tax \nCourt \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). That re-\nview necessarily reaches all live \u201cissues\u201d involved in \nthe Appeal\u2019s Office\u2019s determination, which expressly \nincludes the taxpayer\u2019s \u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (3)(B). So long as a liability is-\nsue remains disputed, nothing in \u00a7 6330 suggests the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review the question van-\nishes when the IRS collects the amount due another \nway and no longer needs the levy. \nTo the contrary, \u00a7 6330\u2019s history makes clear that \nCongress wanted the Tax Court to have and retain ju-\nrisdiction to decide disputes over underlying liability. \nBefore 2006, \u00a7 6330 provided that an appeal of the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination would go to district court \n\u201cif the Tax Court [did] not have jurisdiction of the un-\nderlying tax liability,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330 (2000)\u2014that is, \nthe liability wouldn\u2019t otherwise be within its defi-\nciency jurisdiction outside the \u00a7 6330 context, Moore \nv. Commissioner, 114 T.C. 171, 175 (2000). Section \n6330\u2019s current text, in contrast, makes clear that the \nTax Court \u201cshall\u201d declare the taxpayer\u2019s disputed lia-\nbility in all cases. \nb. Congress\u2019s decision to give the Tax Court con-\ntinuing jurisdiction to resolve live liability disputes, so \nlong as the IRS was pursuing a levy at the time of fil-\ning, makes sense. It also aligns with time-of-filing \njurisdictional rules in other contexts.  \ni. \nStatutory text and context show why Congress \nlikely gave the Tax Court authority to review the is-\nsues underlying the Appeals Office\u2019s determination. \n\n16 \n \n \nAs noted (at 4-5), a taxpayer can sometimes challenge \nher assessed liability through a deficiency suit in Tax \nCourt before the IRS collects. But sometimes the tax-\npayer doesn\u2019t have that opportunity before the IRS \nseeks to levy the taxpayer\u2019s property. To address that \ncircumstance, Congress gave taxpayers the right to \ndispute their liability and required the Appeals Office \nand Tax Court to resolve those challenges. Even if the \nIRS is able to terminate the levy after initiating levy \nproceedings, it makes sense for the Tax Court to finish \nresolving the liability dispute if it remains live. After \nall, if the dispute continues past the levy, closing the \nTax Court\u2019s doors would simply require the taxpayer \nto file another lawsuit, this time seeking a refund un-\nder \u00a7 7422. \nThe tax \u201cscheme is designed \u2018\u2026 to insure an or-\nderly administration of the revenue\u2019\u201d and \u201cto allow the \nIRS to avoid unnecessary litigation.\u201d United States v. \nClintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., 553 U.S. 1, 11 (2008). \nRequiring the taxpayer to start new litigation does \njust the opposite. \nii. Section 6330 is also not unusual among fed-\neral statutes in making jurisdiction \u201cdepend[] upon \nthe state of things at the time of the action brought,\u201d \nGrupo Dataflux v. Atlas Global Group, L.P., 541 U.S. \n567, 570 (2004); see, e.g., Conolly v. Taylor, 27 U.S. (2 \nPet.) 556, 565 (1829)\u2014that is, on whether the IRS is \npursuing a levy when the taxpayer starts proceedings. \nTake diversity jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1332. Under that provision, federal district courts \n\u201cshall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions \nwhere\u201d the amount in controversy is more than \n$75,000 and the parties are completely diverse. 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1332(a); see Caterpillar Inc. v. Lewis, 519 \n\n17 \n \n \nU.S. 61, 68 (1996). So long as there really was $75,000 \nin controversy when the plaintiff sued, \u201csubsequent\u201d \ndevelopments that \u201creduce the amount recoverable \nbelow\u201d $75,000 don\u2019t deprive the court of jurisdiction. \nSaint Paul Mercury Indemnity Co. v. Red Cab Co., 303 \nU.S. 283, 289-90 (1938); accord Republic National \nBank of Miami v. United States, 506 U.S. 80, 88 (1992) \n(\u201cjurisdiction survives reduction of amount in contro-\nversy\u201d after filing). Likewise, the court doesn\u2019t lose \njurisdiction just because a party\u2019s domicile changes af-\nter filing and destroys complete diversity. See, e.g., \nRosado v. Wyman, 397 U.S. 397, 406 n.6 (1970). \nCourts take a similar approach to the Class Action \nFairness Act (CAFA), 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1332(d). Under \nCAFA, \u201cdistrict courts shall have original jurisdiction \nof any\u201d \u201cclass action\u201d \u201cin which the matter in contro-\nversy exceeds\u201d $5 million, and the parties are \nminimally diverse. Id. \u00a7 1332(d)(2). If \u201cjurisdiction \nwas properly invoked as of the time of filing,\u201d Coba v. \nFord Motor Co., 932 F.3d 114, 120 (3d Cir. 2019), the \ncourt doesn\u2019t lose jurisdiction if it declines to certify \nthe class, e.g., Kress Stores of Puerto Rico, Inc. v. Wal-\nMart Puerto Rico., Inc., 121 F.4th 228, 234-35 & n.2 \n(1st Cir. 2024) (collecting cases). \u201c[L]ong-standing \nprinciples apply\u2014post-filing developments do not de-\nfeat jurisdiction.\u201d Coba, 932 F.3d at 119-20. \nThe same goes for longstanding jurisdictional \nrules for the Court of Federal Claims. That court has \njurisdiction over many claims against the United \nStates, see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1491, but it \u201cshall not have \njurisdiction of any claim\u201d that the \u201cplaintiff or his as-\nsignee has pending\u201d in an action against the United \nStates \u201cin any other court,\u201d id. \u00a7 1500. The \u201cgeneral \nrule\u201d that jurisdiction \u201cturns on the facts upon filing\u201d \napplies: whether the Court of Federal Claims has \n\n18 \n \n \njurisdiction depends on whether, \u201cupon filing,\u201d the \nplaintiff had \u201can action pending in any other court\u201d \nthat presented the same claim. Keene Corp. v. United \nStates, 508 U.S. 200, 208-09 (1993) (emphasis added). \nA later-filed district court action thus doesn\u2019t extin-\nguish the Court of Federal Claims\u2019 jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 1500. See Petro-Hunt, LLC v. United States, 862 \nF.3d 1370, 1383-84 (Fed. Cir. 2017). So too here. If the \nTax Court had jurisdiction under \u00a7 6330 at the outset, \nthe IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing a levy doesn\u2019t de-\nstroy that jurisdiction. \nc. Here, the Tax Court had jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330 to review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination, \nincluding its resolution of Zuch\u2019s underlying tax liabil-\nity. Pet. App. 19a-33a. Zuch raised her assessed \nunderlying tax liability in the collection due process \nhearing, as she had a right to do because she did not \nreceive a notice of deficiency or otherwise have an op-\nportunity to challenge the assessed liability. Pet. App. \n10a. After the Appeals Office made its determination, \nZuch timely petitioned the Tax Court for review. CA3 \nApp. A24-A30; see CA3 App. A266-270; Pet. App. 42a. \nThe Tax Court then had jurisdiction over the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s decision, including the dispute over Zuch\u2019s tax \nliability. See I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (c)(3)(B), (d)(1).  \nTo be sure, while the case was at the Tax Court\u2014\nafter more than six years of litigation\u2014the IRS an-\nnounced that it would no longer pursue the levy. But \nthat didn\u2019t deprive the Tax Court of jurisdiction under \n\u00a7 6330, where jurisdiction \u201cwas properly invoked as of \nthe time of filing.\u201d Coba, 932 F.3d at 120. Nothing in \n\u00a7 6330 purports to condition the Tax Court\u2019s ongoing \njurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued pursuit of a levy. \nAs the court of appeals explained, the Tax Court could \nstill resolve Zuch\u2019s underlying liability, and it could \n\n19 \n \n \ndecide whether the IRS properly offset Zuch\u2019s tax bal-\nance using her overpayments from later tax years. See \nPet. App. 19a-25a. \n2. The Tax Court had authority to \ndeclare whether and to what extent \nZuch was liable. \nThe Tax Court not only had jurisdiction to review \nthe Appeals Office\u2019s determination of Zuch\u2019s underly-\ning liability; it also had authority to issue declaratory \nrelief as to that liability. As noted, the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d \u201cshall take into consideration\u201d \u201cthe is-\nsues raised\u201d at the hearing, I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(3)(B), \nincluding \u201cthe existence or amount of the underlying \ntax liability.\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). And because the \nTax Court \u201cshall have jurisdiction\u201d to review \u201csuch de-\ntermination,\u201d I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), the Tax Court can \ndecide and declare a taxpayer\u2019s underlying tax liabil-\nity, too. Accord Michael I. Saltzman & Leslie Book, \nIRS Practice & Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a] (updated Oct. \n2024). A declaratory judgment is just a \u201cdefinitive de-\ntermination of the legal rights of the parties.\u201d \nMedtronic, Inc. v. Mirowski Family Ventures, LLC, \n571 U.S. 191, 200 (2014); accord Haaland v. Brackeen, \n599 U.S. 255, 293 (2023). Here, that\u2019s what the Tax \nCourt does when it reviews and decides the underly-\ning liability question as part of reviewing the Appeals \nOffice\u2019s determination. And in Zuch\u2019s case, that means \nthe Tax Court can declare Zuch\u2019s tax liability by de-\nciding whether she is entitled to credit for the \nestimated payments. See Pet. App. 33a-34a, 42a. \n\n20 \n \n \nB. Zuch\u2019s case didn\u2019t become moot when the \nIRS decided to stop pursuing the levy, \nbecause the parties disputed, and the \nTax Court had the power to decide, \nZuch\u2019s underlying tax liability. \nThe Third Circuit correctly held that Zuch\u2019s case \ndidn\u2019t become moot when the IRS decided to stop pur-\nsuing the levy. The Tax Court retained the power to \nredress Zuch\u2019s injury by declaring her underlying lia-\nbility invalid. If the Tax Court reached that \nconclusion, the IRS likely would abide by it and issue \nher a refund. And even if the IRS refused to do so, \nZuch could pursue a refund suit, where a declaratory \njudgment from the Tax Court would have preclusive \neffect and require the IRS to issue a refund. \n1. The mootness inquiry asks whether standing \n\u201cexists throughout the proceedings.\u201d Uzuegbunam v. \nPreczewski, 592 U.S. 279, 282 (2021). The \u201cirreducible \nconstitutional minimum of standing contains three el-\nements\u201d: (1) injury in fact, (2) causation (i.e., \ntraceability), and (3) redressability. Lujan v. Defend-\ners of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560-61 (1992). But \nmootness sets a lower bar than standing: \u201cAs long as \nthe parties have a concrete interest, however small, in \nthe outcome of the litigation, the case is not moot.\u201d \nCampbell-Ewald Co. v. Gomez, 577 U.S. 153, 161 \n(2016). Thus, redressability requires only that judicial \nrelief \u201clikely\u201d will redress an injury, FEC v. Cruz, 596 \nU.S. 289, 296 (2022), not that \u201ca favorable decision \nwill relieve\u201d \u201cevery injury,\u201d Larson v. Valente, 456 U.S. \n228, 243-44 & n.15 (1982) (first emphasis added). \n2. Zuch\u2019s challenge to her underlying liability \nisn\u2019t moot. Losing the $50,000 in estimated payments \nis a concrete injury, e.g., TransUnion LLC v. Ramirez, \n\n21 \n \n \n594 U.S. 413, 425 (2021), that is traceable to the IRS\u2019s \nrefusal to issue her a refund, see Simon v. Eastern \nKentucky Welfare Rights Organization, 426 U.S. 26, \n41-42 (1976). And the Tax Court can redress that in-\njury by declaring her entitled to the $50,000 in \nestimated payments, which satisfied and made her no \nlonger liable for the $27,000 the IRS had assessed. \nIf the Tax Court declares that Zuch is entitled to \nthe estimated payments, the IRS is likely to issue \nZuch a refund. That\u2019s because the declaration would \nlegally entitle her to a refund, and \u201cit is substantially \nlikely that [the IRS] would abide by\u201d that \u201cauthorita-\ntive\u201d holding \u201cby the [Tax] Court.\u201d Franklin v. \nMassachusetts, 505 U.S. 788, 803 (1992); accord Reed \nv. Goertz, 598 U.S. 230, 234 (2023); Pet. App. 38a. \nBut even if the IRS doesn\u2019t issue Zuch a refund, \nZuch could institute a refund action under I.R.C. \n\u00a7 7422, and the Tax Court\u2019s judgment would have pre-\nclusive effect. \u201cUnder the doctrine of issue preclusion, \n\u2018a prior judgment forecloses successive litigation of an \nissue of fact or law actually litigated and resolved in a \nvalid court determination essential to the prior judg-\nment.\u2019\u201d Herrera v. Wyoming, 587 U.S. 329, 342 (2019) \n(alterations adopted). \u201cThe idea is straightforward: \nOnce a court has decided an issue, it is \u2018forever settled \nas between the parties.\u2019\u201d B&B Hardware, Inc. v. Har-\ngis Industries, Inc., 575 U.S. 138, 147 (2015). That \ngoes for declaratory relief issued in an earlier case, \ntoo. E.g., 18 Charles A. Wright & Arthur R. Miller, \nFederal Practice and Procedure \u00a7 4421 (3d ed. updated \nJune 2024). \nHere, Zuch\u2019s entitlement to the estimated pay-\nments is an \u201cissue of \u2026 law\u201d that would be \u201cactually \nlitigated and resolved\u201d in the Tax Court proceeding \n\n22 \n \n \nand \u201cessential to\u201d the Tax Court\u2019s decision on Zuch\u2019s \nunderlying liability. Thus, in a later refund suit, the \nTax Court\u2019s declaratory judgment would be preclu-\nsive, and the district court would order the IRS to \nissue a refund. See, e.g., Parklane Hosiery Co. v. Shore, \n439 U.S. 322, 325, 332-33 (1979). \nC. The IRS\u2019s counterarguments lack merit. \n1. The IRS contends that the Tax Court has ju-\nrisdiction to review underlying tax liability under \n\u00a7 6330 only so long as the IRS is pursuing a levy. \nPet. 10-11. According to the IRS, the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d \u201cpresupposes the existence of a \nproposed levy,\u201d and so all the Tax Court can do is de-\ntermine whether a levy can proceed. Pet. 11. \nThat argument ignores \u00a7 6330(d)\u2019s plain text. Sec-\ntion 6330(d)(1) makes clear that the Tax Court has \njurisdiction in \u00a7 6330 proceedings to review the Ap-\npeals Office\u2019s determination of the issues raised in a \ncollection due process hearing. Supra pp. 14-15. It \nprovides that \u201cthe Tax Court shall have jurisdiction\u201d \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s \u201cdetermination\u201d\u2014which \nincludes all the issues the Appeals Office was required \nto consider during the hearing, not just whether the \nlevy can proceed. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1); see I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2), (c)(3)(B). Nothing in \u00a7 6330 conditions ex-\nercise of that jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued \npursuit of a levy, even assuming the phrase \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d implies that there must be a proposed \nlevy at the outset of the collection due process hearing. \nTo the contrary, \u00a7 6330(d)(1) refers only to a \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d by the Appeals Office, which indisputably \nexists here. Supra pp. 9-10. And that determination \naggrieves taxpayers like Zuch by upholding the IRS\u2019s \nliability assessments over their objections. \n\n23 \n \n \nIn straining to read a continuing-levy-request con-\ndition into \u00a7 6330(d), the government ignores \u201cthe \npresumption favoring judicial review of administra-\ntive action.\u201d Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, \n229 (2020). That \u201cstrong presumption\u201d directs that \n\u201cwhen a statutory provision \u2018is reasonably susceptible \nto divergent interpretation,\u2019\u201d courts must \u201cadopt the \nreading that accords with traditional understandings \nand basic principles: that executive determinations \ngenerally are subject to judicial review.\u201d Id. And here, \nthe government cannot even show that its divergent \ninterpretation makes sense, much less that it can \novercome the presumption of judicial review. \n2. The IRS argues that the Tax Court cannot de-\nclare Zuch\u2019s liability, because the \u201conly relief that \nSection 6330 authorizes is rejection of a proposed \nlevy.\u201d Pet. 13-14 n.2. That is incorrect. See Pet. \nApp. 34a-36a.  \nSection 6330 authorizes injunctive relief, I.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(e)(1), which necessarily means it also author-\nizes declaratory relief. That\u2019s because an injunction \nnecessarily rests on a declaration. An injunction pro-\nhibiting an act amounts to \u201ca judicial declaration that \n[the act] is illegal.\u201d Pet. App. 36a. Indeed, as this \nCourt has recognized, declaratory relief is a \u201cmilder\u201d \nalternative to an injunction. Steffel v. Thompson, 415 \nU.S. 452, 466-67 (1974). Thus, the Tax Court\u2019s author-\nity to issue an injunction under \u00a7 6330(e)(1) includes \nthe authority to issue declaratory relief. \nContrary to the government\u2019s argument, the De-\nclaratory Judgment Act doesn\u2019t withdraw the Tax \nCourt\u2019s authority to issue declaratory relief. That stat-\nute authorizes federal courts to \u201cdeclare the rights and \nother legal relations of any interested party seeking \n\n24 \n \n \nsuch declaration,\u201d \u201cexcept with respect to Federal \ntaxes.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2201(a). But courts have uniformly \nheld that the Declaratory Judgment Act must be read \ntogether with the Tax Code and the Anti-Injunction \nAct, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a), and that it does not prohibit de-\nclaratory relief where those other provisions permit \ninjunctions. E.g., Cohen v. United States, 650 F.3d \n717, 727-28 (D.C. Cir. 2011) (en banc); CIC Services, \nLLC v. IRS, 925 F.3d 247, 250 n.3 (6th Cir. 2019), rev\u2019d \non other grounds 593 U.S. 209 (2021); see Bob Jones \nUniversity v. Simon, 461 U.S. 725, 732-33 n.7 (1974). \nBoth the plain text of \u00a7 6330(e)(1) and the Anti-Injunc-\ntion Act, I.R.C. \u00a7 7421(a), authorize injunctions in \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings, so declaratory relief is authorized \nas well. \n3. Trying to cast the issues in Article III terms, \nthe IRS insists that there is no longer a live dispute in \na \u00a7 6330 proceeding once the IRS decides to stop pur-\nsuing a levy because \u201cthe issue that prompted the \nproceeding is no longer \u2018live\u2019\u201d at that point. Pet. 9. \nThat argument fails. The question isn\u2019t whether \u201cthe \nissue that prompted\u201d a collection due process hearing \nis live. Rather, as the Court has made clear, \u201c[a]s long \nas the parties have a concrete interest, however small, \nin the outcome of the litigation,\u201d the case is not moot. \nCampbell-Ewald Co., 577 U.S. at 161. \nTo be sure, in some cases\u2014as in the D.C. and \nFourth Circuit cases discussed below (at 26-28)\u2014if the \nIRS is no longer pursuing a levy and there is no longer \nany dispute over the taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability, \nthe case may be moot because there is no longer any \nconcrete interest in the case. But the narrow question \nhere is whether, where the parties continue to dispute \nthe taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability, the Tax Court still \nhas statutory and Article III jurisdiction to resolve \n\n25 \n \n \nthat liability challenge. And the answer is yes. Zuch \nhas a concrete interest in the outcome of the Tax Court \nreview proceedings because the Tax Court can declare \nher underlying liability by determining her right to \nthe estimated payments, and therefore to a refund, ac-\ncord IRS Practice and Procedure \u00a7 14B.16[4][a], \nwhich, if necessary, she could further pursue in a re-\nfund action under \u00a7 7422. The IRS has a concrete \ninterest, too: if the Tax Court declares that Zuch is not \nentitled to the estimated payments, the IRS keeps her \nmoney. The case thus isn\u2019t moot, because it is not \u201cim-\npossible for a court to grant any effectual relief \nwhat[so]ever\u201d to whoever prevails. Chafin v. Chafin, \n568 U.S. 165, 172 (2013). \nII. There is no circuit split. \nA. The Third Circuit\u2019s decision doesn\u2019t \nconflict with the decisions of the D.C. or \nFourth Circuits. \nThe government claims that the Third Circuit \nhere split from the D.C. and Fourth Circuits. That is \nincorrect. The Third Circuit here held that the Tax \nCourt retains jurisdiction over a \u00a7 6330 proceeding be-\ncause the parties continued to dispute the taxpayer\u2019s \nunderlying liability. The D.C. and Fourth Circuits, in \ncontrast, have held only that the Tax Court lacks ju-\nrisdiction over a \u00a7 6330 proceeding once the IRS \nconcedes the taxpayer was never liable\u2014so there is no \nlive dispute about liability\u2014and no longer seeks a \nlevy. Simply put, the Third Circuit, on the one hand, \nand the D.C. and Fourth Circuits, on the other, have \naddressed different questions, and nothing prevents \nthe Third Circuit from adopting the D.C. and Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s rule in a case without a live liability dispute \nor, conversely, the D.C. or Fourth Circuits from \n\n26 \n \n \nadopting the Third Circuit\u2019s view in a case with a live \nliability dispute. There is no circuit conflict and no \nreason for this Court to intervene. \n1. The D.C. and Fourth Circuits hold \nthat a \u00a7 6330 review proceeding is \nmoot when the IRS concedes that the \ntaxpayer was not liable and stops \npursuing the levy. \na. In Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d 316, 321 \n(D.C. Cir. 2015), the D.C. Circuit held that a \u00a7 6330 \nproceeding was moot because there was neither \u201ctax \nliability\u201d nor a \u201cproposed levy.\u201d  \nWillson arose from the IRS accidentally issuing \nthe taxpayer a refund twice. Id. at 318. Once it real-\nized its mistake, the IRS assessed a tax liability in the \namount it over-refunded Willson. Id. The IRS later \nsought to levy his property to collect on that liability. \nId. at 319. While his \u00a7 6330 proceeding was pending, \nWillson overpaid his taxes for later years, and the IRS \nused those payments to offset his liability. Id. at 318. \nWillson also sent the IRS $5,100 in voluntary pay-\nments \u201cto begin returning\u201d the money the IRS \naccidentally refunded him. Id. at 319; see id. at 318. \nThe Appeals Office sustained the proposed levy. \nId. at 319. But while the case was before the Tax \nCourt, the IRS conceded that it wasn\u2019t permitted to \nassess a tax liability where none existed in order to \nremedy its mistake. Id. The IRS thus extinguished the \nassessment of the liability. Id. The IRS \u201calso deter-\nmined that it was time barred from using its set-off \npower to retain the overpayment Willson reported\u201d on \nhis tax return for a later year \u201cand refunded that \namount to Willson.\u201d Id. The IRS then moved to dis-\nmiss the case as moot \u201c[b]ecause neither an unpaid \n\n27 \n \n \nliability nor a pending levy action remained for the tax \ncourt to review.\u201d Id. Willson, proceeding pro se, ob-\njected, arguing that the IRS should have returned his \nvoluntary payments, too. Id. \nThe D.C. Circuit held the case moot in a brief opin-\nion. The court underscored that there was no live \ndispute about the taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability. Id. \nat 320. \u201cThe debt created by [the IRS\u2019s] erroneous re-\nfund [was] not a tax liability.\u201d Id. So when \u201c[t]he IRS \nretained\u201d Willson\u2019s overpayments, it did so \u201cnot to sat-\nisfy a tax liability but to recover an erroneous refund \nsent as a result of a clerical error.\u201d Id. What\u2019s more, \nthe IRS conceded that \u201cit improperly assessed\u201d the li-\nability, \u201creturned the [amount] it collected in \nsatisfaction of that improper liability,\u201d and no longer \nsought a levy. Id. at 320-21. The IRS had thus issued \nWillson the \u201cvery relief\u201d he \u201costensibly sought when \nhe requested the [\u00a7 6330] hearing.\u201d Id. at 321. \nb. Similarly, the Fourth Circuit held in a brief \nopinion in McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, 319 \n(4th Cir. 2022), that when the IRS \u201chas already con-\nceded that a taxpayer has no liability and that the lien \nshould be removed,\u201d the \u00a7 6330 proceeding \u201cis moot.\u201d \nThe case arose when McLane filed a return claiming \ndeductions for business losses. Id. at 317. The IRS de-\nnied most of the deductions and determined that \nMcLane owed more than $23,000 in taxes. Id. at 317-\n18. But he failed to pay, so the IRS sought to levy his \nproperty. Id. at 318. \nDuring his collection due process hearing, \n\u201cMcLane presented enough information to substanti-\nate the losses reported on his return.\u201d Id. The IRS \nconsequently \u201cconceded that McLane was entitled to \ndeductions exceeding those he initially claimed\u201d and \n\n28 \n \n \n\u201cremoved the assessment of liability.\u201d Id. In other \nwords, there was no longer any live dispute about \nMcLane\u2019s underlying liability. Separately, McLane \nlater \u201casserted for the first time, in a telephone call \nwith the Tax Court, that he overpaid his taxes\u201d and \n\u201cnow sought a refund.\u201d Id. \nThe Tax Court dismissed for lack of jurisdiction, \nid., and on appeal, the Fourth Circuit held that the \ncase was moot, id. at 319. \u201cWhen \u2026 the Commissioner \nhas already conceded that a taxpayer has no tax lia-\nbility\u201d and that it would no longer pursue the levy, the \ncourt reasoned, \u201c[n]o collection action remains, for \nwhich there is underlying tax liability, to appeal.\u201d Id.  \nMcLane\u2019s separate later request for a refund \ndidn\u2019t confer jurisdiction, either: McLane raised his \noverpayment concern for the first time before the Tax \nCourt, but the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited to \n\u201creview\u201d of issues determined by the Appeals Office, \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1), not \u201cindependent overpayment \nclaims,\u201d McLane, 24 F.4th at 319. \n2. Those holdings that a \u00a7 6330 review \nproceeding is moot when there is no \nliability dispute do not conflict with \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s holding that the \nTax Court retains jurisdiction where \nthere is a live liability dispute. \na. As explained, the Third Circuit here held that \nthe Tax Court retains jurisdiction over a \u00a7 6330 re-\nview proceeding, and the proceeding is not moot, \nwhere the parties continue to dispute the taxpayer\u2019s \nunderlying liability, even if the IRS decides to stop \npursuing the levy. Pet. App. 25a-38a. Zuch\u2019s \u201cunderly-\ning tax liability\u201d remained \u201cvery much in dispute,\u201d \nPet. App. 25a: the IRS never conceded that Zuch\u2019s tax \n\n29 \n \n \nliability was improper, but instead maintains that \nZuch was liable for around $27,000 not offset by the \n$50,000 estimated payments.  \nThat ruling does not conflict with the D.C. and \nFourth Circuits\u2019 rulings that a \u00a7 6330 proceeding is \nmoot where the IRS concedes there was \u201cno tax liabil-\nity\u201d and drops the levy request. McLane, 24 F.4th at \n319; accord Willson, 805 F.3d at 320-21. The Third \nCircuit has not considered that question, and its opin-\nion here leaves it free to agree with the D.C. and \nFourth Circuits on that question. Conversely, the D.C. \nand Fourth Circuits have not considered the question \nthe Third Circuit resolved here, where the parties con-\ntinue to dispute the taxpayer\u2019s liability even though \nthe IRS decides to stop pursuing the levy. \nWhat\u2019s more, in McLane, the taxpayer didn\u2019t even \ncontend that he was entitled to a refund based on his \nsupposed overpayments until after the Appeals Office \nissued its determination. See 24 F.4th at 318. Thus, \neven if McLane did raise a challenge to his \u201ctax liabil-\nity,\u201d that challenge was not part of the Appeals Court\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination,\u201d and the Tax Court has jurisdiction \nonly over the issues involved in that determination. \nI.R.C. \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B), (d)(1). \nb. The IRS points to the Fourth Circuit\u2019s state-\nment that the phrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d must \nbe read in the context of the proposed levy. Pet. 14-15. \nBut that point doesn\u2019t help the IRS. True, the \u201cunder-\nlying tax liability\u201d is the liability that the IRS sought \nto collect with the levy. But whether the IRS continues \nto pursue the levy is a separate question from whether \nthe IRS assessed that underlying tax liability and \ntried to levy on it in the first place. And here, the Third \nCircuit read \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d just that way, \n\n30 \n \n \nto refer to the liability that gave rise to the levy. But \nnone of that means that the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction \nto review the Appeals Office\u2019s determination evapo-\nrates when the IRS says it will no longer pursue the \nlevy and the parties continue to dispute that very un-\nderlying tax liability. Supra pp. 22-23. \nc. To be sure, the Third Circuit thought it was \n\u201cpart[ing] ways \u2026 with the Fourth and D.C. Circuits.\u201d \nPet. App. 27a. But whatever it thought of the other \ncourts of appeals\u2019 reasoning, the Third Circuit has not \ndecided whether the Tax Court has jurisdiction over a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding when neither a proposed levy nor \nan underlying tax liability dispute remains, like in \nWillson and McLane. And the D.C. and Fourth Cir-\ncuits have not decided whether the Tax Court retains \njurisdiction where there is a live liability dispute. \nWhat is dispositive is what the courts held, not the \nway the Third Circuit viewed the D.C. and Fourth Cir-\ncuits\u2019 reasoning on a different question. Nothing in \nany of the courts of appeals\u2019 opinions bars the courts \nfrom aligning on the same question if they confront it \nin the future. There is no reason for this Court to in-\ntervene. \nB. The other decisions the IRS cites don\u2019t \nconflict with the decision below, either. \nThe other decisions the IRS cites (Pet. 16) don\u2019t \nconflict with the decision below, either. The IRS \nclaims that the Third Circuit\u2019s conclusion that the Tax \nCourt had \u201cimplicit\u201d jurisdiction to review offsets con-\nflicts with other courts of appeals\u2019 decisions \nrecognizing that the Tax Court has jurisdiction only \nwhen Congress expressly authorizes it. But there is no \nsplit. None of the cases the IRS cites addresses the \nTax Court\u2019s jurisdiction to review offsets in \u00a7 6330 \n\n31 \n \n \nproceedings. And two out of the three decisions don\u2019t \neven involve \u00a7 6330 proceedings. See Borenstein v. \nCommissioner, 919 F.3d 746, 749 (2d Cir. 2019) (re-\nfund jurisdiction); Sanders v. Commissioner, 813 F.2d \n859, 861 (7th Cir. 1987) (attorneys\u2019 fees). In any event, \nthe question is entirely academic, because the Third \nCircuit\u2019s offset-review holding is an alternative hold-\ning that doesn\u2019t change the court\u2019s decision\u2014on which \nthere is also no split\u2014that the Tax Court retained ju-\nrisdiction to resolve the live liability dispute. \nIII. The petition doesn\u2019t warrant review for any \nother reason, either. \nThe question presented isn\u2019t just splitless. It also \nrarely arises and isn\u2019t important to the workable ad-\nministration of the tax laws.  \nA. The question presented rarely arises. The IRS \nmust first deny the taxpayer an \u201copportunity to dis-\npute\u201d \nher \nunderlying \ntax \nliability, \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The taxpayer must then unsuccess-\nfully challenge that liability in a collection due process \nhearing and seek Tax Court review, all while the IRS \ncollects that liability through non-levy means rather \nthan issuing refunds. Unsurprisingly, the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision is the only circuit decision the IRS \nidentifies as presenting that scenario. And even on the \nIRS\u2019s own argument, McLane and Willson are the only \ncircuit decisions, over more than two decades, to ad-\ndress mootness in \u00a7 6330 cases. \nWhat\u2019s more, the question presented must \u201carise \nfrom the IRS\u2019s own recalcitrance.\u201d Boechler, 596 U.S. \nat 207. The question arises only when the IRS unilat-\nerally decides to keep the taxpayer\u2019s money rather \nthan permit judicial resolution of the dispute. \n\n32 \n \n \nB. Even if the IRS were correct that a \u00a7 6330 pro-\nceeding is moot whenever the IRS stops pursuing a \nlevy, this case wouldn\u2019t warrant review. As the IRS \nadmits (Pet. 14), a \u201ctaxpayer seeking a refund of taxes \nerroneously or unlawfully assessed or collected may \nbring an action against the Government\u201d under \n\u00a7 7422(a). Clintwood Elkhorn Mining Co., 553 U.S. \nat 4. Indeed, \u00a7 6330 expressly contemplates refund ac-\ntions by tolling the statute of limitations during \n\u00a7 6330 proceedings. I.R.C. \u00a7\u00a7 6330(e)(1), 6532(a)(1); \nsee 26 C.F.R. \u00a7 301.6330-1(g). So the only consequence \nwould be to require a refund suit that might otherwise \nbe unnecessary. The possibility of multiplying pro-\nceedings doesn\u2019t warrant this Court\u2019s intervention. \nC. The IRS claims this case is important because \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision will allow taxpayers to \nconvert many of the \u201ctens of thousands of Section 6330 \nproceedings each year\u201d \u201cinto a more general forum for \nconsidering challenges to tax liability.\u201d Pet. 16-17. \nThat argument lacks merit. The statute specifies the \nissues taxpayers may raise in collection due process \nhearings, and limits liability challenges (the only is-\nsues here) to taxpayers without an earlier opportunity \nto \nchallenge \ntheir \nassessed \nliability. \nI.R.C. \n\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B). The Tax Court\u2019s liability, in turn, is \nlimited to reviewing the Appeals Office\u2019s determina-\ntion\u2014it does not reach new issues. I.R.C. \u00a7 6330(d)(1). \nIn McLane, for example, the Tax Court lacked juris-\ndiction to resolve a taxpayer\u2019s claim that he overpaid \nhis taxes that he raised for the first time before the \nTax Court. 24 F.4th at 319. Nothing in the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s opinion allows taxpayers to raise new issues \nbefore the Tax Court. And more generally, the dearth \nof appellate decisions about mootness in \u00a7 6330 cases \n\n33 \n \n \nonly underscores that the fact pattern necessary to \nraise the question presented here arises rarely. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nFrank Agostino \nAGOSTINO & \n  ASSOCIATES, P.C. \n14 Washington Place \nHackensack, NJ 07601 \n \n \n \nShay Dvoretzky \n  Counsel of Record \nParker Rider-Longmaid \nArmando Gomez \nSylvia O.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case remains stable following this internal review. The observation did not introduce new external facts but rather consolidated my current model. My belief structure is as follows:\n\n1.  **Core Legal Issue:** The central question is one of statutory jurisdiction and mootness. Specifically, does a pre-deprivation challenge to a proposed IRS levy under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330 become moot when the underlying tax liability is satisfied by other means (in this case, offsets under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6402), thereby eliminating the need for the proposed levy?\n\n2.  **Petitioner's (Government's) Position:** The government's argument, as detailed in the cert petition, is strong and multi-faceted.\n    *   **Jurisdictional Mootness:** The Tax Court's jurisdiction in a \u00a7 6330 proceeding is tethered to a live dispute over a *proposed levy*. Once the IRS no longer intends to levy because the debt is paid, the subject matter of the proceeding disappears, and the case is moot.\n    *   **Ancillary Nature of Liability Challenge:** The ability to challenge the \"underlying tax liability\" within a \u00a7 6330 hearing is not an independent grant of jurisdiction but is contingent upon a valid, ongoing levy dispute.\n    *   **Exclusive Remedy for Offsets:** The government contends that the proper way for Zuch to challenge the IRS's application of her overpayments (the \u00a7 6402 offsets) is through a separate, post-deprivation refund suit in a different court (District Court or Court of Federal Claims), as mandated by 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 7422(a).\n\n3.  **Predictive Signals:** The most powerful signal favoring the petitioner is the existence of a clear circuit split. The Third Circuit's decision in *Zuch* is in direct conflict with the Fourth Circuit (*McLane v. Commissioner*) and the D.C. Circuit (*Willson v. Commissioner*), both of which adopted the government's mootness argument. This suggests the government's position has substantial judicial support.\n\n4.  **Current Prediction & Uncertainty:** My prediction continues to lean in favor of the petitioner (the Commissioner). The argument is a clean, structural one about jurisdiction and statutory interpretation, which often finds favor with the current Supreme Court. However, this prediction is based on a one-sided view. The primary source of my uncertainty is the complete absence of the respondent's counter-arguments. I do not yet know how Zuch will argue that the case is *not* moot or why the Tax Court should retain jurisdiction.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal thought process, provides significant reinforcement and refinement for my meta-level design beliefs. It demonstrates the value of structured self-reflection in the experimental design cycle.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Primacy of the Cert Petition:** This remains my most effective heuristic. Analyzing the cert petition first provides a comprehensive roadmap of one party's argument, the legal questions, and the strategic context (like a circuit split).\n\n2.  **Confirmed Heuristic - The \"Circuit Split\" Signal:** My belief that identifying a circuit split is a first-order predictive variable is strongly reinforced. The cert petition's explicit framing of this split was the single most important piece of information for shaping my initial prediction.\n\n3.  **Refined Heuristic - Iterative, Adversarial Analysis:** My initial belief in an iterative process is now a core principle. Having fully digested the petitioner's argument, the system's logic dictates that the next action *must* be to acquire the opposing viewpoint to resolve the largest area of uncertainty. The value of a document is relative to the current state of knowledge; the Brief in Opposition is now maximally valuable because it directly addresses the known arguments of the petitioner.\n\n4.  **New Heuristic - The Value of Strategic Pauses (Meta-Cognitive Checkpoints):** This `THINK` action itself is a valuable observation about process. An effective design should include deliberate pauses to:\n    *   Synthesize all information gathered to date into a coherent model (as I have done with my Task Beliefs).\n    *   Explicitly identify the remaining sources of uncertainty (in this case, the respondent's entire legal theory).\n    *   Formulate a precise, targeted plan for the next information-gathering action that directly addresses the greatest uncertainty. This transforms the process from a random walk into a directed search for the information with the highest expected value. This checkpoint confirms that my next action\u2014analyzing the Brief in Opposition\u2014is the most efficient path to reducing predictive error."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been substantially developed by acquiring the respondent's counter-arguments, which directly address my previous points of uncertainty. My belief structure has evolved from a one-sided model to a more complete, adversarial view.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Issue (Refined):** The issue remains one of statutory jurisdiction and mootness in a 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330 proceeding. However, the conflict is now clearer. It is a clash between two interpretations of the statute's jurisdictional grant:\n    *   **Petitioner's View:** Jurisdiction is tethered to the \"proposed levy.\" If the levy is no longer pursued, the \"matter\" under \u00a7 6330(d)(1) is gone, and the case is moot.\n    *   **Respondent's View:** Jurisdiction is granted to review the entire \"determination\" of the IRS Appeals Office. Since that determination can and did include a decision on the \"underlying tax liability\" (\u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B)), the Tax Court's jurisdiction persists as long as the liability itself remains a live dispute, even if the specific collection method (the levy) that triggered the hearing is abandoned.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's (Government's) Position (Stable):** My understanding of the government's argument remains unchanged. It is a structural argument based on mootness (the levy is gone), the ancillary nature of the liability challenge, and the existence of an alternative remedy (a separate refund suit under \u00a7 7422).\n\n3.  **Respondent's (Zuch's) Position (New & High-Impact):** The Brief in Opposition has filled the primary gap in my knowledge, presenting a robust counter-narrative.\n    *   **Jurisdiction Attaches and Persists:** The respondent argues that jurisdiction, once properly invoked to review the Appeals Office's \"determination,\" is not defeated by later events that eliminate only one part of the dispute (the levy). The \"matter\" for the Tax Court is the entire determination, which includes the still-contested liability. This argument leans on the general principle that jurisdiction is determined at the time of filing and is not easily divested.\n    *   **Case is Not Moot:** A live controversy exists over the underlying liability. The respondent argues that the Tax Court can still provide \"effectual relief\" through a declaratory judgment stating that Zuch does not owe the tax. Such a judgment would have preclusive effect in any future litigation (like a refund suit) and would likely compel the IRS to issue a refund, thus preventing the case from being moot.\n    *   **Judicial Economy:** It is more efficient to resolve the liability dispute in the Tax Court, which is already familiar with the case, than to force the taxpayer to initiate a brand-new, duplicative lawsuit in a different court.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Significantly Altered):** The new observation dramatically alters the weight of the key predictive signals.\n    *   **The Circuit Split is Contested:** This is the most critical update. My prior belief was that a clear circuit split was the strongest signal favoring the petitioner. The respondent's brief directly and credibly attacks this premise. Zuch's counsel argues there is **no split** because the key cases cited by the government (*McLane v. Commissioner* and *Willson v. Commissioner*) are factually distinguishable. In those cases, the IRS had conceded that the taxpayer was *not liable*, meaning there was no remaining dispute for the court to resolve. In *Zuch*, the IRS continues to dispute the liability. Therefore, the respondent argues, the Third Circuit's ruling\u2014that jurisdiction continues when there is a live liability dispute\u2014does not conflict with other circuits' rulings that a case is moot when there is *no* liability dispute.\n    *   **Quality of Counsel:** The respondent is represented by Shay Dvoretzky of Skadden, Arps, a highly-regarded and frequent practitioner before the Supreme Court. The involvement of elite counsel at the opposition stage is a soft signal that the respondent's arguments are considered strong and are being presented in the most effective way to persuade the Court to deny review.\n\n5.  **Current Prediction & Uncertainty (Revised):** My prediction has shifted significantly. I no longer lean in favor of the petitioner. The respondent's argument that there is no true circuit split severely undermines the primary reason for the Supreme Court to grant certiorari. While the government's statutory argument is not frivolous, the respondent's counter is textually grounded and aligns with principles of judicial economy and jurisdictional persistence.\n    *   **Prediction:** The likelihood of the Court denying the petition for certiorari has increased substantially. If the Court were to grant cert, the outcome on the merits is now much more balanced and could plausibly favor the respondent.\n    *   **Uncertainty:** My primary source of uncertainty has shifted from \"What will the respondent argue?\" to \"How will the Justices' clerks and the Justices themselves perceive the alleged circuit split? Will they accept the respondent's distinction, or will they see a broader conflict in legal reasoning that warrants resolution?\"",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful feedback on my information-gathering strategy, confirming some heuristics while adding crucial layers of sophistication to others.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Primacy of the Cert Petition:** This remains a valid starting point. The cert petition effectively frames the issues and presents the petitioner's best case for review.\n\n2.  **Refined Heuristic - The \"Circuit Split\" Signal:** My belief that a circuit split is a first-order predictive variable is confirmed, but with a critical refinement. A *claimed* circuit split is not the same as an *actual* one. The heuristic is now: \"A claimed circuit split in a cert petition is a powerful initial signal for granting review, but its predictive value is contingent on the respondent's inability to credibly distinguish the conflicting cases in the Brief in Opposition.\" The quality and indisputability of the split are what matter, and this can only be assessed adversarially.\n\n3.  **Confirmed & Refined Heuristic - Iterative, Adversarial Analysis:** This principle is strongly validated. My previous self-reflection correctly identified that acquiring the opposing viewpoint was the single most valuable next action. This observation proves that a one-sided analysis is incomplete and potentially misleading. The core analytic unit for the certiorari stage is the *pair* of documents: the Petition and the Brief in Opposition.\n\n4.  **Confirmed Heuristic - The Value of Strategic Pauses (Meta-Cognitive Checkpoints):** The previous `THINK` step, which led to the targeted search for the Brief in Opposition, was a highly effective use of a strategic pause. It allowed for synthesis and the formulation of a precise query to resolve the largest known uncertainty, confirming the value of this meta-cognitive loop in the design process.\n\n5.  **New Heuristic - The Power of Reframing:** I have observed that elite advocacy involves not just rebutting the opponent's question, but strategically reframing it. The respondent's \"Question Presented\" shifts the focus from the mooted levy to the live liability dispute. Future analysis must explicitly compare how each party frames the legal question, as this often reveals the core of their strategy and theory of the case.\n\n6.  **New Heuristic - Practitioner Quality as a Signal:** The identity of counsel can be a soft predictive signal. The presence of well-known, respected Supreme Court specialists (like Shay Dvoretzky) on either side, but especially for a respondent at the cert stage, suggests the case has significant perceived merit and that the arguments will be crafted with a deep understanding of the Court's priorities and decision-making. This is a factor to note in future case analyses."

As the D.C. and Fourth Circuits \nhave held, that special pre-deprivation proceeding be-\ncomes moot when the IRS no longer needs to pursue a \nlevy.  But the Third Circuit in this case openly \u201cpart[ed] \nways\u201d with those circuits, Pet. App. 27a, holding that a \nSection 6330 proceeding may continue even in the ab-\nsence of any pending levy.  Respondent\u2019s attempts to de-\nfend that decision misunderstand the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted.  And respondent\u2019s denial of the \nexistence of a circuit split contradicts what the decision \nitself acknowledges.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \n\n2 \n \nA. Respondent\u2019s Efforts To Defend The Decision Below \nLack Merit \nAs the petition explains (at 8-14), the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is moot because there is no longer \na live dispute over the proposed levy that prompted the \nproceeding.  The court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision is \nwrong, Pet. App. 16a-39a, and respondent\u2019s efforts to de-\nfend it lack merit. \n1. Because there is no longer a live dispute over the \nproposed levy in this case, the Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot \nAs an Article I court, \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of \nlimited jurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. \n3, 7 (1987) (per curiam); see 26 U.S.C. 7441.  In a Section \n6330 proceeding, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited \nto reviewing a particular \u201cdetermination\u201d by the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office): a \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d whether the proposed levy may proceed.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer a \nlive controversy over the proposed levy, there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cmoot.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d \n316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  That is so \n\u201cnotwithstanding the existence of other live controver-\nsies between the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall \nwithin the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  \nId. at 320. \nRespondent does not dispute that there is no longer \na live controversy over the proposed levy in this case.  \nIn fact, respondent acknowledges (Br. in Opp. 20) that \n\u201cthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the levy\u201d after it was \nable to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her tax \nliability under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  That should be the end \nof the matter.  Because there is no longer any need for \n\n3 \n \na determination whether the proposed levy may go for-\nward, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot. \n2. Respondent\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals held that (a) the \nTax Court still has jurisdiction to consider respondent\u2019s \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d Pet. App. 26a (citation omit-\nted), and (b) the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to \noffset respondent\u2019s tax liability was \u201cinvalid,\u201d id. at 25a.  \nRespondent\u2019s arguments in support of the first holding \nlack merit, and respondent does not even attempt to de-\nfend the second holding. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 12) that \u201cSection \n6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand to issue declaratory relief accordingly, notwithstand-\ning the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing a levy.\u201d  That is \nincorrect.  The only determination that Section 6330 au-\nthorizes the Tax Court to review is the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  Here, for example, the \n\u201cNotice of Determination\u201d issued by the Appeals Office \nspecifies that the Office \u201chas determined to sustain the \naction (levy).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a, 64a (capitalization altered).  \nAnd the only relief that Section 6330 authorizes upon \nreview of that determination is rejection of the proposed \nlevy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.1 \n \n1 Section 6330(e)(1) is not to the contrary.  That provision merely \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d the pendency of a Section 6330 proceeding.  26 U.S.C. \n \n\n4 \n \nOf course, in \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d whether a proposed \nlevy may proceed, the Appeals Office may consider var-\nious subsidiary issues, including \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability  * * *   \nif the person did not receive any statutory notice of de-\nficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have \nan opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (3).2  But the text of Section 6330 makes \nclear that when there is no longer any live dispute over \nthe proposed levy, there is no longer any jurisdiction to \nconsider challenges about those subsidiary issues.  The \nstatute does not identify them as freestanding issues, \nbut rather as ones that \u201c[t]he determination\u201d about the \nproposed levy \u201cshall take into consideration,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3)\u2014confirming that when the \u201cproposed levy is \nmoot,\u201d a taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis\u201d to continue \npursuing those challenges, Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\n \n6330(e)(1).  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion (Br. in Opp. 23), Sec-\ntion 6330(e)(1) does not authorize the Tax Court to \u201cdeclare [a tax-\npayer\u2019s] liability\u201d\u2014let alone authorize that court to issue any relief \nin the absence of a pending levy. \n2 Like the court of appeals, respondent characterizes her challenge \nto the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments in this case as a chal-\nlenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see \nBr. in Opp. 14, 19; Pet. App. 17a-19a.  The government disputes that \ncharacterization; in its view, respondent\u2019s challenge presents an \u201cis-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A), which a tax-\npayer could raise in the course of a live controversy over a proposed \nlevy even if the taxpayer had previously received a \u201cstatutory notice \nof deficiency,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  See Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-\n25.  This dispute over the characterization of respondent\u2019s challenge, \nhowever, has no bearing on the correct answer to the question pre-\nsented.  Even under respondent\u2019s characterization of her challenge, \nthe Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot because a taxpayer \nmay challenge \u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d only in connection with \na determination about a proposed levy.  See Pet. 10-11. \n\n5 \n \nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006).  And Congress\u2019s use of the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d reinforces the infer-\nence that jurisdiction exists only in connection with a \npre-deprivation determination about a proposed levy.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added); see Pet. 11.  \nRespondent therefore errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. 18) \nthat \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition the Tax \nCourt\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued pur-\nsuit of a levy.\u201d \nContrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 15-\n16), the statutory history and context undermine, rather \nthan support, her interpretation of Section 6330.  Con-\ngress enacted Section 6330 on the view that \u201c[d]ue pro-\ncess\u201d warrants giving taxpayers notice and an oppor-\ntunity to be heard before the IRS engages in a particu-\nlar type of collection action: a levy on a taxpayer\u2019s prop-\nerty.  Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Re-\nform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), \n112 Stat. 747.  When the IRS decides that it no longer \nneeds to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, that rationale \nfor a pre-deprivation proceeding no longer applies. \nCongress\u2019s 2006 amendment to Section 6330 does not \nsuggest otherwise.  Section 6330(d)(1) originally granted \nboth the Tax Court and district courts jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determinations, depending on \nthe type of tax at issue.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1) (Supp. IV \n1998).  The 2006 amendment simply revised Section \n6330(d)(1) to make the Tax Court the sole court with ju-\nrisdiction to review those determinations.  Pension Pro-\ntection Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-280, \u00a7 855(a), 120 \nStat. 1019.  Nothing about that amendment suggests that \na Section 6330 proceeding may continue without any \nlive dispute over a proposed levy. \n\n6 \n \nRespondent attempts to analogize Section 6330 to \nfederal statutes that make \u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend upon \nthe state of things at the time of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 16 (brackets and citation omitted).  But those \nanalogies fail because Section 6330 limits the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review of a particular kind of \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d: a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there \nis no longer any need for such a determination, the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot. \nFinally, respondent invokes \u201cthe presumption favor-\ning judicial review of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. \n23 (quoting Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, \n229 (2020)).  But that presumption is inapplicable here \nbecause the government\u2019s interpretation of Section 6330 \ndoes not eliminate judicial review.  See Pet. 14.  As re-\nspondent acknowledges, taxpayers in her position may \nstill \u201chead to court\u201d by filing a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available \nwhether or not there was ever a proposed levy to trigger \nSection 6330.  Br. in Opp. 4; see, e.g., id. at 2 (acknowl-\nedging that \u201ctaxpayers can file refund suits anyway\u201d); \nid. at 13 (acknowledging that \u201cthe taxpayer can sepa-\nrately sue the government for a refund under [26 U.S.C.] \n7422\u201d). \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals also held that the \nIRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to offset respond-\nent\u2019s tax liability was invalid.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Re-\nspondent makes no attempt to defend that holding, see \nBr. in Opp. 3-4, 13, 18-19, and for good reason.  As the pe-\n\n7 \n \ntition explains (at 12-14), no statute grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory  \nauthority to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against \nher tax liability.  And in any event, even if the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction, and even if the offsets were inva-\nlid, there would still be no live controversy over whether \nthe proposed levy may proceed\u2014as would be required \nfor the Tax Court to be able to consider respondent\u2019s  \nchallenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. 10-11, 13.  The court of appeals\u2019 \nattempt to avoid a mootness problem by deeming the \noffsets invalid therefore fails. \nB. Respondent\u2019s Attempts To Minimize The Need For This \nCourt\u2019s Review Are Unavailing \n1. As the petition explains (at 14-16), the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in this case conflicts with decisions of the \nD.C. and Fourth Circuits. \na. The Third Circuit itself recognized that its deci-\nsion \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWillson v. Commissioner, supra.  Pet. App. 27a.  Re-\nspondent nevertheless denies the existence of a conflict, \nasserting (Br. in Opp. 12) that Willson \u201cheld only that a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot if the IRS decides to \nstop pursuing the levy and no dispute about the tax-\npayer\u2019s liability remains.\u201d  But that is not what Willson \nheld.  Rather, as the decision below acknowledged, Will-\nson held that \u201cthere is \u2018no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss a case as moot\u2019 \nwhen the IRS withdraws its proposed levy.\u201d  Pet. App. \n27a (quoting Willson, 805 F.3d at 321) (brackets omit-\nted).  That holding cannot be reconciled with the Third \nCircuit\u2019s view that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase \u201cis not moot\u201d even though the IRS withdrew its pro-\nposed levy.  Id. at 2a. \n\n8 \n \nRespondent is thus wrong in contending (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the D.C. Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree with \nthe Third Circuit in a future case with a liability dis-\npute.\u201d  Though Willson involved a \u201ccontinuing contro-\nversy\u201d over whether the taxpayer was entitled to a \u201cre-\nturn\u201d of certain funds, 805 F.3d at 318, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that the Section 6330 proceeding was moot in \u201cthe \nabsence of a pending levy,\u201d id. at 321.  The D.C. Circuit \nexplained:  \u201cWith no levy being placed upon Willson\u2019s \nproperty, there was no actual case in controversy re-\ngarding his appeal of such a levy action.\u201d  Ibid. (brack-\nets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  That holding makes \nclear that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent if it had arisen in the D.C. Circuit.  And the fact \nthat Willson turned on \u201cthe absence of a pending levy\u201d \nforecloses any possibility that the D.C. Circuit might \nagree with the Third Circuit in a future case.  Ibid. \nRespondent\u2019s own arguments in support of the deci-\nsion below highlight the conflict with Willson.  In de-\nfending the Third Circuit\u2019s decision, respondent argues \nthat the government is \u201cincorrect\u201d that \u201cthe \u2018only relief \nthat Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a proposed \nlevy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Pet. 14 n.2).  The D.C. Cir-\ncuit in Willson, however, agreed with the government \nthat the rejection of a proposed levy is \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  805 \nF.3d at 321.  Willson thus held that a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is moot when \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy \non [the taxpayer\u2019s] property,\u201d ibid.\u2014a holding that di-\nrectly conflicts with the Third Circuit\u2019s decision below. \nb. The Third Circuit also recognized that its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, cert. \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022).  Pet. App. 27a.  Yet respond-\n\n9 \n \nent denies the existence of that conflict as well.  Con-\ntrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 3), how-\never, McLane did not \u201chold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  Instead, McLane held that a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot when a taxpayer \u201cno longer \nfaces\u201d a levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  That holding contradicts \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, which held that \na Section 6330 proceeding \u201cis not moot\u201d even though re-\nspondent no longer faces a levy.  Pet. App. 2a. \nRespondent likewise errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the Fourth Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree \nwith the Third Circuit in a future case with a liability \ndispute.\u201d  After all, McLane itself was a case with a lia-\nbility dispute:  The taxpayer \u201ccontend[ed] that the phrase \n\u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] jurisdiction \non the Tax Court to determine that he overpaid and [to] \norder a refund.\u201d  24 F.4th at 318.  But whereas the Third \nCircuit found \u201cnothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) to suggest that \na taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the existence or amount \nof her underlying tax becomes moot once the levy is no \nlonger being enforced,\u201d Pet. App. 26a-27a, the Fourth \nCircuit in McLane found just the opposite\u2014namely, that \n\u201c[t]he phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019 does not provide \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over independent overpay-\nment claims when the collection action no longer ex-\nists,\u201d 24 F.4th at 319.  Because the Fourth Circuit con-\nstrued that phrase more \u201cnarrowly\u201d than the Third Cir-\ncuit did in this case, Pet. App. 27a, the conflict between \nthe circuits is square. \nAttempting to distinguish McLane on its facts, re-\nspondent notes that the taxpayer in that case sought a \nrefund for the first time in the Tax Court.  Br. in Opp. 29 \n\n10 \n \n(citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 318).  But that fact played \nno role in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  Instead, the \nFourth Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018taxpayer was permitted \nto challenge the amount of his underlying liability in the \n[Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only in the context of deter-\nmining whether the collection action could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMcLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (citation omitted).  And because \nthe taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding was moot.  Ibid. \n2. As the petition explains (at 16), the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in this case also conflicts with decisions of other \ncircuits recognizing that the Tax Court possesses only \nthat jurisdiction expressly authorized by Congress.  Re-\nspondent contends (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that none of those \nother decisions addressed whether the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceed-\ning.  But each of the other circuits\u2019 decisions recognized \nthat the Tax Court may exercise jurisdiction only to the \nextent expressly authorized.  See Pet. 16.  And respond-\nent makes no attempt to reconcile that fundamental \nprinciple with the decision below\u2014which, as respondent \nacknowledges (Br. in Opp. 3), held that \u201cthe Tax Court \nhas \u2018implicit\u2019 jurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings.\u201d \n3. Finally, respondent asserts (Br. in Opp. 11-12) that \nthe question presented \u201crarely arises and is of little prac-\ntical importance to the workable administration of the \ntax laws.\u201d  That is incorrect.  As the petition explains, \nthere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceedings \neach year, see Pet. 16-17, and the question presented \narises each time \u201cthere is no longer a live dispute over \nthe proposed levy that gave rise to [such a] proceeding,\u201d \nPet. I.  Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. \n32-33), moreover, the decision below threatens signifi-\n\n11 \n \ncant practical consequences\u2014not only by expanding the \nscope of Section 6330 proceedings far beyond what Con-\ngress contemplated, see Pet. 17, but also by embracing \na theory of \u201cimplicit\u201d Tax Court jurisdiction unbounded \nby any statutory text, Pet. App. 20a.\n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the  \npetition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nBRIAN H.

As the D.C. and Fourth Circuits \nhave held, that special pre-deprivation proceeding be-\ncomes moot when the IRS no longer needs to pursue a \nlevy.  But the Third Circuit in this case openly \u201cpart[ed] \nways\u201d with those circuits, Pet. App. 27a, holding that a \nSection 6330 proceeding may continue even in the ab-\nsence of any pending levy.  Respondent\u2019s attempts to de-\nfend that decision misunderstand the text of the statute \nthat Congress enacted.  And respondent\u2019s denial of the \nexistence of a circuit split contradicts what the decision \nitself acknowledges.  The petition for a writ of certiorari \nshould be granted. \n\n2 \n \nA. Respondent\u2019s Efforts To Defend The Decision Below \nLack Merit \nAs the petition explains (at 8-14), the Section 6330 \nproceeding in this case is moot because there is no longer \na live dispute over the proposed levy that prompted the \nproceeding.  The court of appeals\u2019 contrary decision is \nwrong, Pet. App. 16a-39a, and respondent\u2019s efforts to de-\nfend it lack merit. \n1. Because there is no longer a live dispute over the \nproposed levy in this case, the Section 6330 proceeding \nis moot \nAs an Article I court, \u201c[t]he Tax Court is a court of \nlimited jurisdiction.\u201d  Commissioner v. McCoy, 484 U.S. \n3, 7 (1987) (per curiam); see 26 U.S.C. 7441.  In a Section \n6330 proceeding, the Tax Court\u2019s jurisdiction is limited \nto reviewing a particular \u201cdetermination\u201d by the IRS \nIndependent Office of Appeals (Appeals Office): a \u201cde-\ntermination\u201d whether the proposed levy may proceed.  26 \nU.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there is no longer a \nlive controversy over the proposed levy, there is no longer \nany need for such a determination, and the Section 6330 \nproceeding is \u201cmoot.\u201d  Willson v. Commissioner, 805 F.3d \n316, 321 (D.C. Cir. 2015) (citation omitted).  That is so \n\u201cnotwithstanding the existence of other live controver-\nsies between the taxpayer and the IRS that do not fall \nwithin the tax court\u2019s jurisdiction\u201d under Section 6330.  \nId. at 320. \nRespondent does not dispute that there is no longer \na live controversy over the proposed levy in this case.  \nIn fact, respondent acknowledges (Br. in Opp. 20) that \n\u201cthe IRS decided to stop pursuing the levy\u201d after it was \nable to use respondent\u2019s overpayments to offset her tax \nliability under 26 U.S.C. 6402(a).  That should be the end \nof the matter.  Because there is no longer any need for \n\n3 \n \na determination whether the proposed levy may go for-\nward, the Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot. \n2. Respondent\u2019s contrary arguments are unpersuasive \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals held that (a) the \nTax Court still has jurisdiction to consider respondent\u2019s \n\u201cunderlying tax liability,\u201d Pet. App. 26a (citation omit-\nted), and (b) the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to \noffset respondent\u2019s tax liability was \u201cinvalid,\u201d id. at 25a.  \nRespondent\u2019s arguments in support of the first holding \nlack merit, and respondent does not even attempt to de-\nfend the second holding. \na. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to consider \n\u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d when there is no \nlive dispute over the proposed levy \nRespondent contends (Br. in Opp. 12) that \u201cSection \n6330 authorizes the Tax Court to review the Appeals Of-\nfice\u2019s determination of a taxpayer\u2019s underlying liability \nand to issue declaratory relief accordingly, notwithstand-\ning the IRS\u2019s decision to stop pursuing a levy.\u201d  That is \nincorrect.  The only determination that Section 6330 au-\nthorizes the Tax Court to review is the Appeals Office\u2019s \n\u201cdetermination\u201d whether a proposed levy may proceed.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  Here, for example, the \n\u201cNotice of Determination\u201d issued by the Appeals Office \nspecifies that the Office \u201chas determined to sustain the \naction (levy).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a, 64a (capitalization altered).  \nAnd the only relief that Section 6330 authorizes upon \nreview of that determination is rejection of the proposed \nlevy.  See Willson, 805 F.3d at 321.1 \n \n1 Section 6330(e)(1) is not to the contrary.  That provision merely \nauthorizes the Tax Court to enjoin \u201cthe beginning of a levy or pro-\nceeding during\u201d the pendency of a Section 6330 proceeding.  26 U.S.C. \n \n\n4 \n \nOf course, in \u201cdetermin[ing]\u201d whether a proposed \nlevy may proceed, the Appeals Office may consider var-\nious subsidiary issues, including \u201cchallenges to the ex-\nistence or amount of the underlying tax liability  * * *   \nif the person did not receive any statutory notice of de-\nficiency for such tax liability or did not otherwise have \nan opportunity to dispute such tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B) and (3).2  But the text of Section 6330 makes \nclear that when there is no longer any live dispute over \nthe proposed levy, there is no longer any jurisdiction to \nconsider challenges about those subsidiary issues.  The \nstatute does not identify them as freestanding issues, \nbut rather as ones that \u201c[t]he determination\u201d about the \nproposed levy \u201cshall take into consideration,\u201d 26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(3)\u2014confirming that when the \u201cproposed levy is \nmoot,\u201d a taxpayer \u201chas no independent basis\u201d to continue \npursuing those challenges, Greene-Thapedi v. Commis-\n \n6330(e)(1).  Contrary to respondent\u2019s suggestion (Br. in Opp. 23), Sec-\ntion 6330(e)(1) does not authorize the Tax Court to \u201cdeclare [a tax-\npayer\u2019s] liability\u201d\u2014let alone authorize that court to issue any relief \nin the absence of a pending levy. \n2 Like the court of appeals, respondent characterizes her challenge \nto the IRS\u2019s allocation of estimated payments in this case as a chal-\nlenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B); see \nBr. in Opp. 14, 19; Pet. App. 17a-19a.  The government disputes that \ncharacterization; in its view, respondent\u2019s challenge presents an \u201cis-\nsue relating to the unpaid tax,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(A), which a tax-\npayer could raise in the course of a live controversy over a proposed \nlevy even if the taxpayer had previously received a \u201cstatutory notice \nof deficiency,\u201d 26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B).  See Gov\u2019t C.A. Supp. Br. 24-\n25.  This dispute over the characterization of respondent\u2019s challenge, \nhowever, has no bearing on the correct answer to the question pre-\nsented.  Even under respondent\u2019s characterization of her challenge, \nthe Section 6330 proceeding in this case is moot because a taxpayer \nmay challenge \u201cthe underlying tax liability\u201d only in connection with \na determination about a proposed levy.  See Pet. 10-11. \n\n5 \n \nsioner, 126 T.C. 1, 8 (2006).  And Congress\u2019s use of the \nphrase \u201cunderlying tax liability\u201d reinforces the infer-\nence that jurisdiction exists only in connection with a \npre-deprivation determination about a proposed levy.  \n26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(2)(B) (emphasis added); see Pet. 11.  \nRespondent therefore errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. 18) \nthat \u201c[n]othing in \u00a7 6330 purports to condition the Tax \nCourt\u2019s ongoing jurisdiction on the IRS\u2019s continued pur-\nsuit of a levy.\u201d \nContrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 15-\n16), the statutory history and context undermine, rather \nthan support, her interpretation of Section 6330.  Con-\ngress enacted Section 6330 on the view that \u201c[d]ue pro-\ncess\u201d warrants giving taxpayers notice and an oppor-\ntunity to be heard before the IRS engages in a particu-\nlar type of collection action: a levy on a taxpayer\u2019s prop-\nerty.  Internal Revenue Service Restructuring and Re-\nform Act of 1998, Pub. L. No. 105-206, Tit. III, \u00a7 3401(b), \n112 Stat. 747.  When the IRS decides that it no longer \nneeds to levy on the taxpayer\u2019s property, that rationale \nfor a pre-deprivation proceeding no longer applies. \nCongress\u2019s 2006 amendment to Section 6330 does not \nsuggest otherwise.  Section 6330(d)(1) originally granted \nboth the Tax Court and district courts jurisdiction to re-\nview the Appeals Office\u2019s determinations, depending on \nthe type of tax at issue.  26 U.S.C. 6330(d)(1) (Supp. IV \n1998).  The 2006 amendment simply revised Section \n6330(d)(1) to make the Tax Court the sole court with ju-\nrisdiction to review those determinations.  Pension Pro-\ntection Act of 2006, Pub. L. No. 109-280, \u00a7 855(a), 120 \nStat. 1019.  Nothing about that amendment suggests that \na Section 6330 proceeding may continue without any \nlive dispute over a proposed levy. \n\n6 \n \nRespondent attempts to analogize Section 6330 to \nfederal statutes that make \u201cjurisdiction \u2018depend upon \nthe state of things at the time of the action brought.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nBr. in Opp. 16 (brackets and citation omitted).  But those \nanalogies fail because Section 6330 limits the Tax Court\u2019s \njurisdiction to review of a particular kind of \u201cdetermi-\nnation\u201d: a \u201cdetermination\u201d whether the proposed levy \nmay proceed.  26 U.S.C. 6330(c)(3) and (d)(1).  When there \nis no longer any need for such a determination, the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot. \nFinally, respondent invokes \u201cthe presumption favor-\ning judicial review of administrative action.\u201d  Br. in Opp. \n23 (quoting Guerrero-Lasprilla v. Barr, 589 U.S. 221, \n229 (2020)).  But that presumption is inapplicable here \nbecause the government\u2019s interpretation of Section 6330 \ndoes not eliminate judicial review.  See Pet. 14.  As re-\nspondent acknowledges, taxpayers in her position may \nstill \u201chead to court\u201d by filing a refund suit\u2014the tradi-\ntional mechanism for disputing the assessment or col-\nlection of a federal tax, and the one that is available \nwhether or not there was ever a proposed levy to trigger \nSection 6330.  Br. in Opp. 4; see, e.g., id. at 2 (acknowl-\nedging that \u201ctaxpayers can file refund suits anyway\u201d); \nid. at 13 (acknowledging that \u201cthe taxpayer can sepa-\nrately sue the government for a refund under [26 U.S.C.] \n7422\u201d). \nb. The Tax Court lacks jurisdiction to review offsets \nin a Section 6330 proceeding \nIn concluding that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase is not moot, the court of appeals also held that the \nIRS\u2019s exercise of statutory authority to offset respond-\nent\u2019s tax liability was invalid.  Pet. App. 19a-25a.  Re-\nspondent makes no attempt to defend that holding, see \nBr. in Opp. 3-4, 13, 18-19, and for good reason.  As the pe-\n\n7 \n \ntition explains (at 12-14), no statute grants the Tax Court \njurisdiction to review the IRS\u2019s exercise of statutory  \nauthority to credit a taxpayer\u2019s overpayments against \nher tax liability.  And in any event, even if the Tax Court \nhad such jurisdiction, and even if the offsets were inva-\nlid, there would still be no live controversy over whether \nthe proposed levy may proceed\u2014as would be required \nfor the Tax Court to be able to consider respondent\u2019s  \nchallenge to \u201cthe underlying tax liability.\u201d  26 U.S.C. \n6330(c)(2)(B); see Pet. 10-11, 13.  The court of appeals\u2019 \nattempt to avoid a mootness problem by deeming the \noffsets invalid therefore fails. \nB. Respondent\u2019s Attempts To Minimize The Need For This \nCourt\u2019s Review Are Unavailing \n1. As the petition explains (at 14-16), the Third Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in this case conflicts with decisions of the \nD.C. and Fourth Circuits. \na. The Third Circuit itself recognized that its deci-\nsion \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the D.C. Circuit\u2019s decision in \nWillson v. Commissioner, supra.  Pet. App. 27a.  Re-\nspondent nevertheless denies the existence of a conflict, \nasserting (Br. in Opp. 12) that Willson \u201cheld only that a \n\u00a7 6330 proceeding becomes moot if the IRS decides to \nstop pursuing the levy and no dispute about the tax-\npayer\u2019s liability remains.\u201d  But that is not what Willson \nheld.  Rather, as the decision below acknowledged, Will-\nson held that \u201cthere is \u2018no appropriate course of action \nfor the Tax Court to take but to dismiss a case as moot\u2019 \nwhen the IRS withdraws its proposed levy.\u201d  Pet. App. \n27a (quoting Willson, 805 F.3d at 321) (brackets omit-\nted).  That holding cannot be reconciled with the Third \nCircuit\u2019s view that the Section 6330 proceeding in this \ncase \u201cis not moot\u201d even though the IRS withdrew its pro-\nposed levy.  Id. at 2a. \n\n8 \n \nRespondent is thus wrong in contending (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the D.C. Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree with \nthe Third Circuit in a future case with a liability dis-\npute.\u201d  Though Willson involved a \u201ccontinuing contro-\nversy\u201d over whether the taxpayer was entitled to a \u201cre-\nturn\u201d of certain funds, 805 F.3d at 318, the D.C. Circuit \nheld that the Section 6330 proceeding was moot in \u201cthe \nabsence of a pending levy,\u201d id. at 321.  The D.C. Circuit \nexplained:  \u201cWith no levy being placed upon Willson\u2019s \nproperty, there was no actual case in controversy re-\ngarding his appeal of such a levy action.\u201d  Ibid. (brack-\nets, citation, and ellipsis omitted).  That holding makes \nclear that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent if it had arisen in the D.C. Circuit.  And the fact \nthat Willson turned on \u201cthe absence of a pending levy\u201d \nforecloses any possibility that the D.C. Circuit might \nagree with the Third Circuit in a future case.  Ibid. \nRespondent\u2019s own arguments in support of the deci-\nsion below highlight the conflict with Willson.  In de-\nfending the Third Circuit\u2019s decision, respondent argues \nthat the government is \u201cincorrect\u201d that \u201cthe \u2018only relief \nthat Section 6330 authorizes is rejection of a proposed \nlevy.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Br. in Opp. 23 (quoting Pet. 14 n.2).  The D.C. Cir-\ncuit in Willson, however, agreed with the government \nthat the rejection of a proposed levy is \u201call the relief \nthat section 6330 authorizes the tax court to grant.\u201d  805 \nF.3d at 321.  Willson thus held that a Section 6330 pro-\nceeding is moot when \u201c[t]he IRS no longer seeks to levy \non [the taxpayer\u2019s] property,\u201d ibid.\u2014a holding that di-\nrectly conflicts with the Third Circuit\u2019s decision below. \nb. The Third Circuit also recognized that its decision \nin this case \u201cpart[s] ways\u201d with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s de-\ncision in McLane v. Commissioner, 24 F.4th 316, cert. \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 408 (2022).  Pet. App. 27a.  Yet respond-\n\n9 \n \nent denies the existence of that conflict as well.  Con-\ntrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. 3), how-\never, McLane did not \u201chold only that a \u00a7 6330 Tax Court \nproceeding becomes moot when the government stops \npursuing the levy and the parties don\u2019t dispute the un-\nderlying tax liability.\u201d  Instead, McLane held that a Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding is moot when a taxpayer \u201cno longer \nfaces\u201d a levy.  24 F.4th at 319.  That holding contradicts \nthe Third Circuit\u2019s decision in this case, which held that \na Section 6330 proceeding \u201cis not moot\u201d even though re-\nspondent no longer faces a levy.  Pet. App. 2a. \nRespondent likewise errs in asserting (Br. in Opp. \n12-13) that the Fourth Circuit would be \u201cfree to agree \nwith the Third Circuit in a future case with a liability \ndispute.\u201d  After all, McLane itself was a case with a lia-\nbility dispute:  The taxpayer \u201ccontend[ed] that the phrase \n\u2018underlying tax liability\u2019  * * *  confer[red] jurisdiction \non the Tax Court to determine that he overpaid and [to] \norder a refund.\u201d  24 F.4th at 318.  But whereas the Third \nCircuit found \u201cnothing in \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) to suggest that \na taxpayer\u2019s right to challenge the existence or amount \nof her underlying tax becomes moot once the levy is no \nlonger being enforced,\u201d Pet. App. 26a-27a, the Fourth \nCircuit in McLane found just the opposite\u2014namely, that \n\u201c[t]he phrase \u2018underlying tax liability\u2019 does not provide \nthe Tax Court jurisdiction over independent overpay-\nment claims when the collection action no longer ex-\nists,\u201d 24 F.4th at 319.  Because the Fourth Circuit con-\nstrued that phrase more \u201cnarrowly\u201d than the Third Cir-\ncuit did in this case, Pet. App. 27a, the conflict between \nthe circuits is square. \nAttempting to distinguish McLane on its facts, re-\nspondent notes that the taxpayer in that case sought a \nrefund for the first time in the Tax Court.  Br. in Opp. 29 \n\n10 \n \n(citing McLane, 24 F.4th at 318).  But that fact played \nno role in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s reasoning.  Instead, the \nFourth Circuit held that \u201cthe \u2018taxpayer was permitted \nto challenge the amount of his underlying liability in the \n[Section 6330] hearing  . . .  only in the context of deter-\nmining whether the collection action could proceed.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nMcLane, 24 F.4th at 319 (citation omitted).  And because \nthe taxpayer \u201cno longer face[d] such an action,\u201d the Sec-\ntion 6330 proceeding was moot.  Ibid. \n2. As the petition explains (at 16), the Third Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in this case also conflicts with decisions of other \ncircuits recognizing that the Tax Court possesses only \nthat jurisdiction expressly authorized by Congress.  Re-\nspondent contends (Br. in Opp. 30-31) that none of those \nother decisions addressed whether the Tax Court has \njurisdiction to review offsets in a Section 6330 proceed-\ning.  But each of the other circuits\u2019 decisions recognized \nthat the Tax Court may exercise jurisdiction only to the \nextent expressly authorized.  See Pet. 16.  And respond-\nent makes no attempt to reconcile that fundamental \nprinciple with the decision below\u2014which, as respondent \nacknowledges (Br. in Opp. 3), held that \u201cthe Tax Court \nhas \u2018implicit\u2019 jurisdiction to review IRS offsets in \u00a7 6330 \nproceedings.\u201d \n3. Finally, respondent asserts (Br. in Opp. 11-12) that \nthe question presented \u201crarely arises and is of little prac-\ntical importance to the workable administration of the \ntax laws.\u201d  That is incorrect.  As the petition explains, \nthere are tens of thousands of Section 6330 proceedings \neach year, see Pet. 16-17, and the question presented \narises each time \u201cthere is no longer a live dispute over \nthe proposed levy that gave rise to [such a] proceeding,\u201d \nPet. I.  Contrary to respondent\u2019s contention (Br. in Opp. \n32-33), moreover, the decision below threatens signifi-\n\n11 \n \ncant practical consequences\u2014not only by expanding the \nscope of Section 6330 proceedings far beyond what Con-\ngress contemplated, see Pet. 17, but also by embracing \na theory of \u201cimplicit\u201d Tax Court jurisdiction unbounded \nby any statutory text, Pet. App. 20a.\n*  *  *  *  * \nFor the foregoing reasons and those stated in the  \npetition for a writ of certiorari, the petition should be \ngranted. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nBRIAN H.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been substantially developed by acquiring the respondent's counter-arguments, which directly address my previous points of uncertainty. My belief structure has evolved from a one-sided model to a more complete, adversarial view, and has now synthesized this conflict to identify the next critical point of inquiry.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Issue (Refined):** The issue remains a clash between two interpretations of the Tax Court's jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330:\n    *   **Petitioner's View:** Jurisdiction is tied directly to the \"proposed levy.\" If the levy is abandoned (e.g., because the tax is collected by other means), the case is moot, and any challenge to the underlying liability must be brought in a separate refund suit.\n    *   **Respondent's View:** Jurisdiction is granted to review the entire \"determination\" of the IRS Appeals Office, which explicitly can include the \"underlying tax liability.\" Once jurisdiction attaches to this determination, it is not divested by the subsequent mooting of the specific collection method (the levy) as long as the liability itself remains a live controversy.\n\n2.  **Petitioner's (Government's) Position (Stable):** The government's argument is based on mootness, the ancillary nature of the liability challenge within a levy proceeding, and the availability of an alternative remedy (\u00a7 7422 refund suit).\n\n3.  **Respondent's (Zuch's) Position (Stable & High-Impact):** The respondent's Brief in Opposition provides a robust counter-narrative built on three pillars:\n    *   **Jurisdictional Persistence:** Jurisdiction, once properly invoked, is not easily divested by subsequent events. The \"matter\" for the court is the entire IRS determination, not just the levy.\n    *   **Live Controversy:** A dispute over the underlying liability is not moot. The Tax Court can grant \"effectual relief\" via a declaratory judgment on the liability, which would have preclusive effect.\n    *   **Judicial Economy:** Resolving the dispute in the already-engaged Tax Court is more efficient than forcing a new, duplicative lawsuit.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Significantly Altered):**\n    *   **The Contested Circuit Split:** This remains the central predictive factor. The respondent's brief credibly argues there is **no split** by factually distinguishing the cases cited by the government (*McLane* and *Willson*). The key distinction is that in those cases, the IRS had conceded the taxpayer was *not liable*, thus eliminating any live controversy. Here, the IRS continues to dispute the liability. This distinction, if accepted by the Court, severely weakens the primary reason to grant certiorari.\n    *   **Quality of Counsel:** The respondent's representation by Shay Dvoretzky (Skadden, Arps) remains a soft signal that the respondent's case is perceived as strong and is being argued effectively.\n\n5.  **Current Prediction & Uncertainty (Sharpened):** My prediction has shifted away from favoring the petitioner and now leans toward a denial of certiorari. The synthesis of the petition and opposition has clarified the pivotal question.\n    *   **Prediction:** The likelihood of the Court denying the petition for certiorari is high. The respondent's argument that the circuit split is illusory is powerful and, if unrebutted, will likely be persuasive.\n    *   **Primary Uncertainty (Evolved):** My uncertainty has evolved from \"What will the respondent argue?\" to a much more specific question: **\"How will the petitioner (the government) respond to the direct and detailed attack on the existence of a circuit split in their reply brief?\"** The government's ability to convincingly rebut the respondent's case distinctions is now the most important unknown variable for predicting the cert grant. The petitioner's reply brief is therefore the next, and likely final, crucial piece of evidence for the certiorari stage.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an internal synthesis of the adversarial filings, provides powerful feedback on my information-gathering strategy, confirming and refining several core heuristics about the legal process.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Primacy of the Cert Petition:** This remains a valid starting point for framing the issues from the petitioner's perspective.\n\n2.  **Refined Heuristic - The \"Circuit Split\" Signal:** A claimed circuit split is a powerful initial signal, but its predictive value is *contingent* and must be tested adversarially. The heuristic is now more precise: \"A claimed circuit split's importance is a function of its indisputability. The respondent's Brief in Opposition is the primary test of this, and the petitioner's Reply Brief is the final verdict.\" The quality of the split, not just its existence, is paramount.\n\n3.  **Refined Heuristic - Iterative, Adversarial Analysis (The Three-Step Certiorari Model):** This principle is strongly validated and now more sophisticated. A one-sided analysis is misleading. The core analytic unit for the certiorari stage is the *sequence* of filings:\n    *   **Step 1 (Petition):** Understand the petitioner's asserted question and reason for review (e.g., the claimed split).\n    *   **Step 2 (Opposition):** Understand the respondent's rebuttal and counter-arguments (e.g., the attack on the split).\n    *   **Step 3 (Reply):** Assess the petitioner's rejoinder to the rebuttal. This final step often determines whether a genuine, intractable conflict of law exists that requires the Court's intervention. My process must now explicitly seek out the reply brief after analyzing the opposition.\n\n4.  **Confirmed Heuristic - The Value of Strategic Pauses (Meta-Cognitive Checkpoints):** This `THINK` step itself confirms the high value of pausing to synthesize information, evaluate the current state of uncertainty, and formulate a precise query for the next most valuable piece of information. This prevents inefficient or random information gathering and focuses resources on resolving the most critical unknown.\n\n5.  **New Heuristic - The Power of Reframing:** Elite advocacy often involves reframing the opponent's question. The respondent's shift in focus from the mooted levy to the live liability dispute is a key strategic move. Future analysis must explicitly compare how each party frames the \"Question Presented.\"\n\n6.  **New Heuristic - Practitioner Quality as a Signal:** The identity of counsel (e.g., a known Supreme Court specialist) is a useful soft signal of a case's perceived merit and the quality of argumentation to expect. This is particularly noteworthy for a respondent at the cert stage, as it indicates a strong belief that the petition can be defeated."

The petitioner's Reply Brief was decisive, as it successfully re-established a clean circuit split by focusing on the conflicting legal reasoning between the Third Circuit and the D.C./Fourth Circuits regarding the scope of Tax Court jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330. This makes a grant of certiorari highly probable. On the merits of the legal question, the petitioner's argument\u2014that jurisdiction over the 'underlying tax liability' is ancillary to a live dispute over the levy and becomes moot when the levy is abandoned\u2014is more persuasive. It is better grounded in the statutory text ('underlying'), the limited nature of Tax Court jurisdiction, and the reasoning of the other circuits. Therefore, I predict the Court will answer 'Yes' to the question presented. I have sufficient information to make a final prediction."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been brought to its cert-stage conclusion by acquiring and analyzing the petitioner's Reply Brief. This final filing directly addresses the respondent's counter-arguments, allowing for a complete synthesis of the adversarial positions and a refined final prediction on the certiorari question.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Issue (Final Synthesis):** The central conflict is a dispute over the statutory architecture of 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330. The question is whether the Tax Court's jurisdiction to review the \"underlying tax liability\" is an independent grant of authority or is strictly ancillary to, and thus falls away with, a live controversy over the \"proposed levy.\"\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Reaffirmed & Sharpened):** Jurisdiction is tied to the levy. The ability to challenge liability under \u00a7 6330(c)(2)(B) is a *subsidiary issue* considered only \"in the context of determining whether the collection action could proceed.\" Once the levy is moot, the statutory basis for the \u00a7 6330 proceeding evaporates, and the taxpayer's remedy for the liability dispute reverts to a standard refund suit (\u00a7 7422).\n    *   **Respondent's View (Contested):** Jurisdiction attaches to the entire IRS \"determination,\" which can include the underlying liability. Once jurisdiction is established, the subsequent mooting of one component (the levy) does not divest the court of power to resolve other live components of the determination (the liability dispute).\n\n2.  **Petitioner's (Government's) Position (Strengthened):** The government's Reply Brief effectively counters the respondent's primary argument. It does not try to distinguish the cases cited by the respondent but instead re-asserts its own interpretation of them, arguing that the respondent's reading is incorrect. The government's position is now fully articulated and defended against the respondent's best arguments.\n\n3.  **Respondent's (Zuch's) Position (Stable but Impact Diminished):** The respondent's arguments for jurisdictional persistence and judicial economy remain well-reasoned. However, the force of their central claim\u2014that no true circuit split exists\u2014has been significantly blunted by the petitioner's direct and forceful rebuttal in the Reply Brief.\n\n4.  **Predictive Signals (Dramatically Altered by Reply Brief):**\n    *   **The Contested Circuit Split:** This is now the paramount signal, and it points strongly toward a cert grant. My previous belief that the respondent had successfully distinguished the split was premature. The petitioner's Reply Brief convincingly argues that a square conflict exists by focusing on the legal reasoning of the other circuits, not just their facts.\n        *   **Government on *Willson* (D.C. Cir.):** Argues *Willson* held that the *only* relief in a \u00a7 6330 case is rejecting a levy, so the case becomes moot \"in the absence of a pending levy,\" regardless of other remaining disputes.\n        *   **Government on *McLane* (4th Cir.):** Argues *McLane* explicitly rejected jurisdiction over liability claims \"when the collection action no longer exists,\" directly contradicting the Third Circuit's holding.\n        *   **Conclusion:** The government has successfully framed the issue as a disagreement on a pure question of law: the scope of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction after a levy is abandoned. This is precisely the kind of conflict the Supreme Court exists to resolve.\n    *   **Quality of Counsel:** The high quality of counsel on both sides has resulted in an exceptionally clear presentation of two diametrically opposed, well-supported legal positions, making the case an attractive vehicle for the Court to clarify the law.\n\n5.  **Current Prediction & Uncertainty (Final Cert-Stage Prediction):** The acquisition of the Reply Brief has resolved my primary uncertainty and caused a major shift in my prediction.\n    *   **Prediction:** The likelihood of the Court granting the petition for certiorari is now **high**. The petitioner (the government) has successfully rebutted the respondent's main argument and has presented the Court with what appears to be a clean, acknowledged, and recurring circuit split on an important issue of tax administration and statutory jurisdiction.\n    *   **Primary Uncertainty (Resolved & Evolved):** The uncertainty has shifted from \"What will the parties argue?\" to \"How will the nine Justices vote?\" The adversarial filings are complete. The next piece of evidence will be the Court's order list indicating whether certiorari is granted or denied. If granted, the focus will shift to the merits briefs and oral arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation completes a full cycle of cert-stage analysis, providing powerful validation for some heuristics and adding significant new layers of sophistication to my overall strategy.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Primacy of the Cert Petition:** Remains the essential starting point for identifying the petitioner's framing of the Question Presented and the core justification for review.\n\n2.  **Refined Heuristic - The \"Circuit Split\" Signal:** A claimed circuit split is a powerful but volatile signal. Its predictive value evolves.\n    *   *Initial State:* A claimed split is a strong reason to investigate.\n    *   *Post-Opposition:* Its value is tested; it may be weakened or nullified if the respondent successfully distinguishes the cases.\n    *   *Post-Reply:* Its value is finalized. The petitioner's ability to rebut the respondent's distinctions and persuasively re-characterize the conflict is often the deciding factor. The key is not the *existence* of different outcomes, but whether the *legal reasoning* is irreconcilable.\n\n3.  **Refined Heuristic - Iterative, Adversarial Analysis (The Three-Step Certiorari Model):** This model is now a cornerstone of my methodology, proven to be indispensable. Analyzing the briefs in sequence (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply) is the only reliable way to model the dialectic that the Court itself observes. Stopping at the opposition brief would have led to a confident but incorrect prediction. The reply brief is not an optional supplement; it is the crucial third act.\n\n4.  **Confirmed Heuristic - The Value of Strategic Pauses:** The practice of pausing to synthesize and identify the \"next most important question\" (which led me from the opposition to seek the reply) is validated as a highly efficient method for navigating the information landscape.\n\n5.  **Refined Heuristic - The Power of Reframing:** I have now observed a three-part framing battle.\n    *   *Petitioner's Frame:* The case is about a *mooted levy*.\n    *   *Respondent's Reframe:* The case is about a *live liability dispute*.\n    *   *Petitioner's Final Frame:* The case is about *statutory hierarchy*, where the liability issue is subordinate to the levy issue, a view they argue other circuits share. The ability to successfully execute this final reframe in the reply is a powerful tool of advocacy.\n\n6.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Practitioner Quality as a Signal:** Elite counsel on both sides elevates the dispute, clarifying the legal questions for the Court. This can increase the odds of a grant by presenting a \"clean\" vehicle to resolve a complex issue.\n\n7.  **New Heuristic - The Strategic Role of the Reply Brief:** The reply brief's primary function is to neutralize the respondent's most effective arguments and re-center the debate on the petitioner's terms. It is fundamentally a work of rebuttal and reframing. A strong reply brief will not just repeat the petition; it will show the Court why the respondent's counter-narrative is flawed and why the original reasons for granting cert remain compelling despite the opposition. My future analysis must treat the reply as the petitioner's closing argument on why the case is worthy of review."

This shift is based on a complete synthesis of the cert-stage briefing.\n\n1.  **Core Legal Issue (Stable):** The fundamental dispute remains whether the Tax Court's jurisdiction under 26 U.S.C. \u00a7 6330 to review an \"underlying tax liability\" is an independent power or is strictly ancillary to a live controversy over the \"proposed levy.\"\n    *   **Petitioner's View (Stable):** Jurisdiction over liability is subsidiary. Once the levy action that triggered the \u00a7 6330 proceeding is moot, the entire proceeding, including the liability challenge, becomes moot. The taxpayer's recourse is a separate refund suit under \u00a7 7422.\n    *   **Respondent's View (Stable):** Jurisdiction attaches to the IRS's overall \"determination.\" The mooting of the levy component does not divest the court of jurisdiction to resolve the still-live liability dispute.\n\n2.  **Party Positions (Stable):** The adversarial arguments presented in the cert-stage briefing (Petition, Opposition, Reply) are fully articulated. The government's position appears strengthened by its effective rebuttal in the Reply Brief.\n\n3.  **Predictive Signals for Certiorari (Finalized):**\n    *   **The Circuit Split:** The petitioner's Reply Brief successfully framed the issue as a clean and recurring legal conflict between the Third Circuit and the D.C. and Fourth Circuits on the scope of \u00a7 6330 jurisdiction. This remains the single most powerful signal pointing toward a grant of certiorari.\n    *   **Quality of Counsel:** The high quality of the briefing from both sides has produced an ideal vehicle for the Court to resolve this statutory question.\n\n4.  **Prediction & Uncertainty (Evolved from Cert to Merits):** My analysis has now moved past the cert-stage question to the ultimate outcome.\n    *   **Certiorari Prediction:** **High likelihood of a grant.** The case presents a clear circuit split on an important and recurring issue of federal tax administration.\n    *   **NEW - Merits Prediction:** I predict the Supreme Court will rule in favor of the petitioner (the government) and answer **\"Yes\"** to the question presented. This would mean reversing the Third Circuit.\n    *   **NEW - Rationale for Merits Prediction:** The petitioner's argument appears more persuasive. It is more closely aligned with:\n        *   **Statutory Text:** The phrase \"underlying tax liability\" suggests a subordinate relationship to the primary subject of the proceeding, which is the collection action (levy).\n        *   **Jurisdictional Principles:** The Tax Court is a court of limited jurisdiction, and a narrow reading that ties its power directly to the live collection action is more consistent with this principle.\n        *   **Consistency with Other Circuits:** The petitioner's position aligns with the reasoning articulated by the D.C. Circuit in *Willson* and the Fourth Circuit in *McLane*, suggesting the Third Circuit is an outlier.\n    *   **Evolved Uncertainty:** The primary uncertainty is no longer whether the Court will take the case, but how the Justices will ultimately weigh these arguments on the merits. The next key information will be the Court's order list, followed by the merits briefs and oral arguments if certiorari is granted.",
          "design_beliefs": "The completion of the cert-stage analysis and the formulation of a preliminary merits prediction provides a capstone to my initial set of heuristics and introduces new strategies for transitioning between analytical phases.\n\n1.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Primacy of the Cert Petition:** Remains the foundational document for understanding the case's framing.\n\n2.  **Refined Heuristic - The \"Circuit Split\" Signal:** A claimed split is a dynamic signal. Its predictive power is not confirmed until the petitioner's Reply Brief successfully rebuts the respondent's attempts to distinguish the conflicting cases. The focus must be on irreconcilable *legal reasoning*, not just factual differences.\n\n3.  **Refined Heuristic - Iterative, Adversarial Analysis (The Three-Step Certiorari Model):** This model (Petition -> Opposition -> Reply) is confirmed as essential. Its value extends beyond predicting the cert grant; the comprehensive understanding of the dueling arguments built during this process provides the direct foundation for a preliminary merits prediction.\n\n4.  **Confirmed Heuristic - The Value of Strategic Pauses:** The practice of pausing to synthesize information and identify the next critical question is validated.\n\n5.  **Refined Heuristic - The Power of Reframing:** The cert-stage battle is a contest of framing. The petitioner's ability to win this battle in the Reply Brief (re-centering the issue on statutory hierarchy after the respondent reframed it as a live liability dispute) is a strong indicator of success.\n\n6.  **Confirmed Heuristic - Practitioner Quality as a Signal:** Elite counsel creating a \"clean vehicle\" increases the probability of a grant.\n\n7.  **Refined Heuristic - The Strategic Role of the Reply Brief:** The Reply Brief is the petitioner's closing argument for certiorari. Its function is to neutralize the opposition's best points and re-establish the clarity and importance of the legal conflict. Its effectiveness is a key predictive variable.\n\n8.  **NEW Heuristic - Leverage Cert-Stage Analysis for Preliminary Merits Prediction:** The deep analysis required to evaluate the probability of a cert grant should be immediately repurposed to form an initial prediction on the merits. The arguments that are most persuasive for granting review are often a strong indicator of which arguments will prevail in the final decision.\n\n9.  **NEW Heuristic - The \"Formal Synthesis and Prediction Point\" Strategy:** After a complete information-gathering cycle (e.g., all cert-stage briefs are filed), it is a highly effective strategy to formally pause, synthesize all evidence, and commit to a concrete, multi-layered prediction (e.g., cert likelihood and preliminary merits outcome). This crystallizes the state of knowledge and provides a clear hypothesis to be tested by future events.\n\n10. **NEW Heuristic - Identifying \"Sufficiency Thresholds\":** An efficient design requires recognizing when enough information has been gathered to answer a sub-question with sufficient confidence. My conclusion that I had \"sufficient information\" after the Reply Brief marks the crossing of such a threshold, allowing a strategic pivot from the \"Will cert be granted?\" question to the \"How will the Court rule on the merits?\" question."
