      "Do public schools burden parents\u2019 religious exercise when they compel elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents\u2019 religious convictions and without notice or opportunity to opt out?"

    "facts_of_the_case": "In October 2022, Montgomery County Public Schools in Maryland approved LGBTQ-inclusive books for its English Language Arts curriculum. These \u201cStorybooks\u201d featured characters and themes related to sexual orientation and gender identity, including books like \u201cPride Puppy!\u201d for pre-K students and \u201cBorn Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope\u201d for K-5 students. Initially, the school board allowed parents to receive notice and opt their children out of lessons involving these books, in line with the district\u2019s guidelines for religious accommodations. However, in March 2023, the Board abruptly reversed this policy, eliminating all notice and opt-out options without explanation, though they later cited concerns about high student absenteeism, classroom disruption, administrative burden, and potential stigmatization of individuals represented in the books.\n\nSeveral parents of different religious backgrounds (Muslim, Roman Catholic, and Ukrainian Orthodox) sued the Board, arguing that the denial of notice and opt-out options violated their religious freedom and parental rights. The parents did not seek to ban the books or challenge their adoption into the curriculum; rather, they sought to maintain control over how and when their children would be exposed to content they believed conflicted with their religious duties to train their children according to their faiths on matters of gender, marriage, and sexuality.\n\nThe district court denied the parents\u2019 motion for a preliminary injunction, finding the parents failed to demonstrate a cognizable burden to their religious freedom, and the parents filed an interlocutory appeal, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed the district court\u2019s denial.",

The case involves a clash between parents' First Amendment Free Exercise rights and a public school board's authority over curriculum. The key issue is whether denying an opt-out from instruction on gender and sexuality constitutes a legally cognizable 'burden' on the parents' religious exercise.\n\nMy initial uncertainties are high in both \u03b8 and D.\n\nFor \u03b8 (task-specifics):\n1.  What are the precise legal arguments the petitioners (parents) are making? Which precedents are they relying on? (e.g., *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, *Pierce v. Society of Sisters*, *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*).\n2.  What is the school board's defense? How do they justify the removal of the opt-out policy and argue it doesn't burden religious freedom?\n3.  What was the detailed reasoning of the Fourth Circuit for finding the parents failed to show a 'cognizable burden'? This is a critical legal threshold.\n\nFor D (design effectiveness/meta-knowledge):\n1.  How has the current Supreme Court, particularly its conservative majority, treated Free Exercise claims, especially when they conflict with neutral, generally applicable policies? Recent cases like *Fulton*, *Kennedy v. Bremerton*, and *Carson v. Makin* suggest a strong tendency to favor religious claimants.\n2.  What is the current judicial standard for what constitutes a 'burden' on religious exercise? Is the Court still applying the framework from *Employment Division v. Smith*, or is it moving towards a more stringent form of scrutiny?\n3.  How does the Court balance the fundamental right of parents to direct their children's upbringing with the state's interest in public education?\n\nMy first action should aim to gather the most fundamental information about the case. The best document for this is the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, filed by the parents. This document will lay out their best arguments for why the Supreme Court should hear the case and why the lower court's decision was wrong. It will directly address my \u03b8-uncertainties by detailing their legal claims and cited precedents. It will also inform my D-beliefs by showing which legal theories and precedents are considered most persuasive for this type of claim before the current Court.\n\nTherefore, I will perform a closed search for the petition for certiorari.",

It correctly identifies the core uncertainties at both the task (\u03b8) and design (D) levels. For the task, it pinpoints the critical need to understand the petitioners' arguments, the school board's defense, and the Fourth Circuit's reasoning on the 'cognizable burden' standard. For design, it correctly frames the meta-question around the current Court's strong pro-Free Exercise trend and the potential erosion of the 'Smith' precedent. The proposed next action\u2014searching for the cert petition\u2014is the single most efficient step to address these identified uncertainties. The THINK action, therefore, has high instrumental value, creating a clear and effective plan that makes subsequent information gathering maximally informative for both the specific case prediction and general strategic understanding.",

At the outset of the litigation, the Parents \nmoved for a preliminary injunction to require the \nBoard to provide such notice and an opt-out option. \nAfter the district court denied their motion, the \nParents filed this interlocutory appeal. We take no \nview on whether the Parents will be able to present \nevidence sufficient to support any of their various \ntheories once they have the opportunity to develop a \nrecord as to the circumstances surrounding the \nBoard\u2019s decision and how the challenged texts are \nactually being used in schools. At this early stage, \nhowever, given the Parents\u2019 broad claims, the very \nhigh burden required to obtain a preliminary \ninjunction, and the scant record before us, we are \nconstrained to affirm the district court\u2019s order denying \na preliminary injunction.  \n9a\n\nI. \nA. The Storybooks & Board Policy \nIn October 2022, the Board announced that, \nthrough its regular curriculum adoption process, it \nhad approved a group of \u201cLGBTQ-Inclusive Books as \npart of the English Language Arts Curriculum\u201d for use \nin Montgomery County Public Schools. J.A. 540. These \ntexts, which we will refer to as \u201cthe Storybooks,\u201d are \nostensibly \u201cused to assist students with mastering \nreading concepts like answering questions about \ncharacters, retelling key events about characters in a \nstory, and drawing inferences about story characters \nbased on their actions.\u201d J.A. 541. While their \nindividual contents vary, the Storybooks as a whole \nexpress their authors\u2019 views on sexual orientation and \ngender \nidentity \nby \nportraying \nhomosexual, \ntransgender, and non-binary characters in various \nsituations. For example, the alphabet primer Pride \nPuppy!, which is the sole text expressly approved for \nuse in pre-Kindergarten and Head Start classrooms, \ndepicts a family whose puppy gets lost amidst a \nLGBTQ-pride parade, with each page focused on a \nletter of the alphabet. The three-and four-year-old \naudience is invited to look for items such as \n\u201c[drag]king,\u201d \u201cleather,\u201d \u201clip ring,\u201d \u201c[drag]queen,\u201d and \n\u201cunderwear.\u201d J.A. 98 (brackets in original); see J.A. \n82\u201399 (reproducing Robin Stevenson, Pride Puppy! \n(2021)).1 \n \n1  \nIn another book, Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named \nPenelope, approved for use in Kindergarten through Grade 5 and \ntargeted for use in Grade 5, the main character is a biological girl \nwho becomes upset when others say, \u201cyou look like your sister,\u201d \nJ.A. 244, because \u201c[i]nside I\u2019m a boy. When I close my eyes and \n \n10a\n\nThe record provides little explanation of how the \nStorybooks have been, or will be, integrated into the \nlarger array of books offered as part of the Language \nArts curriculum. But when opposing the motion for a \npreliminary injunction, the Board submitted a \ndeclaration from the Associate Superintendent of \nCurriculum \nand \nInstructional \nPrograms \nfor \nMontgomery County Public Schools that addressed \nthe school system\u2019s purpose in adopting and its \nintended use of the Storybooks. Her declaration states \nthat to \u201cprepare[]principals and teachers for the \nintroduction of\u201d the Storybooks into the curriculum, \nthe school system provided guidance and training \nopportunities, \nincluding \nstatements \nthat \nthe \nStorybooks were not \u201cplanned\u201d to be part of \u201cexplicit \ninstruction on gender identity and sexual orientation \nin elementary school, and that no student or adult is \nasked to change how they feel about these issues.\u201d J.A. \n540\u201341. \nTeachers \nwere \ninstead \nexpected \nto \n\u201cincorporate the [Storybooks] into the curriculum in \nthe same way that other books are used, namely, to \nput them on a shelf for students to find on their own; \nto recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; \nto offer the books as an option for literature circles, \nbook clubs, or paired reading groups; or to use them as \na read aloud\u201d for all students in the class. J.A. 540\u201341. \nAlthough the adoption of the Storybooks came with \nthe expectation that teachers would incorporate them \ninto the classroom environment in some way, the \n \ndream, I\u2019m a boy,\u201d J.A. 248.Penelope\u2019s family is supportive, and \n\u201cmake[s] a plan to tell everyone\u201d that Penelope is a boy even if it \n\u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d to them because \u201c[n]ot everything needs to \nmake sense. This is about love.\u201d J.A. 255, 259; see J.A. 242\u201376 \n(reproducing Jodie Patterson, Born Ready: The True Story of a \nBoy Named Penelope(2021)).  \n11a\n\nAssociate \nSuperintendent \nrepresented \nthat \nthe \ndecision about which books to use and how they\u2019d be \nused in an individual classroom is left to each teacher\u2019s \ndiscretion. J.A. 541 (\u201cTeachers have a choice regarding \nwhich [of the Storybooks] to use and when to use them \nthroughout each unit. . . . Teachers cannot, however, \nelect not to use the [Storybooks] at all.\u201d).  \nAs part of the Storybooks\u2019 rollout, Montgomery \nCounty teachers and administrators were provided \naccess to additional materials \u201cto support\u201d them in \nresponding to inquiries about the Storybooks\u2019 \ncontents. J.A. 600. These materials, which are not part \nof the student-facing texts, include a number of \npotential questions that the Storybooks may generate \nfrom students and their caregivers\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

At the outset of the litigation, the Parents \nmoved for a preliminary injunction to require the \nBoard to provide such notice and an opt-out option. \nAfter the district court denied their motion, the \nParents filed this interlocutory appeal. We take no \nview on whether the Parents will be able to present \nevidence sufficient to support any of their various \ntheories once they have the opportunity to develop a \nrecord as to the circumstances surrounding the \nBoard\u2019s decision and how the challenged texts are \nactually being used in schools. At this early stage, \nhowever, given the Parents\u2019 broad claims, the very \nhigh burden required to obtain a preliminary \ninjunction, and the scant record before us, we are \nconstrained to affirm the district court\u2019s order denying \na preliminary injunction.  \n9a\n\nI. \nA. The Storybooks & Board Policy \nIn October 2022, the Board announced that, \nthrough its regular curriculum adoption process, it \nhad approved a group of \u201cLGBTQ-Inclusive Books as \npart of the English Language Arts Curriculum\u201d for use \nin Montgomery County Public Schools. J.A. 540. These \ntexts, which we will refer to as \u201cthe Storybooks,\u201d are \nostensibly \u201cused to assist students with mastering \nreading concepts like answering questions about \ncharacters, retelling key events about characters in a \nstory, and drawing inferences about story characters \nbased on their actions.\u201d J.A. 541. While their \nindividual contents vary, the Storybooks as a whole \nexpress their authors\u2019 views on sexual orientation and \ngender \nidentity \nby \nportraying \nhomosexual, \ntransgender, and non-binary characters in various \nsituations. For example, the alphabet primer Pride \nPuppy!, which is the sole text expressly approved for \nuse in pre-Kindergarten and Head Start classrooms, \ndepicts a family whose puppy gets lost amidst a \nLGBTQ-pride parade, with each page focused on a \nletter of the alphabet. The three-and four-year-old \naudience is invited to look for items such as \n\u201c[drag]king,\u201d \u201cleather,\u201d \u201clip ring,\u201d \u201c[drag]queen,\u201d and \n\u201cunderwear.\u201d J.A. 98 (brackets in original); see J.A. \n82\u201399 (reproducing Robin Stevenson, Pride Puppy! \n(2021)).1 \n \n1  \nIn another book, Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named \nPenelope, approved for use in Kindergarten through Grade 5 and \ntargeted for use in Grade 5, the main character is a biological girl \nwho becomes upset when others say, \u201cyou look like your sister,\u201d \nJ.A. 244, because \u201c[i]nside I\u2019m a boy. When I close my eyes and \n \n10a\n\nThe record provides little explanation of how the \nStorybooks have been, or will be, integrated into the \nlarger array of books offered as part of the Language \nArts curriculum. But when opposing the motion for a \npreliminary injunction, the Board submitted a \ndeclaration from the Associate Superintendent of \nCurriculum \nand \nInstructional \nPrograms \nfor \nMontgomery County Public Schools that addressed \nthe school system\u2019s purpose in adopting and its \nintended use of the Storybooks. Her declaration states \nthat to \u201cprepare[]principals and teachers for the \nintroduction of\u201d the Storybooks into the curriculum, \nthe school system provided guidance and training \nopportunities, \nincluding \nstatements \nthat \nthe \nStorybooks were not \u201cplanned\u201d to be part of \u201cexplicit \ninstruction on gender identity and sexual orientation \nin elementary school, and that no student or adult is \nasked to change how they feel about these issues.\u201d J.A. \n540\u201341. \nTeachers \nwere \ninstead \nexpected \nto \n\u201cincorporate the [Storybooks] into the curriculum in \nthe same way that other books are used, namely, to \nput them on a shelf for students to find on their own; \nto recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; \nto offer the books as an option for literature circles, \nbook clubs, or paired reading groups; or to use them as \na read aloud\u201d for all students in the class. J.A. 540\u201341. \nAlthough the adoption of the Storybooks came with \nthe expectation that teachers would incorporate them \ninto the classroom environment in some way, the \n \ndream, I\u2019m a boy,\u201d J.A. 248.Penelope\u2019s family is supportive, and \n\u201cmake[s] a plan to tell everyone\u201d that Penelope is a boy even if it \n\u201cdoesn\u2019t make sense\u201d to them because \u201c[n]ot everything needs to \nmake sense. This is about love.\u201d J.A. 255, 259; see J.A. 242\u201376 \n(reproducing Jodie Patterson, Born Ready: The True Story of a \nBoy Named Penelope(2021)).  \n11a\n\nAssociate \nSuperintendent \nrepresented \nthat \nthe \ndecision about which books to use and how they\u2019d be \nused in an individual classroom is left to each teacher\u2019s \ndiscretion. J.A. 541 (\u201cTeachers have a choice regarding \nwhich [of the Storybooks] to use and when to use them \nthroughout each unit. . . . Teachers cannot, however, \nelect not to use the [Storybooks] at all.\u201d).  \nAs part of the Storybooks\u2019 rollout, Montgomery \nCounty teachers and administrators were provided \naccess to additional materials \u201cto support\u201d them in \nresponding to inquiries about the Storybooks\u2019 \ncontents. J.A. 600. These materials, which are not part \nof the student-facing texts, include a number of \npotential questions that the Storybooks may generate \nfrom students and their caregivers, along with sample \nanswers and conversation points to justify the \nStorybooks. For example, if a student says \u201cBeing \n_____ (gay, lesbian, queer, etc) is wrong and not \nallowed in my religion,\u201d teachers \u201ccan respond,\u201d \u201cI \nunderstand that is what you believe, but not everyone \nbelieves that. We don\u2019t have to understand or support \na person\u2019s identity to treat them with respect and \nkindness.\u201d J.A. 595. The guidance also counsels that if \na student says that \u201ca girl . . . can only like boys \nbecause she\u2019s a girl,\u201d the teacher can \u201c[d]isrupt the \neither/or thinking by saying something like: actually, \npeople of any gender can like whoever they like. . . . \nHow do you think it would make (character\u2019s name)to \nhear you say that? Do you think it\u2019s fair for people to \ndecide for us who we can and can\u2019t like?\u201d J.A. 595 \n(emphasis added). If a student asks what it means to \nbe transgender, the teacher could explain, \u201cWhen \nwe\u2019re born, people make a guess about our gender and \nlabel us \u2018boy\u2019 or \u2018girl\u2019 based on our body parts. \nSometimes they\u2019re right and sometimes they\u2019re wrong \n12a\n\n. . . Our body parts do not decide our gender. Our \ngender comes from our inside[.]\u201d J.A. 596.  \nIn terms of responding to queries from parents or \ncaregivers, the additional materials include such \nrecommendations as disagreeing with concerns that \nelementary-age children are \u201ctoo young to be learning \nabout gender and sexual[] identity.\u201d J.A. 600. It \nprompts that teachers could respond to such concerns \nby observing that \u201c[c]hildren are already learning \nabout it\u201d because \u201c[m]essages about gender are \neverywhere,\u201d \nand \nthat \n\u201c[b]eginning \nthese \nconversations in elementary school will help young \npeople develop empathy for a diverse group of people \nand learn about identities that might relate to their \nfamilies or even themselves.\u201d J.A. 600. In response to \na caregiver\u2019s concern that values in the books \u201cgo \nagainst the values we are instilling . . . at home,\u201d the \nguidance suggests reiterating that \u201c[t]he purpose of \nlearning about gender and sexual[] identity diversity \nis to demonstrate that children are unique and that \nthere is no single way to be a boy, girl, or any other \ngender. If a child does not agree with or understand \nanother student\u2019s . . . identity . . . , they do not have to \nchange how they feel about it.\u201d J.A. 601.  \nAlmost as soon as the Storybooks were first \nadopted and integrated into Montgomery County \nschools \nduring \nthe \n2022\u20132023 \nacademic \nyear, \nnumerous teachers, administrators, and parents \nbegan voicing concerns about their efficacy and age \nappropriateness. Some complaints were based on \nreligious grounds, but many were not. For instance, \nseveral elementary school principals signed onto a \ndocument that identified numerous instances in the \nStorybooks of age-inappropriate content such as words \n13a\n\nbeing used without definitions; inherent problems \nwith depicting young children \u201cfalling in love\u201d with \nanother individual regardless of orientation; and the \noverall difficulty of some of the concepts presented. \nJ.A. 574. Many parents, including the eventual \nplaintiffs in this case, expressed concerns about \nhaving their children exposed to content at odds with \ntheir religious faith or that they deemed to be \ninappropriate \nfor \ntheir \nchildren\u2019s \nage \nand \ndevelopment. In short, the Storybooks\u2019 rollout was \ncontentious and many caregivers sought\u2014for religious \nand secular reasons\u2014to have their children exempted \nfrom the Storybooks.  \nDuring the first year of the Storybooks\u2019 inclusion in \nthe Language Arts curriculum, parents were provided \nnotice and the opportunity to opt out of their use \nthrough agreements with individual principals and \nteachers. This accommodation appeared to be in line \nwith \nthe \nCounty\u2019s \n2022-2023 \nGuidelines \nfor \nRespecting Religious Diversity, which encouraged \nschools \u201cto make reasonable and feasible adjustments \nto the instructional program to accommodate requests \n. . . to be excused from specific classroom discussions \nor activities that [parents or students] believe would \nimpose a substantial burden on their religious beliefs,\u201d \nsubject to alternative assignments. J.A. 67. As alleged \nin the amended complaint, on March 22, 2023, the \nBoard publicly reiterated that when a teacher chose to \nuse one of the Storybooks in their classrooms, \u201ca \nnotification goes out to parents about the book,\u201d and, \nif a caregiver chooses to opt their child out, the teacher \nwould \u201cfind a substitute text for that student that \nsupports\u201d the same language arts standards and \nobjectives. J.A. 31.  \n14a\n\nThe following day, without explanation, the Board \nannounced in a complete about-face that a notice and \nopt-out option would no longer be permitted. Although \nthe revised policy became effective immediately, old \nrequests for accommodations were grandfathered in \nthrough the end of the 2022\u20132023 academic year, \nmaking the current 2023\u20132024 academic year the first \nyear for which no students or their parents are \nprovided notice or the opportunity to opt out from the \nStorybooks.2 \nWhat motivated the policy change is largely \nunknown, \nbut \nthe \nAssociate \nSuperintendent\u2019s \ndeclaration \nasserts \nseveral \nafter-the-fact \nexplanations. First, it claims that the original notice-\nand-opt-out \npolicy \nhad \nled \nto \n\u201chigh \nstudent \nabsenteeism,\u201d J.A. 543, and it cited concerns from \n \n2  \nAlthough not directly cited in the amended complaint or \nfilings to date, we note that according to the Board\u2019s website, its \n2023-2024 Guidelines have since been amended considerably, \npermitting students to be \u201cexcused from noncurricular activities \n. . . that involve materials or practices in conflict with a family\u2019s \nreligious, and/or other, practices,\u201d but prohibiting all \u201crequests \nfor exemptions from required curricular instruction or the use of \ncurricular instructional materials based on religious, and/or \nother, objections\u201d and eliminating the language encouraging \naccommodations when the instruction substantially burdens a \nparent or child\u2019s free-exercise rights. 2023-2024 Guidelines for \nRespecting Religious Diversity, 3\u20134, https://perma.cc/SB9Z-SJSC.  \nBecause we conclude that the Parents have not yet come \nforward with evidence that would establish a burden for purposes \nof obtaining a preliminary injunction on their claim as it\u2019s been \nformulated thus far, we do not delve into the constitutionality of \nthe Guidelines in their current form. Any impact this revised \nwritten language has on the Parents\u2019 claims or arguments would \nneed to be fleshed out in the first instance in the district court if \nraised by the Parents.   \n15a\n\nprincipals and teachers regarding the feasibility of \n\u201caccommodat[ing] the growing number of opt out \nrequests without causing significant disruptions to the \nclassroom environment and undermining [the school \nsystem\u2019s] educational mission,\u201d J.A. 542. It also \nrepresented that allowing notice and an opt-out option \nplaced too great a burden on school staff charged with \n(1) remembering which students could be present \nduring lessons involving the Storybooks or otherwise \nbe permitted access to those books, and (2) developing \nalternative plans for those students who could not be \npresent across a range of language-arts activities. \nLastly, the declaration recounts the Board\u2019s concern \nabout stigmatizing and isolating individuals whose \ncircumstances were reflected in the Storybooks.  \nB. The Litigation \nTwo months after the Board changed its policy and \nprohibited notice and an opt-out option, the Parents \nfiled a complaint in the United States District Court \nfor the District of Maryland.3 They subsequently \namended the complaint to add a plaintiff.4 The \n \n3  \nThe named individual plaintiffs are Tamer Mahmoud and \nEnas Barakat, who are Muslim; Jeff and Svitlana Roman, who \nare Roman Catholic and Ukrainian Orthodox, respectively; and \nChris and Melissa Persak, who are Catholic. Each of these \nfamilies have one or more elementary-school-age children \nattending Montgomery County Public Schools. They\u2019ve sued in \ntheir individual capacities and ex relatione their children.  \nThe named defendants are the Board and its individual \nmembers, sued in their official capacities.   \n4  \nThe added plaintiff is Kids First, \u201can unincorporated \nassociation of parents and teachers\u201d advocating \u201cfor the return of \nparental notice and opt-out rights\u201d in Montgomery County Public \n \n16a\n\namended complaint alleges six claims, which can be \ngrouped into four bases for asserting the Board\u2019s \ndecision violates the Parents\u2019 and their children\u2019s \nrights: (1) free exercise; (2) free speech; (3) due process; \nand (4) Maryland state law. \nThe Parents do not challenge the Board\u2019s adoption \nof the Storybooks or seek to ban their use in \nMontgomery County Public Schools. Instead, the \nParents contend that the cited legal bases require that \nthey have notice and the opportunity to opt out \u201cof \nclassroom instruction on such sensitive religious and \nideological issues.\u201d J.A. 13. Their overarching \nassertion is broad, contending that it violates the Free \nExercise Clause not to allow individualized opt-outs \nfrom all potential uses of the Storybooks within the \nLanguage Arts curriculum as well as all discussions \nthat may arise related to their use. Consistent with \nthose arguments, the amended complaint seeks a \ndeclaratory judgment that the revised policy violates \nthe cited federal and state constitutional provisions; \nrequests injunctive relief prohibiting forced exposure \nto the Storybooks and requiring notice and an \n \nSchools. J.A. 13\u201314. Kids First did not join in the Parents\u2019 motion \nfor a preliminary injunction. Although the district court \nexpressed concern about the Parents\u2019 arguments in support of the \nmotion that relied on one member of Kids First\u2019s declaration, it \nnonetheless \nconsidered \nthose \narguments \nin \ndenying \na \npreliminary injunction.  \nBecause Kids First did not join the motion for a preliminary \ninjunction and given the strict standards by which such a motion \nis considered, we will not consider these arguments in this \nappeal. We express no view on arguments Kids First may raise \nin the district court and that court is free to consider and assess \nthe merits or barriers to reaching the merits of any of those \nclaims as the litigation proceeds.   \n17a\n\nopportunity for opt-outs; and asks for nominal and \nactual damages.  \nWhile the specifics vary, the Parents all cite their \nreligious views as spurring their desire to opt their \nchildren out of the Storybooks. Broadly speaking, they \nbelieve they have a religious duty to train their \nchildren in accord with their faiths on what it means \nto be male and female; the institution of marriage; \nhuman sexuality; and related themes. Their respective \nreligious faiths direct and inform their views about \nthese issues, and they want to maintain control over \nwhat, how, and when these matters are introduced to \ntheir children. Because the Parents believe that the \n\u201cideological view[s] of family life and sexuality\u201d \nportrayed in the Storybooks conflict with their views \non these and related topics, they object to their \nchildren being exposed to them. J.A. 18. Accordingly, \nthey assert that the Board\u2019s refusal to permit notice \nand an opportunity to opt out from use or discussions \nrelating to the Storybooks violates the free exercise of \ntheir religion and their due process right to direct their \nchildren\u2019s education.5  \nShortly after filing their complaint, the Parents \nmoved for a preliminary injunction based only on the \nalleged violations of the Free Exercise and Due \n \n5  \nThe Parents\u2019 challenge stretches beyond their children \nreading (or being read) the Storybooks to any classroom \nconversations about the themes and issues presented in the \nStorybooks. Opening Br. 34 (\u201c[T]he Parents object to their \nchildren\u2019s presence in situations that prematurely expose them to \nideas about sexuality and gender in conflict with their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d).   \n18a\n\nProcess Clauses of the federal Constitution.6 They \nargued that they had shown a likelihood of succeeding \non the merits of their free exercise and due process \nclaims because the Board\u2019s refusal to provide notice \nand an opt-out opportunity was subject to strict \nscrutiny and could not withstand that review.   \nThe Parents relied on four lines of Supreme Court \ncases in advocating why strict scrutiny should apply \nto their free exercise claims: (1) Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972), demands strict scrutiny of any \npolicy that interferes with a parent\u2019s right to direct \nthe religious upbringing of his or her children; (2) \nFulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. 1868 (2021), \nprovides for strict scrutiny of any policy that permits \ndiscretionary, individualized exemptions; (3) Tandon \nv. Newsom, 141 S. Ct. 1294 (2021) (per curiam), states \nthat any policy treating religious exemptions worse \nthan secular exemptions triggers strict scrutiny; and \n(4) Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993), and Masterpiece \nCakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado Civil Rights Commission, \n138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018), call for strict scrutiny when \nofficial \naction \noccurs \nunder \ncircumstances \ndemonstrating \ngovernmental \nhostility \ntoward \nreligion.   \nThe Parents argued that strict scrutiny also \napplied to their due process claim because it was being \nasserted in conjunction with a free exercise claim, and \n \n6  \nThe Parents\u2019 motion did not rely on the First Amendment \nfree speech or Maryland state law claims. As such, arguments \nrelated to them are not before us and it remains for the district \ncourt to consider them in the first instance.  \n19a\n\nthus presented a so-called \u201chybrid rights\u201d claim.7 But \nthe crux of their claim is that they have a fundamental \nright to direct the religious and educational \nupbringing of their children, which the Board has \nviolated by denying them a right to notice and an opt-\nout opportunity. From this view that strict scrutiny \napplied to their claims, the Parents argued that the \nBoard\u2019s refusal to allow notice and an opportunity to \nopt out of the Storybooks could not withstand that \nreview given that the Board lacked a compelling \ninterest for its policy and the policy was not the least \nrestrictive means for achieving any asserted interest.8   \nAfter briefing and a hearing, the district court \ndeclined to issue a preliminary injunction. In the \ncourt\u2019s view, the Parents had failed to demonstrate a \ncognizable burden to the free exercise of their religion. \nAnd without that showing, there was no reason to \nconsider the Parents\u2019 arguments as to the other \n \n7  \nUnder a hybrid-rights theory, a claim alleging a violation of \nthe U.S. Constitution that would ordinarily be subject to rational \nbasis review should instead be subjected to strict (Continued) \nscrutiny because it is intertwined with an alleged violation of \nanother provision of the U.S. Constitution. See, e.g., Combs v. \nHomer-Ctr. Sch. Dist., 540 F.3d 231, 243\u201347 (3d Cir. 2008) \n(explaining the hybrid-rights theory). Applied here, the Parents \nmaintained that their due process claim alleging a right to direct \nthe education of their children, which is normally subject to \nrational basis review, should be subjected to strict scrutiny \nbecause it relates to their free exercise claim and thus asserts a \nviolation of their right to direct the religious education of their \nchildren. \n8  \nThe parties also briefed the other requirements to obtaining \na preliminary injunction, but the focus has been on the likelihood \nof success on the merits. Because we agree that this issue \nresolves our review of the district court\u2019s denial of relief, we \nsimilarly focus our discussion.  \n20a\n\naspects of a free exercise claim because they could not \nshow a likelihood of success on the merits. The district \ncourt also denied a preliminary injunction based on \nthe Parents\u2019 due process claim. It expressed some \nskepticism as to whether this Court would recognize \nthe hybrid-rights theory that the Parents advanced \ngiven that we have not yet done so and other circuit \ncourts of appeals are divided on the issue. Regardless, \nthe district court observed that, even in jurisdictions \nthat have accepted a hybrid-rights argument, the \nplaintiff\u2019s free exercise claim must be colorable for \nstrict scrutiny to apply, and the Parents\u2019 claim was \nnot. Accordingly, the court applied rational basis \nreview to this claim, observed the Parents did not \ncontest that the revised policy would survive such \nreview, and agreed with that conclusion.  \nThe Parents noted a timely interlocutory appeal, \nand we have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1292(a)(1). \nIn conjunction with filing their notice of appeal, the \nParents filed an emergency motion for preliminary \ninjunctive relief pending resolution of the appeal. We \ndenied that request, but accelerated briefing and \nexpedited oral argument. In the interim, the district \ncourt granted the parties\u2019 joint motion to stay further \nproceedings in that court pending this appeal.  \nII. \n A party seeking a preliminary injunction faces an \nexceedingly high burden. As the Supreme Court has \nrecognized, \n\u201c[a] \npreliminary \ninjunction \nis \nan \nextraordinary remedy never awarded as of right.\u201d \nWinter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 \n(2008). Each request requires courts to \u201cbalance the \ncompeting claims of injury,\u201d \u201cconsider the effect on \neach party,\u201d and \u201cpay particular regard for the public \n21a\n\nconsequences\u201d of issuing a preliminary injunction. Id. \n(citations omitted).  \nTo be eligible for a preliminary injunction, \nplaintiffs must show that (1) they are \u201clikely to \nsucceed on the merits\u201d; (2) they are \u201clikely to suffer \nirreparable harm in the absence of preliminary relief\u201d; \n(3) \u201cthe balance of the equities tips in [their] favor\u201d; \nand (4) \u201can injunction is in the public interest.\u201d Vitkus \nv. Blinken, 79 F.4th 352, 361 (4th Cir. 2023) (citation \nomitted). A failure on any factor is a basis for denying \na preliminary injunction, regardless of the remaining \nfactors. Id.  \n\u201cA party . . . is not required to prove his case in full \nat a preliminary-injunction hearing,\u201d and the process \nordinarily entails procedures \u201cthat are less formal and \n[considered upon] evidence that is less complete than \nin a trial on the merits.\u201d Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, \n451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981). Despite considering the case \nat the early stages of the proceedings, to make the \nrequisite showings, a plaintiff seeking a preliminary \ninjunction generally cannot rely on mere allegations \nin the complaint but must come forward with some \nevidence showing a likelihood of success on the merits. \nSee Winter, 555 U.S. at 20\u201321.  \n Plaintiffs appealing the denial of a preliminary \ninjunction face an even higher burden as they must \nshow that the district court abused its discretion in \ndenying relief. Id. Under that familiar standard, \nhowever, the Court reviews de novo the district court\u2019s \nlegal conclusions, as a district court abuses its \ndiscretion \u201cwhen it misapprehends the law with \nrespect to the underlying issues in litigation.\u201d Id. at \n362 (cleaned up). But \u201c[o]ur mere disagreement with \nthe district court does not make its finding clearly \n22a\n\nerroneous\u201d and we are not concerned with \u201cwhether \nwe would have granted or denied the\u201d Parents\u2019 \nrequest.

The Free \nExercise Clause of the First Amendment to the \nConstitution, which is made applicable to States under \nthe Fourteenth Amendment, Kennedy v. Bremerton \nSch. Dist., 142 S.

Wilkinson, \n544 U.S. 709, 719 (2005). And in considering the \nclaims of religious adherents, the Supreme Court has \nreiterated that \u201creligious beliefs need not be \nacceptable, logical, consistent, or comprehensible to \nothers in order to merit First Amendment protection.\u201d \nThomas v. Rev. Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 714 (1981).9  \n \n9  \nWith limited exceptions not at issue here, courts do not \nquestion the sincerity of a plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs when \nassessing a free-exercise claim. See Thomas, 450 U.S. at 715\u201316 \n(\u201cOne can, of course, imagine an asserted claim so bizarre, so \nclearly nonreligious in motivation, as not to be entitled to \nprotection under the Free Exercise Clause; but . . . the guarantee \nof free exercise is not limited to beliefs which are shared by all of \n \n23a\n\n Many matters fall under the ambit of the Free \nExercise Clause, encompassing both direct and \nindirect coercion of religion.

As the \nSupreme Court has explained, \u201c[t]he government may \nnot compel affirmation of religious belief, punish the \nexpression of religious doctrines it believes to be false, \nimpose special disabilities on the basis of religious \nviews or religious status, or lend its power to one or \nthe other side in controversies over religious authority \nor dogma.\u201d Id. (internal citations omitted).   \nBut the Clause does more than protect \u201cthe right \nto harbor religious beliefs inwardly and secretly.\u201d \nKennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2421. It also safeguards \u201cthe \nability of those who hold religious beliefs of all kinds \nto live out their faiths in daily life through \u2018the \nperformance of (or abstention from) physical acts.\u2019\u201d Id. \n(quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at 877). Such \u201cphysical acts\u201d \ninclude \u201cassembling with others for a worship service, \nparticipating in sacramental use of bread and wine, \nproselytizing, [and] abstaining from certain foods or \ncertain modes of transportation.\u201d Smith, 494 U.S. at \n877.   \n \nthe members of a religious sect. . . . [And] [c]ourts are not arbiters \nof scriptural interpretation.\u201d).   \nAnd we do not question the sincerity of the Parents\u2019 religious \nviews. The question presented here is distinct\u2014whether they \nhave come forward with sufficient evidence at this stage to \nsuggest a likelihood of success on the merits of their claim that \ntheir and their children\u2019s free-exercise rights have been \ninfringed by the Board\u2019s policy not providing notice and an opt-\nout option when the Storybooks are used.  \n24a\n\nIn addition to safeguarding against such types of \ndirect coercion, the Clause also protects against \n\u201cindirect coercion or penalties on the free exercise of \nreligion.\u201d Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery Protective \nAss\u2019n, 485 U.S. 439, 450 (1988). Thus, for example, the \nFree Exercise Clause is implicated when government \naction treats religious adherents \u201cunequal[ly]\u201d or \n\u201cimpose[s] special disabilities on the basis of religious \nstatus.\u201d Trinity Lutheran Church of Columbia, Inc. v. \nComer, 137 S. Ct. 2012, 2019, 2021 (2017) (cleaned \nup). Indirect coercion can also occur when the \ngovernment \n\u201cdisqualif[ies] \notherwise \neligible \nrecipients from a public benefit solely because of their \nreligious character.\u201d Espinoza v. Mont. Dep\u2019t of \nRevenue, 140 S. Ct. 2246, 2255 (2020) (cleaned up).  \nWhile the Free Exercise Clause casts a wide net of \nprotection, it does so in a particular direction, being \n\u201cwritten in terms of what the government cannot do \nto the individual, not in terms of what the individual \ncan extract from the government.\u201d Bowen v. Roy, 476 \nU.S. 693, 700 (1986) (quoting Sherbert v. Verner, 374 \nU.S. 398, 412 (1963) (Douglas, J., concurring)). This \ndividing line \u201cbetween unconstitutional prohibitions \non the free exercise of religion,\u201d on the one hand, \u201cand \nthe legitimate conduct by government of its own \naffairs,\u201d on the other, can be imprecise. Lyng, 485 U.S. \nat 451. But the Supreme Court has consistently \nreaffirmed the line\u2019s existence: \u201cNever to our \nknowledge has the Court interpreted the First \nAmendment to require the Government itself to \nbehave in ways that the individual believes will \nfurther his or her spiritual development or that of his \nor her family.\u201d Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699; accord Lyng, \n485 U.S. at 450\u201351. Thus, as the Supreme Court has \nsaid in another context, \u201cthe Free Exercise Clause \n25a\n\ndoes not require an exemption from a governmental \nprogram unless, at a minimum, inclusion in the \nprogram actually burdens the claimant\u2019s freedom to \nexercise religious rights.\u201d Tony & Susan Alamo \nFound. v. Sec\u2019y of Labor, 471 U.S. 290, 303 (1985).  \nThese principles mean that regardless of the \nspecific nature of the government action at issue, a \nplaintiff alleging a free exercise claim bears the \nburden of \u201cdemonstrat[ing] an infringement of his \nrights under the Free Exercise . . . Clause[].\u201d Kennedy, \n142 S. Ct. at 2421. \u201cIf the plaintiff carries [that] \nburden[], the focus then shifts to the defendant to \nshow that its actions were nonetheless justified and \ntailored consistent with the demands of [governing] \ncase law.\u201d Id. Put another way, if the plaintiff has \nestablished that a government action has burdened \nhis religious exercise, then the analysis shifts to \nwhether the government can justify the limitation or \nintrusion under the applicable level of scrutiny. See \nChrist Coll., Inc. v. Bd. of Supervisors, No. 90-2406, \n1991 WL 179102, *4 (4th Cir. Sept. 13, 1991) \n(declining to resolve which level of scrutiny applied to \nappellants\u2019 claim because they \u201cfailed to establish the \nfirst element in any free exercise claim[:] they have \nnot proved that the [challenged laws] burden their \nexercise of religion\u201d).  \nMany times, the burden that a particular \ngovernment action places on a plaintiff\u2019s exercise of \nreligion will be obvious and require little comment. \nWhen a school district disciplines a public school \nfootball coach for personally praying after a game, \nthere is no dispute that the government action \n\u201cburdened\u201d the coach\u2019s religious practice of praying. \nKennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2422. Similarly, when a \n26a\n\ngovernment \nexcludes \ncertain \nentities \nfrom \nparticipating in a public benefit based on those \nentities\u2019 religious beliefs, it impermissibly, even if \nindirectly, penalizes them for their religious views. \nTrinity Lutheran, 137 S. Ct. at 2022. Regardless, the \nself-evident nature of proving the existence of a \nburden to religious practice in some cases does not \nexcuse a plaintiff from satisfying that obligation in \neach case.   \nThe Court\u2019s free exercise analysis does not end \nwith proving the existence of a burden on religious \nexercise, however, because \u201c[n]ot all burdens on \nreligion are unconstitutional.\u201d United States v. Lee, \n455 U.S. 252, 257 (1982). Governments may infringe \non an individual\u2019s religious practice under certain \ncircumstances. Id.   \nOver time, the Supreme Court has changed its \narticulation of what level of scrutiny applies to various \ntypes of laws. Under the currently applicable \nstandard set out in Employment Division v. Smith, the \nSupreme \nCourt \nheld \nthat \n\u201claws \nincidentally \nburdening religion are ordinarily not subject to strict \nscrutiny under the Free Exercise Clause so long as \nthey are neutral and generally applicable.\u201d10 Fulton, \n141 S.

For example, government action might not be \n\u201cneutral\u201d because it intentionally discriminates or \ntargets religious practice, Church of Lukumi Babalu \n \n11  In Smith, two individuals \u201cwere fired from their jobs . . . \nbecause they ingested peyote for sacramental purposes at a \nceremony of the Native American Church, of which both [were] \nmembers.\u201d 494 U.S. at 874.

Id. at 874\u201375. The upshot of the Supreme \nCourt\u2019s holding was that Oregon\u2019s criminal law did not violate \nthe Free Exercise Clause because it was a neutral, generally \napplicable prohibition of the ingestion of substances (including \npeyote) for any purpose, id. at 878\u201379, so the State could deny \nindividuals \u201cunemployment compensation when their dismissal \nresults from use of the drug,\u201d id. at 890.  \n28a\n\nAye, Inc., 508 U.S. at 532, or proceeds in a manner \nintolerant of religious beliefs or restricts practices \nbecause of their religious nature,\u201d Fulton, 141 S.

Mahmoud v. McKnight, Civ. No. DLB-23-1380, 2023 WL \n5487218, at *15 n.8 (D. Md. Aug. 24, 2023). The Parents have not \ntaken that position on appeal, though they do assert (Continued) \n \n29a\n\n \nthat some recent Supreme Court cases state that some laws \nimpose an \u201cinherent burden\u201d on religious exercise. Reply Br. 16.   \nWe have not seen any indication that the Supreme Court has \nreversed course on requiring a showing of a burden, so we \ncontinue to look for this threshold showing in a free exercise \nclaim. What has changed over time is how the Supreme Court \nhas articulated its free exercise analysis. Before Smith, courts \nrequired plaintiffs to show that a challenged government action \n\u201csubstantial[ly] burden[ed]\u201d religious exercise, at which point the \nanalysis shifted to whether the government showed a compelling \ninterest. Burwell, 573 U.S. at 693. The Supreme Court applied \nthis earlier framework in cases such as Yoder. 406 U.S. at 219\u2013\n21. Smith, however, \u201clargely repudiated the method of analyzing \nfree-exercise claims that had been used in cases like . . . Yoder\u201d \nby reformulating the relevant inquiry. Id. at 693\u201394; see also \nFirewalker-Fields v. Lee, 58 F.4th 104, 114 n.2 (4th Cir. 2023) \n(recognizing that free exercise cases (like Yoder) relying on a \n\u201csubstantial burden\u201d analysis were \u201coverruled 30 years ago\u201d by \nthe Supreme Court and yet this language continues to be carried \nforward in contexts such as prisoner-rights cases where it \n\u201cappears to be out-ofdate,\u201d but declining to resolve the open \nquestion because \u201cthe threshold standard [did] not matter\u201d for \npurposes of deciding the case).   \nAs noted earlier, under Smith\u2019s articulation of the free \nexercise standard, \u201claws incidentally burdening religion are \nordinarily not subject to strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise \nClause so long as they are neutral and generally applicable.\u201d \nFulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1876 (emphasis added) (citing Smith, 494 \nU.S. at 878\u201382). Thus, it is sufficient for our purposes to \nrecognize that even after Smith, a plaintiff\u2019s failure to show that \na challenged government action constitutes any burden on his \nreligious conduct makes it unnecessary to proceed further in the \nanalysis by determining or applying the appropriate level of \nscrutiny. See Kennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2421\u201322; cf. Navajo Nation \nv. U.S. Forest Serv., 535 F.3d 1058, 1076 (9th Cir. 2008) \n(recognizing \u201cthe Supreme Court\u2019s repeated practice of \nconcluding a government action \u2018prohibits\u2019 the free exercise of \nreligion by determining whether the action places a \u2018burden\u2019 on \nthe exercise of religion\u201d). \n30a\n\nsaid, they generally assert that the Board\u2019s failure to \nprovide notice and an opportunity to opt out of the \nStorybooks coerces, directly or indirectly, their own \nand their children\u2019s religious beliefs and practices by \nexposing them to viewpoints at odds with their \nreligious beliefs. To demonstrate this coercion, the \nParents principally rely on Yoder, equating their \nobjections to their children being \u201ccompel[led] . . . to \nparticipate in instruction prohibited by their faith,\u201d \nOpening Br. 24, to the Amish parents\u2019 successful \nobjections to Wisconsin\u2019s compulsory secondary \neducation laws in that case. They also maintain that \nthe Board\u2019s decision has coerced them by requiring \nthem to contradict their faith in order to access a \npublic benefit or avoid exposing their children to \nobjectionable views by incurring the costs of \nalternatives to public school.  \nTo recap briefly, to show a cognizable burden, the \nParents must show that the absence of an opt-out \nopportunity coerces them or their children to believe \nor act contrary to their religious views. This coercion \ncan be both direct or indirect, meaning that a burden \nexists \nwhenever \ngovernment \nconduct \neither \n\u201ccompel[s] a violation of conscience\u201d or \u201cput[s] \nsubstantial pressure on an adherent to modify his \nbehavior and to violate his beliefs.\u201d Thomas, 450 U.S. \nat 717\u201318 (emphasis omitted).  \n1. \n At the outset, we stress that our review is based \non a very limited record developed as attachments to \nthe amended complaint or filed in support and \nopposition to the motion for a preliminary injunction. \nThat record includes declarations from the Parents \noutlining their religious views and objecting to their \n31a\n\nchildren being exposed to ideas and being present \nduring \ndiscussions \ninvolving \nviewpoints \nthat \ncontradict their religious views. E.g., J.A. 404\u201305 \n(\u201cIntentionally exposing our . . . son to activities and \ncurriculum on sex, sexuality, and gender that \nundermine Islamic teaching on these subjects would . \n. . conflict with our religious duty to raise our children \nin accordance with our faith. . . . [F]orcing our son to \nparticipate in reading these books . . . would confuse \nhis religious upbringing.\u201d); J.A. 411\u201312 (\u201cHaving \n[teachers] teach principles about sexuality or gender \nidentity that conflict with our religious beliefs \nsignificantly interferes with our ability to form his \nreligious faith and religious outlook on life and is \nspiritually and emotionally harmful to his well-\nbeing.\u201d); J.A. 414 (\u201cWe believe that exposing our \nelementary-aged daughters to viewpoints on sex, \nsexuality, and gender that contradict Catholic \nteaching on these subjects is inappropriate and \nconflicts with our religious duty to raise our children \nin accordance with Catholic teaching.\u201d).13   \n \n13  The Parents also submitted a declaration from a non-party \nparent who is a member of plaintiff Kids First. But, as noted, \nKids First did not join the motion for a preliminary injunction.   \nIn addition, the Parents submitted a declaration from one of \ntheir attorneys to which they attached a Montgomery County \nelementary school newsletter from June 2023 announcing that \nas part of Pride Month, \u201c\u2018each day in June, classrooms will read \nan inclusive, LGBTQ+ friendly book\u2019 followed by a \u2018community \ncircle discussion.\u2019\u201d J.A. 416. It\u2019s not clear from the record, \nhowever, whether any of the Parents\u2019 children attend the specific \nelementary school that published this newsletter. Nor is there \ninformation about whether the readings actually took place or \nthe nature of any discussions that followed them.  \n32a\n\nIn opposition to the motion, the Board submitted a \ndeclaration from the Associate Superintendent \naddressing the adoption of the Storybooks and the \nevolution of the opt-out policy, which we recounted in \npart earlier.   \n Critically, however, none of these declarations \nprovides any information about how any teacher or \nschool employee has actually used any of the \nStorybooks in the Parents\u2019 children\u2019s classrooms, how \noften the Storybooks are actually being used, what \nany child has been taught in conjunction with their \nuse, or what conversations have ensued about their \nthemes.   \n None of the documentary evidence submitted to \nthe district court does so either. For example, the \nrecord contains emails between individual parents \nand school administrators regarding requests for opt-\nouts before the Board formally rejected that \nopportunity. It contains copies of the Storybooks and \nvarious Montgomery County Public School guidelines \nand curriculum goals. And it contains copies of at least \nsome of the additional materials we discussed earlier \nthat provided teachers and administrators with \nsuggested answers for how to respond to caregiver and \nstudent questions that might arise related to the \nStorybooks.  \nIn short, the record is threadbare.    \n2. \nThe Parents contend that the lack of an across-the-\nboard notice and an opt-out opportunity relating to \nthe Storybooks, in and of itself, coerces them and their \nchildren in the free exercise of their religion.   \n33a\n\nConsidering that broad claim joined with the \nextremely limited record, we conclude the Parents \nhave not shown a cognizable burden to support their \nfree exercise claim. As such, they have not shown a \nlikelihood of succeeding on the merits. Accordingly, \nthe district court did not err in denying them a \npreliminary injunction as to the free exercise claim.  \na.  \nAs an initial matter, there\u2019s no evidence at present \nthat the Board\u2019s decision not to permit opt-outs \ncompels the Parents or their children to change their \nreligious beliefs or conduct, either at school or \nelsewhere. See Hobbie v. Unemp. Appeals Comm\u2019n, \n480 U.S. 136, 140\u201341 (1987) (recognizing that coercion \noccurs when the government prescribes or proscribes \nreligiously motivated conduct). Although the Parents \nallege that the Board\u2019s decision not to provide notice \nand an opt-out option \u201cburdens [their] right to form \ntheir children on a matter of core religious exercise \nand parenting: how to understand who they are,\u201d J.A. \n35, they do not show anything at this point about the \nBoard\u2019s decision that affects what they teach their \nown children. For example, the Parents\u2019 declarations \ndo not suggest, nor does the existing record show, that \nthe Parents or their children have in fact been asked \nto affirm views contrary to their own views on gender \nor sexuality, to disavow views on these matters that \ntheir religion espouses, or otherwise affirmatively act \nin violation of their religious beliefs. We have no basis \nin the current record for concluding that schools have \nacted \ninconsistent \nwith \nthe \nAssistant \nSuperintendent\u2019s declaration that \u201cno student or \nadult is asked to change how they feel about these \nissues.\u201d J.A. 541. Instead, as the district court \n34a\n\nobserved, \u201c[t]he [P]arents still may instruct their \nchildren on their religious beliefs regarding sexuality, \nmarriage, and gender, and each family may place \ncontrary views in its religious context.\u201d Mahmoud, \n2023 WL 5487218, at *22. And \u201c[n]o government \naction prevents the parents from freely discussing the \ntopics raised in the [S]torybooks with their children or \nteaching their children as they wish.\u201d Id.  \nb.  \nThe Parents do not really take issue with the \nforegoing conclusion; instead, they argue that the \nBoard\u2019s decision nonetheless coerces religious exercise \nby compelling them to expose their children to views \nthat are at odds with their religious faith. E.g., \nOpening Br. 3 (asserting that they are being coerced \ninto \u201cexposing their children to the . . . Storybooks and \nrelated instruction\u201d). Thus, it\u2019s the effect of the Board\u2019s \nfailure to grant an opt-out opportunity\u2014that children \nmust be present when teachers use the Storybooks in \ntheir classrooms or have conversations related to their \nthemes\u2014that the Parents oppose.  \nBut as previously discussed, Supreme Court \nprecedent requires some sort of direct or indirect \npressure to abandon religious beliefs or affirmatively \nact contrary to those beliefs. E.g., Lyng, 485 U.S. at \n450. And simply hearing about other views does not \nnecessarily exert pressure to believe or act differently \nthan one\u2019s religious faith requires. E.g., Cal. Parents \nfor the Equalization of Educ. Materials v. Torlakson, \n973 F.3d 1010, 1020 (9th Cir. 2020) (finding no \ncognizable burden to religious exercise because the \ncurriculum the plaintiffs claimed to be \u201coffensive to \ntheir religious beliefs\u201d \u201cd[id] not penalize, interfere \nwith, or otherwise burden religious exercise\u201d); Parker \n35a\n\nv. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87, 90, 106 (1st Cir. 2008) (finding \nno cognizable burden from the lack of notice or the \nopportunity to opt out from children\u2019s \u201cexposure to \nbooks\u201d that espouse views contrary to their religious \nfaith when there was no evidence the school required \n\u201cstudent[s] [to] agree with or affirm those ideas, or \neven participate in discussions about them\u201d (emphasis \nadded)); Mozert v. Hawkins Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 827 \nF.2d 1058, 1065 (6th Cir. 1987) (finding no cognizable \nburden from assignments involving reading materials \nthat contradicted the plaintiff-parents and their \nchildren\u2019s religious views because those assignments \ndid not compel the students to \u201cengage in conduct that \nviolated \n[their] \nreligious \nconvictions\u201d \nsuch \nas \n\u201caffirmation or denial or a religious belief, or \nperformance or non-performance of a religious \nexercise or practice\u201d). In the absence of that coercive \neffect, a government action does not burden religious \nexercise.14  \nTo contend otherwise the Parents rely extensively \non Yoder, asserting that their religious rights have \nbeen burdened for the same reasons the Supreme \nCourt identified a free exercise violation in that case: \n \n14  The dissenting opinion distinguishes these cases and \nothers like them by asserting that this case involves \u201cuse . . . far \nbeyond mere exposure to objectionable viewpoints,\u201d post, at 58 & \nn.2, but the threadbare record developed to date does not support \nthat (Continued) conclusion. As discussed, the contents of the \nbooks vary considerably as does their potential method of use \nwithin classrooms and the nature of any subsequent \nconversations. Until those dots can be shorn up, there\u2019s no \nreasonable likelihood that the Parents can prevail on their \nassertion that the inability to opt out of the Storybooks violates \ntheir free exercise rights.  \n \n36a\n\ntheir children are being compelled to attend classroom \ninstruction that violates their religious views. This \nargument that compelled presence or exposure \nnecessarily establishes the existence of a burden relies \non too expansive a reading of Yoder, a case which has \nbeen markedly circumscribed within free exercise \nprecedent in the decades since it was decided.  \nIn Yoder, \u201cthe Court held that Amish children \ncould not be required to comply with a state law \ndemanding that they remain in school until the age of \n16 even though their religion required them to focus \non uniquely Amish values and beliefs during their \nformative adolescent years.\u201d Burwell, 573 U.S. at 694 \n(citing Yoder, 406 U.S. at 210\u201311, 234\u201336). Building \non a record that the Supreme Court recognized \n\u201cprobably few other religious groups or sects could\u201d \ndevelop, 406 U.S. at 236, the Court concluded that the \nAmish parents had demonstrated why requiring their \nchildren to attend formal secondary education \ncompelled both the parents and their children \u201cto \nperform acts undeniably at odds with fundamental \ntenets of their religious beliefs.\u201d Id. at 218. Against \nthat record, the Court observed that the state had not \ncome forward with evidence that would justify \noverriding the burden imposed on the Amish parents \nand their children by requiring them  to attend formal \nsecondary education. Id. at 236; accord Lyng, 485 U.S. \nat 456\u201357 (discussing the state\u2019s failure of proof in \nYoder and reiterating that the compulsory attendance \nlaw was impermissibly \u201ccoercive in nature\u201d because \nformal secondary education was \u201ccontrary to the \nAmish religion and way of life\u201d (citation omitted)).   \nAs the Supreme Court itself recognized in Yoder, \nits holding was tailored to the specific evidence in that \n37a\n\nrecord \nregarding \nhow \nWisconsin\u2019s \ncompulsory \nsecondary education law would have \u201cinescapabl[y]\u201d \ncoerced the Amish to act or believe in violation of their \nreligious views. 406 U.S. at 218. In the decades since \nYoder was decided, other circuit courts of appeals \nhave expressed a similar understanding of its limited \nholding, connecting its discussion to the unique record \nestablished concerning the Amish faith\u2019s rejection of \nformal secondary education as a whole. Cf. Combs v. \nHomer-Ctr. Sch. Dist., 540 F.3d 231, 250 (3d Cir. 2008) \n(\u201cParents favor a broad reading of Yoder and insist \nthat it applies to all citizens. But Yoder\u2019s reach is \nrestricted by the Court\u2019s limiting language and the \nfacts suggesting an exceptional burden imposed on \nthe plaintiffs.\u201d); Parker, 514 F.3d at 100 (\u201cTellingly, \nYoder emphasized that its holding was essentially sui \ngeneris, as few sects could make a similar showing of \na unique and demanding religious way of life that is \nfundamentally incompatible with any schooling \nsystem.\u201d); Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1067 (\u201cYoder rested on \nsuch a singular set of facts that we do not believe it \ncan be held to announce a general rule that exposure \nwithout compulsion to act, believe, affirm or deny \ncreates an unconstitutional burden.\u201d).15  \nBased on the Supreme Court\u2019s limiting language \nand confirmed by the views of our sister circuits, we \n \n15  We have previously recognized how dependent Yoder\u2019s \nanalysis was on the unique record established in that case, \nincluding the unusual degree of separation from modern life that \nthe Amish religious faith compels, though we applied the pre-\nSmith balancing test and decided the case based on the state\u2019s \noverriding interests in enforcing the law. Duro v. Dist. Att\u2019y, 712 \nF.2d 96, 97\u201399 (4th Cir. 1983) (rejecting a Pentecostal parent\u2019s \nchallenge to North Carolina\u2019s compulsory attendance law).  \n38a\n\nconclude that Yoder does not support the Parents\u2019 \nargument that potential use of the Storybooks \nresulting in exposure to views contrary to one\u2019s own \nreligious beliefs necessarily constitutes a cognizable \nburden on their free exercise of religion. Instead, in \nYoder, the Supreme Court applied a narrower \nprinciple to a singular set of facts. That narrower \nprinciple is whether the challenged government \naction \u201caffirmatively compel[led] them, under threat \nof criminal sanction, to perform acts undeniably at \nodds with fundamental tenets of their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 218 (emphasis added); \naccord United States v. Ali, 682 F.3d 705, 711 (8th Cir. \n2012) (\u201c[A]n order requiring someone either to act \naffirmatively in violation of a sincerely held religious \nbelief or face criminal penalties substantially burdens \nthe free exercise of religion.\u201d (citing Yoder, 406 U.S. at \n234\u201336)). And, as already set out, the existing record \ndoes not show that mere exposure to the Storybooks is \n\u201caffirmatively compel[ling]\u201d the Parents or their \nchildren \u201cto perform acts undeniably at odds with\u201d \ntheir religious views. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 218.  \nOur understanding of Yoder and what constitutes \na cognizable burden is also consistent with the \nSupreme Court\u2019s recognition that the Free Exercise \nClause does not force \u201cthe Government itself to behave \nin ways that [an] individual believes will further his \nor her spiritual development or that of his or her \nfamily.\u201d Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699. Drawing on this \nprinciple, courts of appeals have rejected free exercise \nchallenges to public school curriculum and requests to \nopt out of materials based on complaints limited to the \ncontention that the materials express views and \nexpose students to content deemed to be religiously \nobjectionable. E.g., Parker, 514 F.3d at 105\u201306 \n39a\n\n(rejecting parents\u2019 request for notice and an opt-out \nopportunity from occasional readings that offended \ntheir religious views); Leebaert v. Harrington, 332 \nF.3d 134, 141 (2d Cir. 2003) (rejecting parent\u2019s request \nto opt out child from portions of a public school\u2019s \nhealth curriculum that he asserted contradicted his \nreligious values and those he wanted to impart to his \nchild because there\u2019s no \u201cfundamental right . . . to tell \na public school what his or her child will and will not \nbe taught\u201d \u201cat the public school to which [he] ha[s] \nchosen to send [his] child\u201d (citation omitted)). All this \nis to say that exposure to objectionable material alone \nwill not ordinarily pose a burden on an individual\u2019s \nfree exercise of religion because it lacks the requisite \ncompulsion or pressure on an individual\u2019s religious \nbeliefs or conduct. Instead, claims based on exposure \ntend to fall outside the scope of the Free Exercise \nClause because they seek to \u201crequire the Government \nto conduct its own internal affairs\u201d\u2014here, public \nschool curriculum choices\u2014\u201cin ways that comport \nwith the religious beliefs of particular citizens.\u201d \nBowen, 476 U.S. at 699.   \nResisting this conclusion, the Parents point to \ntheir children\u2019s young ages and impressionability in \ncontending that mere exposure necessarily amounts to \ncoercion. In considering that argument, we are \nmindful that the Storybooks are intended for use with \nelementary-age children\u2014including children in pre-\nKindergarten and Head Start (younger than five \nyears\u2019 old).16 The Supreme Court has recognized that \n \n16  We also acknowledge the declaration of one non-party parent \n(but member of non-movant party Kids First) residing in \nMontgomery County whose child has been diagnosed with Down \n \n40a\n\nelementary-age students are more likely to be \nimpressionable than teenagers and adults when \nanalyzing Establishment Clause claims in the school \ncontext. See Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. 577, 592 (1992) \n(\u201c[T]here are heightened concerns with protecting \nfreedom of conscience from subtle coercive pressure in \nthe elementary and secondary public schools.\u201d). It \nwould likewise be a \u201cheightened concern[]\u201d when \nconsidering a free exercise claim. Id.; see Parker, 514 \nF.3d at 101 (\u201cWe see no principled reason why the age \nof students should be irrelevant in Free Exercise \nClause cases.\u201d). Upon a proper showing in the district \ncourt, it may be that the Parents can come forward \nwith sufficient evidence that an elementary-age \nchild\u2019s exposure to the Storybooks and related \nconversations amounts to coercion.   \nIt is not our station to determine the pedagogical \nor childhood-development value of the Storybooks or \nthe related topics. Our charge as judges is to ascertain \nwhether the Parents have shown a likelihood of \nsuccess on their free exercise claim, which would \nrequire them to show direct or indirect coercion \narising out of the exposure.  \nAt present, however, no evidence in the record \nconnects the requisite dots between the Parents\u2019 \nchildren\u2019s ages or mental capacity and their unknown \nexposure to the Storybooks to conclude that the \nParents have already shown that a cognizable burden \nexists. Given that such a conclusion would cut against \nthe weight of legal authority and in the absence of a \n \nSyndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder and thus has \nvulnerabilities from mere exposure that may be akin to those \nthat could be shown to exist with the particularly young.  \n41a\n\nrecord supporting the Parents\u2019 assertions that their \nchildren\u2019s religious training would be compromised \nfrom every exposure to the Storybooks and related \ndiscussions, we cannot reach such a conclusion now.   \nIn like manner, the Parents\u2019 remaining arguments \nrelated to coercion in the classroom all suffer from a \nlack of proof in the record. They advance several ways \nin which educators could use the Storybooks to \nindoctrinate their children into espousing views at \nodds with their religious training at home and \nelsewhere. For example, one of the Parents\u2019 \ndeclarations explained that it would burden their \nchildren\u2019s religious views to \u201cpry[] into others\u2019 private \nlives and [en]courage[] public disclosure of sexual \nbehavior\u201d by \u201cdiscuss[ing] romantic relationships or \nsexuality with schoolteachers or classmates.\u201d J.A. \n404. Another declaration objects to teaching that \nwould \u201cdismiss parental and religious guidance on \nthese issues.\u201d J.A. 415. And the Parents\u2019 briefs to this \nCourt express their objections to teachers \u201cinvit[ing] \nchildren to question their gender identity, or to \nencourage \nyoung \nchildren \nto \nembrace \ngender \ntransitioning.\u201d Opening Br. 12.  \nWe understand the Parents\u2019 contention that the \nStorybooks could be used in ways that would confuse \nor \nmislead \nchildren \nand, \nin \nparticular, \nthat \ndiscussions relating to their contents could be used to \nindoctrinate their children into espousing views that \nare contrary to their religious faith. But none of that \nis verified by the limited record that is before us. The \nrecord does not show how the Storybooks are actually \nbeing used in classrooms (and more specifically the \nParents\u2019 children\u2019s classrooms). It does not provide \nexamples of any required discussion points or actual \n42a\n\nconversations that have occurred related to their use. \nNor does it reflect whether any of the answers from \nthe additional materials have ever been used.  \nA more developed record or tailored argument \nmight shift the analysis, as is true in many free \nexercise cases. Much will depend on how the record \ndevelops. Proof that discussions are pressuring \nstudents to recast their own religious views\u2014as \nopposed to merely being exposed to the differing \nviewpoints of others\u2014could serve as evidence that the \nStorybooks are being used in a coercive manner. The \nParents are concerned that some of the additional \nmaterials provided to the schools could lead to \nconversations of this kind. Many teachers and \nprincipals had similar objections based on pedagogical \nconcerns \nabout \nage \nappropriateness \nand \ndismissiveness to religious beliefs. Those materials, \nfor example, suggested that teachers \u201c[d]isrupt [a \nstudent\u2019s] either/or thinking\u201d when responding to \ntheir questions or comments about what relationships \nare proper or how individuals of a particular sex \nshould dress or groom. J.A. 595, 597 (emphasis \nadded). Those sorts of conversations, if occurring, may \nveer into the sort of pressures that could constitute \ncoercion, particularly to young children.   \nThat said, we cannot simply assume the contents \nof any conversations that have already or will in the \nfuture cross the line and pressure students to change \ntheir views or act contrary to their faith. Given the \nsparse record, we do not know whether these \nconversations stick to Language Arts purposes, if \nconversations about the Storybooks\u2019 characters and \nthemes simply expose students to viewpoints the \nParents find objectionable, or if discussions have \n43a\n\ndiverted into subtle or not-so-subtle indoctrination \nthat pressures students to act or believe contrary to \ntheir religious upbringing. These gaps in the record \nleave considerable room for development between \nwhat\u2019s been alleged to date and what the Parents may \nbe able to prove after discovery.  \nShould the Parents in this case or other plaintiffs \nin other challenges to the Storybooks\u2019 use come \nforward with proof that a teacher or school \nadministrator is using the Storybooks in a manner \nthat directly or indirectly coerces children into \nchanging their religious views or practices, then the \nanalysis would shift in light of that record. Accord \nZorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. 306, 311 (1952) \n(recognizing that although there was no evidence of \ncoercion \u201cin the record before us,\u201d \u201ca wholly different \ncase would be presented\u201d upon such a showing). But \nat this stage in the litigation, we have a very limited \nrecord to assess an extremely broad claim. It does not \nshow the existence of a cognizable burden on the \nParents\u2019 or their children\u2019s free exercise rights.  \n3.  \nTo the extent the Parents rely on cases recognizing \nthe existence of a burden based on the denial of access \nto public benefits as the basis for showing a cognizable \nburden, their argument fails. See, e.g., Opening Br. 20 \n(asserting the lack of notice and an opt-out option \n\u201cpressure[s] the Parents to violate their religious \nbeliefs as a condition of using the public schools\u201d).   \nThe \nFree \nExercise \nClause \nhas \nlong \nbeen \nunderstood to \u201cprotect[] religious observers against \nunequal \ntreatment,\u201d \nmeaning \nthat \nreligious \nadherents cannot be \u201cdisqualif[ied] . . . from a public \n44a\n\nbenefit \u2018solely because of their religious character.\u2019\u201d \nEspinoza, 140 S. Ct. at 2254\u201355 (quoting Trinity \nLutheran, 137 S. Ct. at 2021); Carson ex rel. O.C. v. \nMakin, 142 S. Ct. 1987, 1996 (2022) (\u201c[W]e have \nrepeatedly held that a State violates the Free Exercise \nClause when it excludes religious observers from \notherwise available public benefits.\u201d). Consistent with \nthat \nunderstanding, \nthe \nSupreme \nCourt \nhas \nrepeatedly rejected claims by the government that \nexclusion from public benefits does not constitute a \nburden on free exercise. E.g., Trinity Lutheran, 137 S. \nCt. at 2022 (observing that placing a condition that \nrequires a religious entity \u201cto disavow its religious \ncharacter\u201d \u201cto participate in a government benefit \nprogram\u201d constitutes a burden because it indirectly \ncoerces or impermissibly penalizes \u201cthe free exercise \nof religion\u201d).   \nWhile public schools are undeniably a \u201cpublic \nbenefit,\u201d the foregoing line of cases involved barriers \nto access to a public benefit that have not been shown \nat present in this case. Specifically, the government \nactors in each of those cases overtly barred religious \nadherents from eligibility to participate in the benefit \nbecause of the plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs or unless the \nplaintiff agreed to act in contradiction to his religious \nbeliefs. See, e.g., Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1875\u201376 \n(recognizing that the city\u2019s refusal to enter into a full \nfoster care contract with a Catholic agency that would \nnot place children with unmarried couples of any \nsexual orientation or same-sex married couples \n\u201cburdened [the agency\u2019s] religious exercise by putting \nit to the choice of curtailing its mission or approving \nrelationships inconsistent with its beliefs\u201d).   \n45a\n\nIn contrast, the Montgomery County Public \nSchools are open to all students who meet the \nrequirements for enrollment, none of which relate to \nthe religious affiliation or beliefs of students or their \nparents. The Board is not directly or indirectly \npenalizing the Parents by requiring them to disavow \ntheir religious views before they can send their \nchildren to public school. Consequently, any burden \non the Parents\u2019 or their children\u2019s free exercise rights \nwould only occur once the students are enrolled, based \non what happens while at school. In sum, this line of \ncases does not provide a basis for concluding, at this \npoint, that the Board has burdened the Parents\u2019 \nreligious exercise rights, and the analysis of whether \nthey are being coerced once there falls under the \nordinary coercion analysis already undertaken.  \nThe Parents raise the related argument that the \nBoard\u2019s conduct is coercive because to avoid exposing \ntheir children to the Storybooks and related \ndiscussion, they would be forced to incur the \nadditional (and in some cases prohibitive) cost of \npursuing an alternative to public schooling. Without \nquestion, the Constitution protects the Parents\u2019 \nability to avoid exposing their children to any \nreligiously objectionable materials by protecting their \nright to choose alternatives such as a private school. \nRunyon v. McCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 178 (1976) \n(reiterating that parents and guardians \u201chave a \nconstitutional right to send their children to private \nschools and a constitutional right to select private \nschools that offer specialized instruction\u201d).17 And, \n \n17  The Supreme Court has recognized that the Constitution \nprotects a parent or guardian\u2019s fundamental right not only \u201cto \n \n46a\n\nunderstandably, the Parents lament that they would \nhave to incur additional costs, which may make these \nalternatives prohibitive. As Justice Alito has put it, \n\u201c[m]ost parents, realistically, have no choice but to \nsend their children to a public school and little ability \nto influence what occurs in the school.\u201d Morse v. \nFrederick, 551 U.S. 393, 424 (2007) (Alito, J., \nconcurring). But the Supreme Court and this Court \nhave previously recognized that government coercion \ndoes not exist merely because an individual may incur \nincreased costs as a consequence of deciding to \nexercise their religious faith in a particular way. See, \ne.g., Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, 605\u201306 (1961) \n(rejecting a free exercise challenge to a state\u2019s Sunday-\nclosure law because it did not \u201cmake a religious \n \ndirect the upbringing and education of children under their care,\u201d \nPierce v. Soc\u2019y of the Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus & Mary, \n268 U.S. 510, 534\u201335 (1925), but also to \u201cgive them religious \ntraining and to encourage them in the practice of religious \nbelief,\u201d Prince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 165 (1944) \n(emphasis added).   \nThis principle expressly includes the right to choose private, \nreligious education. Parents for Priv. v. Barr, 949 F.3d 1210, \n1229 (9th Cir. 2020) (tracing the Supreme Court\u2019s cases \ndiscussing parents\u2019 rights \u201cto make decisions concerning the \ncare, custody, and control of their children,\u201d including the right \nto choose \u201ca specific educational program\u2014 whether it be \nreligious instruction at a private school\u201d or something else \n(citations omitted)). In addition, although the Supreme Court \nhas never expressly so held, these cases also implicitly protect \nthe Parents\u2019 constitutional right to homeschool as well. (And, in \nany (Continued) event, Maryland law specifically protects that \nright. See Md. Code, Educ. \u00a7 7-301(a)(3); Md. Code Regs. \n13A.10.01.01.)   \n \n \n47a\n\npractice itself unlawful\u201d or otherwise force the \nplaintiffs to \u201cforsak[e] their religious practices\u201d even \nthough the law \u201cmay well result in some financial \nsacrifice in order to observe their religious beliefs\u201d); \nD.L. ex rel. K.L. v. Balt. City Bd. of Sch. Comm\u2019rs, 706 \nF.3d 256, 263 (4th Cir. 2013) (rejecting a free exercise \nchallenge where the plaintiffs \u201cretain[ed] full \ndiscretion over which school [their child] attends\u201d \neven if exercising that right increased the \u201coverall \ncost\u201d of education because \u201c[t]he Supreme Court has \nexplained that a statute does not violate the Free \nExercise Clause merely because it causes economic \ndisadvantage on individuals who choose to practice \ntheir religion in a specific manner\u201d); Goodall ex rel. \nGoodall v. Stafford Cnty. Sch. Bd., 60 F.3d 168, 171 \n(4th Cir. 1995) (same). Accordingly, such potential \nadditional costs do not create a cognizable burden \neven if the choice places the Parents in an undesired\u2014\nbut not unconstitutionally coercive\u2014position.  \n* * * * \nFor the reasons stated, we conclude that the \nParents have not come forward at this stage with \nsufficient evidence of a cognizable burden on their free \nexercise rights to satisfy the requirements of a free \nexercise claim. This absence of proof means that they \nhave not shown a likelihood of success on the merits \nand their free exercise claim cannot serve as a basis \nfor obtaining a preliminary injunction. The Parents, \nlike any litigant, may choose their particular \nlitigation strategy. And here they chose to bring their \nmotion \nfor \na \npreliminary \ninjunction \nwithout \ndeveloping a robust record in pursuit of a broadly \narticulated free exercise challenge. The Parents are \nstuck with the consequences of that choice and its \n48a\n\neffect on their appeal from the denial of a preliminary \ninjunction.  \nThe dissenting opinion raises many good points as \nit mirrors the Parents\u2019 concerns that using the \nStorybooks will transgress the line between mere \nexposure, on the one hand, and indirect coercion, on \nthe other hand. But facts and circumstances that \ncould lead to a constitutional violation if assembled a \nparticular way are not the same as facts and \ncircumstances that show a likelihood of violating the \nConstitution. And what is missing here is the \nevidentiary link showing that the Storybooks are \nbeing implemented in a way that directly or indirectly \ncoerces the Parents or their children to believe or act \ncontrary to their religious faith. Without such \nevidence, this case presents only an objection to their \nchildren\u2019s public school curriculum. Granting a \npreliminary injunction here would reset the standard, \npermitting \nplaintiffs \nto \nobtain \na \npreliminary \ninjunction upon a mere showing that they have a \nreligious objection to their children\u2019s curriculum. The \ncase law does not support that outcome.   \nPut simply, we cannot conclude that a policy \nrequiring the presence of an individual in the \nclassroom when these materials may be read ipso \nfacto creates an impermissibly coercive environment. \nMore specific information about the implementation \nof the Storybooks would be required to establish a \ncognizable burden that would shift the analysis to \nwhat level of scrutiny applies and whether the Board\u2019s \ndecision can withstand that review. We\u2019re simply not \nthere now. As such, the Parents have not shown that \nthe Board\u2019s failure to provide notice and an opt-out \n49a\n\nopportunity creates a likelihood of violating their free-\nexercise rights.18  \nIV. \n Lastly, we note that the Parents have not asserted \nthat their due process claim would entitle them to a \npreliminary injunction independent of their free \nexercise claim. That\u2019s so because their argument is \npredicated on the assumption that their due process \nclaim should be reviewed under strict scrutiny. But \nmost due process challenges to public school policies \nare subject only to rational basis review. See Herndon \nex rel. Herndon v. Chapel Hill-Carrboro City Bd. of \nEduc., 89 F.3d 174, 177\u201379 (4th Cir. 1996). Their \nargument that strict scrutiny applies to their due \nprocess claim rests on a hybrid-rights theory where \nheightened scrutiny may be appropriate when a due \nprocess claim involving parents\u2019 rights related to the \neducation of their children is \u201ccoupled with\u201d a \nreligious-exercise claim. Opening Br. 44; see Combs, \n \n18  Further factual development would also be necessary as to \nthe factual predicates for some of the Parents\u2019 arguments about \nwhy strict scrutiny should apply. For example, we cannot \nascertain on the record before us whether the Board acted with \nimpermissible hostility to religious views in deciding to no longer \npermit notice and an opt-out opportunity relating to the \nStorybooks, so as to fall under the Church of the Lukumi Babalu \nAye and Masterpiece Cakeshop line of analysis. As already \ndiscussed, very little is known about that process but as alleged \nin the amended complaint, it appears to have been a quick about-\nface with little consideration. In addition, the Parents have \nbundled together a handful of statements made during and \noutside of Board meetings, both before and after the decision to \ndisallow opt-outs. Therefore, discovery may also shed more light \non those comments and whether religious animus fueled the \nBoard\u2019s decision to disallow notice and an opt-out opportunity.  \n50a\n\n540 F.3d at 243\u201347 (discussing the hybrid-rights \ntheory first discussed in Smith, which \u201chas divided \nour sister circuits\u201d ever since). To date, the validity of \nthe hybrid-rights approach remains an open question \nin this Court, but we need not provide an answer \ntoday. Regardless of the underlying merits of a \nhybrid-rights due process claim, it could only be the \nbasis for a preliminary injunction if the Parents\u2019 free \nexercise claims were also likely to succeed on the \nmerits. E.g., Parents for Priv., 949 F.3d at 1237 \n(\u201c[A]lleging multiple failing constitutional claims that \ndo not have a likelihood of success on the merits \ncannot be enough to invoke a hybrid rights exception \nand require strict scrutiny.\u201d). Insomuch as we have \nconcluded that at this time the Parents have not \nsatisfied their burden of showing a likelihood of \nsuccess as to their free exercise claims, they could not \nshow that their due process claim sets out a hybrid-\nrights due process claim that would be subject to strict \nscrutiny. They do not contend that they would be \nlikely to succeed on the merits of a due process claim \nsubject to rational basis review. Accordingly, the \ndistrict court did not abuse its discretion in denying a \npreliminary injunction as to the Parents\u2019 due process \nclaim.   \nV.  \n For the reasons set out above, we agree with the \ndistrict court that the Parents have not satisfied the \nextraordinary \nshowing \nnecessary \nto \nobtain \na \npreliminary injunction. Therefore, we affirm the \ndistrict court\u2019s order denying the Parents\u2019 motion.  \nAFFIRMED \n \n51a\n\nQUATTLEBAUM, Circuit Judge, dissenting:  \n  This case involves the intersection of a school \nboard\u2019s decision to deny religious opt outs for \ninstruction involving certain books selected for K-5 \nchildren to promote diversity and inclusion\u2014here, as \nto the LGBTQ+ community\u2014and parents\u2019 claims that \nforcing these books on their children infringes on their \nreligious rights under the Constitution to direct their \nchildren\u2019s upbringing with respect to sexuality and \ngender. At this intersection, emotions run high. And \nmake no mistake about it, both sides of the issue \nadvance passionate arguments. Some insist diversity \nand inclusion should be prioritized over the religious \nrights of parents and children. Others argue the \nopposite.    \nTo judges, whether it is a good or bad idea for a \nboard to use these texts in teaching K-5 children is \nirrelevant. We deal with law, not policy. And the legal \nquestion we face is whether the board\u2019s actions violate \nparents\u2019 First Amendment free exercise rights. As to \nthat question, generally, courts have recognized a \nlocal \nschool \nboard\u2019s \nbroad \ndiscretion \nin \nthe \nmanagement of affairs and curriculum. Bd. of Educ., \nIsland Trees Union Free Sch. Dist. No. 26 v. Pico, 457 \nU.S. 853, 863 (1982). But that deference is not \nabsolute. School decisions\u2014even as to curriculum\u2014\nmust comply with the \u201ctranscendent imperatives of \nthe First Amendment.\u201d Id. at 864. The First \nAmendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause prohibits a \ngovernment entity from burdening \u201csincere religious \npractice[s] pursuant to a policy that is not \u2018neutral\u2019 or \n\u2018generally applicable.\u2019\u201d Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. \nDist., 597 U.S. 507, 525 (2022).   \n52a\n\nHere, the parents of certain K-5 children in \nMontgomery County public schools moved for a \npreliminary injunction enjoining the Montgomery \nCounty Board of Education\u2019s decision to deny religious \nopt-out requests for instruction to K-5 children \ninvolving the texts designed to promote diversity and \ninclusivity as to the LGBTQ+ community. The district \ncourt denied the motion, finding the parents failed to \nestablish that the board burdened their First \nAmendment rights.   \nI disagree. The parents have shown the board\u2019s \ndecision to deny religious opt-outs burdened these \nparents\u2019 right to exercise their religion and direct the \nreligious upbringing of their children by putting them \nto the choice of either compromising their religious \nbeliefs or foregoing a public education for their \nchildren. I also find that the board\u2019s actions, at least \nunder this record, were neither neutral nor generally \napplicable. \nFinally, \nI \nfind \nthe \nparents \nhave \nestablished the other requirements for a preliminary \ninjunction. So, I would reverse the district court and \nenjoin the Montgomery County School Board of \nEducation from denying religious opt-outs for \ninstruction to K-5 children involving the texts.   \nI.  Background \nIn the Fall of 2022, in an effort to make its \ncurriculum more representative of and inclusive to \nstudents and families in its county, the Montgomery \nCounty School Board of Education approved several \nbooks it described as \u201cLGBTQ-inclusive texts\u201d for use \nin preKindergarten through middle school classrooms \nas part of the English Language Arts Curriculum.  For \nexample, one of these books is Pride Puppy!, a story \nabout a Pride Day parade. Pride Puppy! invites \n53a\n\nreaders to search for depictions of terms like \u201c[drag] \nqueen,\u201d \u201c[drag] king\u201d and \u201cintersex\u201d among other \nvocabulary words. J.A. 98. The school district \napproved this book for pre-Kindergarten and Head \nStart classrooms\u2014in other words, for three- and four-\nyear-olds. Other books include stories about a planned \nsame-sex marriage, a transgender child\u2019s rainbow-\ncolored wig and elementary school students deciding \nto replace girl/boy bathroom signs with non-binary \nsigns.   \nThe school board provided more than these books; \nit \nalso \nprovided \nmaterials \nfor \nteachers \nand \nadministrators to use in responding to questions from \nstudents. These materials indicate that if a student \nsays \u201cBeing _____ (gay, lesbian, queer, etc) is wrong \nand not allowed in my religion,\u201d school officials \u201ccan \nrespond\u201d by saying, \u201cI understand that is what you \nbelieve, but not everyone believes that. We don\u2019t have \nto understand or support a person\u2019s identity to treat \nthem with respect and kindness.\u201d J.A. 595. The \nmaterials also indicate that if a student says that \u201ca \ngirl . . . can only like boys because she\u2019s a girl,\u201d the \nschool employee can \u201c[d]isrupt the either/or thinking \nby saying something like: actually, people of any \ngender can like whoever they like. . . . How do you \nthink it would make_(character\u2019s name)__to hear you \nsay that? Do you think it\u2019s fair for people to decide for \nus who we can and can\u2019t like?\u201d J.A. 595. And if a \nstudent asks what it means to be transgender, the \nschool board proposed this response: \u201cWhen we\u2019re \nborn, people make a guess about our gender and label \nus \u2018boy\u2019 or \u2018girl\u2019 based on our body parts. Sometimes \nthey\u2019re right and sometimes they\u2019re wrong. . . . Our \nbody parts do not decide our gender. Our gender \ncomes from our inside\u2026.\u201d J.A. 596.  \n54a\n\nThe \nschool \nboard \nalso \nprovided \nsuggested \nresponses to concerns raised by parents. If parents \nquestion whether the texts are age-appropriate, \nmaterials provided by the school board suggest that \nteachers could respond that \u201c[c]hildren are already \nlearning about\u201d gender and sexuality identity because \n\u201c[m]essages about gender are everywhere\u201d and that \n\u201c[b]eginning these conversations in elementary school \nwill help young people develop empathy for a diverse \ngroup of people and learn about identities that might \nrelate to their families or even themselves.\u201d J.A. 600. \nAnd if a parent complains that values in the books \u201cgo \nagainst the values we are instilling . . . at home,\u201d the \nmaterials indicate that teachers could respond that \n\u201c[t]he purpose of learning about gender and sexual[] \nidentity diversity is to demonstrate that children are \nunique and that there is no single way to be a boy, girl, \nor any other gender. If a child does not agree with or \nunderstand another student\u2019s . . . identity . . . , they do \nnot have to change how they feel about it.\u201d J.A. 601.  \nParents of certain K-5 Montgomery County school \nchildren object to their children being instructed with \nthese books. These parents claim their faiths\u2014Islam, \nRoman Catholicism and Ukrainian Orthodox\u2014dictate \nthat they, and not the Montgomery County schools, \nteach their children about sex, human sexuality, \ngender and family life. They also claim the messages \nfrom the books conflict with and undermine the \nsincerely held religious beliefs they seek to convey to \ntheir children. So, they sought to opt their children out \nof reading and discussing the books consistent with \nMaryland regulations requiring parental notice and \nopt-outs for family life and human sexuality, and the \nboard\u2019s \n\u201cGuidelines \nfor \nRespecting \nReligious \nDiversity.\u201d J.A. 60.  \n55a\n\n The Guidelines state that \u201cschools should try to \nmake reasonable and feasible adjustments to the \ninstructional program to accommodate requests [] to \nbe excused from specific classroom discussions or \nactivities that [students or parents] believe would \nimpose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d J.A. 67. Under those Guidelines, throughout \nthe 2022/2023 school year, the board granted the \nparents\u2019 opt-out requests. Then it all changed. For the \n2023/2024 school year, the board decided that, despite \nits Guidelines, optouts would no longer be granted for \nthe books the board required be used to promote \ndiversity and inclusivity to the LGBTQ+ community. \nThe board even advised that \u201cteachers will not send \nhome letters to inform families when inclusive books \nare read in the future.\u201d J.A. 32.  \nIn response, the parents sued the board, alleging \nviolations of their right to free exercise under the First \nAmendment.1 They do not claim the use of the books \nis itself unconstitutional. And they do not seek to ban \nthem. Instead, they only want to opt their children out \nof the instruction involving such texts. More \nspecifically, they challenge the board\u2019s decision to \ncease providing advance notice of the use of such texts \nand to prohibit religious opt-outs for instruction \ninvolving them. The parents also moved for a \n \n1  \nThey also asserted claims for violations of their substantive \ndue process rights to direct and control their children\u2019s \nupbringing under the Fourteenth Amendment, for viewpoint \ndiscrimination under the First Amendment and for violations of \nMaryland state law. Because I would conclude that the parents \nare entitled to a preliminary injunction on their free exercise \nclaim, I do not address these other claims.   \n56a\n\npreliminary injunction to maintain religious opt-outs \nunder the Guidelines.   \nThe district court denied the motion. With respect \nto the free exercise claims, the court held that the \nparents had not established a likelihood of success on \nthe merits based on their assertion that the board\u2019s \nrefusal to grant their requests to opt their children out \nof the instruction involving the texts burdened the \nparents\u2019 free exercise rights.   \nThe parents timely appealed, asking us to reverse \nthe district court\u2019s denial of their motion and to grant \ninjunctive relief. They insist that they have shown a \nlikelihood of success on the merits. They claim the \nboard\u2019s denial of their opt-out requests burdened their \nFirst Amendment free exercise rights in a way that \nwas neither neutral nor generally applicable, and \nthus, the board\u2019s actions were subject to strict \nscrutiny. And because, according to the parents, such \naction cannot withstand that level of scrutiny, the \nboard violated their First Amendment right to freely \nexercise their religion and direct the religious \nupbringing of their children.  \nII.  \nAnalysis \nAs the majority notes, \u201c[a] preliminary injunction \nshall be granted only if the moving party clearly \nestablishes entitlement to the relief sought.\u201d Di Biase \nv. SPX Corp., 872 F.3d 224, 230 (4th Cir. 2017). To \nobtain a preliminary injunction, a plaintiff \u201c\u2018must \nestablish that he is likely to succeed on the merits, \nthat he is likely to suffer irreparable harm in the \nabsence of preliminary relief, that the balance of \nequities tips in his favor, and that an injunction is in \nthe public interest.\u2019\u201d WV Ass\u2019n of Club Owners & \n57a\n\nFraternal Servs., Inc. v. Musgrave, 553 F.3d 292, 298 \n(4th Cir. 2009) (quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. \nCouncil, Inc., 555 U.S. 7 (2008)). We review a district \ncourt\u2019s denial of a motion for preliminary injunction \nfor abuse of discretion. Under that standard, we \nreview factual findings for clear error and legal \nconclusions de novo. See Di Biase, 872 F.3d at 229. But \nlegal error, by definition, is an abuse of discretion. \nUnited States v. Ebersole, 411 F.3d 517, 526\u201327 (4th \nCir. 2005).   \nA. Likelihood of Success \n1. Burden  \nApplicable to the states through the Fourteenth \nAmendment, the First Amendment\u2019s Free Exercise \nClause prohibits the enactment of laws or policies that \nprohibit the free exercise of religion. Cantwell v. \nConnecticut, 310 U.S. 296, 303 (1940). The free \nexercise of religion means \u201cfirst and foremost, the \nright to believe and profess whatever religious \ndoctrine one desires.\u201d Emp. Div., Dep\u2019t of Hum. Res. of \nOregon v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877 (1990). But that is \nnot all. The Free Exercise Clause \u201cprotects not only the \nright to harbor religious beliefs inwardly and secretly.\u201d \nKennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2421. \u201cIt does perhaps its most \nimportant work by protecting the ability of those who \nhold religious beliefs of all kinds to live out their faiths \nin daily life though \u2018the performance of (or abstention \nfrom) physical acts.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Emp. Div., Dep\u2019t of \nHum. Res. of Or. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 877).  \nA free exercise claim first requires asking whether \nthe government action \u201cinterferes\u201d or burdens the \nplaintiff\u2019s free exercise of religion. See United States \nv. Lee, 455 U.S. 252, 256\u201357 (1982). Importantly, \n58a\n\ninterfering or burdening the exercise of religion is not \nlimited to direct coercion. Lyng v. Nw. Indian \nCemetery Protective Ass\u2019n, 485 U.S. 439, 450 (1988) \n(recognizing that the Supreme Court has repeatedly \nheld that indirect coercion, not just outright \nprohibitions, is subject to strict scrutiny under the \nFirst Amendment). When a state \u201cconditions receipt \nof an important benefit upon conduct proscribed by a \nreligious faith, or where it denies such a benefit \nbecause of conduct mandated by religious belief, \nthereby putting substantial pressure on an adherent \nto modify his behavior and to violate his beliefs, a \nburden upon religion exists.\u201d Thomas v. Rev. Bd. of \nInd. Emp. Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717\u201318 (1981); see \nalso Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963) (\u201cThe \nruling forces her to choose between following the \nprecepts of her religion and forfeiting benefits, on the \none hand, and abandoning one of the precepts of her \nreligion in order to accept work, on the other hand. \nGovernmental imposition of such a choice puts the \nsame kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion \nas would a fine imposed against appellant for her \nSaturday worship.\u201d).   \nWhen identifying whether a burden is imposed on \nthe exercise of religious beliefs, courts must not \nquestion the sincerity or judge the significance of the \nparticular belief. Carter v. Fleming, 879 F.3d 132, 139 \n(4th Cir. 2018); see also Wilcox v. Brown, 877 F.3d 161, \n168 (4th Cir. 2017) (\u201cBut Defendants point to no case \nin which the court held that a plaintiff is required to \nplead the theological underpinnings of his religion\u2019s \nrequirements.\u201d). We must accept the belief as honestly \nheld and significant. That is because it \u201cis not within \nthe judicial ken to question the centrality of particular \nbeliefs or practices to a faith, or the validity of \n59a\n\nparticular litigants\u2019 interpretations of those creeds.\u201d \nHernandez v. Comm\u2019r of Internal Revenue, 490 U.S. \n680, 699 (1989).   \nHere, the district court held that the parents had \nnot established that the board\u2019s denial of the parents\u2019 \nopt-out requests burdened their free exercise of \nreligion. The court concluded the board\u2019s actions did \nnot force any children to agree with the books. Thus, \nit rejected the parents\u2019 \u201cindoctrination\u201d claim. And \nwith respect to indirect coercion, the court reasoned \nthat the board\u2019s refusal to grant opt-out requests \nrelated to instruction involving the books did not force \nthe parents to forego exercising their religion. The \nparents could still, the district court explained, teach \ntheir children the tenants of their religion outside of \nschool.   \nI disagree. For decades, the Supreme Court has \nmade clear that \u201cthe liberties of religion and \nexpression may be infringed by the denial of or placing \nof conditions upon a benefit or privilege.\u201d Sherbert, \n374 U.S. at 404. Roughly 60 years ago, in Sherbert, the \nSupreme Court held that denying unemployment \nbenefits to a claimant who refused, for religious \nreasons, to work on Sundays, violated the Free \nExercise Clause. The Court explained that such a \nrefusal forced the claimant \u201cto choose between \nfollowing the precepts of her religion and forfeiting \nbenefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of the \nprecepts of her religion in order to accept work, on the \nother hand.\u201d Id. at 404. The Court reiterated this \nprinciple about 20 years later in Thomas. Then, \nrecently, in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. \n522 (2021), it re-stated it again. There, the Court held \na city\u2019s refusal to grant a full foster care contract to a \n60a\n\nCatholic agency that would not place children with \nsame-sex couples violated the Free Exercise Clause \nbecause it \u201cburdened [the agency\u2019s] religious exercise \nby putting it to the choice of curtailing its mission or \napproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs.\u201d \nFulton, 593 U.S. at 532. To the Court, that was \nenough. And it ruled any judicial inquiry into the \nmerits of the religious belief out of bounds. \n\u201c\u2018[R]eligious beliefs need not be acceptable, logical, \nconsistent, or comprehensible to others in order to \nmerit First Amendment protection.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting \nThomas, 450 U.S. at 714).  \nWhile perhaps not on all fours with the facts here, \nthese decisions provide important guidance to the \nparents\u2019 claim. The parents claim their faith compels \nthat they teach their children about sex, human \nsexuality, gender and family life. They also claim the \nmessages from the books conflict with and undermine \nthe sincerely held religious beliefs they hold and seek \nto convey to their children. And while the concerns \ninclude the content of the texts, they also include the \nresponses the school board provided to teachers to use \nwhen children or parents questioned the texts. \nAccording to the parents, the suggested responses \nmake clear that, in addition to using the books, \nschools will advocate for the themes and values in the \ntexts and against any opposition to them. As a result, \nthey claim that if they cannot opt their children out of \nthe instruction involving the books, they must either \nforego a public education or violate their deeply held \nreligious beliefs.   \nIn my view, the board\u2019s actions put the parents in \na very similar position to the unemployment benefits \nclaimant in Sherbert and the foster care agency in \n61a\n\nFulton. The board\u2019s refusal to grant the parents\u2019 \nrequests for religious opt-outs to instruction with the \nbooks the board required be used to promote diversity \nand inclusivity to the LGBTQ+ community forces the \nparents to make a choice\u2014either adhere to their faith \nor receive a free public education for their children. \nThey cannot do both. Sherbert and Fulton tell us that \nforcing that type of choice burdens the free exercise of \nreligion.   \nAnd I disagree with the majority\u2019s conclusion that \nthe parents have not produced enough evidence to \nestablish that their free exercised rights have been \nburdened. The parents have met their burden. They \nhave produced the books that no one disputes will be \nused to instruct their K-5 children. They produced \ndeclarations explaining in detail why the books \nconflict with their religious beliefs. They have \nproduced the board\u2019s own internal documents that \nshow how it suggests teachers respond to students \nand parents who question the contents of the books. \nRecall those documents advise teachers that they can \n\u201c[d]isrupt the either/or thinking by saying something \nlike: actually, people of any gender can like whoever \nthey like. . . . How do you think it would \nmake_(character\u2019s name)__to hear you say that? Do \nyou think it\u2019s fair for people to decide for us who we \ncan and can\u2019t like?\u201d J.A. 595. And they instruct \nteachers on how to discuss being transgender to the \nK-5 children. \u201cWhen we\u2019re born, people make a guess \nabout our gender and label us \u2018boy\u2019 or \u2018girl\u2019 based on \nour body parts. Sometimes they\u2019re right and \nsometimes they\u2019re wrong. . . . Our body parts do not \ndecide our gender. Our gender comes from our \ninside\u2026.\u201d J.A. 596. Based on Supreme Court \nprecedent, the record here tells all we need to know. \n62a\n\nThe standard for a preliminary injunction is not \nultimate success, but likelihood of success. Winter, \n555 U.S. at 32. The parents have established they are \nlikely to succeed in proving the board\u2019s decisions \nburdened their First Amendment rights.    \nThe \nboard \nmakes \nthree \nprimary \ncounter-\narguments. None are persuasive.  \nFirst, the board argues over and over that the use \nof the books in instructing K-5 children does not coerce \nor require the parents or their children to change their \nreligious \nviews. \nFair \nenough. \nBut \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment protects less direct religious burdens. As \nalready discussed, Sherbert and Fulton make this \npoint. When considering the Free Exercise Clause\u2019s \nprotection against indirect coercion, we ask whether \nthe state policy forces citizens to choose between \nobtaining a public benefit and exercising their \nreligious beliefs. These parents\u2019 faith dictates that \nthey\u2014not others\u2014teach their children about sex, \nhuman sexuality, gender and family life. Their faiths \ndictate that they shield their children from teachings \nthat contradict and undermine their religious views \non those topics. And no matter how you slice it, the \nboard\u2019s decision to deny religious opt-outs prevents \nthe parents from exercising these aspects of their faith \nif they want their children to obtain a public \neducation.    \nSecond, the board contends the parents did not \nface a choice between exercising their faith on the one \nhand and their children receiving a public education \non the other because they could still teach their \nreligious beliefs at home. Of course, they can teach \ntheir beliefs at home. But free exercise law is not \nnearly as cramped as this argument suggests. In \n63a\n\nKennedy, the high school football coach could have \nprayed at home. But that did not matter to the \nSupreme Court. What mattered was that the school \nrestricted the coach from exercising his religion after \ngames on the football field. In Fulton, the Catholic \nfoster care agency could have, even without the \ncontract with the city, exercised its religious beliefs \nabout marriage. But again, that did not matter to the \nSupreme Court. What mattered was that the agency \nhad to either compromise its religious beliefs or forego \nsuch a contract unless it agreed to certify same-sex \ncouples. Fulton, 593 U.S. at 532. Here, the parents \nface a similar choice. If the ability to exercise one\u2019s \nfaith at home shields the impeding of the exercise of \none\u2019s faith at school from the Free Exercise Clause, we \nwill have indeed eliminated much of the clause\u2019s \nprotections.  \nThird, the board argues that mere exposure to \nideas contrary to one\u2019s faith is not enough of a burden \nto implicate the First Amendment. In advancing this \nposition, the board contends that exposure to issues \nthat one disagrees with, even for religious reasons, is \npart of the compromise parents make when choosing \nto send their children to public schools. While it is \ngenerally true that the First Amendment provides no \nguarantee that students will not be exposed to views \nthey (or their parents) disagree with in public schools, \nthere are several problems with the use of that \nprinciple here.  \n To begin, as already discussed, the board\u2019s use of \nthe texts goes far beyond mere exposure to \n64a\n\nobjectionable \nviewpoints.2 \nAnd \nconsider \nthe \nimplication of the board\u2019s argument. In referencing \nthe compromise parents make when choosing to send \ntheir children to public schools, the board seems to be \nsuggesting that to avoid exposure to materials like the \ninclusive texts, the parents could forego a public \neducation for their children. But that means they \nwould need to either send their children to private \nschools or homeschool them. Those may be options for \nsome. But what if a parent cannot afford private \nschool or is unable to homeschool due to work? Surely, \nthe reach of the First Amendment extends beyond the \nbank accounts of those wealthy enough to pay for \neducation alternatives to public schools with policies \ninfringing on the exercise of religion. See Morse v. \nFrederick, 551 U.S. 393, 424 (2007) (\u201cMost parents, \nrealistically, have no choice but to send their children \nto a public school and little ability to influence what \noccurs in the school.\u201d) (Alito, J., concurring).  \nLast, when the onion layers of the board\u2019s \nargument are peeled back, the board seems to \nquestion the relative importance of the parents\u2019 \nreligious beliefs that their children should not be \ntaught with the books the board required be used to \npromote diversity and inclusivity to the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. To explain, the board only denied opt-outs \n \n2  \nThis distinguishes this case from Mozert v. Hawkins County \nBoard of Education, 827 F.2d 1058 (6th Cir. 1987), and \nFleischfresser v. Directors of Sch. Dist. 200, 15 F.3d 680 (7th Cir. \n1994), two of the out-of-circuit cases on which the board relies. \nThe other case the board relies on is Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d \n87 (1st Cir. 2008). Factually, it is the closest case to the one \nbefore us. But it focuses more on indoctrination than indirect \ncoercion.  \n65a\n\nfor instruction involving those books. So, despite \ndisclaiming that it is doing so, the board\u2019s arguments, \nwhich the district court adopted, really view the \nparents\u2019 religious objections to the texts as less \nimportant than the board\u2019s goals to improve \ninclusivity for the LGBTQ+ community. But this is \nthe precisely the sort of value judgment about parents\u2019 \nreligious claims that courts must not make. To repeat, \nit \u201cis not within the judicial ken to question the \ncentrality of particular beliefs or practices to a faith, \nor the validity of particular litigants\u2019 interpretations \nof those creeds.\u201d Hernandez, 490 U.S. at 699.  \nFor these reasons, the parents have shown they \nare likely to succeed on proving board\u2019s refusal to \ngrant their opt-out requests burdened their free \nexercise rights.3  \n2. Neutrality and General Applicability \nOnce a party claiming a violation of the First \nAmendment\u2019s free exercise clause establishes a \nburden\u2014or, in the case of a preliminary injunction, \nestablishes a likelihood of success on burden\u2014the \n \n3  \nThe majority raises an additional issue. It concludes that \nthat the parents were not actually excluded from the benefit of \npublic schools. In other words, it points out that the board did \nnot require the parents or their children to disavow their beliefs \nto attend public school. Any burden on their religion results after \nthe students are enrolled. Maj. Op. at 3940. From a factual \nstandpoint, that is true. But the Supreme Court has never drawn \nsuch a fine line. Neither Thomas, Sherbert, Fulton nor any \nSupreme Court indirect coercion decision holds that a total \nbarrier to the public benefit is required to show a burden on one\u2019s \nright to free exercise. To the contrary, the Court asks a broader \nquestion\u2014 whether the state policy forces the individual to make \na choice to either live out their faith or forego the public benefit. \nThe parents face that choice here.  \n66a\n\nnext step is to examine whether the state action that \nimposed the burden is neutral and generally \napplicable. If it is, we review it only for a rational \nrelationship to a legitimate government interest. \nFulton, 593 U.S. at 533. But if it is not, the state action \nmust survive strict scrutiny review. Id.   \nOn this issue, as with burden, Fulton looms large. \nFulton provides that state action is \u201cnot generally \napplicable if it \u2018invite[s]\u2019 the government to consider \nthe particular reasons for a person\u2019s conduct by \nproviding \n\u2018a \nmechanism \nfor \nindividualized \nexemptions.\u2019\u201d Id. at 533 (quoting Smith, 494 U.S. at \n884). It then held that city\u2019s policy precluding an \nagency from rejecting adoptive or foster parents based \non \ntheir \nsexual \norientation \nunless \nthe \ncity \ncommissioner granted an exception in his or her sole \ndiscretion rendered the policy not neutral nor \ngenerally applicable. Id. In explaining that holding, \nFulton pointed out that the creation of a system of \nexemptions available at the city\u2019s sole discretion \ntriggered strict scrutiny. Id. at 535; see also Sherbert, \n374 U.S. at 401 (denial of unemployment benefits \nabsent a showing of \u201cgood cause\u201d triggered strict \nscrutiny); Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 537 (1993) (strict scrutiny applied \nto the state\u2019s determination about whether the killing \nof certain animals as part of a religious ceremony was \nnecessary). \u201cBy allowing room for discretionary \nexceptions, we no longer have a rule of general \napplication and the First Amendment bristles.\u201d \nCanaan Christian Church v. Montgomery Cnty., 29 \nF.4th 182, 203 (4th Cir. 2022) (Richardson, J., \nconcurring).   \n67a\n\nApplying those principles to the parent\u2019s claims, \nthe parents have established they are likely to succeed \nin proving that the board\u2019s actions are neither neutral \nnor generally applicable. Start with the school board\u2019s \nGuidelines, which set forth provisions for excusing \nstudents from instructional programs for religious \nreasons. The Guidelines state that \u201cschools should try \nto make reasonable and feasible adjustments to the \ninstructional program to accommodate requests [] to \nbe excused from specific classroom discussions or \nactivities that [students or parents] believe would \nimpose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d J.A. 67. Thus, Montgomery County schools \nhave discretion to grant religious opt-out requests. A \nschool decides on an individual basis if the requested \nreligious \naccommodation \nis \n\u201creasonable\u201d \nand \n\u201cfeasible.\u201d That discretion triggers strict scrutiny \nunder Fulton, Sherbert and Church of the Lukumi \nBabalu Aye.   \nIllustrating that discretion, throughout much of \nthe 2022/2023 school year, the board granted the \nparents\u2019 opt-out requests with respect to the inclusive \ntexts. But then it changed its position. The board \ndecided that, despite the Guidelines, opt-outs would \nno longer be granted concerning the texts. In fact, it \nflip-flopped on its policy overnight. On March 22, \n2023, the board stated that \u201c[i]f a parent chooses to \nopt out, a teacher can find a substitute text for that \nstudent.\u201d J.A. 31. The very next day, however, the \nboard announced a \u201crevised message,\u201d in which it \nmade clear that families would no longer be able to \n\u201copt out of engaging with any instruction materials,\u201d \nother than the family life and human sexuality unit of \ninstruction. J.A. 31\u201332. The board also told parents \nthat teachers would not send home letters informing \n68a\n\nthem of when the books were scheduled to be read. \nGuidelines that permit a school board to decide one \nday that religious opt-outs are okay and the next day \nthat they are not\u2014because accommodating the \nrequest is not reasonable or feasible\u2014is inherently \ndiscretionary.  \nTrue, unlike Fulton, the board\u2019s decision applied \nnot to an individual request for an opt-out for the K-5 \ntexts\u2019 instruction; instead, it applied to all such \nrequests. But the board was only able to deny the \nparents\u2019 opt-out requests because the Guidelines gave \nit the discretion to do so. And it would seem odd that \na single denial of a discretionary request to opt out of \ninstruction that burdens the free exercise of one\u2019s \nreligious rights would not be neutral nor generally \napplicable, but one that applied pre-emptively to a \nwider swath would.        \nResisting this conclusion, the board makes several \narguments. First, it argues that its decision to no \nlonger consider opt-outs for the books does not favor \nsecular over religious conduct. See Tandon v. Newsom, \n593 U.S. 61, 62 (2021) (policies that expressly favor \nsecular interests over religious interest trigger strict \nscrutiny). But favoring the secular over the religious \nis but one way to trigger strict scrutiny. Strict scrutiny \nis also triggered by a government policy that creates \n\u201ca formal mechanism for granting exceptions.\u201d Fulton, \n593 U.S. at 537.  And that is what we have here.  \nSecond, the board argues Fulton\u2019s mechanism-for-\ngranting-exceptions principle only applies if the \ndiscretionary exception decisions entail a value \njudgment on the legitimacy of the religious views. \nAlthough such value judgments do offend the Free \nExercise Clause, that is not the only state action that \n69a\n\ndoes so. Fulton makes that clear that mechanisms for \ngranting discretionary exceptions trigger strict \nscrutiny. 593 U.S. at 533. It did not matter in Fulton \nwhether any exceptions were granted or denied based \non value judgments about the religious views.  The \npolicy was neither neutral nor generally applicable \nbecause it invited the government \u201cto decide which \nreasons for not complying with the policy are worthy \nof solicitude\u201d in its sole discretion. Id. at 537.    \nThird, the board insists that whether or not the \nGuidelines \nfor \nRespecting \nReligious \nDiversity \npreviously permitted no discretion, it has now \neliminated any discretion by deciding that the policy \nwill not be applied to the texts for the Montgomery \nCounty K-5 students. But that flip-flop was itself a \npurely discretionary decision. Moreover, the board \nonly eliminated religious opt-outs for the texts for K-5 \nchildren. In other words, it carved away only a sliver \nof those able to request opt-outs\u2014those opposed for \nreligious reasons to the instruction of their K-5 \nchildren with the texts. In other words, other religious \noptout requests are still allowed; just not for those \nopposed to the content of the texts. This slicing and \ndicing of religious opt-outs is neither neutral nor \ngenerally applicable.4    \n \n4  \nThe board\u2019s policy has another problem. Maryland state \nregulations requires instruction on family life and human \nsexuality. Md. Code Regs. 13A.04.18.01 And such \u201cfamily life \nand human sexuality instruction shall represent all students \nregardless of ability, sexual orientation, gender identity, and \ngender expression.\u201d Md. Code Regs. 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(a). But \nMaryland also requires schools to establish procedures for notice \nand opt-out procedures for all \u201cfamily life and human sexuality\u201d \ninstruction regardless of whether they are sought for a religious \n \n70a\n\nTo sum it up, the parents have established they are \nlikely to succeed in proving that the board\u2019s refusal to \nconsider the parents\u2019 religious opt outs requests is not \nneutral; nor is it generally applicable. And for that \nreason, it must survive strict scrutiny.5  \n3. Strict Scrutiny \nUnder strict scrutiny, state action will be \nsustained only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a \ncompelling state interest. City of Cleburne v. Cleburne \nLiving Ctr., 473 U.S. 432, 440 (1985). \u201cA government \npolicy can survive strict scrutiny [] only if it advances \ninterests of the highest order and is narrowly tailored \nto achieve those interests.\u201d Fulton, 593 U.S. at 541. \nThe board contends it decided to use the books to \nreflect the diversity of its community and to foster \ninclusivity of students in the LGBTQ+ community. \nAnd it contends its decision to modify the opt-out \npolicy was to address absenteeism and to reduce \nstigmatization of students who remained in the \n \nreason. Md. Code Regs. 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e). Even though not \ntaught in a sex-ed class, the books the board required be used \nwith K-5 children to promote diversity and inclusivity to the \nLGBTQ+ community involve issues of family life and human \nsexuality. I see nothing in the Maryland regulations that would \npermit the board to avoid the requirement to permit opt-outs for \nfamily life and human sexuality just by adding instruction in \nthat area to other classes.  \n5  \nThe parents argue that strict scrutiny also applies because \nthe record shows the board\u2019s hostility to religion. And they argue \nstrict scrutiny is required under Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205 \n(1972). The board responds to these arguments in its briefing, \nclaiming that the policy was not enacted out of religious hostility \nand that Yoder does not support the parents\u2019 position. But since \nI find strict scrutiny applies due to the absence of a neutral and \ngenerally applicable policy, I do not address those arguments.  \n71a\n\nclassroom for the study and discussion of the inclusive \ntexts.   \nRegardless of one\u2019s views on those interests, they \ncannot withstand strict scrutiny. In Students for Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard \nCollege, 600 U.S. 181 (2023), the Supreme Court \nquestioned how similar interests could be compelling \nif they cannot be subjected to meaningful review. In \nfinding \nrace-based \nadmissions \nprograms \nunconstitutional, the Court explained that \u201cHarvard \nidentifies the following educational benefits that it is \npursuing: (1) \u2018training future leaders in the public and \nprivate sectors\u2019; (2) preparing graduates to \u2018adapt to \nan increasingly pluralistic society\u2019; (3) \u2018better \neducating its students through diversity\u2019; and (4) \n\u2018producing new knowledge stemming from diverse \noutlooks.\u2019\u201d Id. at 214. It then held that \u201calthough \nthese are commendable goals, they are not sufficiently \ncoherent for purposes of strict scrutiny.\u201d Id; see also \nFellowship of Christian Athletes v. San Jose Unified \nSch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 82 F.4th 664, 671\u201372 (9th Cir. \n2023) (\u201cWhile it cannot be overstated that anti-\ndiscrimination \npolicies \ncertainly \nserve \nworthy \ncauses\u2014particularly within the context of a school \nsetting where students are often finding themselves\u2014\nthose policies may not themselves be utilized in a \nmanner \nthat \ntransgresses \nor \nsupersedes \nthe \ngovernment's constitutional commitment to be \nsteadfastly neutral to religion.\u201d). Likewise here, the \nboard\u2019s \ngoals, \nno \nmatter \nhow \nlaudable, \nare \nunmeasurable, and thus fail to pass constitutional \nmuster without a \u201cmeaningful connection to the \nmeans they employ and the goals [it] pursues.\u201d Id. at \n215.    \n72a\n\nWhat\u2019s more, the board cannot show that the texts \nor its refusal to allow religious opt outs are narrowly \ntailored to those interests. The board granted \nreligious opt outs for the texts during the 2022/2023 \nschool year, when it advanced the same interest of \nmaking its schools safe and inclusive for those in the \nLGBTQ+ community. And still today, the board \npermits opt-outs for family life and human sexuality \ninstruction. How can barring religious opt-outs be \nnarrowly tailored to the board\u2019s stated interests when \nit has permitted less restrictive measures in the past \nand currently?   \nThe \nboard \nadvances \nneither \na \ncompelling \ngovernment interest nor a policy narrowly tailored to \nthat interest. Under strict scrutiny, therefore, it is \nlikely to fail constitutional muster. As a result, the \nparents have shown a likelihood of success as to their \nFirst Amendment free exercise claims.   \nB. Other Preliminary Injunction Factors \nShowing a likelihood of success on the merits goes \na long way toward the parents\u2019 request for a \npreliminary injunction. See Frazier v. Prince George\u2019s \nCnty., 86 F.4th 537, 544 (4th Cir. 2023). But they must \nstill show irreparable harm without preliminary \nrelief, that the balance of equities tips in their favor \nand that an injunction is in the public interest. See \nMusgrave, 553 F.3d at 298. Here, those remaining \nissues can be disposed of in short order.  \nTaking them in turn, \u201cirreparable harm\u201d \u201cis \ninseparably linked to the likelihood of success on the \nmerits\u201d because a plaintiff not likely to succeed on the \nmerits is not likely to suffer irreparable harm. Centro \nTepeyac v. Montgomery Cnty., 722 F.3d 184, 190 (4th \n73a\n\nCir. 2013) (cleaned up). Also, the \u201closs of First \nAmendment freedoms, for even minimal periods of \ntime, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.\u201d \nRoman Cath. Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 U.S. \n14, 19 (2020) (finding irreparable harm if COVID-19 \nrestrictions were imposed on houses of worship and \nconcluding that, while some people shut out of \nservices may be able to watch services on television, \nremote viewing is not the same as personal \nattendance and would shut out important traditions \nthat require personal attendance); Tandon, 593 U.S. \nat 64 (\u201cApplicants are likely to succeed on the merits \nof their free exercise claim; they are irreparably \nharmed by the loss of free exercise rights \u2018for even \nminimal periods of time.\u2019\u201d). We have also held that \n\u201cupholding constitutional rights serves the public \ninterest.\u201d Newsom ex rel. Newsom v. Albemarle Cnty. \nSch. Bd., 354 F.3d 249, 261 (4th Cir. 2003). And last, \nbased on my determination that the board\u2019s actions \nwould likely be found unconstitutional, the balance of \nthe equities favors granting a preliminary injunction \ngiven the limited nature of the relief the parents seek. \nIn my view, the record shows that the parents have \nestablished all the requirements of obtaining a \npreliminary injunction.    \nIII.  \nConclusion \nCourts rightly defer to schools, as a general \nmatter, for curriculum decisions. But not for decisions \nthat burden the free exercise of religion in a way that \nis not both neutral and generally applicable. Those \ndecisions are only constitutional if narrowly tailored \nto a compelling governmental interest. Here, the \nparents have shown they are likely to succeed in \nproving the board\u2019s decision to deny religious opt-outs \n74a\n\nfor K-5 students with respect to the use of the texts \nburdens their rights to freely exercise their religion. \nAnd they are likely to succeed in showing that decision \nis neither neutral nor generally applicable. Last, the \nparents are likely to succeed in establishing that the \nboard\u2019s decision cannot withstand strict scrutiny. In \naddition, the other preliminary injunction factors \nfavor enjoining the board\u2019s decision. I would, \ntherefore, reverse the district court and grant the \ninjunctive relief. I respectfully dissent.6   \n \n6  \nThe parents\u2019 appeal involves the board\u2019s decision to remove \nthe religious opt-outs available under the Guidelines for K-5 \nchildren for instruction involving the LGBTQ+ inclusive texts. It \ndoes not present the question of whether opt-outs are required \nanytime a school\u2019s curriculum decisions burden religious \nfreedom. As a result, my opinion should not be construed to \naddress that question.  \n75a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \nTAMER MAHMOUD,  \net al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMONIFA B. MCKNIGHT, \net al., \nDefendants. \n \n \nCiv. No. DLB-23-1380 \nMEMORANDUM OPINION \n \nIn this lawsuit, parents whose elementary-aged \nchildren attend Montgomery County Public Schools \n(\u201cMCPS\u201d) seek the ability to opt their children out of \nreading and discussion of books with lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, transgender, and queer characters because \nthe books\u2019 messages contradict their sincerely held \nreligious beliefs about marriage, human sexuality, and \ngender. Last school year, MCPS incorporated into its \nEnglish language arts curriculum a collection of \nstorybooks \nfeaturing \nLGBTQ \ncharacters \n(the \n\u201cstorybooks\u201d or \u201cbooks\u201d) in an effort to reflect the \ndiversity of the school community. Initially, parents \ncould opt their children out of reading and instruction \ninvolving the books, as they could with other parts of \nthe \ncurriculum. \nIn \nMarch \nof \nthis \nyear, \nthe \ndefendants\u2014the \nMontgomery \nCounty \nBoard \nof \nEducation, the MCPS superintendent, and the elected \nboard members (collectively, the \u201cSchool Board\u201d)\u2014\nannounced that parents no longer would receive \nadvance notice of when the storybooks would be read \n76a\n\n \n \nor be able opt their children out. Following the \nannouncement, three families of diverse faiths filed \nsuit against the School Board, claiming the no-opt-out \npolicy violates their and their children\u2019s free exercise \nand free speech rights under the First Amendment, \nthe parents\u2019 substantive due process rights under the \nFourteenth Amendment, and Maryland law. \n \nThe parents have moved for a preliminary \ninjunction that requires the School Board to give them \nadvance notice and an opportunity to opt their \nchildren out of classroom instruction that involves the \nstorybooks or relates to family life and human \nsexuality. ECF 23. The motion is fully briefed. ECF \n42, 43, 47. The parties have filed supplements in \nsupport of their positions. ECF 48, 49, 51, 52, 54, 55, \n57. The Court held a hearing on the motion on August \n9, 2023. ECF 50. For the following reasons, the motion \nis denied. \nI. Background \n \nMontgomery County Public Schools is the largest \npublic school system in Maryland and one of the \nlargest public school systems in the country. ECF 36, \n\u00b6 39. As of fall 2021, it included 209 schools with \napproximately 160,000 students. Id. \u00b6 38. Roughly \n70,000 of those students attended an elementary \nschool. \nId. \nThe Montgomery County Board of \nEducation is the entity authorized by the State of \nMaryland to administer MCPS. Id. \u00b6 36. It has \nauthority to adopt educational policies, rules, and \nregulations consistent with state law. Id. \u00b6 37. \n \nThe School Board believes that diversity in its \ncommunity is an asset that makes it stronger and that \nbuilding relationships with its diverse community \n77a\n\n \n \nrequires it to understand the perspectives and \nexperiences of others. ECF 43, \u00b6 5. These values are \nmemorialized in the School Board\u2019s Policy on \nNondiscrimination, Equity, and Cultural Proficiency, \nwhich supports \u201cproactive steps to identify and redress \nimplicit biases and structural and institutional \nbarriers \nthat \ntoo \noften \nhave \nresulted \nin\u201d \ndisproportionate exclusion and underrepresentation. \nId. \u00b6 6; see ECF 42-2. Accordingly, the School Board \nstrives to \u201cprovide a culturally responsive . . . \ncurriculum that promotes equity, respect, and civility\u201d \nand prepares students to \u201c[c]onfront and eliminate \nstereotypes related to individuals\u2019 actual or perceived \ncharacteristics,\u201d including gender identity and sexual \norientation.  ECF 43, \u00b6 6.  A critical part of the \nSchool Board\u2019s approach is representation of diverse \nidentities and communities in the curriculum. Id. \u00b6 21. \n\u201cRepresentation in the curriculum creates and \nnormalizes a fully inclusive environment for all \nstudents\u201d and \u201csupports a student\u2019s ability to \nempathize, connect, and collaborate with diverse peers \nand encourages respect for all.\u201d Id. \u00b6 22. \nA. The Storybooks \n \nIn October 2022, the School Board announced the \napproval of \u201cover 22 LGBTQ+-inclusive texts for use in \nthe classroom.\u201d ECF 36, \u00b6 113. According to the \nassociate \nsuperintendent \nfor \ncurriculum \nand \ninstruction programs at MCPS, Niki T. Hazel, the \nSchool Board introduced the storybooks into the \nEnglish language arts curriculum to further its \nsystem-wide goals of promoting diversity, equity, and \nnondiscrimination. ECF 43, \u00b6\u00b6 23\u201326, 31. In the \nspring of 2022, the School Board had determined that \n78a\n\n \n \nthe books in its English language arts curriculum were \nnot sufficiently representative because they did not \ninclude LGBTQ characters. Id. \u00b6 23. It initiated \nprocedures to evaluate potential new instructional \nmaterials that would be more inclusive. Id. \u00b6 24. A \ncommittee of four reading specialists and two \ninstructional specialists engaged in two rounds of \nevaluation and eventually recommended the approval \nof the storybooks, finding they \u201csupported MCPS \ncontent \nstandards \nand \nperformance \nindicators, \ncontained narratives and illustrations that would be \naccessible and engaging to students, and featured \ncharacters of diverse backgrounds whose stories and \nfamilies students could relate to.\u201d Id. \u00b6 26; see ECF \n49-1. \n \nThe plaintiffs have attached seven of the \nstorybooks to their complaint. ECF 1-4, 1-6 \u2013 1-11. \nPride Puppy! chronicles a family\u2019s visit to a \u201cPride \nDay\u201d parade and their search for a runaway puppy, \nusing the letters of the alphabet to illustrate what a \nchild might see at a pride parade. ECF 1-4. Uncle \nBobby\u2019s Wedding tells the story of a girl who is worried \nthat her soon- to-be-married uncle will not spend time \nwith her anymore, but her uncle\u2019s boyfriend befriends \nher and wins her trust. ECF 1-6. Intersection Allies: \nWe Make Room for All features nine characters who \nproudly describe themselves and their diverse \nbackgrounds and connects each character\u2019s story to \nthe collective struggle for justice. ECF 1-7. My \nRainbow tells the story of a mother who creates a \nrainbow-colored wig for her transgender child. ECF 1-\n8. Prince & Knight tells the story of a young prince who \nfalls in love with and marries a male knight after they \nwork together to battle a dragon. ECF 1-9. Love, Violet \n79a\n\n \n \nchronicles a shy child\u2019s efforts to connect with her \nsame- sex crush on a wintry Valentine\u2019s Day. ECF 1-\n10. Born Ready: The True Story of a Boy Named \nPenelope is about an elementary-aged child who \nexperiences triumphs and frustrations in convincing \nothers what the child knows to be true\u2014that he\u2019s a \nboy, not a girl. ECF 1-11. Pride Puppy! is for pre-\nkindergarten and the Head Start program; the other \nbooks are for kindergarten through fifth grade. ECF \n1-3; ECF 1-15, at 23.1 \n \nThe plaintiffs contend state law requires MCPS to \nprovide opt-outs from the storybooks because, in their \nview, the books concern family life and human \nsexuality. The School Board\u2019s position is that the \nstorybooks are part of its English language arts \ncurriculum and opt-outs are required only for the \nfamily life and human sexuality unit of instruction, a \nseparate curriculum. See ECF 43, \u00b6 43. \nB. State and MCPS Opt-Out Policies \n \nMaryland law requires local school systems like \nMCPS to provide \u201ca comprehensive health education\u201d \nthat includes \u201cconcepts and skills\u201d related to \u201cfamily \nlife and human sexuality.\u201d ECF 36, \u00b6\u00b6 84\u201387. This \ninstruction must \u201crepresent all students regardless of \n \n1  \nIn their preliminary injunction motion, the plaintiffs identify \ntwo additional books they object to: What are Your Words? and \nJacob\u2019s Room to Choose. ECF 23-5. The former tells the story of a \nchild figuring out their pronouns. The latter depicts two gender-\nnonconforming children and their elementary-aged class deciding \nto replace male/female bathroom signs with different, non-binary \nsigns. The School Board recommends these books as \u201cResources \nfor Students, Staff, and Parents \u2013 Affirming LGBTQ+ Young \nAdults.\u201d See id. at 1\u20132. \n80a\n\n \n \nability, sexual orientation, and gender expression.\u201d Id. \n\u00b6 89. Maryland law requires school systems to provide \nparents and guardians with an opportunity \u201cto view \ninstructional materials to be used in the teaching of \nfamily life and human sexuality objectives.\u201d Id. \u00b6 99 \n(citing COMAR \u00a7 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(iv)). Like most \nother states that require or permit instruction on \nhuman sexuality in public schools, Maryland allows for \nopt-outs \nfrom \nsuch \ninstruction \nin \ncertain \ncircumstances and requires schools to adopt \u201cpolicies, \nguidelines, and/or procedures for student opt-out\u201d and \nto provide alternative learning activities. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 95, \n100\u201301 (citing COMAR \u00a7 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(i) & \n(ii)). \n \nSeparately, the School Board has adopted an opt-\nout policy for parents and students who have religious \nobjections to MCPS classroom instruction or activities. \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 104\u201312. For the 2022\u20132023 school year, the \nMCPS School Board\u2019s \u201cGuidelines for Respecting \nReligious Diversity\u201d (\u201cReligious Diversity Guidelines\u201d) \nstated, in part: \nWhen possible, schools should try to make \nreasonable and feasible adjustments to the \ninstructional program to accommodate requests \nfrom \nstudents, \nor \nrequests \nfrom \nparents/guardians on behalf of their students, \nto \nbe \nexcused \nfrom \nspecific \nclassroom \ndiscussions or activities that they believe would \nimpose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs. Students, or their parents/guardians on \nbehalf of their students, also have the right to \nask to be excused from the classroom activity if \nthe students or their parents/guardians believe \n81a\n\n \n \nthe activity would invade student privacy by \ncalling attention to the student\u2019s religion. When \na student is excused from the classroom \nactivity, the student will be provided with an \nalternative to the school activity or assignment. \nApplying these principles, it may be feasible to \naccommodate objections from students or their \nparents/guardians to a particular reading \nassignment on religious grounds by providing \nan alternative selection that meets the same \nlesson objectives. However, if such requests \nbecome too frequent or too burdensome, the \nschool may refuse to accommodate the requests. \nSchools are not required to alter fundamentally \nthe educational program or create a separate \neducational program or a separate course to \naccommodate a student\u2019s religious practice or \nbelief. \nECF 1-2, at 11\u201312. \nC. The \nPlaintiffs\u2019 \nObjections \nto \nthe \nStorybooks \n \nThe individual plaintiffs are Montgomery County \nresidents of diverse faiths with children enrolled in \nMCPS. ECF 36, \u00b6\u00b6 21\u201331. Tamer Mahmoud and Enas \nBarakat are Muslims with three school-aged children, \nincluding a second grader. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 24\u201325. Jeff and \nSvitlana Roman are members of the Roman Catholic \nand Ukrainian Orthodox faiths, respectively, who also \nhave a second grader in MCPS. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 27\u201328. Chris \nand \nMelissa \nPersak \nare \nCatholics \nwith \ntwo \nelementary-aged children enrolled in MCPS. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 \n29, 31. Each believes all persons should be respected \nregardless of sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, \n82a\n\n \n \nor other characteristics. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 50, 59, 66, 76. Each \nalso has religious objections to the storybooks. \n \nThe \nindividual \nplaintiffs \nhave \nsubmitted \ndeclarations in which they describe their religious \nbeliefs and the grounds for their objections. Mahmoud \nand Barakat believe they have \u201ca sacred duty\u201d to teach \ntheir children their faith, \u201cincluding religiously \ngrounded sexual ethics.\u201d ECF 23- 2, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 14. Their \nreligion teaches that mankind was divinely created as \nmale and female and that sex and sexuality are sacred \ngifts from God to be expressed through the forming of \na spiritual, marital bond that \u201centails sexually distinct \nbut mutual duties and affections.\u201d \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 5\u20137. \n\u201cInherent in these teachings\u201d is the belief that \u201cgender \ncannot be unwoven from biological sex . . . without \nrejecting the dignity and direction God bestowed on \nhumanity from the start.\u201d Id. \u00b6 9. Accordingly, they \nbelieve \u201chumans attain their fullest God-given \npotential by embracing their biological sex,\u201d and their \nreligion forbids medical procedures to alter the sex of \na healthy person and condemns the imitation of the \nappearance of the opposite gender. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 10\u201312. With \nrespect to instruction that uses the storybooks, they \nbelieve \u201cthere are detrimental spiritual consequences \nfrom \nletting \nauthoritative \nfigures \nsuch \nas \nschoolteachers teach\u201d their children \u201cprinciples \nconcerning sexual and gender ethics that contravene\u201d \ntheir faith. \nId. \u00b6 16. \nThey view the books as \nundermining their efforts to raise their second grader \nbecause the books \u201cencourage young children to \nquestion their sexuality and gender, to identify with \nlabels that categorize them by their sexuality, to focus \nprematurely on romantic relationships, to disregard \ndifferences between men and women, to accept gender \n83a\n\n \n \ntransitioning, and to dismiss parental and religious \nguidance on these issues.\u201d Id. \u00b6 19. They state it would \nconflict with their religious duties to intentionally \nexpose their son \u201cto activities and curriculum on sex, \nsexuality, and gender that undermine Islamic \nteachings . . . .\u201d Id. \u00b6 18. And because Islam \u201cprohibits \nprying into others\u2019 private lives and discourages public \ndisclosure of sexual behavior,\u201d they state it would \nviolate their beliefs and the beliefs of their children if \nthe children \u201cwere asked to discuss romantic \nrelationships or sexuality with schoolteachers or \nclassmates.\u201d Id. \u00b6 17. \n \nThe Romans\u2019 faiths teach that all humans are \ncreated in God\u2019s image with inherent dignity. ECF 23-\n3, \u00b6 4. Based on the teachings of their faiths, the \nRomans believe biological sex is a divine gift that \n\u201centails differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s bodies and \nhow they relate to each other and the world.\u201d Id. \u00b6 6. \nThey believe \u201ca person\u2019s biological sex is both \nunchanging and integral to that person\u2019s being,\u201d that \n\u201cgender and biological sex are intertwined and \ninseparable,\u201d and that \u201chumans attain their fullest \nGod-given potential by embracing their biological sex.\u201d \nId. \u00b6\u00b6 10\u201311. They also view human sexuality as a \ndivine gift that \u201ccalls for an authentic and healthy \nintegration in the person\u201d through the \u201cvirtue of \nchastity\u201d and expression \u201conly in marriage between a \nman and a woman for creating life and strengthening \nthe marital union.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 8\u20139. They have \u201ca sacred \nobligation to teach these principles\u201d to their son and \u201cto \nencourage him at appropriate times to embrace\u201d their \nreligious way of life. Id. \u00b6 12. Based on these beliefs, \nthe Romans believe that \u201cencouraging children to \nunwind\u201d gender and biological sex will teach them that \n84a\n\n \n \ntheir bodies are objects that may be disposed of at will \nrather than \u201ca gift to be received, respected and cared \nfor as something intrinsic to the person.\u201d Id. \u00b6 10. \nThey view much of the content of the storybooks as \n\u201cfalse religiously and scientifically,\u201d and they would \nprefer children \u201cenjoy a time of innocence, when it is \nnot necessary for them to have detailed understanding \nof issues surrounding human sexuality,\u201d rather than \nfor them to be encouraged \u201cto focus prematurely on \nromantic emotions and relationships.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13\u201314. \nBecause their son \u201cloves his teachers and implicitly \ntrusts them,\u201d they believe instruction on \u201csexuality or \ngender identity\u201d that conflicts with their faiths \u201cis \nspiritually and emotionally harmful to his well-being\u201d \nand will significantly interfere with their \u201cability to \nform his religious faith and religious outlook on life.\u201d \nId. \u00b6 20. \n \nThe Persaks, too, believe \u201call humans are created \nas male or female, and that a person\u2019s biological sex is \na gift bestowed by God that is both unchanging and \nintegral to that person\u2019s being.\u201d ECF 23-4, \u00b6 5. They \nview \nthemselves \nas \nhaving \n\u201ca \nGod-given \nresponsibility\u201d to raise their children in accordance \nwith the tenets of their faith, including \u201cthe Catholic \nChurch\u2019s \nteachings \non \nthe \nimmutable \nsexual \ndifferences between males and females, the biblical \nway to properly express romantic and sexual desires, \nand the role of parents to love one another \nunconditionally and sacrificially within the confines of \nbiblical marriage . . . .\u201d Id. \u00b6 7. They view the \nstorybooks as going \u201cfar beyond teaching kindness and \nrespect,\u201d to the point of imposing \u201can ideological view \nof family life and sexuality that characterizes any \ndivergent beliefs as \u2018hurtful.\u2019\u201d Id. \u00b6 15. They believe \n85a\n\n \n \nthe books encourage children \u201cto question their \nsexuality and gender, ignore important differences \nbetween \nmen \nand \nwomen, \napprove \ngender \ntransitioning, \nfocus \nprematurely \non \nromantic \nrelationships and sexuality, and dismiss parental and \nreligious guidance on these issues.\u201d Id. \u00b6 16. Because \nthey regard young children as \u201chighly impressionable \nto ideological instruction presented in children\u2019s books \nor by schoolteachers,\u201d particularly \u201cwhen ideological \ninstruction is imposed to the exclusion of other \nviewpoints,\u201d they believe the books undermine their \nefforts to raise their children in their faith. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 13\u2013\n14, 16. Accordingly, they believe \u201cexposing\u201d their \nchildren to \u201cviewpoints on sex, sexuality, and gender \nthat contradict Catholic teaching on these subjects is \ninappropriate and conflicts with\u201d their religious duty \nto raise their children in their faith. Id. \u00b6 12. \n \nThe individual plaintiffs\u2019 concerns are shared by \nKids First, an unincorporated association of parents \nand teachers that formed \u201cto advocate for the return of \nparental notice and opt-out rights with respect to any \ninstruction related to family life and human \nsexuality\u201d in MCPS. ECF 36, \u00b6\u00b6 32\u201333. Kids First \nincludes members of diverse faiths and is open to \nindividuals of all faiths. Id. \u00b6 34. The association\u2019s \nmembers believe in prioritizing the needs of children \nand \u201callowing elementary-age children to be kids first, \nwithout \nprematurely \nexposing \nthem \nto \nissues \nregarding human sexuality, gender identity, and \ngender transitioning.\u201d Id. \u00b6 72. They believe parents \nhave the primary responsibility to decide how and \nwhen to instruct their children on such matters. Id. \u00b6 \n73. And they believe they have religious obligations to \nensure their children are taught about family life and \n86a\n\n \n \nhuman sexuality in a manner consistent with their \nfaiths. Id. \u00b6 74. \n \nAfter the August 9 motion hearing, the plaintiffs \nsubmitted a declaration of Grace Morrison, a board \nmember of Kids First. ECF 52, \u00b6 2. Morrison and her \nhusband are Roman Catholics and adhere to the \nCatholic Church\u2019s teachings on marriage, family, sex, \nsexuality, and gender. Id. \u00b6 4. They believe gender is \n\u201cinterwoven\u201d with sex and that \u201cmarriage is the \nlifelong union of one man and one woman\u2014distinct \nfrom each other, while complementary to each other\u2014 \nand that the nature and purpose of human sexuality \nis fulfilled in that union.\u201d Id. \u00b6 5. Their ten- year-old \ndaughter has Down Syndrome and Attention Deficit \nDisorder. Id. \u00b6 3. She is enrolled in MCPS\u2019s Learning \nfor Independence Program, has an Individualized \nEducational Plan (\u201cIEP\u201d), and is assisted by a full-time, \none-on-one paraeducator. Id. The Morrisons believe \nthey have a \u201csacred obligation . . . to form [their] \ndaughter\u2019s understanding of what it means to be a \nwoman, to love another person, the nature and \npurpose of marriage, and how to embrace the vocation \nshe is called to by God.\u201d Id. \u00b6 7. They believe their \nreligious obligation is \u201cpressured\u201d by the storybooks, \nwhich conflict with their religious understandings of \nmarriage, sexuality, and gender. Id. \u00b6 8. Because of \ntheir daughter\u2019s learning challenges, she does not \n\u201cunderstand or differentiate instructions from her \nteachers and her parents\u201d and \u201cwill not be able to \nunderstand how or why\u201d the Morrisons disagree with \nthe content of the storybooks. Id. \u00b6 9. For these \nreasons, the Morrisons believe \u201cit is practically \nimpossible\u201d for them to contradict \ninstruction \ninvolving the books. Id. \u00b6 8. At the same time, \n87a\n\n \n \nbecause of their daughter\u2019s needs, they do not believe \nthey have \u201ca clear alternative\u201d for their daughter\u2019s \neducation \u201cexcept to remain in the public schools\u201d and \nuse public school resources. Id. \u00b6 10. \n \nThe plaintiffs articulate strong objections to the \nstorybooks. As a general matter, they object to the \nintroduction of concepts of gender identity, sexuality, \nand \ntransgenderism \nto \ntheir \nelementary-aged \nchildren. See ECF 36, \u00b6 119. They note, for example, \nthat Pride Puppy! includes among a list of words to \nsearch for in its picture \u201c[drag] king\u201d and \u201c[drag] \nqueen,\u201d \u201cleather,\u201d \u201cunderwear,\u201d and the name of a \nprominent sex worker and gay liberation activist. Id. \u00b6 \n116. They read it to \u201cencourage unqualified support for \npride parades,\u201d without acknowledging pride parades \n\u201coften contain material that many parents find \ninappropriate for young children.\u201d Id. \u00b6\u00b6 117, 131. \nSimilarly, they object to Intersection Allies because it \ndefines sex, gender, and transgender and asks readers \nwhat pronouns fit them best, and they object to Love, \nViolet because it depicts children experiencing \nromantic feelings. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 136, 140\u201341. The plaintiffs \nbelieve the books, and the School Board\u2019s guidance on \ntheir use, promote \u201can ideologically one-sided view of \nissues\u201d that is contrary to their faiths and their \nunderstandings of scientific evidence. Id. \u00b6 132.2 They \nnote the resource guide for Pride Puppy! comes from \nthe Human Rights Campaign, which they describe as \nan \u201cactivist organization\u201d that advocates for \u201csex \npositivity\u201d and \u201cideological education on sexual \norientation \nand \ngender \nidentity \nstarting \nin \n \n2  \nThe plaintiffs refer to scientific literature that is, in their \nview, consistent with their religious beliefs. ECF 36, \u00b6\u00b6 145\u201351. \n88a\n\n \n \nkindergarten\u201d; that the teacher\u2019s guide for My \nRainbow \u201ceschews analysis of the various other ways \nparents might appropriately help their children \nexperiencing gender dysphoria\u201d; and that the resource \nguide for Born Ready encourages teachers to respond \nto questions and comments about the main character\u2019s \n\u201cbody parts\u201d by suggesting people only \u201cmake a guess\u201d \nabout gender at birth. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 120\u201332, 138, 141\u201344. In \nshort, they believe the storybooks \u201cpromote one-sided \ntransgender ideology, encourage gender transitioning, \nand focus excessively on romantic infatuation[.]\u201d Id. \u00b6 \n5. \nD. How Teachers Will Use the Storybooks \n \nThe MCPS English Language Arts Framework and \nCore Learning Practices for English Language Arts \nstate in broad terms the goals and strategies of the \ncurriculum, but they do not provide specific guidance \non the use of any particular texts, including the \nstorybooks. See ECF 42-3; ECF 42-4. Hazel states \nMCPS teachers decide how they will use the \nstorybooks in their classrooms. ECF 43, \u00b6\u00b6 29\u201331. \nThe MCPS Office of Curriculum and Instructional \nPrograms suggested teachers incorporate the books \ninto the curriculum like any other book, \u201cnamely, to \nput them on a shelf for students to find on their own; \nto recommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; \nto offer the books as an option for literature circles, \nbook clubs, or paired reading groups; or to use them as \na read aloud.\u201d Id. \u00b6 29. While the School Board \nexpects \u201cthat teachers use the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books \nas part of instruction,\u201d as with all curriculum \nresources, teachers have a choice \u201cregarding which \nMCPS-approved materials to use and when to use \n89a\n\n \n \nthem through each unit\u201d and may \u201cchoose among the \ntexts\u201d rather than being limited to a single book \ncorresponding to grade level. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 30\u201331. The School \nBoard has stated \u201cthere [was] no planned explicit \ninstruction on gender identity and sexual orientation \nin elementary school, and that no student or adult is \nasked to change how they feel about these issues.\u201d Id. \n\u00b6 30; see ECF 1-5, at 3. Rather, the books will be \u201cused \nto assist students with mastering reading concepts \nlike answering questions about characters, retelling \nkey events . . . , and drawing inferences about story \ncharacters based on their actions.\u201d ECF 43, \u00b6 31. In \nadvance of the books\u2019 introduction into the curriculum \nin the 2022\u20132023 school year, MCPS offered a \nprofessional development session on their use that \ndrew more than 130 participants. Id. \u00b6 28. \n \nThe plaintiffs take issue with some of the guidance \nthe School Board has given to teachers on how to use \nthe storybooks. They refer to official MCPS documents \nand instructional materials referenced in a November \n15, 2022 Fox News article published on the New York \nPost website that discussed the books. See ECF 1-5. \nThe School Board has not disputed the accuracy of any \ninformation in the article. The article discusses a \nPowerPoint presentation on the storybooks from a \nprofessional development workshop held in August \n2022. Id. at 2\u20134. That presentation appears to have \nsubstantially overlapped with a document titled \n\u201cResponding to Caregivers/Community Questions,\u201d \nwhich the plaintiffs also provide. See ECF 55-4. The \nproposed \nresponses \nin \nthis \ndocument \nare \ncomprehensive, and the Court shares only excerpts. If \nparents ask why children should learn about sexuality \nand gender in school, or whether elementary school is \n90a\n\n \n \ntoo early for such learning, educators might respond: \nThe learning we\u2019re talking about will happen \nthrough exposure to diversified gender and \nsexuality \nrepresentation, \nnot \nexplicit \ninstruction. Students are already learning \nabout gender and sexuality identity in myriad \nways. For example, when we read a story with \na mom and dad, a Prince kisses a Princess at \nthe end of a fairytale   Children are already \nlearning about it and mostly see \u201cstraight\u201d and \n\u201ccisgender\u201d representations around them. . . . \nBy learning about the diversity of gender, \nchildren have an opportunity to explore a \ngreater \nrange \nof \ninterests, \nideas, \nand \nactivities. . . . Beginning these conversations in \nelementary school will help young people \ndevelop empathy for a diverse group of people \nand learn about identities that might relate to \ntheir families or even themselves. It is never too \nearly for schools to set up a foundation of \nunderstanding and respect. \nId. at 2. If parents express concerns that these ideas \nconflict with their values and ask whether the lessons \nare teaching children to reject those values, educators \nmight say: \nAbsolutely not. . . . Teaching about LGBTQ+ is \nnot about making students think a certain way; \nit is to show that there is no one \u201cright\u201d or \n\u201cnormal\u201d way to be. . . . While one aim for \nlearning about diversity is to become more \naccepting of those around us, not everyone will \nbe best friends. . . . The purpose of learning \nabout gender and sexuality identity diversity is \n91a\n\n \n \nto demonstrate that children are unique and \nthat there is no single way to be a boy, girl, or \nany other gender. If a child does not agree with \nor \nunderstand \nanother \nstudent\u2019s \ngender \nidentity or expression . . . , they do not have to \nchange how they feel about it. However, they do \nnot get to make fun of, harass, harm, or ignore \nthe existence of other students . . . . \nId. at 3. If parents ask about opt-outs, teachers are \nencouraged to explain why the instruction is \nimportant and how the books are used: \nWhile there are no planned explicit lessons \nrelated to gender and sexuality, students will \nsee these identities embedded in our curriculum \nand learning environment. Explicit instruction \ninvolves \nteaching \na \nspecific \nconcept \nor \nprocedure in a highly structured and carefully \nsequenced \nmanner \nwhere \nthere \nis \nan \nopportunity to model, coach and apply the \nlearning. The concepts or terms that relate to \ngender and sexual identity are not taught \nexplicitly, but there may be a need to define \nwords \nthat \nare \nnew and unfamiliar to \nstudents. . . . No child who does not agree with \nor \nunderstand \nanother \nstudent\u2019s \ngender, \nexpression, or their sexual identity is asked to \nchange how they feel about it. Parents always \nhave the choice to keep their student(s) home \nwhile using these texts; however, it will not be \nan excused absence. \nId. at 3\u20134. \n \nThe Fox News article also provides excerpts of \nproposed \u201cthink aloud\u201d moments for some of the books. \n92a\n\n \n \nAfter reading Intersection Allies, students \u201cwill \nrecognize their own responsibility to stand up to \nexclusion, prejudice and injustice.\u201d Id. at 4. For Prince \n& Knight, students might notice \u201cthat the prince \ndoesn\u2019t seem happy about all the princesses trying to \nget his attention\u201d and wonder \u201chow he might feel about \nthe pressure his parents are putting on him to find a \nprincess.\u201d Id. at 5. For Love, Violet, students might \nacknowledge \u201chow uncomfortable we might [be] in \nsituations when we feel our heart beating \u2018thumpity \nthump\u2019 & how hard it can be [to] talk about our \nfeelings with someone that we don\u2019t just \u2018like\u2019 but \u2018like \nlike.\u2019\u201d Id. They \u201cwill develop language and knowledge \nto accurately and respectfully describe how people \n(including themselves) are both similar to and \ndifferent from each other and others in their identity \ngroups.\u201d Id. at 6. And for Born Ready, students might \nnotice \u201chow happy [the main character] is when his \nmom hears him and commits to sharing with their \nloved ones that he is a boy\u201d; teachers might then say \n\u201cthat we know ourselves best.\u201d Id. The article states \nthat another slide of the presentation encouraged \nteachers, \u201cUse five of the books by the end of \nDecember.\u201d ECF 1-5, at 2. \n \nAccording to the article, educators who attended \nthe workshop received a list of potential questions \nfrom students and a list of suggested responses. Id. at \n6. The article appears to be referring to a document \ntitled \u201cSample Student Call-Ins.\u201d See ECF 55-3. The \nfollowing \nexcerpts \nare \nrepresentative \nbut \nnot \nexhaustive. If a student says being \u201cgay, lesbian, \nqueer, etc.\u201d is \u201cwrong and not allowed\u201d by his or her \nreligion, teachers might respond, \n93a\n\n \n \nI understand that is what you believe, but not \neveryone believes that. We don\u2019t have to \nunderstand or support a person\u2019s identity to \ntreat them with respect and kindness. School is \na place where we learn to work together \nregardless of our differences. In any community, \nwe\u2019ll always find people with beliefs different \nfrom our own and that is okay\u2014we can still \nshow them respect. \nId. at 2. If a student says \u201cshe can only like boys \nbecause she\u2019s a girl\u201d or \u201cboys can\u2019t paint their nails,\u201d \nteachers might try to \u201cdisrupt the either/or thinking\u201d \nand provide examples like \u201cHarry Styles wears \ndresses\u201d or \u201cmy best friend is a woman and she is \nmarried to another woman.\u201d Id. at 2\u20134. If a student \nsays \u201cthat\u2019s gay\u201d or \u201cthat\u2019s weird\u201d about gay \ncharacters, teachers might explain that the word gay \n\u201cdescribes people of the same gender who love each \nother. In our school we respect all people so we don\u2019t \ntalk about being \u2018gay\u2019 in a negative way, like saying \nit\u2019s \u2018weird.\u2019\u201d Id. at 2. Teachers might also say \u201cusing \ngay to describe something negative reflects a long \nhistory of prejudice against LGBTQ+ people\u201d and \n\u201cwhen I ask you to not use expressions like \u2018that\u2019s so \ngay,\u2019 I\u2019m just trying to make you aware that it is \nhurtful to a lot of people.\u201d Id. at 4. If a student says, \nin reference to transgenderism and the main character \nin Born Ready, \u201cThat\u2019s weird. He can\u2019t be a boy if he \nwas born a girl,\u201d or asks about the character\u2019s \u201cbody \nparts,\u201d teachers are encouraged to respond, \nThat comment is hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use \nnegative words to talk about peoples\u2019 identities. \nSometimes when we learn information that is \n94a\n\n \n \ndifferent from what we always thought, it can \nbe confusing and hard to process. \nWhen we\u2019re born, people make a guess about \nour gender and label us \u201cboy\u201d or \u201cgirl\u201d based on \nour body parts. Sometimes they\u2019re right, and \nsometimes they\u2019re wrong. When someone\u2019s \ntransgender, \nthey \nguessed \nwrong; \nwhen \nsomeone\u2019s cisgender, they guessed right. Our \nbody parts do not decide our gender. Our gender \ncomes from inside \u2013 we might feel different than \nwhat people tell us we are. We know ourselves \nbest. When someone tells us what their gender \nis, we believe them because they are the experts \non themselves. \nIt\u2019s none of our business what body parts a \nperson has, so we should never ask that \nquestion. \nId. at 2\u20133. Generally, the suggested responses focus \non tolerance, empathy, and respect for different views. \nE. Rollout and Opt-Out Policy \n \nA November 2022 white paper prepared by the \nMontgomery County Association of Administrators \nand Principals expressed concerns about the content \nof some of the books, the suggested responses to \nstudent questions, and the proposed end to opt-outs. \nSee ECF 47-1. The white paper noted \u201cseveral of the \nbooks and supporting documents seemingly contradict \n[the] message\u201d that the books were not supposed to be \nteaching about sexual orientation or gender identity as \nstandalone concepts in elementary school. Id. at 8. It \nstated that teachers had \u201cnot been trained on the use of \nthese \nmaterials \nand \nsubsequent \nquestions, \n95a\n\n \n \nconversations, and class discussions that may occur,\u201d \nand it worried about the \u201cpotentially polarizing \nposition\u201d educators would be put in if individual \nschools or teachers were left to decide whether to use \nthe books. Id. at 9. It referred to \u201cnumerous concerns\u201d \nfrom educators and community members that some of \nthe books were not appropriate for the intended age \ngroup. Singling out Love, Violet, for example, the \nwhite paper stated, \u201cIt is problematic to portray \nelementary school age children falling in love with \nother children, regardless of sexual preferences.\u201d Id. at \n8. The white paper also critiqued excerpts from the list \nof anticipated questions and suggested answers. Id. at \n10. Regarding the suggested answer \u201cpeople make a \nguess about our gender,\u201d it stated, \u201cConcern: Stated as \na fact. Some would not agree this is a fact.\u201d Id. \n \nAccording to Hazel, at the beginning of the 2022\u2013\n2023 school year, some parents began requesting their \nchildren be excused from classroom instruction using \nthe storybooks. ECF 43, \u00b6 33. Some of the requests \nwere religious in nature, but many others were rooted \nin opposition to what the parents perceived as efforts \nto teach students about sex and LGBTQ issues. Id. \u00b6 \n34. In some instances, the teachers and principals who \nreceived these requests accommodated them by \nexcusing students when the storybooks were read in \nclass. Id. \u00b6 35. \n \nIn communications with the individual plaintiffs in \nearly 2023, school officials expressed uncertainty \nabout whether parents would be allowed to opt their \nchildren \nout \nof \nclassroom \ninstruction \non \nthe \nstorybooks. See, e.g., ECF 1-12 \u2013 1-14. The Romans \ncorresponded with their school\u2019s principal, seeking to \n96a\n\n \n \nopt their son out and a guarantee that parents would \ncontinue to receive advance notice. ECF 36, \u00b6 167. \nEventually, the principal agreed their son did not have \nto be present when one of the books was read during \nclass and that other parents could request the same \ntreatment. \nId. \u00b6 168. \nMahmoud and Barakat, \nmeanwhile, were informed by their school\u2019s acting \nprincipal that MCPS was not supporting opt-outs from \nthe storybooks and that teachers were not required to \nprovide alternative assignments, but the acting \nprincipal later agreed on March 20 to allow their son to \nsit outside his classroom while one of the books was \nbeing discussed. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 169\u201374. On March 22, an \nMCPS spokesperson responding to a media inquiry \nissued a statement confirming parents\u2019 notification \nand opt-out rights: \nWhen a teacher selects a curriculum, a \nnotification goes out to parents about the book. \nIf a parent chooses to opt out, a teacher can find \na substitute text for that student that supports \nthese standards and aligns with curriculum. \nECF 36, \u00b6 159. \n \nThe following day, March 23, the School Board \nreversed course and issued a \u201cRevised Message \nRegarding the Use of Inclusive Texts\u201d that stated: \n[T]here is an expectation that teachers utilize \nthese inclusive lessons and texts with all \nstudents. . . . Students and families may not \nchoose to opt out of engaging with any \ninstructional materials, other than \u201cFamily Life \nand Human Sexuality Unit of Instruction\u201d \nwhich is specifically permitted by Maryland \nlaw. As such, teachers will not send home \n97a\n\n \n \nletters to inform families when inclusive books \nare read in the future. \nId. \u00b6 160. Hazel states the new no-opt-out policy was \nthe result of meetings with a small group of principals \nin March 2023, during which the School Board \ndetermined that principals and teachers \u201ccould not \naccommodate the growing number of opt out requests \nwithout causing significant disruptions to the \nclassroom environment and undermining MCPS\u2019s \neducational mission.\u201d ECF 43, \u00b6 36. The School Board \nhad three concerns. First, high student absenteeism. \nId. \u00b6 37. In one instance, for example, parents sought \nto excuse dozens of students in a single elementary \nschool from instruction. Id. Second, the infeasibility of \nmanaging numerous opt-outs. Id. \u00b6 38. Teachers \nwould have to track and accommodate opt-out requests \nfor their students, and other staff who spent time in \nmultiple classrooms would have to do so across an \nentire school. Id. Finally, the School Board was \nconcerned that permitting some students to leave \nthe classroom whenever books featuring LGBTQ \ncharacters were used would expose students who \nbelieve the books represent them and their families to \nsocial stigma and isolation. Id. \u00b6 39. The School Board \nbelieved that would defeat its \u201cefforts to ensure a \nclassroom environment that is safe and conducive to \nlearning for all students\u201d and would risk putting \nMCPS out of compliance with state and federal \nnondiscrimination laws. Id. Based on these concerns, \nthe School Board decided to disallow opt- outs from the \nstorybooks, regardless of the reason, after the 2022\u2013\n98a\n\n \n \n2023 school year. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 40\u201342.3 If schools already had \ngranted opt-out requests, those accommodations would \ncontinue through the end of the school year. Id. \u00b6 41. New \nrequests would not be granted. ECF 36, \u00b6 160. \n \nOn March 24, teachers at the Persaks\u2019 elementary \nschool were instructed to introduce and read the books \nin their classrooms. Id. \u00b6 163. Due to the Persaks\u2019 \nprior request for an opt-out for their daughter, she was \nexcused from the classroom when one of the storybooks \nwas read, but the principal made it clear to the \nPersaks that no further notifications or opt-outs would \nbe provided. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 164\u201365. \n \nOn May 31, Morrison asked her daughter\u2019s teacher \nwhether her class would be reading any of the \nstorybooks and was told that some of the books would \nbe used on June 2, 5, and 6. ECF 52, \u00b6\u00b6 11\u201312. \nMorrison asked whether she could opt her daughter \nout. The teacher said no, and the principal later \nconfirmed to Morrison that the school would adhere to \nthe School Board\u2019s no-opt- out policy. Id. \u00b6 12. \nMorrison kept her daughter home on the days the \nbooks were being read. Id. \nF. MCPS \nResponses \nto \nCommunity \n \n3  \nHisham Garti, the Outreach Director the Montgomery \nCounty Muslim Council, states in a declaration that Muslim \ncommunity leaders met with School Board officials, including \nHazel, on May 1, 2023. ECF 47-2. Garti recalls being told the \n\u201cdecision to rescind the opt-out was made after a few parents of \nthe LGBTQ community complained [children] were offended and \nhad their feelings hurt when students started leaving classrooms \nduring instructions of these texts.\u201d Id. \u00b6 5. According to Garti, \nthat was \u201cthe only explanation MCPS provided for why it \nrescinded the opt- out.\u201d Id. \u00b6 6. \n99a\n\n \n \nOpposition \n \nBoth before and after the School Board\u2019s decision to \nend opt-outs, parents raised concerns about the books \nwith the School Board at public meetings.4 At the \nJanuary 12, 2023 board meeting, one parent objected \nto My Rainbow by stating, \u201cthe transgender ideology \nis throughout the whole book\u201d and \u201cthis is not \ninstruction, it is indoctrination.\u201d (27:10 \u2013 29:10). She \nfound \n\u201cmost \nappalling\u201d \nthe \nproposed \nteacher \nresponses, such as saying people \u201cguess\u201d about gender \nat birth. Id. She believed such statements undermine \n\u201cany teaching or viewpoint that many families . . . have \nused at home.\u201d Id. She criticized the School Board for \nproviding only its viewpoints, which implied that \nparents\u2019 religions and family traditions are wrong. Id. \nShe asserted the School Board was not allowing kids to \n\u201cthink for themselves\u201d and was indoctrinating \nstudents. Id. Another community member later \nexpressed support for her comments and added that \n\u201cmany if not more parents . . . believe in traditional \nJudeo-Christian values as taught in the Bible\u201d and are \n\u201copposed to gender-fluid ideology.\u201d (30:47 \u2013 33:02). He \nexpressed concern that introducing \u201chighly sexualized \nconcepts in elementary school\u201d will \u201ccause children to \n \n4  \nThe plaintiffs provide abbreviated quotations of selected \nstatements made during several School Board meetings, which \nwere recorded and posted online. \nThe Court watched the \nrecordings of the meetings referred to by the plaintiffs. The \nJanuary \n12, \n2023 \nboard \nmeeting \nis \nfound \nat \nhttps://perma.cc/T234-559Q; the March 28, 2023 board meeting is \nfound at https://shorturl.at/fAET6; and the May 25, 2023 board \nmeeting \nis \navailable \nat \nhttps://go.boarddocs.com/mabe/mcpsmd/Board.nsf/Public. \nThe \nCourt cites general timestamps where appropriate. \n100a\n\n \n \nquestion their identity when they otherwise don\u2019t.\u201d Id. \n \nSchool officials responded to the parents\u2019 concerns \nin different ways. At the meeting, Board Member \nLynne Harris responded to these comments by stating: \nSome of the testimony today was disturbing to \nme \npersonally. \nTransgender, \nLGBTQ \nindividuals are not an ideology, they\u2019re a \nreality. And there are religions out there that \nteach \nthat \nwomen \nshould \nachieve \nonly \nsubservient roles in life, and MCPS would never \nthink of not having a book in a classroom that \nshowed a woman as being a superintendent of a \nvery large school system, or a doctor, or vice \npresident of the United States. \nSo, our \nstudents, our staff, our part of the LBGTQ \ncommunity, they are transgender. The very few \nbooks that we\u2019re intentionally including in our \ncurriculum\u2014which, by the way, the language \nbeing \nsuggested \nto \nsupport \nteachers \nin \nanswering questions is evidence- and science-\nbased\u2014that is what we have pledged to do, is to \nmake sure every student sees themselves \nreflected in the curriculum, in the course, in the \nwork they\u2019re doing in their classrooms. I am \nvery proud that we\u2019re doing that work, and I \ncontinue to support it. \n(38:35 \u2013 39:40). An MCPS student who sits with the \nboard expressed similar sentiments: \nIt is our responsibility as a school system to \nequitably provide a high-quality education to all \nof our students, and that is impossible if every \nsingle student cannot see themselves reflected \nin the classroom. Every student, regardless of \n101a\n\n \n \ntheir sexual orientation or their gender identity, \nregardless of what they look like or where they \ncome from, has the right to be reflected in what \nthey learn. I know that I cannot speak for all of \nmy peers, for all of the students in this county, \nbut let me speak for many of them as I applaud \nthe school system for their work in realizing this \nvision. To the students of MCPS, yes, ignorance \nand hate does exist within our community. \nPlease know that every student, each of our \n160,000 students in our large county, has a \nplace in the school system, has a place in their \nschool, and certainly has a place in their \nclassroom. \n(39:40 \n\u2013 \n40:40). \nAfter \nHazel \nand \nDeputy \nSuperintendent Patrick Murphy spoke about the \nstorybooks and how their implementation would be \ncommunicated to families, Board Vice President \nShebra Evans expressed her \u201cfull support\u201d for the \nstudent board member\u2019s comments, stating \u201cit was \nvery important that that be stated out loud.\u201d (44:05 \u2013 \n44:36). \n \nIn a January 24 email, the Persaks\u2019 elementary \nschool principal reflected on a recent parent meeting \nabout the storybooks and stated, \u201cseveral people (both \nstaff and parents) expressed to me that they felt less \nsafe as a result of some of the comments made by\u201d \ncommunity members who opposed the storybooks and \nthat \u201cthe county is considering an \u2018opt out\u2019 for parents\u201d \nto accommodate certain parents\u2019 \u201cfears.\u201d ECF 1-12. \nThe principal expressed her unequivocal opposition to \nan opt-out from \u201cbooks with LGBTQ+ characters in \nthem,\u201d likening it to a decision to opt out of \u201cbooks with \n102a\n\n \n \ncharacters from other marginalized groups\u201d such as \nJews, Muslims, and African Americans. Id. \n \nAt the March 28 board meeting, an individual \nrepresenting various parent groups protested the \ndecision to end opt-outs: \u201cHow is taking away parental \nrights to opt-out of teachings that go against religious \nrights, family values, and core beliefs helping us to \ntrust you . . . ?\u201d (1:08:50 \u2013 1:10:45). Harris commented \non the individual\u2019s concerns: \nI just want to address, what is it, Moms for \nLiberty? If we could talk about what this is \nreally about. You say, \u201cparents rights to pull \ntheir students out of lessons when they\u2019re going \nto be reading a book that has an LGBTQ \ncharacter in it,\u201d because of your \u201creligious \nrights, your family values, your core beliefs.\u201d \nBut Rogers and Hammerstein got it right \nseventy years ago, you have to be taught to hate. \nNo child is born other-izing, marginalizing, \nthinking somebody else is not as good as they \nare, because of the way they look or the way \nthey talk or the religion they practice or who \nthey love. I am proud of the work that this \nsystem is doing and is committed to doing, to \nsay we are going to ensure that every student in \nour school at every age can seek themselves \nreflected in the work of their classroom and in \nthe people in the schools that do that work with \nthem. And even if they don\u2019t feel safe being who \nthey are at home, or in their other community, \nwe\u2019re going to create a space that acknowledges \nthe humanity of everybody. Because saying that \na kindergartener can\u2019t be present when you \n103a\n\n \n \nread a book about a rainbow unicorn because it \noffends your religious rights or your family \nvalues or your core beliefs is just telling that \nkid, \u201chere\u2019s another reason to hate another \nperson.\u201d And we are not going to do that in the \nschool system. \n(1:46:41 \u2013 1:48:19). The student board member also \nshared his thoughts: \nWe cannot opt out of diversity and inclusion. It\u2019s \nthe school system\u2019s responsibility to deliver a \nmeaningful education to all of our students, \nevery student has the right to be reflected in \nwhat they learn. Which means that we cannot \ntreat instruction that reflects some students \nany differently than as we treat instruction that \nreflects others. No aspect of a student\u2019s identity \nshould limit the quality of their education\u2014not \nwhat they look like, not where they come from, \nnot what language they speak, not their \nsexuality, not their gender identity, and not \ntheir religion. To be clear, diversity is a \nnecessity to a comprehensive education, so \ninclusion must stay. \n(1:48:23 \u2013 1:49:13). \n \nAt the May 25 board meeting, many more \ncommunity members spoke about the storybooks and \nthe no-opt-out policy, both for and against the change. \nIn response, the student board member sought \nclarification about when state law required opt-outs \nand whether the storybooks were part of the family life \nand human sexuality unit of the health curriculum. \n(1:11:14). Hazel explained that state law required opt-\nouts only from the human growth and sexuality course \n104a\n\n \n \nand that the storybooks were part of the literacy \ncurriculum. (1:11:54). The student board member \nstated in response: \nWe heard this from all parts of our community, \nbut, fundamentally, diversity is a good thing. \nInclusion is a good thing. And by providing these \ndiverse and inclusive \ntexts, \nby \naligning \nourselves and following state guidance on when \nopt-out is appropriate, we are doing a service to \nour students by creating an inclusive education. \nIt is disheartening to hear about the cases of \nstudents being bullied about practicing their \nreligious beliefs in schools, and we know of \nstudents \nfacing \ndiscrimination \nbased \non \nsexuality or their gender identity. But across \nthe board, by staying true to the value of \ndiversity and inclusion, we are addressing these \nissues in our schools, and I think that is the \ngreatest service we can do for all of our \nstudents. \nAnd this work around creating \ninclusive texts at the elementary school levels, \nthe work around the anti-racist audit, the new \npilot courses coming to our schools next fall . . . \nthat are inclusive of so many communities in our \nschool system are really starting to change the \nface of what it looks like to deliver an inclusive \neducation\u2026 . [I want to make sure we \ncontinue] to send a clear message to all our \nstudents that regardless of their gender identity \nor sexuality, regardless of their religion, this is \ntheir MCPS and they have a right to see \nthemselves in what they learn everyday. \n(1:14:24 \u2013 1:15:50). \nSuperintendent Monifa B. \n105a\n\n \n \nMcKnight then discussed the value of diversity within \nthe MCPS community: \nWhen we think about the diversity that sits \nwithin our community, that\u2019s often referred to \nas a strength, and the school system absolutely \nhas a responsibility to respect and support that. \nEvery day, when our children go home, then \nthey have the lessons that are taught in their \nhome that is reflective of culture, religion, and \nall of those pieces. We would expect that to be \nthe case and would continue in our community \nas it always has   We would expect that there \nare values that come out of every home, and \nthose are the lessons that are taught in that \nhome. And this is not an invasion of that. \n(1:16:20 \u2013 1:17:12). \n \nA June 2, 2023 article on the MoCo360 website \npurports to quote statements made by Harris at the \nMay \n25 \nmeeting.5 \nSee \nECF \n23-1, \nat \n30, \n(https://perma.cc/5GD9-2YVQ). Harris stated she felt \n\u201ckind of sorry\u201d for an MCPS student who had \nexpressed personal discomfort with the curriculum. \nShe wondered whether the student was \u201cparroting \ndogma\u201d learned from her parents. Id. She pushed \nback on the idea that the School Board was infringing \nparental rights, stating: \u201cThere is no right for a parent \nto micromanage their child\u2019s public-school experience. \n \n5  \nThe Court could not locate the quoted statements during its \nreview of the hours-long recording of the May 25 meeting or the \nrecordings of the adjacent board meetings. The accuracy of these \nquotations, which the School Board has not disputed, does not \nbear on the Court\u2019s analysis. \n106a\n\n \n \nIf they want their child to receive an education that \nstrictly adheres to their religious dogma, they can send \ntheir kid to a private religious school.\u201d Id. Harris said \nshe considered it a \u201cbadge of honor\u201d to have been \nquoted four times in the complaint in this lawsuit, \nwhich had been filed the previous day, and she \nexpressed concern about the precedent that would be \nset if the plaintiffs prevailed: \u201cDo [the plaintiffs] \nrealize it would be an impossible disruption to the \nschool system if teachers had to screen the content \nthey plan to teach every day and send out notices so \nwhite supremacists could opt out of civil rights content \nand xenophobes could opt out of stories about \nimmigrant families?\u201d Id.6 \nG. Relevant Procedural History \n \nOn May 24, 2023, the individual parents, on behalf \nof themselves and their children, filed this lawsuit \nagainst the Montgomery County Board of Education, \nSuperintendent Monifa B. McKnight, and board \nmembers Karla Silvestre, Shebra Evans, Grace \nRivera-Oven, Rebecca Smondrowski, Julie Yang, \nBrenda Wolff, and Lynne Harris. ECF 1. They \nasserted violations of the Free Exercise Clause of the \nFirst Amendment, a violation of the Free Speech \nClause of the First Amendment, a violation of the Due \n \n6  \nThe plaintiffs also highlight comments by a Montgomery \nCounty Council member who stated it was unfortunate that the \nissue put \u201csome Muslim families on the same side of an issue as \nWhite supremacists and outright bigots.\u201d See ECF 23-1, at 30, \nhttps://perma.cc/3AJE-RSBA. She continued, \u201cI would not put \nyou in the same category as those folks, although, you know, it\u2019s \ncomplicated because they\u2019re falling on the same side of this \nparticular issue.\u201d Id. \n107a\n\n \n \nProcess Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, and a \nviolation of Maryland law. The federal constitutional \nclaims are brought pursuant to 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983. On \nJune 12, the individual parents moved for a \npreliminary injunction based on the likely success of \ntheir free exercise and due process claims. ECF 23. On \nJuly 6, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint, \nwhich added Kids First as a plaintiff. ECF 36. Kids \nFirst has not joined the preliminary injunction \nmotion.7 \nII. Preliminary Injunction Standard \n \nBefore the entry of a final judgment, a court may \nenter a preliminary injunction. Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a). \n\u201cThe traditional office of a preliminary injunction is to \nprotect the status quo and to prevent irreparable harm \nduring the pendency of a lawsuit ultimately to preserve \nthe court\u2019s ability to render a meaningful judgment on \nthe merits.\u201d United States v. South Carolina, 720 F.3d \n \n7  \nEven though Kids First has not joined the parents\u2019 motion, the \nparents rely on a declaration from one of the association\u2019s \nmembers, Grace Morrison, to support their legal arguments, and \nthey argue the requested injunctive relief also would protect Kids \nFirst and its members. ECF 52 & 57. The Court is not convinced \nthat Kids First has standing to bring claims on behalf of its \nmembers, including Morrison. An association has standing to \nbring suit on behalf of its members when \u201cneither the claim \nasserted nor the relief requested requires the participation of \nindividual members in the suit.\u201d Hunt v. Wash. State Apple \nAdvert. Comm\u2019n, 432 U.S. 333, 343 (1977). Free exercise claims \n\u201cordinarily require[] individual participation.\u201d Harris v. McRae, \n448 U.S. 297, 320\u201321 (1980); Cornerstone Christian Schs. v. Univ. \nInterscholastic League, 563 F.3d 127, 133\u201334 (5th Cir. 2009). The \nparties have not presented arguments on this issue, which was \nthrown into sharp relief by Morrison\u2019s post-hearing declaration \nabout her family\u2019s unique situation. \n108a\n\n \n \n518, 524 (4th Cir. 2013) (quoting In re Microsoft Corp. \nAntitrust Litig., 333 F.3d 517, 525 (4th Cir. 2003)). In \nother words, a preliminary injunction enables the \ncourt to ensure that, should the plaintiff prevail, the \nrelief sought will be available to it to the same extent as \nwhen it filed suit. See id. \u201cA preliminary injunction is \n\u2018an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded \nupon a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to \nsuch relief\u2019 and may never be awarded \u2018as of right.\u2019\u201d \nMountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. W. Pocahontas \nProps. Ltd. P\u2019ship, 918 F.3d 353, 366 (4th Cir. 2019) \n(quoting Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 \nU.S. 7, 22, 24 (2008)). \n \nA plaintiff seeking preliminary injunctive relief \nbears the burden of proof and must meet \u201ca high bar\u201d \nby \u201c[s]atisfying . . . four factors.\u201d SAS Inst., Inc. v. \nWorld Programming Ltd., 874 F.3d 370, 385 (4th Cir. \n2017); Direx Israel, Ltd. v. Breakthrough Med. Corp., \n952 F.2d 802, 812 (4th Cir. 1991). The plaintiff must \nclearly show \u201c[1] that [it] is likely to succeed on the \nmerits, [2] that [it] is likely to suffer irreparable harm \nin the absence of preliminary relief, [3] that the \nbalance of equities tips in [its] favor, and [4] that an \ninjunction is in the public interest.\u201d Winter, 555 U.S. \nat 20; Leaders of a Beautiful Struggle v. Balt. Police \nDep\u2019t, 2 F.4th 330, 339 (4th Cir. 2021) (en banc) (citing \nIn re Search Warrant Issued June 13, 2019, 942 F.3d \n159, 170\u201371 (4th Cir. 2019)). \n \nSeveral of the preliminary injunction factors merge \nwhen constitutional rights are at stake. Leaders, 2 \nF.4th at 346. To start, when \u201cthere is a likely \nconstitutional violation, the irreparable harm factor is \nsatisfied.\u201d Id.; see also W.V. Ass\u2019n of Club Owners & \n109a\n\n \n \nFraternal Servs., Inc. v. Musgrave, 553 F.3d 292, 298 \n(4th Cir. 2009) (\u201c[I]n the context of an alleged violation \nof First Amendment rights, a plaintiff\u2019s claimed \nirreparable harm is \u2018inseparably linked\u2019 to the \nlikelihood of success on the merits of [the] plaintiff\u2019s \nFirst Amendment claim.\u201d). This is so because \u201cthe loss \nof constitutional freedoms, \u2018for even minimal periods \nof time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable \ninjury.\u2019\u201d Leaders, 2 F.4th at 346 (quoting Mills v. \nDistrict of Columbia, 571 F.3d 1304, 1312 (D.C. Cir. \n2009) (quoting Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 \n(1976))). Likewise, the final two factors\u2014the balance \nof the equities and the public interest\u2014are satisfied \nwhen there is a likely constitutional violation because \n\u201cthe public interest favors protecting constitutional \nrights\u201d and \u201ca state is in no way harmed by issuance of \na preliminary injunction which prevents the state \nfrom enforcing restrictions likely to be found \nunconstitutional.\u201d Id.

Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 \n(2009)). \n \nThe School Board contends the plaintiffs seek a \nmandatory \npreliminary \ninjunction. \nMandatory \npreliminary injunctions \u201calter rather than preserve \nthe status quo\u201d and are particularly \u201cdisfavored.\u201d \nMountain Valley Pipeline, LLC v. 6.56 Acres of Land, \nOwned by Sandra Townes Powell, 915 F.3d 197, 216 \nn.8 (4th Cir. 2019).

The Fourth Circuit \nhas defined \u201cthe status quo\u201d as the \u201clast uncontested \nstatus between the parties which preceded the \ncontroversy.\u201d Id. In Pashby, the plaintiffs moved for a \npreliminary injunction the day before the policy they \nchallenged took effect. 709 F.3d at 320. While the \npolicy had been approved by the legislature months \nearlier, it had not taken effect at the time the plaintiffs \nfiled their motion. Id. For that reason, the court held \nthe plaintiffs sought a prohibitory injunction. Id. Here, \nthe plaintiffs filed their motion on June 12, 2023, four \ndays before the close of the 2022\u20132023 school year. At \nthat time, the opt-out requests of the individual \nplaintiffs that previously had been granted were still \nhonored. See ECF 36, \u00b6 164; ECF 43, \u00b6 41 (stating \n\u201caccommodations would no longer be provided after \nthe 2022\u20132023 school year ended\u201d). The individual \nplaintiffs seek to stop the School Board from \nimplementing a change in policy that has not yet \ncaused them injury. \nThat is a prohibitory, not \nmandatory, injunction. \nIII. \nDiscussion \nA. Likelihood of Success on the Merits \n111a\n\n \n \n \nThe parties agree the preliminary injunction \nanalysis in this case collapses into the first factor, the \nlikelihood of success on the merits. The plaintiffs claim \nthe School Board\u2019s decision to disallow opt-outs from \nthe storybooks likely violates their rights under the \nFree Exercise Clause of the First Amendment and the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThe School Board argues the plaintiffs have not \nestablished a likely constitutional violation. \n1. Free Exercise \n \nThe First Amendment, applicable to the states \nthrough the Fourteenth Amendment, provides in part \nthat \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting the \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof.\u201d U.S. Const., amend. I. The Free \nExercise \nClause \n\u201cprotects \nagainst \nlaws \nthat \ndiscriminate against or among religious beliefs or that \nrestrict certain practices because of their religious \nconduct.\u201d Alive Church of the Nazarene, Inc. v. Prince \nWilliam Cnty., Va., 59 F.4th 92, 108 (4th Cir. 2023). \nTo violate the Free Exercise Clause, a law, regulation, \nor government policy must \u201cburden religious exercise.\u201d \nFulton v. City of Philadelphia, --- U.S. ----, 141 S. Ct. \n1868, 1876 (2021); Trinity Lutheran Church of \nColumbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 462\u201363 (2017); \nSch. Dist. of Abington Twp., Pa. v. Schempp, 374 U.S. \n203, 223 (1963) (noting \u201ca violation of the Free Exercise \nClause is predicated on coercion\u201d). Even when state \naction burdens religious exercise, it still may be \n\u201cconstitutionally permissible\u201d if it survives the \nrequisite level of judicial scrutiny. Fulton, 141 S. Ct. \nat 1876. A \u201cfacially neutral and generally applicable\u201d \nlaw that has the incidental effect of burdening \n112a\n\n \n \nreligious exercise is subject to rational basis review. \nAlive Church of the Nazarene, 59 F.4th at 108; see \nEmp\u2019t Div., Dep\u2019t of Human Res. of Ore. v. Smith, 494 \nU.S. 872, 878\u201382 (1990). \u201cLaws that are not neutral \nand generally applicable, however, are subject to strict \nscrutiny review.\u201d Alive Church of the Nazarene, 59 \nF.4th at 108. \n \nThe parties debate whether the plaintiffs\u2019 free \nexercise claims are subject to strict scrutiny or rational \nbasis review. The plaintiffs argue, first, that strict \nscrutiny applies under Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. \n205, 233 (1972), whenever laws restrict the \u201cright of \nparents . . . to direct the [religious] upbringing of their \nchildren.\u201d Next, they argue strict scrutiny applies \nunder Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 141 S. Ct. at 1877, \nwhich reaffirmed that policies are not generally \napplicable when they allow for individualized \nexemptions. \nThe plaintiffs argue the Religious \nDiversity Guidelines, which allowed parents to opt out \nof the storybooks last school year, operate as a system \nof discretionary exemptions and invite \u201cindividualized \ngovernmental assessment of the reasons for\u201d opt-out \nrequests. See Smith, 494 U.S. at 884. Third, the \nplaintiffs argue strict scrutiny applies under Tandon v. \nNewsom, --- U.S   , 141 S. Ct. 1294, 1296 (2021), which \nheld that laws are not generally applicable when they \ntreat \u201cany comparable secular activity more favorably \nthan religious exercise.\u201d The plaintiffs argue the \nSchool Board allows opt-outs for secular reasons from \nits family life and human sexuality curriculum but \nrefuses to allow opt-outs for religious reasons from the \nstorybooks, which they view as covering some of the \nsame topics. Finally, the plaintiffs argue the no-opt-\nout policy is not neutral because its adoption was \n113a\n\n \n \nsurrounded by official expressions of hostility toward \nreligion and, as a result, it is subject to strict scrutiny \nunder Masterpiece Cakeshop, Ltd. v. Colo. C.R. \nComm\u2019n, --- U.S. ----, 138 S. Ct. 1719 (2018), and \nChurch of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of \nHialeah, 508 U.S. 520 (1993). The defendants argue \nthe no-opt-out policy is neutral and generally \napplicable because it was not adopted based on \nhostility toward religion and no one can opt out of \ninstruction involving the storybooks for any reason. \nThus, they contend, the policy is subject to rational \nbasis review. \n \nBefore the Court may reach the question of the \nappropriate level of judicial review, it first must \naddress the threshold question of whether the \nplaintiffs can establish that the no-opt-out policy \nburdens their religious exercise. They assert the policy \nsubstantially interferes with their sacred obligations \nto form their children in their faiths and the religious \nexercise of their children. The School Board argues the \nno-opt-out policy does not burden the plaintiffs\u2019 \nreligious exercise because the parents and their \nchildren are not being directly or indirectly coerced \ninto activity that violates their religious beliefs. \na. Burden \u2013 Legal Principles \n\u201c[T]he ordinary meaning of \u2018prohibiting the free \nexercise of religion\u2019 was (and still is) forbidding or \nhindering \nunrestrained \nreligious \npractices \nor \nworship.\u201d Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1896 (Alito, J., \nconcurring). Thus, \u201cit is necessary in a free exercise \ncase for one to show the coercive effect of the \nenactment as it operates against him in the practice of \nhis religion.\u201d  Schempp, 374 U.S. at 223; see Burwell \n114a\n\n \n \nv. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc., 573 U.S. 682, 720 (2014) \n(finding religious exercise burdened by a law that \nrequired the plaintiffs to \u201cengage[] in conduct that \nseriously violates their religious beliefs\u201d). Coercion can \nbe direct or indirect. Lyng v. Nw. Indian Cemetery \nProtective Ass\u2019n, 485 U.S. 439, 450 (1988). Direct \ncoercion is the express prohibition of conduct required \nby faith or the compulsion to perform conduct \nprohibited by faith. \nSee Smith, 494 U.S. at 878 \n(recognizing an individual\u2019s religious exercise is \nburdened by any law that \u201crequires (or forbids) the \nperformance of an act that his religious belief forbids \n(or requires)\u201d). \nIndirect coercion \nexists \nwhen \ngovernment action places \u201csubstantial pressure on an \nadherent to modify his behavior and violate his \nbeliefs[.]\u201d Thomas v. Rev. Bd. of Ind. Emp\u2019t Sec. Div., \n450 U.S. 707, 717\u201318 (1981).8 \n \nThe early indirect coercion cases involved \u201cstate \nunemployment compensation rules that conditioned \nthe availability of benefits upon an applicant\u2019s \nwillingness to work under conditions forbidden by his \n \n8  \nAt oral argument, the plaintiffs suggested a burden on \nreligious exercise may not be required to establish a free exercise \nviolation, citing three recent Supreme Court cases they say did not \naddress burden. However, in one case, the Court stated, \u201cit is \nplain that the City\u2019s actions have burdened [the plaintiff\u2019s] \nreligious exercise . . . .\u201d Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1876. In the other \ncases, the burden was equally obvious. California had prohibited \nprivate religious gatherings of a certain size. Tandon, 141 S. Ct. \nat 1297. And Colorado had ordered an individual to engage in \nconduct contrary to his beliefs. Masterpiece Cakeshop, 138 S. Ct. \nat 1726. These cases do not support the plaintiffs\u2019 position that a \nburden on religious exercise may not be required to establish a \nfree exercise claim, a position that cannot be squared with the \ntext of the Free Exercise Clause. \n115a\n\n \n \nreligion.\u201d Smith, 494 U.S. at 883. For example, in \nSherbert v. Verner, a woman lost her job and was \nunable to obtain other employment because she \nrefused to work on her religious day of rest. 374 U.S. \n398, 399 (1963). She sought unemployment benefits, \nbut under state law, she was ineligible because she \nhad failed, without good cause, to accept available \nsuitable work. Id. at 400\u201301. The Supreme Court held \nthe state law burdened the plaintiff\u2019s religious exercise \nbecause \u201cthe pressure upon her to forego [the practice \nof her religion] is unmistakable\u201d\u2014the law \u201cforce[d] her \nto choose between following the precepts of her \nreligion and forfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and \nabandoning one of the precepts of her religion in order \nto accept work, on the other hand.\u201d Id. at 404. \n\u201cGovernmental imposition of such a choice puts the \nsame kind of burden upon the free exercise of religion \nas would a fine imposed against [an individual] for her \nSunday worship.\u201d Id.; see also Thomas, 450 U.S. at \n717\u201318. \n \nThe Supreme Court has clarified that these cases \nsupport a general rule that \u201ca State violates the Free \nExercise Clause when it excludes religious observers \nfrom otherwise available public benefits.\u201d Carson v. \nMakin, --- U.S ----, 142 S. Ct. 1987, 1998 (2022). Thus, \nin Carson, the Court concluded a state law that \nprovided certain parents with tuition assistance for \ntheir school-aged children but prohibited religious \nschools from receiving the state-issued tuition \nassistance burdened the parents\u2019 religious exercise. \nId. The law forced the parents to choose between \nreligious schooling and a public benefit, just as the \nunemployment benefits framework in Sherbert forced \nthe worker to choose between honoring her religious \n116a\n\n \n \nday of rest and receiving unemployment assistance. \nId.; see also Trinity Lutheran, 582 U.S. at 462 (\u201c[T]he \nDepartment\u2019s policy puts Trinity Lutheran to a choice: \nIt may participate in an otherwise available benefit \nprogram or remain a religious institution.\u201d). Similar \nreasoning led the Court to find indirect coercion when \na policy forced a religious organization to choose \nbetween \u201ccurtailing its mission\u201d and violating its \nbeliefs. Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1876. In Fulton, a \nCatholic foster care agency faced exclusion from \nmunicipal contracts for the placement of needy \nchildren into foster homes unless it agreed to certify \nsame-sex foster families\u2014conduct it viewed as \n\u201capproving relationships inconsistent with its beliefs.\u201d \nId. There, too, the coercive pressure to forgo religious \nexercise was clear. \n \nThis case involves objections to a public-school \ncurriculum. The Fourth Circuit has not addressed the \nquestion \nof \nwhen \na \nmandatory \npublic-school \ncurriculum might burden the religious exercise of \nstudents or parents. Other courts have. Every court \nthat has addressed the question has concluded that \nthe mere exposure in public school to ideas that \ncontradict religious beliefs does not burden the \nreligious exercise of students or parents.

Hanover Sch. Dist., \n665 F. Supp. 2d 58, 71 (D.N.H. 2009). The Court will \ndiscuss a few of these cases in detail, but in brief, these \ncourts reasoned that the mere exposure to ideas in \npublic school did not burden religious exercise because \n(1) students were not required to behave contrary to \ntheir faiths or affirm any views contrary to their \nreligious beliefs, and (2) parents were not prevented \nfrom discussing and contextualizing any contrary \nviews at home. \nIn Mozert v. Hawkins, students and parents brought a \nfree exercise challenge against a mandatory public-\nschool curriculum involving a series of basic reading \ntextbooks. 827 F.2d at 1059\u201360. The families had \nreligious objections to several themes in the books, \nincluding mental telepathy, evolution, and pacifism. \nId. at 1060\u201361. Initially, the school worked with the \nfamilies to provide an alternative reading program for \nstudents whose parents objected to the books. Id. at \n1060. But the school board later voted to eliminate all \nalternative reading programs, making the books \nmandatory. Id. Several students who refused to read \nthe books or attend reading classes in which they were \nused were suspended, others transferred schools or \nwithdrew from public school, and a few received \nunsanctioned accommodations. \nId. \nThe families \nclaimed the mandatory curriculum violated their \nrights under the Free Exercise Clause. The lower \n118a\n\n \n \ncourt agreed, concluding \u201cthe plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise \nrights ha[d] been burdened because their \u2018religious \nbeliefs compel[led] them to refrain from exposure to \nthe [book] series,\u2019 and the defendant school board \n\u2018ha[d] effectively required that the student plaintiffs \neither read the offensive texts or give up their free \npublic education.\u2019\u201d Id. at 1062. But the Sixth Circuit \nreversed and held exposure to ideas did not burden the \nfamilies\u2019 religious exercise. Id. at 1065. The court \ndiscussed indirect coercion cases, noting that in each, \n\u201cthere was compulsion to do an act that violated the \nplaintiffs\u2019 religious convictions.\u201d Id. at 1065\u201366. But \nnothing in the record suggested \u201cany student was ever \nrequired to affirm his or her belief or disbelief in any \nidea or practice mentioned in the various stories.\u201d Id. \nat 1063\u201364. The plaintiffs pointed to guidance in \nteachers\u2019 materials that they viewed as encouraging \nteachers to present the objectionable ideas as \u201ctruth,\u201d \nbut the court noted students did not read the teachers\u2019 \nmaterials and there was \u201cno proof that any plaintiff \nstudent was ever called upon to say or do anything . . . \nor to engage or refrain from engaging in any act either \nrequired or forbidden by the student\u2019s religious \nconvictions.\u201d Id. The court concluded \u201ccompulsion\u201d \nmust mean something beyond simply \u201creading and \ndiscussing assigned materials.\u201d Id. at 1064. \n \nSimilarly, in Fleischfresser v. Directors of School \nDistrict 200, the Seventh Circuit affirmed the \ndismissal of a free exercise challenge brought by \nparents against a public school district for its use of a \nseries of books in a supplemental reading program. 15 \nF.3d at 690. The parents alleged the book series \nfocused on supernatural beings including \u201cwizards, \nsorcerers, giants and unspecified creatures with \n119a\n\n \n \nsupernatural powers\u201d and \u201cindoctrinate[d] children in \nvalues directly opposed to their Christian beliefs by \nteaching tricks, despair, deceit, parental disrespect \nand by denigrating Christian symbols and holidays.\u201d \nId. at 683. The court acknowledged the parents\u2019 right \n\u201cto control the religious upbringing and training of \ntheir minor children.\u201d Id. at 689 (citing Yoder, 406 U.S. \nat 213\u201314). But it found no free exercise violation \nbecause the parents had not alleged the use of the \nbooks had \u201ca coercive effect that operate[d] against the \n[ ] practice of their religion.\u201d Id. at 689\u201390. The \ndefendants were \u201cnot precluding the parents from \nmeeting their religious obligation to instruct their \nchildren,\u201d and \u201cthe use of the series [did not] compel \nthe parents or children to do or refrain from doing \nanything of a religious nature. Thus, no coercion \nexist[ed] . . . .\u201d Id. at 690. The court concluded by \nendorsing a concern Justice Jackson had expressed \nnearly 50 years earlier: \u201cIf we are to eliminate \neverything that is objectionable to any [religious \ngroup] or inconsistent with any of their doctrines, we \nwill leave public schools in shreds. Nothing but \neducational confusion and a discrediting of the public \nschool system can result from subjecting it to constant \nlaw suits.\u201d Id. (quoting McCollum v. Bd. of Educ., 333 \nU.S. 203, 235 (1948) (Jackson, J., concurring)). \n \nThe most recent circuit-level analysis of free \nexercise challenges to public-school curricula is found \nin Parker v. Hurley, 514 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2008). In that \ncase, parents brought free exercise challenges to two \nbooks that portrayed families with same-sex parents. \nId. at 90. The parents sought advance notice from the \nschool about when the books would be used and the \nopportunity to opt their children out of instruction \n120a\n\n \n \nusing the books, which they believed contradicted \ntheir religious beliefs. Id. The First Circuit affirmed \nthe dismissal of the parents\u2019 claims, which it \ncharacterized \nas \nseeking \nan \n\u201cexemption \nfrom \nreligiously offensive material.\u201d Id. at 95, 104. It began \nwith \n\u201cthe \nstandard \nconstitutional \nthreshold \nquestion\u201d\u2014\u201cwhether the plaintiff\u2019s free exercise is \ninterfered with at all.\u201d Id. at 99 (quoting N.M. \nStolzenberg, \u201cHe Drew a Circle That Shut Me Out\u201d: \nAssimilation, Indoctrination, and the Paradox of a \nLiberal Education, 106 Harv. L. Rev. 581, 592\u201393 \n(1993)). It found no allegations of direct coercion: \nThe parents do not allege coercion in the form of \na direct interference with their religious beliefs, \nnor of compulsion in the form of punishment for \ntheir beliefs . . . . Nor do they allege the denial \nof benefits. Further, plaintiffs do not allege that \nthe mere listening to a book being read violated \nany religious duty on the part of the child. \nThere is no claim that as a condition of \nattendance at the public schools, the defendants \nhave forced plaintiffs\u2014either the parents or the \nchildren\u2014to violate their religious beliefs. \nId. at 105. Instead, the court determined the \u201cheart of \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise claim is a claim of \n\u2018indoctrination\u2019: that the state has put pressure on \ntheir children to endorse an affirmative view of gay \nmarriage and thus has undercut the parents\u2019 efforts to \ninculcate their children with their own opposing \nreligious views.\u201d Id. It declined to decide whether such \na theory might be cognizable, instead concluding that \nthe plaintiffs had not alleged coercion through \nindoctrination. Id. \u201c[A]s to the parents\u2019 free exercise \n121a\n\n \n \nrights, the mere fact that a child is exposed on occasion \nin public school to a concept offensive to a parent\u2019s \nreligious belief does not inhibit the parent from \ninstructing the child differently\u201d because parents \nremain \u201cfree to discuss [objectionable] matters and to \nplace them in the family\u2019s moral or religious context . . \n. .\u201d Id. (quoting C.N. v. Ridgewood Bd. of Educ., 430 \nF.3d 159, 185 (3d Cir. 2005)). In addressing the \nchildren\u2019s rights, the court imagined a spectrum \nbetween impermissible indoctrination and permissible \n\u201cinfluence-toward- tolerance.\u201d Id. at 106. One child\u2019s \nrights were not burdened at all because he was never \nrequired to read the book, which in his case merely \ndepicted same-sex couples and did not endorse \nhomosexuality. Id. The other child had \u201ca more \nsignificant claim\u201d because he was forced to sit through \na classroom reading of a book that did endorse same-\nsex marriage and homosexuality. But his claim still \nfell well short of potentially actionable indoctrination \nbecause he was not required to affirm same-sex \nmarriage, faced no consequences for disagreeing with \nthe books or refusing to read them, and was not \n\u201csubject to a constant stream of like materials.\u201d Id. \nThe court concluded the \u201creading by a teacher of one \nbook, or even three, and even if to a young and \nimpressionable \nchild, \ndoes \nnot \nconstitute \n\u2018indoctrination.\u2019\u201d Id. at 107. \n \nWhen courts have found free exercise violations \nbased on public-school curricula, the challenged \ncurricula involved more than exposure to ideas. The \ncurricula required conduct that conflicted with \nstudents\u2019 faiths. In Moody v. Cronin, for example, \nparents and students brought a free exercise challenge \nagainst a statewide requirement that public-school \n122a\n\n \n \nstudents \u201cattend all coeducational physical education \nclasses under penalty of suspension, expulsion, denial \nof credits for graduation and other discipline.\u201d 484 F. \nSupp. 270, 272 (C.D. Ill. 1979). The families had \nreligious objections to their children being \u201crequired to \nview and interact with members of the opposite sex \nwho are wearing \u2018immodest attire.\u2019\u201d Id. The court \nfound the statewide requirement \u201csubstantially \ninterfere[d] with the religious development of the \nPentecostal children and their integration into the \nway of life of the Pentecostal faith community.\u201d Id. at \n276. It reasoned: \n[T]here is a degree of visual and physical \ncontact inherent in physical education that is \nnot present in other classes. The required \nparticipation \nin \ncoeducational \nphysical \neducation forces interaction with members of \nthe opposite sex who are wearing \u201cimmodest \nattire.\u201d The nature of the activities engaged in \neffectively deprives the Pentecostal children of \nthe decision of \u201ctaking the second look\u201d and is \nthus in direct violation of Church teachings \nregarding being a party to lust, either by being \nprovocative \nthemselves \nor \nby \nallowing \nthemselves to be put in a position where the \ntemptation is present. \nId. at 275. The court held the students could not be \nrequired to participate in coeducational physical \neducation in violation of their religious beliefs. Id. at \n277. Similarly, another court found a requirement that \nhigh school students participate in a military training \nprogram or be denied a diploma burdened the religious \nexercise of a student whose religious beliefs prohibited \n123a\n\n \n \nhim from participating in training to prepare for war. \nSpence v. Bailey, 465 F.2d 797, 800 (6th Cir. 1972). \nThat choice was tantamount to indirect coercion, as in \nSherbert. Id. at 799. A court in this circuit found a \nschool\u2019s uniform requirement that contravened a \nparent\u2019s religious beliefs burdened religious exercise. \nHicks ex rel. Hicks v. Halifax Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 93 F. \nSupp. 2d 649, 659 (E.D.N.C. 1999). And in yet another \ncase, a court recognized that a school\u2019s refusal to \nexcuse students with religious objections to watching \nmovies and listening to recordings of any kind \nburdened parents\u2019 rights to pass on their faiths \nbecause it \u201callows to be done in school what is \nprohibited at home. It places the children between the \nScylla of obeying their parents\u2019 religious teachings and \nthe Charybdis of obeying the commands of their \nteachers and school authorities.\u201d Davis v. Page, 385 F. \nSupp. 395, 399\u2013400 (D.N.H. 1974). \n \nEach of these cases relied on Yoder, a seminal \nSupreme Court case that reaffirmed the \u201cright of \nparents to direct the religious upbringing of their \nchildren.\u201d 406 U.S. at 233. In Yoder, Amish parents \nchallenged their convictions under a state criminal \nstatute requiring them to cause their children to \nattend public or private school until age 16. Id. at 207. \nThe parents had declined to send their 14- and 15-\nyear-old children to public or private school. Id. They \nbelieved their children\u2019s attendance in school was \ncontrary to the Amish religion and way of life, and that \n\u201cby sending their children to high school, they would \nnot only expose themselves to the danger of the \ncensure of the church community, but . . . also \nendanger their own salvation and that of their \nchildren.\u201d Id. at 209. Substantial evidence supported \n124a\n\n \n \nthe \nparents\u2019 \ncontention \nthat \ntheir \nreligious \ncommunities were \u201ccharacterized by a fundamental \nbelief that salvation requires life in a church \ncommunity separate and apart from the world and \nworldly influence.\u201d Id. at 209\u2013210. The evidence \nincluded \n\u201cthe \nunchallenged \ntestimony \nof \nacknowledged experts in education and religious \nhistory, almost 300 years of consistent practice, and \nstrong evidence of a sustained faith pervading and \nregulating respondents\u2019 entire mode of life . . . .\u201d Id. at \n219. Based on this evidence, the Supreme Court found \nthat \nsecondary \nschooling, \nby \nexposing \nAmish \nchildren to worldly influences in terms of \nattitudes, goals, and values contrary to their \nbeliefs, and by substantially interfering with the \nreligious development of the Amish child and \nhis integration into the way of life of the Amish \nfaith community at the crucial adolescent stage \nof development, contravenes the basic religious \ntenets and practice of the Amish faith[.] \nId. at 218. In other words, the record showed \ncompulsory school attendance for Amish children \n\u201ccarrie[d] with it a very real threat of undermining the \nAmish community and religious practice as they exist \ntoday; they must either abandon belief and be \nassimilated into society at large, or be forced to \nmigrate to some other and more tolerant religion.\u201d Id. \nThe Court acknowledged the state\u2019s interest in \nuniversal compulsory education but held it was not \nabsolute and did not outweigh the Amish parents\u2019 \nfundamental rights and interests \u201cwith respect to the \nreligious upbringing of their children . . . .\u201d Id. at 214\u2013\n125a\n\n \n \n15. \n \nThe Yoder Court was clear that its holding was \ninexorably linked to the Amish community\u2019s unique \nreligious beliefs and practices. Id. at 235\u201336. It stated \nits heightened scrutiny of the challenged law was \ncompelled by the combination of \u201cthe interests of \nparenthood\u201d and \u201ca free exercise claim of the nature \nrevealed by this record.\u201d Id. at 233 (emphasis added). \nIt anticipated \u201cprobably few other religious groups or \nsects could make\u201d a showing similar to the evidence \nprovided by the Amish parents, including the \ninterrelationship of their beliefs and a centuries-long \npractice of isolated and self-sufficient communal \nliving, and it counseled courts to \u201cmove with great \ncircumspection in performing the sensitive and \ndelicate task of weighing a State\u2019s legitimate social \nconcern when faced with religious claims for \nexemption from generally applicable educational \nrequirements.\u201d \nId. \nFor these reasons, Mozert \ndistinguished Yoder as resting \u201con such a singular set \nof facts that . . . it cannot be held to announce a general \nrule that exposure without compulsion to act, believe, \naffirm or deny creates an unconstitutional burden.\u201d \n827 F.2d at 1067. Parker, too, observed that \u201cYoder \nemphasized that its holding was essentially sui \ngeneris, as few sects could make a similar showing of a \nunique and demanding religious way of life that is \nfundamentally incompatible with any schooling \nsystem.\u201d 514 F.3d at 100. Still, Yoder stands as the \nultimate application of the Free Exercise Clause\u2019s \nprotection against compulsory public-school education \nthat violates parents\u2019 religious beliefs. \nFinally, it is worth emphasizing one throughline in all \n126a\n\n \n \nthese \ncases. \nThe \nSupreme \nCourt \nnever \nhas \n\u201cinterpreted the First Amendment to require the \nGovernment itself to behave in ways that the \nindividual believes will further his or her spiritual \ndevelopment or that of his or her family.\u201d Bowen v. Roy, \n476 U.S. 693, 699 (1986). \nIn Bowen, parents \nchallenged the government\u2019s practice of assigning and \nusing Social Security numbers. They asserted that \npractice, as applied to their two-year-old daughter, \nwould violate their religious beliefs and limit their \ndaughter\u2019s spiritual development. The Court rejected \ntheir claims because the \u201cFree Exercise Clause simply \ncannot be understood to require the Government to \nconduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport \nwith the religious beliefs of particular citizens.\u201d Id. \n\u201cJust as the Government may not insist that appellees \nengage in any set form of religious observance, so \nappellees may not demand that the Government join \nin their chosen religious practices by refraining from \nusing a number to identify their daughter.\u201d Id. at 699\u2013\n700. \u201cThe Free Exercise Clause affords an individual \nprotection from certain forms of governmental \ncompulsion; it does not afford an individual a right to \ndictate the conduct of the Government\u2019s internal \nprocedures.\u201d Id. at 700. The Court acknowledged that \nthe parents\u2019 \u201creligious views may not accept this \ndistinction between individual and governmental \nconduct[,]\u201d but it concluded that \u201cthe Constitution, \nrather than an individual\u2019s religion, must supply the \nframe of reference.\u201d Id. at 701 n.6. For the same \nreasons, the Court rejected free exercise challenges to \nfederal agency actions that had authorized road \nconstruction across land used for religious purposes. \nLyng, 485 U.S. at 442. The Court reaffirmed the Free \n127a\n\n \n \nExercise Clause\u2019s protection against forms of indirect \ncoercion like the disqualification from unemployment \nbenefits based on religious conduct, which it \nanalogized to direct fines on religious worship. Id. at \n450. But the Court held that line of indirect-coercion \ncases \u201cdoes not and cannot imply that incidental \neffects of government programs, which may make it \nmore difficult to practice certain religions but which \nhave no tendency to coerce individuals into acting \ncontrary to their religious beliefs, require\u201d judicial \nscrutiny. Id. at 450\u201351. \nb. Burden \u2013 Application \n \nWith these principles in mind, the Court considers \nwhether the plaintiffs likely have established their \nand their children\u2019s religious exercise rights will be \nburdened \nby \nthe \nno-opt-out \npolicy. \nIn \ntheir \ndeclarations, the parents claim a sacred obligation to \nteach their children their faiths and their religious \nviews on family structure, gender, and human \nsexuality. ECF 23-2, \u00b6\u00b6 4, 14; ECF 23-3, \u00b6 12; ECF 23-\n4, \u00b6 7; ECF 52, \u00b6 7. Mahmoud and Barakat state their \nfaith prohibits prying into others\u2019 private lives and \ndiscourages public disclosure of sexual behavior. ECF \n23-2, \u00b6 17. They state it would violate their religious \nbeliefs and the beliefs of their children if their children \n\u201cwere asked to discuss romantic relationships or \nsexuality with schoolteachers or classmates.\u201d Id. They \nalso state \u201c[i]ntentionally exposing\u201d their children to \ncontrary instruction would conflict with their religious \nobligations. Id. \u00b6 18. The Romans state their child \nloves his teachers and implicitly trusts them, so \n\u201c[h]aving them teach principles about sexuality or \ngender identity that conflict with [their] religious \n128a\n\n \n \nbeliefs significantly interferes with [their] ability to \nform his religious faith and religious outlook on life \nand is spiritually and emotionally harmful to his well-\nbeing.\u201d ECF 23-3, \u00b6 20. The Persaks state \u201cexposing\u201d \ntheir children to viewpoints that contradict their \nbeliefs \u201cconflicts\u201d with their religious duties and \n\u201cundermines [their] efforts to raise [their] children in \naccordance with [their] faith . . . .\u201d ECF 23-4, \u00b6\u00b6 12, 16. \nFinally, Morrison, a board member of Kids First, states \nher religious obligations are \u201cpressured\u201d by the books \nbecause \u201cit is practically impossible for [her and her \nhusband] to contradict\u201d contrary instruction due to her \nchild\u2019s learning disability, which prevents her from \nunderstanding their disagreement with the books and \ndifferentiating their instruction from her teachers\u2019 \ninstruction. ECF 52, \u00b6\u00b6 8\u20139. Morrison also states she \nhas no realistic alternative to public school for her \nchild\u2019s education. Id. \u00b6\u00b6 10, 14. \n \nThe Court begins with the asserted burden on the \nchildren\u2019s religious exercise. The plaintiffs contend \nnot allowing opt-outs from the storybooks exerts \n\u201cbehavioral pressure\u201d on the children to \u201cmodify their \nreligious beliefs and behavior.\u201d ECF 47, at 10\u201311. The \npressure comes from the books\u2019 calls to action and \nintrospection \nand \nthe \ninevitable \nteacher-led \ndiscussion, which advance the School Board\u2019s express \ngoal to normalize an inclusive environment. In \nessence, the plaintiffs argue that by being forced to \nread and discuss the storybooks, their children will be \npressured to change their religious views on human \nsexuality, gender, and marriage. The Court interprets \nthis argument as an indoctrination claim of the sort \ncontemplated in Parker. \n129a\n\n \n \n \nThe plaintiffs have not identified any case \nrecognizing a free exercise violation based on \nindoctrination. The closest any court has come to \ndoing so appears to be Tatel v. Mount Lebanon School \nDistrict, 637 F. Supp. 3d 295 (W.D. Penn. 2022). In \nTatel, the court denied a motion to dismiss a free \nexercise claim brought by parents who challenged a \npublic-school teacher\u2019s non- curricular instruction on \ntransgender topics. \nId. at 330. The parents \nalleged the teacher had engaged in a year-long course \nof instruction to first graders on gender dysphoria, \nincluding books, videos, discussions, and private \ncounseling. Id. at 303\u201305. She also had \u201cinstructed the \nchildren in her first-grade class that their parents \nmight be wrong about their children\u2019s gender,\u201d told \none student that he could dress like a different gender, \nsaid she would never lie to them (suggesting their \nparents would), and encouraged her students \u201cnot to \ntell their parents about her instruction.\u201d Id. Such \ninstruction was \u201ccontrary to the District\u2019s published \ncurriculum,\u201d though administrators allegedly had \nadopted a de facto policy allowing the teacher to \ncontinue her activities. Id. at 304.  \n \nThe Tatel Court\u2019s basis for finding a burden on the \nparents\u2019 religious exercise is not clear, but the court\u2019s \nanalysis seems to align with the First Circuit\u2019s \ndescription \nof \nindoctrination \nin \nParker. \nIn \ndistinguishing Parker, the court noted that the teacher \n\u201cdid attempt to indoctrinate\u201d the children by telling \nthem their parents \u201cmay be wrong and her teachings \nabout gender identity were right.\u201d Id. at 325. Later, in \nsummarizing its reason for finding a viable free \nexercise claim, the court stated the teacher had \nimpermissibly \u201cadvocated her own agenda and beliefs \n130a\n\n \n \nabout gender identity\u201d in the classroom despite the \nparents\u2019 objections. Id. at 330.9 The teacher allegedly \nengaged in a consistent, multi-pronged, year-long \neffort to convince her first-grade students to believe \nher views on gender and, in some cases, to change \ntheir gender identities. Id. at 303\u201305. She told her \nstudents she would never lie to them, and she \nencouraged them not to discuss her instruction with \ntheir parents. Id. The students were not just exposed \nto ideas. They were being pressured by their teacher \nto change their religious views on gender identity. \n \nHere, the plaintiffs have not shown that the no-opt-\nout policy likely will result in the indoctrination of \ntheir children. Their allegations do not approach the \n \n9  \nOn a motion for reconsideration, the court expanded on its \nanalysis. Tatel v. Mt. Lebanon Sch. Dist., --- F. Supp. 3d ----, 2023 \nWL 3740822, at *13\u201314 (W.D. Penn. May 31, 2023). The court \nreasoned, first, that the plaintiffs did not have to allege coercion \nbecause \u201ca non-neutral policy to the detriment of a religious belief \nis a per se burden on Free Exercise rights\u201d under Kennedy v. \nBremerton School District, --- U.S. ----, 142 S. Ct. 2407 (2022). \nTatel, 2023 WL 3740822, at *13. In support, the court cited the \nfollowing language from Kennedy: \u201c[A] plaintiff may carry the \nburden of proving a free exercise violation in various ways, \nincluding by showing that a government entity has burdened his \nsincere religious practice pursuant to a policy that is not \u2018neutral\u2019 \nor \u2018generally applicable.\u2019\u201d 142 S. Ct. at 2421\u201322. The Court does \nnot read this language from Kennedy as describing a per se \nburden. Rather, the language explains when strict scrutiny may \nbe triggered by a law that imposes a burden. The Tatel Court \nreasoned in the alternative that the plaintiffs had pled coercion \nbecause they \u201cmust either withdraw their children from the \npublic school or submit to [the teacher\u2019s] advocacy.\u201d 2023 WL \n3740822, at *14 n.18. This reasoning seems to find indirect \ncoercion based on the pressure either to \u201csubmit to\u201d \nindoctrination or abandon a public education. \n131a\n\n \n \nparents\u2019 allegations in Tatel or the description of \nindoctrination in Parker. To be sure, the topics in the \nstorybooks the plaintiffs find objectionable\u2014gender \nidentity, transgenderism, and same-sex marriage\u2014\noutnumber the single objectionable issue (same-sex \nmarriage) in the two books in Parker. And some of the \nbooks may be viewed as endorsing particular \nviewpoints, like one of the books in Parker that the \ncourt suggested presented \u201ca more significant claim.\u201d \nParker, 514 F.3d at 106. But the storybooks are still a \nsmall subset of many books used in the MCPS English \nlanguage arts curriculum; they are not a \u201cconstant \nstream of like materials.\u201d Id. Moreover, as in Parker, \nthe School Board \u201cimposes no requirement that the \nstudent[s] agree with or affirm\u201d the books\u2019 views on the \ntopics and threatens no punishment if they refuse to do \nso. Id. To the contrary, it consistently has stated, \u201cNo \nchild, or adult, who does not agree with or understand \nanother student\u2019s gender identity or expression of \ntheir sexual identity is asked to change how they feel \nabout it.\u201d ECF 1-5; ECF 43, \u00b6 30; ECF 55-3, at 2 \n(suggesting teachers to respond to student religious \nobjections by saying, \u201cI understand that is what you \nbelieve, but not everyone believes that\u201d and \u201cwe don\u2019t \nhave to understand a person\u2019s identity to treat them \nwith respect and kindness\u201d). Even if one or two of the \nsuggested answers to possible student questions in the \nSchool Board\u2019s guidance could be interpreted to \npromote a particular view as correct, they are not \nrequired answers, and they are outliers among the \nsuggested answers that do not promote a particular \nview. ECF 55-3. And some MCPS educators have \nexpressed concerns about the more assertive suggested \nanswers, suggesting those responses are less likely to \n132a\n\n \n \nbe used in the classroom. ECF 47-1, at 10. On the \ncurrent record, the plaintiffs have not shown that \nMCPS\u2019s use of the storybooks crosses the line from \npermissible influence to potentially impermissible \nindoctrination. Therefore, as in Parker, the Court need \nnot decide whether indoctrination burdens religious \nexercise. \n \nThe plaintiffs contend the Morrisons\u2019 daughter, at \nleast, has a viable indoctrination claim. Their \ndaughter has Down Syndrome and Attention Deficit \nDisorder. \nShe is enrolled in the Learning for \nIndependence Program, has an IEP, and qualifies for \nthe full-time, one-on-one assistance of a paraeducator. \nMorrison states her daughter\u2019s learning disability \nprevents \nthe \nchild \nfrom \nunderstanding \nor \ndifferentiating instructions from her teachers and her \nparents and renders her unable to understand how or \nwhy her parents disagree with the ideas presented in \nthe storybooks. As a result, Morrison states, it is \npractically impossible for Morrison and her husband to \ncontradict instruction the child receives at school that \nconflicts with the family\u2019s religious beliefs. \n \nThe Morrisons are not named plaintiffs, and the \nCourt questions whether Kids First has standing to \nbring claims on their behalf. See Harris, 448 U.S. at \n320\u201321; Cornerstone Christian Schs., 563 F.3d at 133\u2013\n34 (rejecting religious school\u2019s claims of associational \nstanding to bring free exercise challenges on behalf of \nparents and students); 13A Charles A. Wright, Arthur \nR. Miller & Edward H. Cooper, Fed. Prac. & Proc. \u00a7 \n3531.9.5 (3d ed.) (\u201cSome substantive claims may seem \ninherently so personal that individual participation \nshould be required simply because of the nature of the \n133a\n\n \n \nclaim.\u201d). Even if the Court were to assume the \nMorrisons\u2019 claims are properly \npresented, \nthe \nMorrisons have not shown the use of the storybooks \nwill result in their daughter\u2019s indoctrination. She may \nbe uniquely vulnerable to indoctrination due to her \nneurodivergence, but on the current record, the \nMorrisons \nstill \nhave \nnot \nestablished \nthat \nindoctrination is likely to occur. The evidence suggests \nthat, generally, MCPS teachers will occasionally read \none of the handful of books, lead discussions and ask \nquestions about the characters, and respond to \nquestions and comments in ways that encourage \ntolerance for different views and lifestyles. That is not \nindoctrination. That the Morrisons\u2019 child cannot \ndistinguish between what her parents and teachers \ninstruct does not convert the teachers\u2019 instruction into \nindoctrination\u2014nothing \nsuggests \nshe \nwill \nbe \npressured to affirm or agree with the views presented \nin the storybooks. Moreover, the Morrisons have not \noffered evidence about how the books will be \nincorporated into the Learning for Independence \nProgram or whether the Morrisons have requested \na \nmodification \nto \ntheir \ndaughter\u2019s \nIEP \nto \naccommodate her disability as it relates to the \nstorybooks. Based on the evidence before the Court, \nthe \nMorrisons \nare \nlikely \nto \nsucceed \non \nan \nindoctrination claim.10 \n \nSeparate from any indoctrination claim, Mahmoud \n \n10  Even if Kids First has standing to bring a claim on behalf of \nthe Morrisons and the Morrisons could satisfy the standard for a \npreliminary injunction, the unique situation of one family would \nnot justify a broad injunction applicable to the individual \nplaintiffs and every Kids First member. \n134a\n\n \n \nand Barakat contend their son would be forced to \nviolate Islam\u2019s prohibition of \u201cprying into others\u2019 \nprivate lives\u201d and its discouragement of \u201cpublic \ndisclosure of sexual behavior\u201d if his teacher were to \nask him to discuss \u201cromantic relationships or \nsexuality.\u201d ECF 23-2, \u00b6 17. Forcing a child to discuss \ntopics that his religion prohbits him from discussing \ngoes beyond the mere exposure to ideas that conflict \nwith religious beliefs. But nothing in the current \nrecord suggests the child will be required to share such \nprivate information. Based on the evidence of how \nteachers will use the books, it appears discussion will \nfocus on the characters, not on the students. See ECF \n43, \u00b6 30 (stating the books \u201care used to assist students \nwith mastering concepts like answering questions \nabout characters, retelling key events . . . and drawing \ninferences about story characters\u201d); ECF 1-15, at 24 \n(same); ECF 1-5 (noting \u201cthink-aloud moments\u201d about \nwhat characters feel). \nWhile some instructional \nguidance seems to encourage student introspection, \nnone encourages students to share their personal \nexperiences or to discuss their or their families\u2019 \nromantic relationships, gender identities, or sexuality. \nSee ECF 55-3, at 3 (\u201cAre you comfortable sharing your \npronouns with me?\u201d). Additionally, Mahmoud and \nBarakat have not established the likelihood that \nprohibited conversations will occur. They do not allege \nthey have told their son\u2019s teachers that his religion \ndoes not allow him to discuss prohibited topics with \nothers or that his teachers, when on notice that he \ncannot discuss these topics, will pressure him to do so. \nThus, the Court cannot conclude the child is likely to \nbe coerced into violating his beliefs in the manner \nidentified by his parents. \n135a\n\n \n \n \nThe sine qua non of a free exercise claim is coercion, \nand the plaintiffs have not shown the no-opt-out policy \nlikely will result in the indoctrination of their children \nor otherwise coerce their children to violate or change \ntheir religious beliefs. \u201cPublic schools are not obliged \nto shield individual students from ideas which \npotentially are religiously offensive, particularly when \nthe school imposes no requirement that the student\u201d \nviolate his or her faith during classroom instruction. \nParker, 514 F.3d at 106. \n \nThe parents\u2019 burden arguments, too, fall short. The \nparents assert that their children\u2019s exposure to the \nstorybooks, including discussion about the characters, \nstoryline, and themes, will substantially interfere with \ntheir sacred obligations to raise their children in their \nfaiths. The Court\u2019s analysis of the parents\u2019 asserted \nburden is guided by Parker and the other circuit-level \ncases, which the Court finds persuasive. Under these \ncases, the parents\u2019 inability to opt their children out of \nreading and discussion of the storybooks does not \ncoerce them into violating their religious beliefs. See \nParker, 514 F.3d at 105\u201306; Fleischfresser, 15 F.3d at \n690; Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1065\u201366. The parents still \nmay instruct their children on their religious beliefs \nregarding sexuality, marriage, and gender, and each \nfamily may place contrary views in its religious \ncontext.11 No government action prevents the parents \n \n11  The Morrisons, too, do not face any coercion to violate their \nsacred duty to raise their child in their faith. Morrison states \nthey cannot contextualize contrary ideas for their disabled \ndaughter because her disability prevents her from understanding \nthe difference between what her parents say and what her \nteachers say. But the no-opt-out policy does not prevent the \n \n136a\n\n \n \nfrom freely discussing the topics raised in the \nstorybooks with their children or teaching their \nchildren as they wish. The no-opt-out policy does not \nprevent the parents from exercising their religious \nobligations or coerce them into forgoing their religious \nbeliefs.12 \n \nThe plaintiffs argue this conclusion is inconsistent \nwith Justice Alito\u2019s concurrence in Morse v. Frederick, \nwhich stated: \u201cIt is a dangerous fiction to pretend that \nparents simply delegate their authority\u2014including \ntheir authority to determine what their children may \nsay and hear\u2014to public school authorities.\u201d 551 U.S. \n393, 424 (2007) (Alito, J., concurring). Morse involved \na free speech challenge to a school\u2019s decision to punish \na student for raising a controversial banner at an off-\ncampus, school-approved event. Id. at 396. In context, \nJustice Alito was reaffirming that schools act as agents \nof the State and not private actors when they regulate \nstudent speech. \nSee id. (\u201cWhen public school \nauthorities regulate student speech, they act as agents \nof the State; they do not stand in the shoes of the \nstudents\u2019 parents.\u201d). In the same paragraph, he \nobserved that \u201c[m]ost parents, realistically, have . . . \n \nMorrisons from taking the action required by their religion\u2014\ntrying to teach their daughter their beliefs. \n12  The plaintiffs argue they will not know what to discuss with \ntheir children or when without advance notice of when the \nstorybooks will be read. But parents know the books are a part of \nthe English language curriculum and must be used in the \nclassroom at some point during the upcoming school year. They \nmay read the books for themselves and decide whether, when, and \nhow best to address them with their children. Not receiving notice \nof the precise dates on which the books will be read does not \nburden their religious exercise. \n137a\n\n \n \nlittle ability to influence what occurs in the school[,]\u201d \nundermining the plaintiffs\u2019 argument that Justice \nAlito intended to suggest parents\u2019 have substantial \ncontrol over public-school curricula. Id. The Court\u2019s \nfindings here are not inconsistent with the holding in \nMorse or Justice Alito\u2019s concurrence. \n \nThe plaintiffs further argue Parker, Mozert, and \nFleischfresser are not persuasive and should not be \nfollowed here. They argue first that, even if they \nremain free to teach their beliefs to their children, \ntheir religious exercise is nonetheless burdened \nbecause the storybooks impede their efforts to instill \ntheir religious beliefs in their children. In other words, \nthey argue instruction that uses the storybooks will \nmake it less likely they will accomplish their religious \nobligations to raise their children in their faiths. Yet, \nthey cite no case that has recognized a free exercise \nclaim based on government action that reduces the \nlikelihood of meeting a sacred obligation. Such a \nfinding would seem to contravene the Supreme Court\u2019s \nguidance that the Free Exercise Clause cannot be used \nto \u201crequire the Government itself to behave in ways \nthat the individual believes will further his or her \nspiritual development or that of his or her family.\u201d \nBowen, 476 U.S. at 699. It is not enough for a plaintiff \nto identify \u201cthe incidental effects of government \nprograms, which may make it more difficult to practice \ncertain religions but which have no tendency to coerce \nindividuals into acting contrary to their religious \nbeliefs[.]\u201d Lyng, 485 U.S. at 450. \u201cThe crucial word in \nthe constitutional text is \u2018prohibit\u2019: \u2018For the Free \nExercise Clause is written in terms of what the \ngovernment cannot do to the individual, not in terms \nof \nwhat \nthe \nindividual \ncan \nexact \nfrom \nthe \n138a\n\n \n \ngovernment.\u2019\u201d Id. (quoting Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 412). \nWith or without an opt-out right, the parents remain \nfree to pursue their sacred obligations to instruct their \nchildren in their faiths. Even if their children\u2019s \nexposure to religiously offensive ideas makes the \nparents\u2019 efforts less likely to succeed, that does not \namount to a government-imposed burden on their \nreligious exercise. \n \nThe plaintiffs next argue that the no-opt-out policy \nis a form of indirect coercion, which they claim Parker \ndid not address. They contend the policy pressures \nthem to choose between the benefits of a public \neducation and exercising their religious rights. \nIndirect coercion, as discussed above, is substantial \npressure short of an express command to modify one\u2019s \nbehavior or to violate one\u2019s beliefs. Such pressure may \ncome from conditions on receiving public benefits, \nwhich courts have found are analogous to fines. \nCertainly, public education is a valuable public \nbenefit. And many families cannot afford to send their \nchildren to private schools. But the benefit of a public \neducation in this case is not conditioned on any \nactivity or abstention that violates the parents\u2019 \nreligious beliefs. \nThe no-opt-out policy does not \npressure the parents to refrain from teaching their \nfaiths, to engage in conduct that would violate their \nreligious beliefs, or to change their religious beliefs. \nThe policy may pressure them to discuss the topics \nraised by the storybooks with their children, but those \ndiscussions are anticipated, not prohibited, by the \nparents\u2019 faiths. The parents are not pressured into \nviolating their religious beliefs in order to obtain the \nbenefits of a public education. \n139a\n\n \n \n \nThird, the plaintiffs argue the Supreme Court\u2019s \ndecision in Yoder compels the conclusion that the no-\nopt-out policy interferes with their rights to direct the \nreligious upbringing of their children and teach their \nreligious views on topics central to their faiths. They \nclaim the reading and discussion of the storybooks will \ninterfere with this right by encouraging their children \nto think about and question their sexuality and gender \nidentity, \nto \nfocus \nprematurely \non \nromantic \nrelationships, and to disregard religious teachings. \n \nParker and Mozert are representative of how courts \nhave viewed Yoder in cases challenging curricula on \nfree exercise grounds. The Sixth Circuit in Mozert \nnoted \u201cYoder was decided in large part on the \nimpossibility of reconciling the goals of public \neducation with the religious requirement of the Amish \nthat their children be prepared for life in a separated \ncommunity\u201d and the threat to the Amish way of life \nand religious practice posed by the public- school \nattendance requirement. 827 F.2d at 1067. It found \nno similar threat to the parents on the facts before it \nbecause they wanted the benefits of a public education, \nalbeit with greater control over the curriculum, and \nbecause they did not claim their children\u2019s exposure to \nthe curriculum would prevent them from practicing \ntheir religion. Id. The First Circuit in Parker likewise \nfound \u201csubstantial differences\u201d between the parents\u2019 \nclaims and the claims in Yoder, covering much the \nsame ground as Mozert. 514 F.3d at 100. Unlike in \nYoder, the parents in Parker had chosen to enroll their \nchildren in public school and made no claim of a \ndistinct community and lifestyle threatened by the \ncurriculum. Id. They had not shown that \u201cexposure to \nthe materials in dispute\u201d would \u201cautomatically and \n140a\n\n \n \nirreversibly prevent [them] from raising [their \nchildren] in the religious belief that gay marriage is \nimmoral.\u201d Id. By contrast, the continued education of \nthe Amish children in Yoder would have prevented \ntheir parents from raising their children in their \nseparate and distinct religious culture and lifestyle. \nId. And, in both cases, the courts noted the parents had \nlegal alternatives to public school (private schools and \nhomeschooling) that would satisfy their religious \nconcerns, whereas the Amish parents in Yoder did not. \nId.; Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1067. \n \nThe plaintiffs argue these readings of Yoder are too \nnarrow and conflict with the Supreme Court\u2019s recent \ndescription of the parental right at issue in that case. \nThey cite Espinoza v. Montana Department of Revenue, \nin which parents challenged a state regulation that \nblocked private religious schools from receiving funds \nfrom a state scholarship program. --- U.S ----, 140 S. \nCt. 2246, 2249 (2020). The majority in Espinoza noted \nthat Yoder supported the Court\u2019s longstanding \nrecognition of \u201cthe rights of parents to direct \u2018the \nreligious upbringing\u2019 of their children.\u201d Id. at 2261. \nJustice Gorsuch, writing in concurrence, stated \u201cthis \nCourt has already recognized that parents\u2019 decisions \nabout the education of their children . . . can constitute \nprotected religious activity.\u201d Id. at 2276 (Gorsuch, J., \nconcurring). And Justice Breyer, writing in dissent, \nnoted \u201cthe Free Exercise Clause draws upon a history \nthat places great value upon the freedom of parents to \nteach their children the tenets of their faith.\u201d Id. at \n2284 (Breyer, J., dissenting). In each instance, Yoder \nis referred to in passing and at a high level of \ngenerality. \n141a\n\n \n \n \nSuch stray statements offer limited guidance here, \nwith facts that are a far cry from both Yoder and \nEspinoza. Neither the majority, the concurrence, nor \nthe dissent stated lower courts\u2019 interpretations of \nYoder in this context is incorrect or provided any \nanalysis from which this Court may infer their \ndissatisfaction with those interpretations. At the same \ntime, the plaintiffs offer no analogous case to support \ntheir proposed application of Yoder to these facts. \nEven if the plaintiffs are correct that the Supreme \nCourt has never adopted the reading of Yoder followed \nby lower courts in this context, the Court is persuaded \nto follow the persuasive authority in the absence of \nany controlling authority to the contrary. Yoder is sui \ngeneris. The Supreme Court itself said as much, \nanticipating few groups could match the Amish \nparents\u2019 claims. The outcome in that case turned on \nthe Court\u2019s findings that the Amish parents\u2019 religious \nbeliefs required them to live apart from the modern \nworld and that their children\u2019s continued enrollment \nin school would destroy their religious way of life. \nThus, the statutory requirement that they send their \nchildren to school on pain of criminal punishment \ncoerced them to violate their religious beliefs. The \nplaintiffs here do not and cannot make a similar \nclaim.13 \n \n\u201c[A] violation of the Free Exercise Clause is \n \n13  The plaintiffs argue distinguishing their claims from the \nAmish parents\u2019 claims requires the Court to engage in \u201cdoctrinal \nfavoritism.\u201d ECF 57, at 3. Not so. The Court\u2019s analysis does not \nturn on religious doctrine. It turns on whether the facts involve \ngovernment coercion to violate religious beliefs. In Yoder, they \ndid; here, they do not. \n142a\n\n \n \npredicated on coercion,\u201d either direct or indirect. \nSchempp, 374 U.S. at 223. The plaintiffs have not \nshown the no-opt-out policy likely coerces them to \nviolate their religious beliefs. Regardless of the \nwisdom of affording opt-outs in these circumstances, \nthe weight of existing authority is clear. The plaintiffs\u2019 \nfree exercise claims are not likely to succeed on the \nmerits.14 \n2. Substantive Due Process \n \nThe plaintiffs assert that the School Board\u2019s refusal \nto allow parents to opt their children out of reading \nand discussion of the storybooks infringes their right \nto direct their children\u2019s upbringing in violation of the \nDue Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. \nThey claim this due process right is fundamental, \ntriggering strict scrutiny. \n \nUnder substantive due process jurisprudence, \n\u201ccourts examine whether government intrusions into \ncitizens\u2019 liberties are justified by adequate state \ninterests.\u201d Herndon by Herndon v. Chapel Hill-\nCarrboro City Bd. of Educ., 89 F.3d 174, 177 (4th Cir. \n1996). \n\u201cA substantive due process challenge is \nconsidered under rational-basis review unless some \nfundamental right is implicated.\u201d Doe v. Settle, 24 \nF.4th 932, 953 (4th Cir. 2022) (citing Herndon, 89 F.3d \nat 177). Fundamental rights are those \u201cwhich are, \nobjectively, deeply rooted in this Nation\u2019s history and \ntradition.\u201d Hawkins v. Freemen, 195 F.3d 732, 739 \n \n14  Because the plaintiffs have not shown that the no-opt-out \npolicy likely will burden their religious exercise, the Court need \nnot address whether the policy is neutral and generally \napplicable under Fulton, Tandon, and Masterpiece/Lukumi. \n143a\n\n \n \n(4th Cir. 1999) (quoting Washington v. Glucksberg, \n521 U.S. 702, 720\u201321 (1997)). \n\u201cCritical to the \n\u2018fundamental interest\u2019 inquiry is the requirement that \nit be conducted on the basis of a \u2018careful description of \nthe asserted fundamental liberty interest.\u2019\u201d \nId. \n(quoting Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720). In defining the \nasserted \nliberty \ninterest, \ncourts \nmust \navoid \n\u201covergeneralization in the historical inquiry.\u201d Id. at \n747 (citing Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 722\u201323). \n \nIn their complaint and preliminary injunction \nmotion, the parents asserted a violation of their \nsubstantive due process rights to direct the upbringing \nof their children, which they described as \u201c[s]eparate \nand apart from\u201d their free exercise claims. ECF 23-1, \nat 31; see ECF 36, \u00b6\u00b6 262\u201375. But in their reply brief \nand at oral argument, they characterized their due \nprocess rights as concerning the religious upbringing \nof their children, blurring the line between their due \nprocess arguments and their free exercise arguments \nbased on Yoder. See ECF 47, at 16. The Court \nconsiders the asserted secular due process right and \nits religious variation, in turn. \n \nThe \u201cinterest of parents in the care, custody, and \ncontrol of their children [] is perhaps the oldest of the \nfundamental liberty interests recognized by\u201d the \nSupreme Court. Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 \n(2000). Nearly 100 years ago, the Court held that the \n\u201cliberty\u201d protected by the Due Process Clause includes \nthe right of parents \u201cto control the education of their \nown,\u201d Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 401 (1923), and \n\u201cto direct the upbringing and education of children \nunder their control,\u201d Pierce v. Soc\u2019y of Sisters, 268 U.S. \n510, 534\u201335 (1925). Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65. In the \n144a\n\n \n \nsubsequent decades, the Court has addressed parents\u2019 \nrights in different contexts, often using broad \nlanguage. See, e.g., id.; Glucksberg, 521 U.S. at 720 \n(noting the right \u201cto direct the education and \nupbringing of one\u2019s children\u201d under Meyer and Pierce); \nStanley v. Illinois, 405 U.S. 645, 651 (1972) (\u201cThe \nrights to conceive and to raise one\u2019s children have been \ndeemed \u2018essential,\u2019 \u2018basic civil rights of man,\u2019 and \n\u2018[r]ights far more precious . . . than property rights[.]\u2019\u201d) \n(citations omitted). Relying on these cases, the parents \nargue the right to control the upbringing of their \nchildren is fundamental.15 \n \nThere is no doubt parents have substantial rights \nunder the Due Process Clause, but the Court still must \ndefine the specific right at stake with granularity. \nHawkins, 195 F.3d at 747. Indeed, \u201c\u2018[a]lthough the \nSupreme Court has never been called upon to \ndefine the precise boundaries of a parent\u2019s right to \ncontrol a child\u2019s upbringing and education,\u2019 it is clear \nthat the right is neither absolute nor unqualified.\u201d \nBailey v. Va. High Sch. League, Inc., 488 F. App\u2019x 714, \n716 (4th Cir. 2012) (unpublished per curiam) \n \n15  The plaintiffs cite several other cases that have no clear \napplication to the facts of this case. See, e.g., Mahanoy Area Sch. \nDist. v. B.L. ex rel. Levy, --- U.S. ----, 141 S. Ct. 2038, 2043\u201344 \n(2021) (concerning a school\u2019s regulation of off-campus speech); \nTroxel, 530 U.S. at 60\u201363 (concerning parents\u2019 control over \nvisitation rights for their children); Edwards v. Aguillard, 482 \nU.S. 578, 584 (1987) (concerning school\u2019s adoption of a religious \ncurriculum in violation of the Establishment Clause); Stanley, \n405 U.S. at 646\u201347 (concerning unwed father\u2019s custodial rights); \nGruenke v. Seip, 225 F.3d 290, 295 (3d Cir. 2000) (concerning \nparents\u2019 rights to learn and control the disclosure of information \nabout their daughter\u2019s pregnancy). \n145a\n\n \n \n(collecting cases) (quoting C.N., 430 F.3d at 182). The \nCourt has noted, for example, that there is \u201cno support \n[for] the contention that parents may replace state \neducational requirements with their own idiosyncratic \nviews of what knowledge a child needs to be a \nproductive and happy member of society.\u201d Runyon v. \nMcCrary, 427 U.S. 160, 177 (1976). And in several \ncases, the Court has expressly adopted a narrow \nreading of Meyer and Pierce. Id. (describing the rights \nestablished in Meyer and Pierce as protecting \u201cthe \nsubject matter . . . taught at . . . private school\u201d and the \nright to send children to private school); Norwood v. \nHarrison, 413 U.S. 455, 462 (1973) (finding Pierce \n\u201caffirmed the right of private schools to exist and \noperate\u201d and \u201csaid nothing of any supposed right of \nparochial schools\u201d to state funding); see also Leebaert \nv. Harrington, 332 F.3d 134, 140\u201341 (2d Cir. 2003) \n(holding \u201cMeyer, Pierce, and their progeny do not begin \nto suggest the existence of a fundamental right of \nevery parent to tell a public school what his or her \nchild will and will not be taught\u201d). So, while parents \nhave the right to \u201ccontrol the education of their own\u201d \nand \u201cto direct the upbringing and education of children \nunder their control,\u201d the existence of those rights does \nnot require the application of strict scrutiny every time \nparents assert authority over a child\u2019s education. \nHerndon, 89 F.3d at 179; see also Blau v. Fort Thomas \nPub. Sch. Dist., 401 F.3d 381, 395 (6th Cir. 2005) \n(\u201cWhile parents may have a fundamental right to \ndecide whether to send their child to a public school, \nthey do not have a fundamental right generally to \ndirect how a public school teaches their child.\u201d). \n \nThe controlling Fourth Circuit authority regarding \nparental control over a child\u2019s public education is \n146a\n\n \n \nHerndon by Herndon v. Chapel Hill-Carrboro City \nBoard of Education, 89 F.3d 174 (4th Cir. 1996). \nHerndon \ninvolved \na \nsubstantive \ndue \nprocess \nchallenge by parents to a public school\u2019s community \nservice requirement. Id. at 176\u201377. The challenge was \nnot motivated by religious objections. Id. at 179. After \ndiscussing the relevant Supreme Court cases, \nincluding Meyer, Pierce, and Yoder, the court \nsummarized: \n[T]he Supreme Court has stated consistently \nthat parents have a liberty interest, protected \nby the Fourteenth Amendment, in directing \ntheir children\u2019s schooling. Except when the \nparents\u2019 interest includes a religious element, \nhowever, the Court has declared with equal \nconsistency that reasonable regulation by the \nstate is permissible even if it conflicts with that \ninterest. That is the language of rational basis \nscrutiny. \nId. Because the plaintiffs conceded \u201ctheir interest \n[was] not religious,\u201d the court applied rational basis \nreview to the service requirement. Id. Thus, Herndon \nstands for the proposition that the parental right to \ndirect a child\u2019s education is not fundamental unless it \nincludes a religious element. To the extent the parents\u2019 \nsubstantive due process claims are premised on a \nsecular liberty interest, they do not assert a \nfundamental right, and their claims are subject to \nrational basis review. \n \nThe plaintiffs do not address this holding in \nHerndon. Instead, they emphasize the religious nature \nof their opposition to the storybooks. They argue that, \nunder Herndon, whenever a due process claim \n147a\n\n \n \ninvolves both a parent\u2019s right to direct their child\u2019s \neducation and free exercise concerns, as is the case \nhere, strict scrutiny automatically applies. They see \nsupport for such a rule in Herndon\u2019s statement that \nthe Supreme Court had applied rational basis review \n\u201c[e]xcept when the parents\u2019 interest includes a \nreligious element\u201d and its subsequent discussion of \nYoder, which it described as having \u201creaffirmed that \nparental rights are among the liberties protected by \nthe Constitution.\u201d \n89 F.3d at 178. \nThe court \ncontinued, \u201cWhen those rights combine with First \nAmendment free exercise concerns, the [Yoder] Court \nheld, they are fundamental[.]\u201d Id. (citing Yoder, 406 \nU.S. at 232). \n \nThere are several problems with the plaintiffs\u2019 \nreading of Herndon. First, Herndon did not involve \nany free exercise concerns, so the court had no cause \nto adopt such a broad rule.  Its description of Yoder \nis dicta, and it would be strange indeed if the court \nfundamentally \nrewrote \nits \nconstitutional \njurisprudence in a single sentence when its holding did \nnot depend on such a revision. Second, when the court \ndiscussed Yoder, it wrote descriptively. It observed the \nparents\u2019 rights asserted in Yoder were fundamental for \nthe reasons stated in Yoder. It did not extend Yoder\u2019s \nholding beyond its unique facts. Neither Yoder nor the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s interpretation of Yoder in Herndon \nholds that a parent\u2019s right to direct their children\u2019s \nupbringing automatically rises to the level of a \nfundamental right whenever the parent\u2019s interest \nincludes a religious element. \n \nAt oral argument, the plaintiffs proposed another \nreading of Herndon that they believe warrants the \n148a\n\n \n \napplication of strict scrutiny to the no-opt-out policy. \nThey suggested Herndon indicated the Fourth \nCircuit would be open to so-called \u201chybrid-rights\u201d \nclaims, in which two constitutional rights violations \nare based on the same set of facts. The concept of \nhybrid-rights claims originated in Smith. 494 U.S. at \n881\u201382. Smith\u2019s central holding was that the Free \nExercise Clause \u201cdoes not relieve an individual of the \nobligation to comply with\u201d neutral and generally \napplicable laws. Id. at 879. In discussing that rule, the \nCourt observed that \u201cthe only decisions in which we \nhave held that the First Amendment bars application \nof a neutral, generally applicable law to religiously \nmotivated action have involved not the Free Exercise \nClause alone, but the Free Exercise Clause in \nconjunction with other constitutional protections[.]\u201d \nId. at 881\u201382. The Court included Pierce and Yoder on \nits list of \u201chybrid\u201d cases to which its general rule did \nnot apply. Id. \u201cWhether and how to apply the hybrid-\nrights exception described in Smith have been the \nsubject of much debate and disagreement among the \ncircuit courts of appeal and academic commentators\u201d \nsince Smith\u2019s publication. Hicks, 93 F. Supp. 2d at \n659. Over the years, several justices have expressed \nskepticism about the hybrid-rights doctrine. Most \nrecently, Justice Alito stated in his concurrence in \nFulton, \u201c[I]t is hard to see the justification for this \ncurious doctrine . . . such a scheme is obviously \nunworkable and has never been recognized outside of \nSmith.\u201d 141 S. Ct. at 1915 (Alito, J., concurring). \nJustice Alito also suggested \u201cthe hybrid-rights \nexception would largely swallow up Smith\u2019s general \nrule\u201d because \u201ca great many claims for religious \nexemptions can easily be understood as hybrid free-\n149a\n\n \n \nexercise/free-speech claims.\u201d Id. But see Danville \nChristian Academy, Inc. v. Beshear, --- U.S. ----, 141 S. \nCt. 527, 529 (2020) (Gorsuch, J., dissenting) (\u201c[U]nder \nthis Court\u2019s precedents, even neutral and generally \napplicable laws are subject to strict scrutiny where a \nplaintiff presents a \u2018hybrid\u2019 claim\u2014meaning a claim \ninvolving the violation of the right to free exercise and \nanother right, such as the right of parents \u2018to direct \nthe education of their children.\u2019\u201d). \n \nHerndon cannot be read to endorse a hybrid-rights \ntheory. Beyond the fact that Herndon was not itself a \nhybrid-rights case and did not expressly refer to the \nconcept, the Fourth Circuit more recently has \nconfirmed that it has not taken a stance on the topic. \nSee Workman v. Mingo Cnty. Bd. of Educ., 419 F. \nApp\u2019x 348, 353 (4th Cir. 2011) (unpublished table \nopinion) (\u201cWe observe that there is a circuit split over \nthe validity of this \u2018hybrid-rights\u2019 exception. However, \nwe do not need to decide this issue here . . . .\u201d). The \nCourt does not read Herndon to require strict scrutiny \nanytime \na \nplaintiff \nchallenges \na \npublic-school \ncurriculum based on both parental and religious \nrights. \n \nWithout Fourth Circuit guidance on when strict \nscrutiny is required in such cases, the Court looks \noutside the circuit. Notably, as of 2008, \u201c[n]o published \ncircuit court opinion . . . ha[d] ever applied strict \nscrutiny to a case in which plaintiffs argued they had \npresented a hybrid claim.\u201d Parker, 514 F.3d at 98. \nThat observation remains true today. Three circuits \nhave expressly rejected the hybrid-rights theory. See \nCombs v. Homer-Center Sch. Dist., 540 F.3d 231, 244\u2013\n47 (3d Cir. 2008); Leebaert v. Harrington, 332 F.3d at \n150a\n\n \n \n143\u201344; Kissinger v. Bd. of Trs. of Ohio St. Univ., Coll. \nof Veterinary Med., 5 F.3d 177, 180 (6th Cir. 1993). The \ncircuits that have not rejected the theory have held that \nthe component claims must be, at least, colorable. See \n303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 6 F.4th 1160, 1188 (10th \nCir. 2021), rev\u2019d on other grounds, --- U.S ----, 143 S. \nCt. 2298 (2023); Henderson v. McMurray, 987 F.3d \n997,1005\u201307 (11th Cir. 2021); Parents for Privacy v. \nBarr, 949 F.3d 1210, 1237\u201338 (9th Cir. 2020); \nCornerstone Christian Schs., 563 F.3d at 136 n.8; \nParker, 514 F.3d at 97\u201399; Civil Liberties for Urban \nBelievers v. Chicago, 342 F.3d 752, 764\u201365 (7th Cir. \n2003). \u201cColorable\u201d in this context means likely to \nsucceed on the merits. Parents for Privacy, 949 F.3d at \n1237.16 \n \nIn the absence of persuasive authority to the \ncontrary, the Court will not adopt a lower standard. \nAny hybrid-rights claim, if such a claim is cognizable \nat all, does not warrant strict scrutiny here because \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 free exercise claims are not likely to \nsucceed on the merits. The Court concludes the \nplaintiffs\u2019 asserted due process right to direct their \nchildren\u2019s upbringing by opting out of a public-school \ncurriculum that conflicts with their religious views is \nnot a fundamental right. Rational basis review is the \nappropriate level of scrutiny. \n \nRational basis review \u201crequires only that the \n[challenged state action] be shown to bear some \nrational relationship to legitimate state purposes.\u201d \n \n16  At least one district court in this circuit has applied strict \nscrutiny to a hybrid-rights claim that involved colorable free \nexercise and substantive due process claims. See Hicks, 93 F. \nSupp. 2d at 657\u201363. \n151a\n\n \n \nHerndon, 89 F.3d at 177 (quoting San Antonio Indep. \nSch. Dist. v. Rodriguez, 411 U.S. 1, 37\u201340 (1973)); see \nalso Bethel World Outreach Ministries v. Montgomery \nCnty. Council, 706 F.3d 548, 561 (4th Cir. 2013). The \nplaintiffs do not dispute the no-opt-out policy would \nsurvive rational basis review. Indeed, the policy \nserves the School Board\u2019s legitimate interest in \n\u201c[f]oster[ing] \nsocial \nintegration \nand \ncultural \ninclusiveness \nof \ntransgender \nand \ngender \nnonconforming students\u201d by ensuring all MCPS \nstudents are exposed to inclusive and representative \ninstructional materials. See ECF 42-7, at 4; ECF 43, \u00b6 \n6. It also helps prevent students who identify with \ncharacters in the storybooks from feeling stigmatized \nor discriminated against when other students leave \nthe room when the books are read, furthering the \nSchool Board\u2019s interests in providing a safe and \nsupportive learning environment for its students, \nprotecting LGBTQ students\u2019 health and safety, and \ncomplying with anti-discrimination laws. ECF 43, \u00b6 \n39. \n \nThe plaintiffs are not likely to succeed on their \nsubstantive due process claim. \nB. The Remaining Preliminary Injunction \nFactors \n \nBecause the plaintiffs have not established any of \ntheir claims is likely to succeed on the merits, the \nCourt need not address the remaining preliminary \ninjunction \nfactors. \nNonetheless, \nbecause \na \nconstitutional violation is not likely or imminent, it \nfollows that the plaintiffs are not likely to suffer \nimminent irreparable harm, and the balance of the \nequities and the public interest favor denying an \n152a\n\n \n \ninjunction to avoid undermining the School Board\u2019s \nlegitimate interests in the no-opt-out policy. See \nLeaders, 2 F.4th at 346. \nIV. Injunction Pending Appeal \n \nAt the hearing on the preliminary injunction \nmotion, the plaintiffs made an oral motion for a stay \npursuant to Rule 8(a)(1) of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure if the Court were to deny their \nmotion. That rule requires that a \u201cparty ordinarily \nmove first in the district court for . . . a stay of the \njudgment or order of a district court pending appeal.\u201d \nFed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(A). There is no judgment or \norder of this Court to be stayed. The Court construes \nthe plaintiffs\u2019 motion as a request for an injunction \npending appeal under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n62(d).17 The standard for injunctive relief pending \nappeal is the same as for a preliminary injunction. See \nNken, 556 U.S. at 434; Goldstein v. Miller, 488 F. Supp. \n156, 171\u201372 (D. Md. 1980). This is so \u201cbecause similar \nconcerns arise whenever a court order may allow or \ndisallow anticipated action before the legality of that \naction has been conclusively determined.\u201d Nken, 556 \nU.S. at 434.  \n \nThe plaintiffs seek the same relief pending appeal \nas in their preliminary injunction motion: an \ninjunction that requires the Board to provide advance \nnotice and opt-outs from instruction involving the \nstorybooks and family life and human sexuality. For \nthe reasons stated in this opinion, the Court cannot \nconclude the plaintiffs are likely to succeed on the \n \n17  Fed. R. App. P. 8(a)(1)(C) requires parties to move for such \nrelief first in the district court. \n153a\n\n \n \nmerits of an appeal. The plaintiffs\u2019 request for a \npreliminary injunction pending appeal is denied. \nV. Conclusion \n \nThe \nplaintiffs \nhave \nnot \nestablished \nthe \nrequirements for a preliminary injunction. Their \nmotion is denied. Their request for an injunction \npending appeal is denied.

In a concurrently filed motion, Plaintiffs have \nrequested a waiver of the requirement under Local Rule 102.2(a) \nto provide their own and Defendants\u2019 home addresses in the \ncaption of this complaint.   \n \n156a\n\nNATURE OF THE ACTION \n1. This lawsuit against the Montgomery County Board \nof Education and its superintendent and board \nmembers (collectively, the \u201cSchool Board\u201d) is about \nwhether parents have the right to opt their children \nout of classroom instruction regarding family life and \nhuman sexuality.  \n2. \nMaryland \nlaw \nsays \n\u201cyes.\u201d \nCOMAR \n13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(iv), (i)-(ii).  \n3. Pursuant to written policy, the School Board has \nalways said \u201cyes\u201d too, including in an email to parents \nas recent as March 22, 2023.  \n4. But on March 23, 2023, the School Board flipped \npositions.  \n5. Now, it claims authority to introduce pre-K and \nelementary school kids to certain books (the \u201cPride \nStorybooks\u201d) that promote one-sided transgender \nideology, encourage gender transitioning, and focus \nexcessively on romantic infatuation\u2014with no parental \nnotification or opportunity to opt out.  \n6. The individual Plaintiff Parents and Kids First \n(collectively, \u201cthe Parents\u201d) have kids in the \nMontgomery County Public Schools (\u201cMCPS\u201d).  \n7. They come from many faith backgrounds, including \ndiverse strands of Islam and Christianity. Their \nconcerns \nreflect \nthose \nof \nthousands \nof \nother \nMontgomery County parents from a variety of faiths \nand political persuasions.  \n8. They are united in the conviction that the Pride \nStorybooks are age-inappropriate and inconsistent \nwith their religious beliefs and practices and their \nchild-raising philosophies.  \n157a\n\n9. For example, one book invites three- and four-year-\nolds to look for images of things they might find at a \npride parade, including an \u201cintersex [flag],\u201d a \u201c[drag] \nking\u201d and \u201c[drag] queen,\u201d \u201cleather,\u201d \u201cunderwear,\u201d and \nan image of a celebrated LGBTQ activist and sex \nworker, \n\u201cMarsha \nP. \nJohnson.\u201d \n  \n10. A book mandated for fourth graders describes a \nchild \u201cblush[ing] hot\u201d as she daydreams about \n\u201cgalloping off\u201d with a classmate who makes her \u201cheart \nskip.\u201d  \n158a\n\n \n \n11. \nThe \nteachers\u2019 \nguide \ninvites \nstudents \nto \n\u201cacknowledg[e] how uncomfortable we might [be] \u2026 \nwhen we feel our heart beating \u2018thumpity thump\u2019 & \nhow hard it can be [to] talk about our feelings with \nsomeone that we don\u2019t just \u2018like\u2019 but we \u2018like like.\u2019\u201d  \n12. Another book, for fifth graders, advocates a child-\nknows-best approach to gender transitioning, telling \nstudents that a decision to transition doesn\u2019t have to \n\u201cmake sense\u201d and that students are the best \u201cteacher\u201d \non such matters, not parents or other adults.  \n159a\n\n \n \n13. If a student insists that you \u201ccan\u2019t be a boy if \u2026 \nborn a girl\u201d or that sex depends on \u201c[w]hat body parts \n[you] have,\u201d teachers are told to correct the student:  \nWhen we are born, people make a guess about our \ngender and label us \u201cboy\u201d or \u201cgirl\u201d based on our body \nparts. Sometimes they\u2019re right, and sometimes they\u2019re \nwrong. Our body parts do not decide our gender. Our \ngender comes from inside\u2014we might feel different \nthan what people tell us we are. We know ourselves \nbest.  \n160a\n\n14. This school year, after the Parents were told about \nthe books, requests for their kids to opt out were \nhonored.  \n15. Now the Parents have been told that, next year, no \nnotice will be given and no opt-outs tolerated because \ntheir kids must learn to be more \u201cLGBTQ-Inclusive.\u201d  \n16. Under long-standing precedent, government \nschools are not \u201cempowered \u2026 to \u2018save\u2019 a child from \nhimself or his [religious] parents\u201d by imposing \n\u201ccompulsory\u201d education to \u201cinfluence \u2026 the religious \nfuture of the child.\u201d Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, \n232 (1972).  \n17. The Maryland law that lets parents opt their \nchildren out from instruction on \u201cfamily life and \nhuman sexuality\u201d reflects that principle. See COMAR \n13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(iv), (i)-(ii).  \n18. So do the School Board\u2019s own written policies on \nupholding religious diversity. See, e.g., Ex. A at 3 \n(committing \u201cto accommodate requests from students, \nor requests from parents/guardians on behalf of their \nstudents, to be excused from specific classroom \ndiscussions or activities that they believe would \nimpose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs\u201d).  \n19. The School Board\u2019s recent about-face strips away \nthis long-standing protection of parental rights. This \nviolates not just Maryland law and Board policy and \npractice but also the United States Constitution.  \n20. Specifically, the First Amendment\u2019s Religion and \nFree \nSpeech \nClauses \nand \nthe \nFourteenth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause guarantee the \nparental right to opt  \n161a\n\nchildren out of classroom instruction on such sensitive \nreligious and ideological issues.  \n21. The Parents bring this lawsuit to vindicate that \nlong-recognized right.  \nJURISDICTION AND VENUE \n22. The Court has subject matter jurisdiction under 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1331 and 1343.  \n23. Venue lies in this district under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 \n1391(b).  \nTHE PARTIES \nThe Mahmoud-Barakat Family  \n24. Plaintiffs Tamer Mahmoud and Enas Barakat are \nMuslims and residents of Montgomery County.  \n25. They currently have three children enrolled in \nMCPS\u2014a son and daughter in tenth grade and a son \nin second grade.  \nThe Roman Family  \n26. Plaintiffs Jeff and Svitlana Roman are also \nMontgomery County residents.  \n27. Jeff is Roman Catholic and an MCPS graduate of \nSherwood High School; Svitlana is Ukrainian \nOrthodox.  \n28. The Romans currently have one son enrolled in \nMCPS in second grade.  \nThe Persak Family  \n29. Plaintiffs Chris and Melissa Persak are Catholic \nand life-long residents of Montgomery County.  \n30. Melissa is an MCPS graduate of Sherwood High \nSchool.  \n162a\n\n31. The Persaks have two elementary school age \ndaughters (the \u201cStudent Plaintiffs\u201d) enrolled in MCPS.  \nKids First  \n32. Kids First is an unincorporated association of \nparents and teachers who prioritize the needs of \nchildren in the Montgomery County Public Schools \nand who believe that children deserve to be kids first.  \n33. The association was formed to advocate for the \nreturn of parental notice and opt-out rights with \nrespect to any instruction related to family life and \nhuman sexuality in the Montgomery County Public \nSchools.  \n34. The Association includes Muslims, Catholics, \nProtestants, Latter-day Saints, and Jews, and is open \nto individuals of all faiths.  \n35. Many members of Kids First have children in the \nMontgomery County Public Schools or would have \nchildren in the Montgomery County Public Schools but \nfor the removal of parental notice and opt-out rights \nwith respect to instruction related to family life and \nhuman sexuality.  \nDefendants  \n36. \nDefendant \nMontgomery \nCounty \nBoard \nof \nEducation is a government entity authorized by the \nState of Maryland to administer MCPS. Md. Code, \nEduc. Art. \u00a7\u00a7 3-103, 3-104(a).  \n37. It controls educational matters that affect \nMontgomery County, id. at \u00a7 4-101, and is authorized \nto adopt educational policies, rules, and regulations for \nMCPS, as long as they are consistent with State law, \nid. at \u00a7 4-108(3)-(4).  \n163a\n\n38. As of fall 2021, MCPS comprises 209 schools and \napproximately \n160,000 \nstudents, \nincluding \napproximately 70,000 elementary school students.  \n39. It is the largest public school system in Maryland \nand routinely among the twenty largest public school \nsystems in the United States. See At a Glance, \nMontgomery County Public Schools (Oct. 2019), \nhttps://perma.cc/U3AS-EMWT.  \n40. Its principal place of business is 850 Hungerford \nDrive, Rockville, Maryland.  \n41. Defendant Monifa B. McKnight, Ed.D., is the \nsuperintendent of MCPS.  \n42. In that role, Dr. McKnight is charged with \nimplementing the policies at issue.  \n43. She regularly attends board meetings and \nparticipated in the decision to strip parents of their \nnotice and opt-out rights with respect to the Pride \nStorybooks.  \n44. At all relevant times, Dr. McKnight was acting \nunder color of state law.  \n45. She is sued in her official capacity only.  \n46. Defendants Karla Silvestre, Shebra Evans, Grace \nRivera-Oven, Rebecca Smondrowski, Julie Yang, \nBrenda Wolff, and Lynne Harris are elected members \nof the Montgomery County Board of Education.  \n47. Each regularly attends board meetings and \nparticipated in the decision to strip parents of their \nnotice and opt-out rights with respect to the Pride \nStorybooks.  \n48. At all relevant times, they were acting under color \nof state law.  \n164a\n\n49. They are sued in their official capacities only.  \nFACTUAL BACKGROUND \nThe Parents\u2019 religious beliefs  \nThe Mahmoud/Barakat Family  \n50. As taught by the Qu\u2019ran, Plaintiffs Tamer \nMahmoud and Enas Barakat believe that all humans \nare God\u2019s creations with God-given dignity that must \nbe respected, regardless of the person\u2019s faith, race, \nethnic origin, sex, gender identity, sexual orientation, \nor social status. Surah al-Israa 17:70.  \n51. As also taught by the Qu\u2019ran, they believe that \nmankind has been divinely created as male and \nfemale, Surah al-Hujurat 49:13, and that all people \nare connected through a common ancestor: the first \nmale and the first female, Surah an-Nisaa 4:1.  \n52. Based on this teaching, Tamer and Enas believe \nthat sex and sexuality are sacred gifts from God to be \nexpressed through the forming of a spiritual, marital \nbond between spouses\u2014one male and one female\u2014for \nthe \nshared \npromise \nof \nsecurity, \ntranquility, \ncompassion, contentment, and joy. Surah al-A\u2019raf \n7:189; Surah ar-Rum 30:21.  \n53. Tamer and Enas believe that this sacred bond \nbetween husbands and wives entails sexually distinct \nbut mutual duties and affections: \u201cThey are clothing \nfor you and you are clothing for them.\u201d Surah al-\nBaqarah 2:187.  \n54. Tamer and Enas believe that marriage, sex, and \nsexuality are also meant for creating children and \nteaching them virtue\u2014not only to build a loving family \nbut also to serve as an example of righteousness for \nsociety at large. Surah al-Furqan 25:74.  \n165a\n\n55. Inherent in this teaching, Tamer and Enas believe \nthat \u201cgender\u201d cannot be unwoven from biological \n\u201csex\u201d\u2014to the extent the two are even distinct\u2014\nwithout rejecting the dignity and direction God \nbestowed on humanity from the start.  \n56. Tamer and Enas believe that humans attain their \nfullest God-given potential by embracing their \nbiological sex.  \n57. Tamer and Enas believe that they have a sacred \nobligation to teach these principles to their children.  \nThe Roman Family  \n58. The Romans\u2019 Christian faith teaches that all \nhumans are children of God created in God\u2019s image \nand likeness.  \n59. Based on this teaching, they believe God \ncommands them to treat others as bearers of this \nintrinsic nature. They believe that what God has \ncreated by His design cannot be redefined or recreated \nby man.  \n60. Also based on this teaching, they believe that \nsexuality is a sacred gift from God, reflecting that men \nand women together are capable of cooperating with \nGod in creating new life.  \n61. For this reason, the Romans believe sexuality is \nexpressed only in marriage between a man and a \nwoman for creating life and strengthening the marital \nunion.  \n62. For the same reasons, the Romans believe that \ngender and biological sex are intertwined and \ninseparable and that encouraging children to unwind \nthem will teach them that their bodies are \u201can object, \na mere tool at the disposal of the soul, one that each \n166a\n\nperson may dispose of according to his or her own will,\u201d \nrather than a \u201cconstitutive part of the human subject, \na gift to be received, respected, and cared for as \nsomething intrinsic to the person.\u201d Committee on \nDoctrine United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops, Doctrinal Note on the Moral Limits to \nTechnological Manipulation of the Human Body 4 \n(2023), https://perma.cc/T6Y6-NXAB.  \n63. The Romans believe that humans attain their \nfullest God-given potential by embracing their \nbiological sex.  \n64. They believe they have a sacred obligation to teach \nthese principles to their son.  \nThe Persak Family  \n65. The Persaks believe that questions about sex and \nsexuality should be informed by sound science and \ncommon sense.  \n66. They believe that all persons should be treated \nwith respect and dignity regardless of religion, race, \nsex, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or \nother characteristics.  \n67. The Persak parents want their daughters to \nunderstand and appreciate the unique gifts and \nchallenges of every individual.  \n68. The Persaks\u2019 understanding of what is best for \ntheir child is informed by their Roman Catholic faith.  \n69. The Persaks believe that matters regarding family \nlife and human sexuality should be taught in a way \nthat is consistent with their beliefs, sound science, and \ncommon sense.  \n167a\n\n70. They believe that children\u2014particularly those, \nlike their own, in elementary school\u2014are highly \nimpressionable to ideological instruction presented in \nchildren\u2019s books or by schoolteachers.  \n71. They believe this risk is even more serious when \nideological instruction is imposed to the exclusion of \nother viewpoints.  \nKids First  \n72. The members of Kids First come from diverse \nreligious \ntraditions, \nincluding \nIslam, \nJudaism, \nChristianity, and more. They believe in prioritizing \nthe needs of children and allowing elementary-age \nchildren to be kids first, without prematurely exposing \nthem to issues regarding human sexuality, gender \nidentity, and gender transitioning.  \n73. They agree that parents have the primary \nresponsibility to decide how and when to introduce \ninstruction on family life and human sexuality to their \nown children.  \n74. They have a religious obligation to ensure that \ntheir children are taught about family life and human \nsexuality in a manner that is consistent with their \nrespective religious beliefs.  \n75. Aspects of some or all of the Pride Storybooks \nviolate their religious understanding of human \nsexuality and contradict the religious teachings they \nseek to convey to their children.  \n* * * \n76. The Parents believe that every individual has \nequal dignity before God and should be treated with \nlove, kindness, and respect.  \n168a\n\n77. They want their children to understand and \nappreciate the unique gifts and challenges of every \nindividual.  \n78. The Parents believe that matters regarding family \nlife and human sexuality should be taught in a way \nthat is consistent with their respective religious \nbeliefs.  \n79. The Parents also believe that such matters should \nbe taught to children in age-appropriate ways. This \nincludes teaching children, at the proper time, to \nchannel their romantic passions, rather than indulge \nthem at first spark.  \n80. The Parents also believe that the Pride Storybooks \ngo far beyond teaching kindness and respect (as a \nmatter of manners or virtuous citizenship).  \n81. Rather, the Pride Storybooks are being used to \nimpose an ideological view of family life and sexuality \nthat characterizes any divergent beliefs as \u201churtful.\u201d  \n82. The Pride Storybooks also promote political \nideologies about family life and human sexuality that \nare inconsistent with sound science, common sense, \nand the well-being of children.  \n83. The Parents believe it is spiritually, mentally, and \nphysically injurious to introduce children prematurely \nto many of the topics introduced by the Pride \nStorybooks.  \nInstruction on family life and human sexuality  \n84. By regulation, every \u201clocal school system\u201d in \nMaryland is required to provide a \u201ccomprehensive \nhealth education\u201d that includes \u201cfamily life and \nhuman sexuality.\u201d COMAR 13A.04.18.01(A), (C)(1)(c), \n(D)(2).  \n169a\n\n85. Such instruction \u201cwill begin in or prior to the grade \n5.\u201d Id. at 18.01(D)(2)(d).  \n86. Nothing in Maryland law requires that this \ninstruction be reserved to a single class or a discrete \nsection of the curriculum.  \n87. Rather, schools are required to teach \u201cindicators \nand objectives\u201d and \u201cconcepts and skills\u201d related to \n\u201cfamily \nlife \nand \nhuman \nsexuality.\u201d \nId. \nat \n18.01(D)(2)(d), (g).  \n88. Such \u201cindicators and objectives\u201d and \u201cconcepts and \nskills\u201d comprise a wide range of instruction.  \n89. This instruction must \u201crepresent all students \nregardless of ability, sexual orientation, gender \nidentity, and gender expression.\u201d Id. at 18.01(D)(2)(a).  \n90. By grade 7, the instruction \u201cshall emphasize that \nrefraining from sexual activity is the best method to \navoid sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, \nand unintended pregnancy.\u201d Id. at 18.01(D)(2)(b).  \n91. It must also include \u201cmedically accurate \ninformation about contraception and condoms.\u201d Id.  \n92. And \u201cin every grade in which the curriculum is \ntaught,\u201d there must be \u201cage-appropriate instruction on \nthe meaning of \u2018consent\u2019 and respect for personal \nboundaries.\u201d Id. at 18.01(D)(2)(f).  \nThe national consensus on notice and opt-outs  \n93. Forty-three states and the District of Columbia \nrequire or permit some instruction in human \nsexuality.  \n94. In some states, that instruction is limited to \nreproductive health or HIV/AIDS, while other states\u2014\n170a\n\nlike Maryland\u2014speak more broadly to \u201cfamily life\u201d \nand \u201chuman sexuality.\u201d  \n95. Thirty-two of those 44 jurisdictions allow for \nstudent opt-outs, including Maryland.2 \n96. Another four states require that human sexuality \nbe taught to children only when parents opt in.3 \n97. One state doesn\u2019t require human sexuality \ninstruction\u2014but still requires opt-outs should any \nschools implement that instruction.4 \n \n2  \nSee Ariz. Rev. Stat.

Code Ann. \u00a7 28.004(i).   \n171a\n\nMaryland law on notice and opt-outs  \n98. Within this broad consensus for ensuring opt-outs, \nMaryland is among the jurisdictions most protective of \nparental rights, broadly requiring both parental notice \nand the ability to opt out.  \n99. Maryland law provides, \u201cThe local school system \nshall provide an opportunity for parents/guardians to \nview instructional materials to be used in the teaching \nof family life and human sexuality objectives.\u201d \nCOMAR 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(iv).  \n100. And there must be \u201cpolicies, guidelines, and/or \nprocedures for student opt-out regarding instruction \nrelated to family life and human sexuality objectives.\u201d \nId. at 18.01(D)(2)(e)(i).  \n101. Students that opt out of this instruction must \nthen be provided \u201cwith appropriate alternative \nlearning activities and/or assessments in health \neducation.\u201d Id. at 18.01(D)(2)(e)(ii).  \n102. The opt-out provision does not require a religious \nor moral objection.  \nThe School Board\u2019s own rules on notice and opt-\nouts  \n103. Beyond the state regulations protecting opt-outs, \nthe School Board\u2019s own guidelines reinforce this \nparental right.  \n104. In particular, the School Board\u2019s 2022-2023 \n\u201cGuidelines for Respecting Religious Diversity\u201d (the \n\u201cGuidelines\u201d) \u201ccommit to making feasible and \nreasonable accommodations for [religious] beliefs and \npractices.\u201d See Ex. A at 1.  \n105. The School Board\u2019s Guidelines promise:  \n172a\n\na. \u201cto accommodate requests from students, \nor requests from parents/guardians on \nbehalf of their students, to be excused from \nspecific classroom discussions or activities \nthat \nthey \nbelieve \nwould \nimpose \na \nsubstantial \nburden \non \ntheir \nreligious \nbeliefs,\u201d id. at 3;  \nb. to allow students \u201cto be excused from the \nclassroom activity if the students, or their \nparents/guardians, \nbelieve \nthe \nactivity \nwould invade student privacy by calling \nattention to the student\u2019s religion,\u201d id. at 3-\n4; and  \nc. to \u201caccommodate objections from students \nor their parents/guardians to a particular \nreading assignment on religious grounds by \nproviding an alternative selection that \nmeets the same lesson objectives,\u201d id. at 4.  \n106. The Guidelines also ensure other religious \naccommodations for MCPS students.  \n107. They provide for excused absences for religious \nholidays\u2014with \na \n\u201ccase-by-case\u201d \napproach \nto \ndetermining whether students must make up missed \nassignments. Id. at 2.  \n108. They also allow for \u201cexcus[ing] students who do \nnot want to participate\u201d in \u201cactivities\u201d that \u201cmay be \nviewed by others as having religious overtones,\u201d \nincluding \u201cbirthdays or other occasions that many may \nconsider to be secular, such as Halloween and \nValentine\u2019s Day.\u201d Id. at 4.  \n109. Beyond religious accommodations, the Guidelines \nalso \u201cexpect instructional activities to be fair, \n173a\n\nobjective, \nand \nnot \ndemean \nany \nreligious \nor \nnonreligious beliefs.\u201d Id. at 4.  \n110. They provide that \u201c[r]especting students\u2019 differing \nbeliefs is an essential element of a pluralistic society.\u201d \nId.  \n111. Accordingly, the Guidelines prohibit \u201cteachers, \nstudents, and guest speakers\u201d from \u201cadvocat[ing] \nparticular religious viewpoints as superior to other \nreligious or nonreligious viewpoints.\u201d Id.  \n112. Similarly, when guest speakers come to school or \nstudents are allowed to speak at assemblies, \u201c[s]chools \nshould make appropriate, neutral disclaimers to avoid \nconveying the perception to other students, their \nparents/guardians, or guests that the school endorses \nthe student\u2019s or guest speaker\u2019s viewpoints (whether \nreligious or not).\u201d Id.  \nThe Pride Storybooks  \n113. In October 2022, the School Board announced it \nhad \u201capproved a selection of over 22 LGBTQ+-\ninclusive texts for use in the classroom.\u201d See Diverse \nand Inclusive  \nInstructional Materials & Resources, Montgomery \nCounty Public Schools, https://perma.cc/B5B3-GCEU; \nSee also Ex. B. This came in response to a \ncomprehensive \u201cAntiracist System Audit\u201d that the \nSchool Board commissioned in 2021. See Dr. Monifa \nMcKnight, MCPS Antiracist Audit Implementation, \nMontgomery County Public Schools (Feb. 2, 2022), \nhttps://perma.cc/ZT69-ZURR.  \n114. For children in pre-K and Head Start programs, \nthe School Board approved Pride Puppy, a book \n174a\n\nrelating the story of two women taking their children \nto a pride parade, where their puppy gets lost. Ex. C.  \n115. The story uses the letters of the alphabet to \nillustrate what a child might see at a pride parade.  \n116. The book\u2019s \u201cSearch and Find Word List\u201d \nencourages children to search for images of, among \nother things, the \u201cintersex [flag],\u201d a \u201c[drag] king,\u201d \n\u201cleather,\u201d a \u201clip ring,\u201d a \u201c[drag] queen,\u201d \u201cunderwear,\u201d \nand a celebrated sex worker.  \n117. The book\u2019s illustrations encourage unqualified \nsupport for pride parades, with illustrations ostensibly \ngeared toward three- and four-year-olds, showing \nthings such as a minister wearing pride apparel and \nstudents and teachers enthusiastically advocating for \n\u201cPeers + Queers,\u201d \u201cPride Club,\u201d \u201cLove Knows No \nGender,\u201d and \u201cTwo Spirit Pride.\u201d  \n118. One illustration celebrates Marsha P. Johnson, a \nself-defined \u201ctransvestite\u201d or \u201cqueen\u201d who, again as \nself-described, built a life \u201caround sex and gay \nliberation, being a drag queen\u201d and sex work. \nStonewall 1979: The Drag of Politics, The Village \nVoice, https://perma.cc/9NRA-JF2A.  \n119. Other illustrations similarly introduce concepts \naround transgenderism, \u201cqueer\u201d ideology, same-sex \nmarriage, intersectionality, gender transitioning, \ndrag, and drag shows. Ex. C at 3-17.  \n120. Pre-K teachers assigned to read the book in their \nclassrooms are provided a resource guide from the \nHuman Rights Campaign (HRC) for \u201cdefining \nLGBTQ+ words for elementary students.\u201d Ex. D at 2.  \n121. HRC is an activist organization that advocates for \nideological education on sexual orientation and gender \n175a\n\nidentity starting in kindergarten. To that end, it \npublishes teaching guides using some of the books \napproved by the School Board. See, e.g., Ex. D at 2.  \n122. Beyond laudable aims of promoting equality, \nfairness, and the end of bullying, HRC espouses a \nspecific ideology on issues regarding family life and \nhuman sexuality.  \n123. For example, HRC advocates \u201csex positivity,\u201d \nHRC Foundation Launches Gen Z Sexual Health \nProgram: GENERATE, Human Rights Campaign, \nhttps://perma.cc/P4S4-3VSN, \nwhich \nis \ngenerally \nunderstood as promoting \u201can attitude towards human \nsexuality that regards all consensual sexual activities \nas \nfundamentally \nhealthy \nand \npleasurable, \nencourages sexual pleasure and experimentation.\u201d \nAllena Gabosch, A Sex Positive Renaissance (Dec. 8, \n2014), https://perma.cc/92WD-W94R.  \n124. \u201c[S]ex positivity can be understood as an ideology \nthat promotes, with respect to gender and sexuality, \nbeing open-minded, non-judgmental and respectful of \npersonal sexual autonomy, when there is consent.\u201d \nChantelle Ivanski \n& Taylor Kohut, Exploring \ndefinitions of sex positivity through thematic analysis, \n26 Can. J. of Hum. Sexuality 3, 216-25 (2017), \nhttps://utpjournals.press/doi/10.3138/cjhs.2017-0017.  \n125. The HRC guide promotes discussion with \nstudents including vocabulary such as \u201ccisgender,\u201d \n\u201cgender binary,\u201d \u201ctransgender,\u201d \u201cpansexual,\u201d and \n\u201cqueer.\u201d Ex. D at 2.  \n126. Many individuals who argue in favor of children \nattending pride parades do so for reasons that the \nParents\u2014and countless others\u2014find ideological and \nobjectionable.  \n176a\n\n127. For example, a recent article in Fatherly argues \nfor kids \u201cabsolutely\u201d participating in pride parades, \nopining that it is simply \u201cnecessary to talk to [them]\u201d \nin advance \u201cabout new things they may see,\u201d like \n\u201cpublic nudity and kink.\u201d Heather Tirado Gilligan, \nShould You Take Your Kids To A Pride Parade?, \nFatherly (June 1, 2022), https://perma.cc/E22H-5DN4.  \n128. One parent quoted in the article contended that \nher kids \u201cjust had to learn to laugh and enjoy things. \nLike there were these Beanie Babies with giant \npenises on them. \u2026 For a fourth- and fifth-grade kid, \nthat\u2019s super funny.\u201d Id.  \n129. A 2021 op-ed in the Washington Post argued in \nsupport of exposing children to \u201ca few dozen kinksters \nwho danced down the street, laughing together as they \ntwirled their whips and batons, some leading \ncompanions by leashes.\u201d Lauren Rowello, Yes, kink \nbelongs at Pride. And I want my kids to see it, \nWashington \nPost \n(June \n29, \n2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/RM3Q-9W6N.  \n130. This parent was happy to explain to her \nelementary-age child and toddler why a \u201cbare-chested \nman in dark sunglasses whose black suspenders \nclipped into a leather thong \u2026 paused to be spanked \nplayfully by a partner with a flog.\u201d Id.  \n131. The storybook Pride Puppy makes no mention of \nthis broader context, instead promoting pride parades \nonly as a laudable family experience, without \nacknowledging they often contain material that many \nparents find inappropriate for young children.  \n132. Other Pride Storybooks similarly promote an \nideologically one-sided view of issues that are \nreligiously, socially, and scientifically controverted.  \n177a\n\n133. For example, books for first through fifth graders \ninclude Uncle Bobby\u2019s Wedding; Intersection Allies; My \nRainbow; Prince & Knight; Love, Violet; and Born \nReady\u2014The True Story of a Boy Named Penelope.  \n134. Uncle Bobby\u2019s Wedding is a story meant, as its \njacket states, to \u201cvalidat[e]\u201d same-sex marriage in the \neyes of a small child. The book describes itself as a \n\u201ccelebration of love in all its forms.\u201d The story consists \nof a young girl upset that her uncle wants to marry, \nuntil her uncle\u2019s boyfriend befriends her and gains her \ntrust.

When the mother points to her \nown short hair, he responds \u201cPeople don\u2019t care if \ncisgender girls like you have short hair. But it\u2019s \ndifferent for transgender girls.

Ex. \nH.  \n140. The story, Love, Violet, is about an elementary \nschool girl\u2019s crush on one of her classmates. \u201cAs far as \nViolet was concerned,\u201d it reads, \u201conly one person in her \nclass raced like the wind. Only one had a leaping \nlaugh. Only one made Violet\u2019s heart skip.\u201d Ex. I at 4. \nThe story details Violet\u2019s inhibition to express her \nromantic feelings until the end of the story when the \ntwo classmates exchange a valentine and a locket. \nViolet is described as \u201cblush[ing] hot\u201d when asked \nabout her valentine.

I AM a boy.\u201d The mother agrees to tell \ntheir family \u201cwhat we know. \u2026 You are a boy.\u201d \nGrandpa agrees that \u201cgender isn\u2019t such a big deal.\u201d \nWhen Penelope\u2019s brother protests\u2014\u201cYou can\u2019t become \na boy. You have to be born one\u201d\u2014he\u2019s told that \u201c[n]ot \neverything needs to make sense. This is about love.\u201d \nPapa agrees that Penelope is a boy as long as Penelope \nwill \u201ctell me yourself.\u201d And when Penelope tells the \nprincipal \u201cI think like a boy. I feel like a boy. \u2026 I\u2019m \nsure I\u2019m a boy,\u201d the teacher says, \u201ctoday you\u2019re my \nteacher.\u201d Ex. J.  \n143. The resource guide for this book encourages \nchildren to notice \u201chow happy Penelope is when his \nmom \u2026 commits to sharing with their loved ones that \nhe is a boy\u201d and to question why gender is \u201csuch a big \ndeal [in the United States].\u201d Ex.

Sometimes they\u2019re \nright, and sometimes they\u2019re wrong. Our \nbody parts do not decide our gender.

D at 5.  \n180a\n\nThe science around transgenderism and sexual \norientation  \n145. A significant body of scientific evidence indicates \nthat most children who experience gender dysphoria \nwill outgrow those feelings.

As the American College of Pediatrics put it in \n2018, \u201c[t]he debate over how to treat children with \n[gender dysphoria] is primarily an ethical dispute; one \nthat concerns physician worldview as much as science. \n\u2026 Medicine also does not occur in a political vacuum \nand being on the wrong side of sexual politics can have \nsevere consequences for individuals who hold the \npolitically incorrect view.\u201d Am.

Many children also experience feelings of same-\nsex attraction or infatuation but do not identify as gay \nor lesbian in adulthood. See Miles Ott et al., Stability \nand Change in Self-Reported Sexual Orientation \nIdentity in Young People: Application of Mobility \nMetrics, 40 Archives Sexual Behav. 519, 520 (2011), \nhttps://perma.cc/VY75-RVEC \n(\u201c[I]t \nhas \nbeen \nacknowledged that a person\u2019s sexual orientation may \nchange not only during adolescence but also across the \nadult lifespan.\u201d); see also Bennett McIntosh, There\u2019s \n(Still) No Gay Gene, Harv.

There is also significant evidence that an \nindividual\u2019s \nwell-being \nis \nnot \nimproved \nto \na \nstatistically significant degree by indulging that \nindividual\u2019s subjective perception of his gender \nidentity. See, e.g., William Malone, Puberty Blockers \nfor Gender Dysphoria: The Science is Far from Settled, \n5 Lancet Child & Adolescent Health 33 (2021), \nhttps://perma.cc/5RCS-HHVH; \nLisa \nLittman, \nIndividuals Treated for Gender Dysphoria with \nMedical \nand/or \nSurgical \nTransition \nWho \nSubsequently Detransitioned: A Survey of 100 \nDetransitioners, 50 Archives Sexual Behav. 3353 \n182a\n\n(2021), https://perma.cc/852N-6EHW; see also Gibson, \n920 F.3d at 222 (quoting expert who \u201cemphasized that \n\u2018large gaps\u2019 exist in the medical community\u2019s \nknowledge regarding the long-term effects of [sex \n\u201creassignment\u201d surgery] and other [gender dysphoria] \ntreatments in relation to its positive or negative \ncorrelation to suicidal ideation.\u2019\u201d (alterations in \noriginal)).  \n150. This scientific and experiential data is consistent \nwith many parents\u2019 religious beliefs that a person\u2019s \nbiological sex is a gift from God and that the greatest \nhappiness comes from appreciating the body given as \na free gift to the person.  \n151. Many religious believers also accept that sexual \nrelations are intended by God to take place only within \nmarriage between a man and a woman and encourage \ntheir children to live consistent with those religious \nteachings.  \nThe \nSchool \nBoard\u2019s \ndecision \nto \nconceal \ninformation and reject opt-outs  \n152. Hundreds of parents in Montgomery County have \nexpressed concern that the new Pride Storybooks \nintroduce issues around family life and sexuality that \nare inappropriate for children in elementary school.  \n153. Indeed, a poll by the Washington Post and \nUniversity \nof \nMaryland \nshowed \nthat, \namong \nregistered voters, sixty-six percent of Marylanders \ndisapproved of schoolteachers discussing LGBTQ \nissues with students from kindergarten through third \ngrade. Nicole Asbury and Emily Guskin, Most Md. \nvoters say elementary school discussion of LGBTQ \nacceptance \u2018inappropriate,\u2019 The Washington Post (Oct. \n12, 2022), https://perma.cc/6NED-E9RH.  \n183a\n\n154. Fifty-six percent disapproved for fourth and fifth \ngraders. Id.  \n155. Even for middle schoolers, forty-two percent of \nvoters disapproved. Id.  \n156. Only for high schoolers, did a strong majority \nsupport such conversations, with only twenty-seven \npercent of voters disapproving. Id.  \n157. One parent expressed concern at a School Board \nmeeting that the book My Rainbow was pushing \ntransgender ideology: \u201cthis is not instruction, it is \nindoctrination.\u201d Testimony at the Montgomery County \nPublic Schools Business Meeting, at 27:11-29:09 (Jan. \n12, 2023), https://perma.cc/T234-559Q.  \n158. Defendant Harris responded urging the School \nBoard to adhere to the curriculum, and a colleague \nemphasized in reference to the parent\u2019s testimony \nthat, \u201c[y]es, ignorance and hate does exist in our \ncommunity.\u201d Id. at 38:34-40:40.  \n159. Nevertheless, on March 22, 2023, consistent with \nits policies and past practices, the School Board issued \na statement confirming parents\u2019 notification and opt-\nout rights:  \n \nWhen a teacher selects a curriculum, a \nnotification goes out to parents about the \nbook. If a parent chooses to opt out, a \nteacher can find a substitute text for that \nstudent that supports these standards and \naligns with curriculum.  \nSee Stephanie Ramirez, MCPS revises policy on \nLGBTQ-friendly books, Fox 5 Washington DC (Mar. \n22, 2023), https://perma.cc/8L5G-XQ9X.  \n184a\n\n160. But the next day, in a \u201cRevised Message \nRegarding the Use of Inclusive Texts,\u201d the School \nBoard reversed course:  \n[T]here is as an expectation that teachers \nutilize these inclusive lessons and texts with \nall students. \u2026 Students and families may \nnot choose to opt out of engaging with any \ninstructional materials, other than \u201cFamily \nLife \nand \nHuman \nSexuality \nUnit \nof \nInstruction\u201d which is specifically permitted \nby Maryland law. As such, teachers will not \nsend home letters to inform families when \ninclusive books are read in the future. \nSee 5 Things to Know, Montgomery County Public \nSchools (March 23, 2023), https://perma.cc/6XVG-\nR3CF.  \n161. The School Board\u2019s attempt to segregate the Pride \nStorybooks from \u201cfamily life and human sexuality\u201d is \ninconsistent with the Maryland regulation requiring \nparental notice and opt-outs.  \n162. The regulation extends parental notice and opt-\nout rights to any teaching of \u201cindicators and \nobjectives\u201d or \u201cconcepts and skills\u201d regarding family \nlife and human sexuality\u2014not a single class or \n\u201c[u]nit.\u201d See COMAR 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(d)(g).  \n163. The next day in the Persak Plaintiffs\u2019 elementary \nschool, teachers were instructed to introduce and read \nthe books in their classrooms.  \n164. The principal informed the Persaks that, because \nthey had requested an opt-out, their daughter was \nexcused from the classroom when one of the Pride \nStorybooks was read.  \n185a\n\n165. The principal made clear, however, that no \nfurther notifications or opt-outs would be provided.  \n166. As the principal put it earlier, these opt-outs were \nmade \u201c[t]o accommodate [parents\u2019] fears\u201d and she \n\u201cdisagree[d] with th[em] unequivocally.\u201d Ex. K.  \n167. The Roman Plaintiffs corresponded with the \nprincipal of their elementary school, seeking both an \nopt-out for their son and guarantees that parents \nwould continue to receive notice about the Pride \nStorybooks and that teaching them would be optional \nfor teachers. See Ex. L.  \n168. On February 1, 2023, the principal told the \nRomans that \u201cit is your right to ask that [your son] not \nbe present when this book is read to the class and if \nany other parents reach out I will meet with them to \nhave the same discussion we engaged in and they can \nmake a decision for their family.\u201d Id. at 7.  \n169. Plaintiffs Tamer Mahmoud and Enas Barakat \nasked the acting principal of their elementary school \nto opt their son out of class reading of Prince and \nKnight, and to assign him an alternative activity. Ex. \nM.  \n170. The acting principal offered the parents an \nopportunity to read the book. Id.  \n171. The acting principal then followed up by stating \nthat MCPS is not supporting parents opting out of the \nPride Storybooks, and teachers are not required to \nprovide alternative assignments. Id.  \n172. Tamer and Enas responded by saying that their \ndecision to opt-out did not change after reading the \nbook. Id.  \n186a\n\n173. They again asked for their son to receive an \nalternate assignment. Id.  \n174. The acting principal finally responded (on March \n20) that he would allow their son to sit outside the \nclassroom while the book was discussed. Id.  \n175. Nevertheless, on March 23, the School Board \nannounced that the Pride Storybooks were being read \nto students and that parents would no longer receive \nadvance notice or opportunity to opt their children out. \nId.  \n176. On March 28, Defendant Harris addressed the \nissue at a School Board meeting, accusing parents who \nhad just testified in support of opt outs that they were \nmotivated by hate: \nRogers and Hammerstein got it right seven \nyears: \u201cYou have to be taught to hate.\u201d You \nknow, \nno \nchild \nis \nborn \nother-izing, \nmarginalizing, thinking somebody else is \nnot as good as they are \u2026. Saying that a \nkindergartener can\u2019t be present when you \nread a book about a rainbow unicorn \nbecause it offends your religious rights or \nyour family values or your core beliefs is just \ntelling that kid, \u201cHere\u2019s another reason to \nhate another person.\u201d   \nLynne Harris, Remarks at the MCPS Board Meeting \nat \n1:48:00-1:48:15 \n(March \n28, \n2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/AW3T-DMJB; see also Ex.

Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding \nparagraphs.  \n178. Independent of the lack of general applicability or \nneutrality toward religion, the Pride Storybooks \nviolate the Free Exercise Clause\u2019s guarantee of an \n\u201cenduring American tradition\u201d: \u201cthe rights of parents \nto direct \u2018the religious upbringing\u2019 of their children.\u201d \nEspinoza v.

The long-standing American tradition protecting \nthe right of parents to shape their children\u2019s religious \neducation meant \u201ccourts tended to rely on a common \nlaw presumption of the soundness of parental \njudgment in making educational decisions pertaining \nto their children.\u201d Ralph D. Mawdsley & Daniel Drake, \nCommentary, Involving Parents in the Public Schools: \nLegal and Policy Issues, 76 Educ. L. Rep. 299, 301 \n(1992).  \n180. The American tradition was a departure from the \nEnglish religious establishment, where laws fined \nparents for instructing their children \u201cin the popish \nreligion.\u201d 1 William Blackstone, Commentaries on the \nLaws of England 451 (Edward Christian ed., 1793); see \nalso id. at 450 (\u201cYet in one case, that of religion, \n[parents] are under peculiar restrictions.\u201d).  \n181. Under the American tradition, unless the \nparental decision would detrimentally \u201caffect the \ngovernment of the school or incommode the other \nstudents or the teachers,\u201d \u201cit is for the parent, not the \n[school], to direct the branches of education [a child] \nshall pursue, so far as they are taught.\u201d Trs. of Schs. \nv. People ex rel. Van Allen, 87 Ill. 303, 309 (1877); see \nalso Morse v.

Accordingly, unless public safety or the \u201cspecial \ncharacteristics\u201d of the school setting are at issue, a \nschool\u2019s desired \u201ceducational mission\u201d is insufficient to \nrestrict First Amendment rights. Morse, 551 U.S. at \n423 (Alito, J., concurring).  \n183. Here, the forced inculcation of the Pride \nStorybooks without parental notice or opt-out rights \nburdens the Parents\u2019 right to form their children on a \nmatter of core religious exercise and parenting: how to \nunderstand who they are.  \n184. There is no analogous tradition of restricting this \nright.  \n185. To the contrary, as discussed above, a long-\nstanding national consensus of broadly allowing opt-\nouts from instruction on family life and human \nsexuality instruction exists, including in Maryland. \nSupra \u00b6\u00b6 85-94.  \n186. And at least one court has already blocked an \nearlier effort by the Board to transgress the First \nAmendment rights of parents through related \ninstruction. Citizens for a Responsible Curriculum v. \nMontgomery County Public Schools, No. CIV.A.AW-\n05-1194, 2005 WL 1075634, at *11 (D. Md.

Unable to show a contrary tradition of restricting \nparental control over family life and human sexuality \neducation by denying opt-outs, the School Board \ncannot overcome the Parents\u2019 free exercise right. See \nBruen, 142 S.

If a policy is not generally applicable for either of \nthese reasons, that \u201cis sufficient to trigger strict \nscrutiny.\u201d Kennedy, 142 S. Ct. at 2422 (citation \nomitted).  \n196. Here, both general applicability triggers are met \nby the School Board\u2019s refusal to accommodate \nPlaintiffs\u2019 notification and opt-out requests from the \nPride Storybooks.  \n197. This failure burdens the Parents\u2019 freedom to form \ntheir children on a matter of core religious exercise \nand parenting: how to understand who they are.  \n198. It also burdens the Student Plaintiffs\u2019 rights to \nopt out of books that violate their religious beliefs and \npractices.  \n199. The first trigger\u2014not accommodating some opt-\nout requests while permitting conduct that similarly \nundermines the supposed government interest\u2014is \ndemonstrated in multiple ways.  \n200. Maryland law requires parental notification and \nopt-out rights for instruction regarding family life and \nhuman sexuality for any reason, religious or not.  \n201. The School Board has traditionally extended \nparental notification and opt-out rights for instruction \nregarding family life and human sexuality.  \n192a\n\n202. For the 2022-23 school year, the School Board \nprovided parental notification and allowed parental \nopt outs for the new Pride Storybooks.  \n203. This included honoring opt-out requests for the \nPersak children, acknowledging an opt-out for the \nRoman\u2019s son, and giving Tamar and Enas\u2019s son an opt-\nout.  \n204. The School Board has also traditionally allowed \nstudents to opt out of books that violate their religious \nbeliefs and receive a different reading assignment \ninstead.  \n205. But then, on March 23, the School Board \nsuspended all opt-outs without explanation.  \n206. The second trigger for general applicability\u2014a \nmechanism for individualized assessments\u2014is also \nmet by much of the same evidence.  \n207. The School Board has allowed administrators and \nteachers to provide parental notification and opt outs \non a case-by-case basis.  \n208. Indeed, the School Board\u2019s written Guidelines \nprovide that \u201ceach situation\u201d of religious-based \nabsence from school \u201cmust be addressed on a case-by-\ncase basis.\u201d Ex. A at 2.  \n209. The School Board\u2019s decision to reverse itself and \nno longer honor opt-outs from the Pride Storybooks\u2014\nwhen it had already allowed some, and continues to \nallow analogous opt-outs (as they must under \nMaryland law and their own Guidelines)\u2014is not \ngenerally applicable.  \n210. Strict scrutiny therefore applies.  \n193a\n\n211. The School Board cannot meet its burden to prove \nthat forced exposure to the Pride Storybooks pursues \na compelling governmental interest or that it is \nnarrowly tailored to achieve such an interest.  \n212. The School Board cannot \u201crely on broadly \nformulated interests\u201d but must explain \u201cthe asserted \nharm of granting specific exemptions to particular \nreligious claimants.\u201d Fulton, 141 S. Ct. at 1881 \n(cleaned up).  \n213. In other words, the School Board cannot explain \nwhy it must force these Parents to violate their \nreligious freedom to form their children in their own \nreligious traditions. See, e.g., id. (\u201c[S]o long as the \ngovernment can achieve its interests in a manner that \ndoes not burden religion, it must do so.\u201d).  \n214. The School Board cannot show forcing all children \nto read the Pride Storybooks is the only way to teach \ninclusion and civility toward all individuals.  \n215. Plaintiffs have and will continue to suffer the \nirreparable injury of their First Amendment rights \nbeing denied by Defendants.  \n216. The Parents also have or may in the future suffer \nmonetary damages in being forced to pursue other \neducational opportunities for their children because of \nthe Board\u2019s disregard for their constitutional rights.  \n217. To remedy their injuries, Plaintiffs are entitled to \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.  \n218. To the extent this Court finds the Board\u2019s Pride \nStorybooks \npolicy \ngenerally \napplicable, \nthen \nEmployment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990) \nwas wrongly decided.  \n194a\n\nCount III \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \nViolation of the First Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \nFree Exercise Clause \nNeutrality \n219. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding \nparagraphs.  \n220. The Free Exercise Clause requires that \ngovernment policies be \u201cneutral\u201d toward religious \nexercise.  \n221. \u201cA government policy will not qualify as neutral \nif it is specifically directed at religious practice\u201d\u2014\ndetectable if the policy \u201cdiscriminates on its face, or if \na religious exercise is otherwise its object.\u201d Kennedy, \n142 S. Ct. at 2422 (cleaned up).  \n222. \u201cA plaintiff may also prove a free exercise \nviolation by showing that \u2018official expressions of \nhostility\u2019 to religion accompany laws or policies \nburdening religious exercise; in cases like that [the \nSupreme Court] ha[s] \u2018set aside\u2019 such policies without \nfurther inquiry.\u201d Id. at 2422 n.1 (citing Masterpiece \nCakeshop, Ltd. V. Colorado C.R. Comm\u2019n, 138 S. Ct. \n1719, 1732 (2018)).  \n223. \nBut \neven \n\u201c[f]acial \nneutrality \nis \nnot \ndeterminative.\u201d Church of the Lukumi Babalu Aye, \nInc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. 520, 534 (1993).  \n224. The Free Exercise Clause also \u201cforbids subtle \ndepartures from neutrality,\u201d \u201cprotect[ing] against \ngovernmental hostility which is masked, as well as \novert.\u201d Id.  \n195a\n\n225. The School Board\u2019s policy to mandate the Pride \nStorybooks to discourage a biological understanding of \nhuman sexuality is not neutral toward religion, in part \nbecause it assumes that traditional religious views \nregarding family life and sexuality as supported by \nsound science and common sense are hurtful, hateful, \nor bigoted.  \n226. This burdens the Parents\u2019 freedom to form their \nchildren on a matter of core religious exercise and \nparenting: how to understand who they are.  \n227. It also burdens the Student Plaintiff\u2019s freedom to \nreceive an education in an environment free from \nreligious discrimination.  \n228. The School Board\u2019s policy of forced participation \nin the Pride Storybooks is not neutral toward religious \nexercise and expressly encourages teachers to tell \nstudents \nthat \ntheir \nreligious \nand \nscientific \nperspectives are \u201churtful.\u201d  \n229. A principal at one School made this explicit when \nsaying that parents who voiced religious-based \nconcerns over subjecting their children to Pride \nStorybooks are being \u201cmotivat[ed]\u201d by \u201cfear.\u201d \u201cFear is \na powerful motivator,\u201d and the School Board only \nconsidered an opt out from the Pride Storybooks \u201c[t]o \naccommodate these fears.\u201d Ex. K.  \n230. And Defendant Harris was even more explicit \nafter the School Board decided to end opt-outs on the \nPride Storybooks. She said that allowing such opt-outs \nfor religious reasons \u201cis just telling that kid, \u2018Here\u2019s \nanother reason to hate another person.\u2019\u201d  \n \n196a\n\n231. To the contrary, the School Board\u2019s Guidelines \npermit opt-out requests on any subject, classroom \ndiscussion, or activity that violates parents\u2019 or \nstudents\u2019 religious beliefs or practices.  \n232. Maryland also requires opt-outs from instruction \non \u201cfamily life and human sexuality,\u201d which extends to \nissues of sexual orientation, gender identity, and \ngender expression, consent, and personal boundaries.  \n233. It is not neutral to exclude the Pride Storybooks \nfrom \nthese \notherwise \ngeneral \nreligious \naccommodations.  \n234. Moreover, non-neutrality toward religion is also \ndemonstrated by teachers no longer notifying parents \nwhen the Pride Storybooks will be read to their \nchildren.  \n235. The School Board\u2019s Guidelines require that \naffirmative steps be taken by schools to ensure that \n\u201cinstructional activities\u201d are \u201cfair, objective, and [do] \nnot demean any religious or nonreligious beliefs.\u201d \nSupra \u00b6 101.  \n236. Those steps, when guest or student speakers are \ninvolved, can also include \u201cdisclaimers\u201d issued to \nparents and guardians. Supra \u00b6 104.  \n237. Now, however, the Parents will have no way of \nknowing when or how these books are foisted upon \ntheir children\u2014despite their religious objections.  \n238. As with general applicability, the School Board\u2019s \nlack of neutrality toward religious concerns \u201cis \nsufficient to trigger strict scrutiny.\u201d Kennedy, 142 S. \nCt. at 2422 (citation omitted).  \n239. For the foregoing reasons, the School Board \ncannot meet its burden to establish that the Pride \n197a\n\nStorybooks achieve a compelling government interest, \nand that forcing Plaintiffs to violate their religious \nbeliefs toward is narrowly tailored to achieve that \ninterest.  \n240. Plaintiffs have and will continue to suffer the \nirreparable injury of their First Amendment rights \nbeing denied by Defendants.  \n241. The Parents also have or may in the future suffer \nmonetary damages in being forced to pursue other \neducational opportunities for their children because of \nthe School Board\u2019s disregard for their constitutional \nrights.  \n242. To remedy their injuries, Plaintiffs are entitled to \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.  \n243. To the extent this Court finds the Board\u2019s Pride \nStorybooks policy neutral, then Employment Division \nv. Smith, 494 U.S. 872 (1990) was wrongly decided.  \nCount IV \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \nViolation of the First Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \nFree Speech Clause \nViewpoint Discrimination \n244. Parents incorporate by reference all preceding \nparagraphs.  \n245. The School Board\u2019s policy to discourage a \nbiological understanding of human sexuality through \nthe \nPride \nStorybooks \nis \nreligious \nviewpoint \ndiscrimination \nand \nthereby \nviolates \nthe \nFirst \nAmendment\u2019s Free Speech Clause.  \n246. No matter the \u201cforum\u201d in which speech occurs, \nviewpoint \ndiscrimination \nis \nalways \nprohibited. \n198a\n\nRosenberger v. Rector & Visitors of Univ. of Va., 515 \nU.S. 819, 829 (1995).  \n247. Accordingly, schools\u2014like other fora for private \nspeech\u2014cannot exclude speech \u201con the basis of the \nreligious nature of the speech.\u201d Good News Club v. \nMilford Cent. Sch., 533 U.S. 98, 105 (2001); \nRosenberger, 515 U.S. at 831 (\u201cReligion may be a vast \narea of inquiry, but it also provides, as it did here, a \nspecific premise, a perspective, a standpoint from \nwhich a variety of subjects may be discussed and \nconsidered.\u201d).  \n248. Here, however, the School Board\u2019s Pride \nStorybooks are excluding religious perspectives on the \ntopic of gender identity.  \n249. As early as pre-K, children will be introduced to \nwhat it means to be \u201ccisgender,\u201d \u201cgender binary,\u201d \n\u201ctransgender,\u201d \u201cpansexual,\u201d and \u201cqueer.\u201d Ex. D.  \n250. First-graders will read a book discussing being \n\u201cnon-binary\u201d and \u201cwhat pronouns fit you best.\u201d Id.  \n251. In second grade, the Pride Storybooks will make \nchildren \nrecognize \n\u201cbiased \nspeech\u201d \nand \n\u201cdiscrimination.\u201d Id. Later in fifth grade, children will \nread about a mother committing to sharing with loved \nones that her boy \u201cis\u201d a girl. Id.  \n252. The Pride Storybooks promote a single viewpoint \non what it means to be \u201caffirming\u201d on matters of and \nhuman sexuality. Different viewpoints on what \n\u201caffirming\u201d means in this context are either not \nprovided or outright discouraged.  \n253. Moreover, and despite the School Board\u2019s \nGuidelines on religious diversity, its \u201cresource guide\u201d \n199a\n\non the Pride Storybooks prohibits divergent religious \nperspectives too.  \n254. For example, the resource guide suggests \nteachers tell students who question the premise of \ngender identity that the \u201ccomment is hurtful; we \nshouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk about peoples\u2019 \nidentities.\u201d Id. at 5.  \n255. Were other students to state what their parents \ntaught them\u2014that gender is not \u201cassigned\u201d at birth \nbut an observation of biological reality\u2014the teacher is \nsuggested to tell the student that \u201c[w]hen we are born, \npeople make a guess about our gender and label us \n\u2018boy\u2019 or \u2018girl\u2019 based on our body parts. Sometimes \nthey\u2019re right, and sometimes they\u2019re wrong.\u201d Id.  \n256. Similarly, were a student to question why \nsubjective feelings override objective biological reality, \nteachers are suggested to say that \u201c[o]ur gender comes \nfrom inside \u2013 we might feel different than what people \ntell us we are. We know ourselves best.\u201d Id.  \n257. Far from guaranteeing a fair and objective \ndiscussion of religious perspectives, the School Board\u2019s \nPride Storybooks and corresponding \u201cresource guide\u201d  \npreclude religious viewpoints on the topics of sexual \norientation and gender identity\u2014because of their \nviewpoint. That is unconstitutional.  \n258. As a \u201cfinding of viewpoint bias end[s] the matter,\u201d \nthere is no subsequent analysis of strict scrutiny. \nIancu v. Brunetti, 139 S. Ct. 2294, 2302 (2019) (\u201cOnce \nwe have found that a law aims at the suppression of \nviews, why would it matter that Congress could have \ncaptured some of the same speech through a \nviewpoint-neutral statute.\u201d) (cleaned up).  \n200a\n\n259. Plaintiffs have and will continue to suffer the \nirreparable injury of their First Amendment rights \nbecause \nof \nthe \nSchool \nBoard\u2019s \nviewpoint \ndiscrimination.  \n260. The Parents also have or may in the future suffer \nmonetary damages in being forced to pursue other \neducational opportunities for their children because of \nthe Board\u2019s disregard for their constitutional rights.  \n261. To remedy their injuries, Plaintiffs are entitled to \ndeclaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.  \nCount V \n42 U.S.C. \u00a7 1983 \nViolation of the Fourteenth Amendment  \nto the U.S. Constitution \nSubstantive Due Process \nParental Right to Direct Children\u2019s  \nEducation and Upbringing \n262. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding \nparagraphs.  \n263. \u201c[T]he child is not the mere creature of the State; \nthose who nurture him and direct his destiny have the \nright, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and \nprepare him for additional obligations.\u201d Troxel v. \nGranville, 530 U.S. 57, 65 (2000) (quoting Pierce v. \nSoc\u2019y of Sisters, 268 U.S. 510, 535 (1925)).  \n264. That right\u2014that high duty\u2014is not only deeply \nembedded in \u201c[t]he history and culture of Western \ncivilization,\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 232; it also has \u201ca \nconstitutional dimension,\u201d Troxel, 530 U.S. at 65.  \n265. A century of Supreme Court decisions establish \nthat \u201cit cannot now be doubted that the Due Process \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment protects the \n201a\n\nfundamental right of parents to make decisions \nconcerning the care, custody, and control of their \nchildren.\u201d Id. at 66.  \n266. Simply put, the \u201c\u2018liberty\u2019 specially protected by \nthe Due Process Clause includes the right[] \u2026 to direct \nthe education and upbringing of one\u2019s children.\u201d \nWashington v. Glucksberg, 521 U.S. 702, 720 (1997).  \n267. The School Board\u2019s policies regarding the Pride \nStorybooks violate the Parents\u2019 fundamental right to \nmake key decisions regarding the upbringing, \neducation, custody, care, and control of their children, \nincluding the right to opt their children out of \ninstruction on family life and human sexuality that \nviolates their religious beliefs and practices.  \n268. There is no compelling state interest in forcing \nelementary school children to participate in the Pride \nStorybooks that outweighs the Parents\u2019 constitutional \nright to direct the education, upbringing, care, \ncustody, and control of their children.  \n269. The Parents have and will continue to suffer \nirreparable injury to their constitutional rights \nbecause of Defendants\u2019 actions.  \n270. The Parents also have or may in the future suffer \nmonetary damages in being forced to pursue other \neducational opportunities for their children because of \nthe Board\u2019s disregard for their constitutional rights.  \n271. At bottom, the School Board\u2019s actions violate the \n\u201ccardinal\u201d principle \u201cthat the custody, care and \nnurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose \nprimary function and freedom include preparation for \nobligations the state can neither supply nor hinder.\u201d \n202a\n\nTroxel, 268 U.S. at 65-66 (emphases added) (quoting \nPrince v. Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158, 166 (1944)).  \n272. Eyes wide open, the School Board has disavowed \nwhat \u201c[p]ublic schools must not forget\u201d: \u201cthat \u2018in loco \nparentis\u2019 does not mean \u2018displace parents.\u2019\u201d Gruenke v. \nSeip, 225 F.3d 290, 307 (3d Cir. 2000).  \n273. The Parents have and will continue to suffer the \nirreparable injury of their Fourteenth Amendment \nrights being denied by Defendants.  \n274. The Parents also have or may in the future suffer \nmonetary damages in being forced to pursue other \neducational opportunities for their children because of \nthe Board\u2019s disregard for their constitutional rights.  \n275. To remedy their injuries, the Parents are entitled \nto declaratory, injunctive, and monetary relief.  \nCount VI \nViolation of Maryland State Law \n276. Plaintiffs incorporate by reference all preceding \nparagraphs.  \n277. Article 24 of the Declaration of Rights of the \nMaryland Constitution provides, \u201cThat no man ought \nto be \u2026 disseized of his \u2026 liberties or privileges \u2026 or, \nin any manner, destroyed, or deprived of his life, \nliberty or property, but by the judgment of his peers, \nor by the Law of the land.\u201d Md. Const. Declaration of \nRights Art. \u00a7 24.  \n278. Article 5(a)(1) of the Declaration of Rights of the \nMaryland Constitution also provides, that \u201cthe \nInhabitants of Maryland are entitled to the Common \nLaw of England \u2026 and to the benefit of such of the \nEnglish statutes as existed on the Fourth day of July, \nseventeen hundred and seventy-six \u2026 subject, \n203a\n\nnevertheless, to the revision of, and amendment or \nrepeal by, the Legislature of this State.\u201d Md. Const. \nDeclaration of Rights Art. \u00a7 5(a)(1).  \n279. These provisions in Maryland\u2019s Constitution \nprotect parents\u2019 fundamental rights to direct the care, \ncustody, education, welfare, safety, and control of their \nminor children.  \n280. The State of Maryland by regulation has given \nexplicit protection for these rights in the context of \npublic school instruction regarding \u201cfamily life and \nhuman sexuality.\u201d  \n281. State regulations require a local school system \nlike \nMCPS \nto \n\u201cprovide \nan \nopportunity \nfor \nparents/guardians to view instructional materials to \nbe used in the teaching of family life and human \nsexuality \nobjectives.\u201d \nCOMAR \n13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(iv)  \n282. They further provide that the local school system \n\u201cshall establish policies, guidelines, and/or procedures \nfor student opt-out regarding instruction related to \nfamily life and human sexuality objectives.\u201d Id. at \n18.01(D)(2)(e)(i).  \n283. The School Board\u2019s own policies reinforce these \nrights to notice and opportunity to opt out, committing \n\u201cto accommodate requests from students, or requests \nfrom parents/guardians on behalf of their students, to \nbe excused from specific classroom discussions or \nactivities that they believe would impose a substantial \nburden on their religious beliefs\u201d. Ex. A at 3.  \n284. The School Board\u2019s policy of withholding notice \nand opt-outs violates Maryland\u2019s Constitution, state \nlaw, and the School Board\u2019s own regulations.  \n204a\n\n285. Plaintiffs have and will continue to suffer the \nirreparable injury of their state rights being denied by \nDefendants.  \n286.

As a community, we have \nadjusted to changing guidelines for in-school and out-\nof-school operations, necessitated by the ongoing \npandemic, to keep all of us safe. As a community, it \nhas become more important than ever before to \ncollaborate and partner in every aspect of the work \nthat must be done to ensure a high-quality education \nfor all students. \nWe must continue to embrace the vibrant diversity of \nour Montgomery County community and ensure that \nall individuals, no matter their race, ethnicity, or \nreligious identification, feel welcomed and valued in \nour school system. This is foundational so that \neveryone can successfully participate, teach, and learn \nat high levels, in a welcoming environment. \nThis commitment is codified in Montgomery County \nBoard of Education Policy ACA, Nondiscrimination, \nEquity, and Cultural Proficiency, and it is needed \nmore than ever, given the rise in hate, bias, and racism \n210a\n\nagainst minoritized communities. Part of that \ncommitment is making sure our students have the \nright to express their religious and nonreligious beliefs \nand practices, free from discrimination, bullying, and \nharassment. As a school district, we are committed to \nmaking feasible and reasonable accommodations for \nthose beliefs and practices, as we strive to create safe, \npositive, and respectful learning environments for all \nof our students. \nIn partnership, \n/s/ Monifa B. McKnight \nMonifa B. McKnight \n* \n* \n* \nINTRODUCTION \nRespecting Religious Diversity in Montgomery \nCounty Public Schools \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) is \ncommitted \nto \nproviding \nall \nstudents \nwith \nopportunities to succeed and thrive. Part of that \ncommitment is making sure our students have the \nright to express their religious or nonreligious beliefs \nand practices, free from discrimination, bullying, or \nharassment. \nOur nation and the state of Maryland have a deep and \nlong-standing commitment both to the protection of \nreligious liberty and to the separation of church and \nstate. The First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution \nstates: \u201cCongress shall make no law respecting an \nestablishment of religion, or prohibiting the free \nexercise thereof\u2026\u201d This means that the government \nmay not promote one religion over another, prefer \n211a\n\nreligion over nonreligion, or express hostility or \nopposition to religion.  \nThe U.S. Supreme Court has emphasized the \nimportance of neutrality toward religion by public \nschools. Schools must protect the religious liberty \nrights \nof \nall \nstudents, \nwhile \nrejecting \npublic \nendorsement of religion. Schools may neither inculcate \nnor inhibit religion, and students have a right to an \nacademic environment where religious beliefs are not \nadvocated in courses or in school-sponsored activities, \nsuch as commencements or assemblies. Equally \nimportant, students have the right to their religious or \nnonreligious \nbeliefs \nand \npractices, \nfree \nfrom \ndiscrimination, bullying, or harassment, and MCPS is \ncommitted to making feasible and \nreasonable \naccommodations for those beliefs and practices. \nThese guidelines are intended to provide a quick \nreference regarding several Montgomery County \nBoard of Education policies and MCPS regulations, as \nwell as state and federal laws, which guide the district \non these topics. These guidelines put all of this \ninformation together in one place and answer \nfrequently asked questions about religious guidelines \nfor students, while in school and during school-\nsponsored activities, so that the expectations are clear \nto our staff, our students, our families, and our \ncommunity. Please note that these legal requirements \nare subject to change between editions of this \npublication, \nand \nany \nchanges \nsupersede \nthe \nstatements \nand \nreferences \ncontained \nin \nthis \npublication. \nMCPS created these guidelines in collaboration with \nthe \nMontgomery \nCounty \nExecutive\u2019s \nFaith \nCommunity Working Group and other stakeholders. \n212a\n\nThis partnership and collaboration seek to promote \nrespect and appreciation for the religions, beliefs, and \ncustoms of our diverse student population. They foster \na culture where all families feel respected and deepen \nour commitment to our core values of Learning, \nRelationships, Respect, Excellence, and Equity. MCPS \nbelieves that diversity is one of our greatest strengths \nand should enrich our community as we learn together \nin our schools. \nWe hope you find these guidelines helpful. If you have \nquestions about anything in this handbook, please \nfirst talk with your school administrators. If you have \nfurther questions, contact the MCPS Office of the \nChief of Districtwide Services and Supports, Student \nWelfare \nand \nCompliance, \nat \n240-740-3215, \nor \nSWC@mcpsmd.org. If your questions cannot be \nanswered by MCPS staff, you also may contact the \nBoard of Education chief of staff or the Board \nombudsman at 240-740-3030, or boe@mcpsmd.org. \nFrequently Asked Questions \nAre students\u2019 absences excused for observances \nof religious holidays? \nYES. Families must follow all of the regular \nprocedures to report and document absences. Please \nsee the Absences for Religious Holidays section of \nthese guidelines for further information (page 2). \nCan students make up work due to absences for \nreligious holidays? \nYES. Families should work with their child\u2019s school to \narrange for making up work. Please see the Absences \n213a\n\nfor Religious Holidays section of these guidelines for \nmore detailed information (page 2). \nCan students pray during the school day? \nYES, under certain circumstances. Please see the \nPrayer and Religious Dress section of these guidelines \nfor more specific information (page 3). \nCan students wear clothing associated with \ntheir religion? \nYES. Students may wear scarves, hijabs, yarmulkes, \npatkas, kufis, or other clothing associated with their \nreligion in accordance with Board policies and MCPS \nregulations. Please see the Prayer and Religious Dress \nsection \nof \nthese \nguidelines \nfor \nmore \nspecific \ninformation (page 3). \nCan religious topics be discussed in school \nassignments? \nYES. Students may express their religious beliefs or \nnonbelief in school assignments as long as their \nexpressions meet the assignment\u2019s requirements, are \nrelevant to the topic, and follow the other guidelines \ndiscussed in this handbook. In addition, objective and \nfactual lessons about religion in literature, history, \nand the arts may be part of the MCPS curriculum. \nPlease see the Religion in the Instructional Program \nsection of these guidelines for further information \n(page 3). \nDo schools accommodate students\u2019 religion \nrelated dietary restrictions? \nYES. Schools regularly work with students who may \nhave religion-related dietary restrictions. Please see \nthe Food and Religious Observance section of these \nguidelines for more information (page 5). \n214a\n\nCan students distribute religious informational \nmaterials? \nYES. Students may distribute religious materials on \nthe same terms as they are permitted to distribute \nother informational material unrelated to school \nactivities. Students must follow school rules about \nwhere, when, and how materials are distributed. \nPlease see the Distributing Religious Informational \nMaterials section of these guidelines for more \ninformation (page 5). \nAre religious extracurricular clubs allowed in \nschools? \nYES. Students have a right to organize religion-\nrelated extracurricular clubs or assemble and conduct \nreligious \nmeetings, \nprayer \ngroups, \nor \nother \nobservances \nof \nreligious \npractices \nduring \nnoninstructional time, on the same basis as other \nextracurricular student groups that are not related \ndirectly to a subject taught in school. These religion-\nrelated extracurricular meetings or clubs must be \nstudent led. For more information and specific \nguidance, please see the Extracurricular Student \nReligious Activities section of these guidelines (page \n6). \nAbsences for Religious Holidays \nAttendance and Absences for Observance of \nReligious Holidays \nDaily attendance at school is crucial to student \nachievement. Nevertheless, MCPS understands that \nstudents may occasionally miss school for a variety of \nreasons, including the observance of religious \n215a\n\nholidays. These are excused absences, and students \nwill be allowed to make up missed assignments. If \nstudents miss school, they should bring a note from a \nparent/ guardian providing a written explanation \nwithin three school days of returning to school. \nMCPS will accommodate reasonable requests for late \narrivals or early dismissals related to the observance \nof a religious holiday, but they must be authorized by \na parent/guardian. \nAlthough participation in any athletic event or \npractice generally requires athletes to attend all of \ntheir scheduled classes on the day of the event or \npractice, students who have prescheduled activities, \nsuch as the observance of a religious holiday, will be \npermitted to participate in athletic events or practices \non the day of the absence, provided they receive \nadvance approval from their school. \nBecause free exercise of religion is a constitutional \nright, MCPS schools that have perfect attendance \nawards may not withhold these awards from students \nwhose only absences have been excused for the \nobservance of religious holidays. \nReferences: \nMCPS Regulation JEA-RA, Student Attendance. \nMaking Up Work After an Absence for Observing \nReligious Holidays \nStudents have a responsibility and generally are \nexpected to make up work they miss while absent from \nschool. It is best for students and their parents/ \nguardians to plan ahead to arrange extensions or other \naccommodations for work that students will miss \nwhen they are absent to observe a religious holiday. \n216a\n\nHowever, MCPS realizes that it is not always realistic \nor possible to do so. If the absence is excused, the \nstudent\u2019s teacher will help the student make up work, \noffer a retest, or grant an extension on classwork or \nhomework that was due during the student\u2019s \nobservance of a religious holiday. While each situation \nmust be addressed on a case-by-case basis, students \ntypically will be eligible for an extension of up to three \nschool days to make up work after an excused absence \nfor observance of a religious holiday. \nIn addition, when assigning homework, schools should \nbe mindful of cultural, ethnic, religious, and other \ncelebrations or events that are important to members \nof our community. Montgomery County has developed \na listing of Days of Commemoration, including certain \nholidays relating to the religious, ethnic, and cultural \nheritage \nof \ncounty \nresidents, \navailable \nat \nwww.montgomerycountymd.gov/ \nmcg/commemorations.html. \nThe Equity Initiatives Unit has a document that \nprovides staff with background information about the \nmany commemorations/holidays, which staff and \nother members of the MCPS community may find \nhelpful as well. The calendar on the MCPS website \nwill display the Days of Commemoration as a \nreference for staff, students, parents/guardians, and \ncommunity members, in addition to MCPS school \nclosure information. The calendar is available at \nwww.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/info/calendars/. \n217a\n\nPrayer and Religious Dress \nPrayer at School \nStudents are free to pray and discuss their religious \nviews with other students, as long as these activities \nare voluntary, student initiated, and do not materially \ndisrupt or infringe on classroom instruction, other \nschool activities, or the rights of others. For example, \na student may say a prayer or read religious texts \nbefore a meal or before a test in informal settings, such \nas cafeterias or hallways, to the same extent that \nstudents are permitted to engage in nonreligious \nactivities; or a student athlete may pray before a \ncompetition or after scoring a touchdown or a goal as \nlong as it does not unreasonably delay or disrupt the \ncompetition or interfere with the rights of other \nathletes or spectators. While students may exercise \ntheir right to pray during the school day or at school-\nrelated activities, they may not compel, harass, or \npressure others at school to participate in or listen to \na prayer, sermon, or other religious activity. For \ninstance, student-led prayers broadcast to all classes \nover the school\u2019s public announcement system would \nnot be permissable. \nIf a student requests a quiet place to pray, schools will \nmake a reasonable effort to accommodate the request, \nprovided that space is available, there is appropriate \nstaff monitoring to ensure student safety, and the \neducational process is not disrupted. This could mean \na quiet space in the media center, an empty classroom, \nor other room. \nStudents and their parents/guardians should expect \nthat MCPS teachers, administrators, and other staff \nwill not organize, lead, initiate, endorse, or actively \n218a\n\nparticipate in student prayers or other student \nreligious activities during school hours or at school-\nsponsored events. MCPS staff may be present during \nstudent prayers or other student-led religious \nactivities only for purposes of monitoring and \nproviding oversight to ensure student and school \nsafety. \nReligious Dress \nStudents may not be disciplined for their style of dress \nunless it\u2014 \n\u2022 causes a disruption to the educational environment; \n\u2022 endangers or potentially threatens the health and/or \nsafety of self or others; \n\u2022 fails to meet a reasonable requirement of a course or \nactivity; \n\u2022 is associated with gangs; \n\u2022 is lewd, vulgar, obscene, or revealing or of a sexual \nnature; or \n\u2022 promotes tobacco, alcohol, drugs, or sexual activity. \nAs long as their style of dress is consistent with these \nguidelines, students should be permitted to wear \nscarves, hijabs, yarmulkes, patkas, or other clothing \nor jewelry associated with their religion or containing \na religious message. \nWhen possible, schools should provide reasonable \naccommodations to students if they (or their parents/ \nguardians on their behalf) request permission to wear \nor not wear certain clothing during physical education \nclass or school-sponsored activities that they perceive \nas immodest, based on religious beliefs. Such \naccommodations \ndo \nnot \npreclude \na \nstudent\u2019s \n219a\n\nparticipation in an activity. For example, the \nMaryland \nPublic \nSecondary \nSchools \nAthletics \nAssociation \nallows \nathletes \nparticipating \nin \ninterscholastic competitions to \u201cwear a head covering, \nwrap, or other required religious garment which is not \nabrasive, hard, or dangerous to any player/others, and \nis attached in such a way that it is unlikely to come off \nduring play.\u201d For other questions regarding athletic \naccommodations, please consult your school athletic \ndirector or the MCPS Athletics Unit. \nReligion in the Instructional Program \nReligion in School Assignments \nStudents are free to express religious beliefs or \nnonbelief in school assignments as long as their \nexpressions are relevant to the topic and meet the \nrequirements of the assignment. In the evaluation of \nschool assignments, teachers will not discriminate \nbased \non \nthe \nreligious \ncontent \nof \nstudents\u2019 \nsubmissions. Schoolwork will be judged by ordinary \nacademic standards and other legitimate educational \ninterests. For example, if an assignment involves \nwriting a poem, the work of a student who submits a \npoem in the form of a prayer (such as a psalm or a \npiyyut) will be evaluated based on academic standards \n(such as literary quality) and neither penalized nor \nrewarded based on the poem\u2019s religious content. \nRequests to be Excused from Instructional \nPrograms for Religious Reasons \nWhen possible, schools should try to make reasonable \nand feasible adjustments to the instructional program \nto accommodate requests from students, or requests \nfrom parents/guardians on behalf of their students, to \n220a\n\nbe excused from specific classroom discussions or \nactivities that they believe would impose a substantial \nburden on their religious beliefs. Students, or their \nparents/guardians on behalf of their students, also \nhave the right to ask to be excused from the classroom \nactivity if the students, or their parents/guardians, \nbelieve the activity would invade student privacy by \ncalling attention to the student\u2019s religion. When a \nstudent is excused from the classroom activity, the \nstudent will be provided with an alternative to the \nschool activity or assignment. \nApplying these principles, it may be feasible to \naccommodate objections from students or their \nparents/guardians to a particular reading assignment \non religious grounds by providing an alternative \nselection that meets the same lesson objectives. \nHowever, if such requests become too frequent or too \nburdensome, the school may refuse to accommodate \nthe requests. Schools are not required to alter \nfundamentally the educational program or create a \nseparate educational program or a separate course to \naccommodate a student\u2019s religious practice or belief. \nFor example, schools are not required to excuse \nstudents from all music instruction based on a \nreligious concern, because music is an integral part of \nMaryland\u2019s arts curriculum; however, schools may \nseek to avoid, if possible, requiring a student with a \nreligious objection to play an instrument or sing. \nTeaching About Religion or Religious Holidays \nin Schools \nMCPS believes that schools should develop a climate \nin which children can learn and appreciate cultures \nand heritages different from their own. To this end, \nthe MCPS curriculum recognizes the role of religions \n221a\n\nin literature, history, the humanities, and the arts. \nIndeed, it would be difficult to teach about these \nsubjects without considering religious influences. The \nMCPS curriculum also builds students\u2019 understanding \nof the relationship between government and religious \nfreedom as a preparation for full citizenship in a \nmulticultural society. Students may attend elective \nclasses, when available, on the history or comparative \nstudy of religions in which aspects of religion are \ndiscussed. \nWhen students are taught about religion, they should \nexpect instructional activities to be fair, objective, and \nnot demean any religious or nonreligious beliefs. \nRespecting students\u2019 differing beliefs is an essential \nelement \nof \na \npluralistic \nsociety. \nClassroom \npresentations by teachers, students, and guest \nspeakers should not proselytize or advocate particular \nreligious viewpoints as superior to other religious or \nnonreligious viewpoints. Students may or may not \nchoose to share their ideas about religious traditions. \nStudents should expect that they will not be asked to \nbe spokespersons or representatives for their religious \ntraditions. Singling out students in this way may \nmake them feel uncomfortable, and one student\u2019s \nreligious experience should never be generalized to an \nentire group.  \nAs a teaching aid or resource, schools may use \nreligious symbols in the classroom as examples of \nreligious or cultural heritage. But these teaching aids \nor resources may be displayed only on a short-term \nbasis to accompany appropriate classroom instruction.  \nAs part of the educational program, schools may teach \nabout religious holidays in a factual manner. School \nactivities may feature the secular aspects of a holiday, \n222a\n\nbut holiday activities may not involve participation in \na religious practice or event. Students of various \nfaiths, or their parents/guardians, may ask for \nstudents to be excused from certain holiday activities. \nTeachers should work to honor these requests by \nplanning an alternate activity for students who \nrequest one. Even birthdays or other occasions that \nmany may consider to be secular, such as Halloween \nand Valentine\u2019s Day, may be viewed by others as \nhaving religious overtones. Schools are permitted to \nhave activities around these events\u2014as long as they \nare secular in nature\u2014and may excuse students who \ndo not want to participate. \nReligion in School Assemblies and Concerts \nSpecial school events, assemblies, concerts, and \nprograms must be designed to further a secular and \nobjective program of education and must not focus on \nany one religion or religious observance. For instance, \nreligious music may be performed at a winter concert \nas long as the total effect of the program is \nnonreligious, and secular music is also included as \npart of a balanced and inclusive approach. \nWhen assemblies or programs include student bands \nor other musical groups, participating students may \nrequest reasonable and feasible accommodations if \nthey \nfeel \nthat \nperforming \nreligious \nmusic \nis \ninappropriate to their beliefs. In handling requests for \naccommodations, school staff should consult with the \nstudents and their parents/guardians and take care to \navoid embarrassment to, or coercion of, students.  \nStudent or guest speakers at assemblies should be \nselected based on neutral and even-handed criteria \nthat neither favor nor disfavor religion. Schools should \n223a\n\nmake appropriate, neutral disclaimers to avoid \nconveying the perception to other students, their \nparents/guardians, or guests that the school endorses \nthe student\u2019s or guest speaker\u2019s viewpoints (whether \nreligious or not). In addition, parents/guardians \nshould expect that age will be a factor in schools\u2019 \nprogramming for assemblies and other school events \ninvolving religion-related topics or holidays. While \nhigh school students may understand that a school \ndoes not endorse the viewpoints of students or guests \nwho are selected on an even-handed basis to speak, \nmiddle and elementary students are less likely to \nmake this distinction, even if school staff provide \nappropriate disclaimers. \nFood and Religious Observance \nReligion-related \nDietary \nRestrictions \nand \nFasting \nStudents, or their parents/guardians, may request \nschools \nto \nmake \nreasonable \nand \nfeasible \naccommodations for a student\u2019s dietary needs, \nincluding religion-related dietary restrictions and \nfasting. The MCPS Division of Food and Nutrition \nServices helps students who have certain dietary \nrestrictions by labeling foods and/or offering a variety \nof choices for breakfast, lunch, and snacks, such as \npork-free options; but schools are not required to \nprepare special foods solely to fulfill a student\u2019s \nparticular \nreligious \nrequirements. \nFor \nmore \ninformation, visit www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/ \ndepartments/ food-and-nutrition/. \nSimilarly, students who are fasting for religious \nreasons may be permitted to go to the media center or \n224a\n\nanother separate area, rather than the cafe teria, \nduring lunchtime, provided there is appropriate staff \nsupervision. In addition, students who are fasting for \nreligious reasons and ask to be excused from strenuous \nactivities during physical education class should be \nprovided \nreasonable \naccommodations. \nStudents \nshould bring to school a note from a parent/guardian \nproviding a written explanation identifying the \nrequested fasting related accommodation. \nDistributing Religious Informational Materials \nStudent Requests to Distribute Religion related \nInformational Materials \nStudents \nmay \ndistribute \nreligion-related \ninformational materials to their school mates on the \nsame terms as they are permitted to distribute other \ninformational material that is unrelated to school \ncurriculum or activities. This means that schools can \nspecify at what time the distribution may occur, where \nit may occur, and how it may occur, as long as these \ntime, place, and manner restrictions are applied \nconsistently to all non-school-related informational \nmaterials. \nThese \ntime, \nplace, \nand \nmanner-of-distribution \nrequirements are reflected in MCPS regulations and \nrules \nthat \nstudents\u2019 \ndistribution \nof \nreligious \ninformational materials, like political materials or any \nother \nnon-school-related \ninformational \nmaterial, \nshould occur only outside of class time and in a \nnondisruptive manner. For example, schools may \npermit students to distribute informational materials \non sidewalks and in the cafeteria, designated \nhallways, or student government rooms or areas. \n225a\n\nHowever, students may not distribute non-school-\nrelated informational materials in classrooms, the \nmedia center, or other school rooms during the school \nday, except (a) when the room is being used as a \nvoluntary meeting place or (b) when the informational \nmaterial is being used in a class as part of the regular \nteaching program or a voluntary forum or seminar \nheld by students. In addition, students may not \ndistribute informational materials, whether religious \nor otherwise, that are obscene, defamatory, disruptive \nof the educational environment, or invade the rights of \nothers in the school setting.  \nReferences: \nMCPS Regulation JFA-RA, Student Rights and \nResponsibilities  \nMCPS Regulation CNA-RA, Display and Distribution \nof Informational Materials and Announcements. \nMCPS Regulation KEA-RA, Participation in Political \nCampaigns and Distribution of Campaign Materials \nExtracurricular Student Religious Activities \nReligion-related Extracurricular Activities and \nClubs \nStudents have a right to organize religion-related \nextracurricular clubs or assemble and conduct \nreligious \nmeetings, \nprayer \ngroups, \nor \nother \nobservances \nof \nreligious \npractices \nduring \nnoninstructional \ntime. \nThese \nreligion-related \nextracurricular meetings or clubs must be student led. \nMCPS staff provide appropriate monitoring and \noversight to ensure student and school safety, but they \nmust not organize, lead, initiate, endorse, or actively \n226a\n\nparticipate in prayers or any other religious activities \nundertaken in these extracurricular meetings or clubs. \nStudents should inform the MCPS administration \nabout any student-led, religious extracurricular club \nor activity, and they should talk with school \nadministrators in advance to find an adequate space \nwithin the school for these activities. Student religious \ngroups may have access to school facilities, equipment, \nand \nservices \non \nthe \nsame \nbasis \nas \nother \nextracurricular student groups that are not related \ndirectly to a subject that is taught in school. This could \ninclude access to bulletin boards, computers, and \nnotices in the school newspaper, if such access is made \navailable to other extracurricular student groups that \nare not related directly to a subject that is taught in \nschool. These religion-related extracurricular groups \nalso may be listed in the section of the school yearbook \ndesignated for extracurricular student groups that are \nnot related directly to a subject that is taught in \nschool.  \nReligion-related extracurricular student groups may \ninvite outside adults or religious leaders to attend \ntheir meetings on an occasional basis. However, \nindividuals who are not students at the school may not \nregularly attend or direct, conduct, control, or lead \nprayers or other religious activities in student-led \nextracurricular groups. \nStudent-led groups, whether religious or nonreligious, \nwill not be permitted to meet in MCPS schools if they \nadvocate violence or hate, engage in illegal activity, \ncause substantial disruption of the school, violate \nMCPS nondiscrimination policies, or invade the rights \nof others in the school setting. However, schools may \nnot ban students from forming groups solely because \n227a\n\nthey involve discussion of controversial and complex \nsocial and legal issues.  \nStudents may participate in before- or after-school \nevents with religious content on the same terms as \nthey may participate in other non-curriculum-related \nactivities on school premises. \nMCPS Use of Facilities Owned by Religious \nOrganizations \nStudents and their parents/guardians should expect \nthat schools will not use space in facilities owned or \noperated by religious organizations for school-related \nactivities or functions when a nonreligious alternative \nvenue is viable and reasonably suitable for the activity \nor function. Schools will not select or reject the use of \nany private religious facility based on any facet of \nreligious teachings with which any such facility is \nassociated; instead, religion-neutral criteria will be \nemployed to select these facilities, such as proximity \nto MCPS, suitability of the facility for the intended \nuse, health and safety, comparative expense, and \naccessibility. \nIf a school-related activity or function is held in a \nfacility owned or operated by a religious organization, \nstudents and their parents/guardians should expect \nthat the school will clearly identify a secular purpose \nfor using the facility and ensure, to the greatest extent \npossible, that religious symbols, messages, or artifacts \nare not displayed in the specific rooms utilized for the \nschool-related \nactivities \nduring \ntheir \nuse. \nAdditionally, all reasonable steps will be taken to \navoid or minimize exposure to conspicuous religious \nsymbols, messages, or artifacts in areas where \n228a\n\nparticipants in the schoolrelated activity or function \npass through. \nPartnerships \nBetween \nSchools \nand \nFaith \nCommunities \nMCPS works to maintain and develop partnerships \nwith the faith community, just as it does with \nbusinesses and other community and civic groups. \nStudents and schools gain a great deal when every \npart of a community comes together to support \neducation. \nAny faith community partnership program must have \na purely secular purpose and neither promote religion \nnor preclude it. Students will not be selected to \nparticipate based on membership in any religious \ngroup, or on acceptance or rejection of any religious \nbelief, or on participation in, or refusal to participate \nin, any religious activity. \nVolunteers from faith communities must recognize \nthat the purpose of any partnership is educational and \nsecular in nature, not religious, and that volunteers \nmust respect the First Amendment rights of students. \nNo volunteers or other participants in any faith \ncommunity partnership program may proselytize \nabout their faith to students or engage in any religious \nworship activity while conducting or participating in a \nschool-sponsored activity. Volunteers and other \nparticipants in faith community partnership programs \nmust follow the same MCPS rules for distribution of \ninformational materials as apply to other community \norganizations. \n229a\n\nFostering a Culture of Respect for All \nThese guidelines have been developed to assist in \nfostering a culture of respect among everyone in the \nMCPS community. With great diversity in our \ncommunity, there is much that we can learn from each \nother when there is a culture of respect, openness, and \ntolerance. Our schools work to create supportive and \naccepting \nlearning \nenvironments, \nand \nparents/ \nguardians are encouraged to work closely with \nteachers and administrators to understand their \nfamilies\u2019 needs as they pertain to their religious beliefs \nand practices.  \nAs part of our efforts to create positive and respectful \nschools, students have a right to a safe learning \nenvironment, free from bullying, harassment, and \nintimidation of any sort, including intimidation based \non the student\u2019s actual or perceived personal \ncharacteristics, including religion. Further, the Board \nprohibits the use of language and/or the display of \nimages and symbols that promote hate and can be \nreasonably expected to cause substantial disruption to \nschool or district operations or activities. Students \nwho are bullied, students who bully, and students who \nare bystanders to bullying are at risk of a range of \nnegative health, safety, and educational outcomes. \nMCPS has implemented a systemwide approach \ndesigned \nto \nprevent \nbullying, \nharassment, \nor \nintimidation and effectively intervene when it occurs, \nas well as to deter reprisal and retaliation against \nindividuals who report acts of bullying, harassment, or \nintimidation. To report any such actions, students or \ntheir parents/ guardians should work with school \nadministrators to resolve any issues and complete \n230a\n\nMCPS Form 230-35, Bullying, Harassment, or \nIntimidation Reporting Form, available via an online \nreporting form (preferred) and a paper reporting form. \nwww.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/forms\n/detail.aspx?formNumber=230-35&catID=1& \nsubCatId=44 In alignment with Board Policy COA, \nStudent Wellbeing and School Safety, MCPS has \nestablished \nand \nmaintains \na \nbehavior \nthreat \nassessment process, based on an appraisal of \nbehaviors that provides appropriate preventive or \ncorrective measures to maintain safe and secure \nschool environments and workplaces.  \nAll children deserve a safe and nurturing school \nenvironment that supports their physical, social, and \npsychological well-being. Such safe and nurturing \nenvironments \nare \nessential \nprerequisites \nfor \npromoting all students\u2019 opportunity to learn. In \nalignment with Board Policy ACA, Nondiscrimination, \nEquity, and Cultural Proficiency, school safety \nmeasures should not reinforce biases against, or rely \non the profiling of, students based on their actual or \nperceived personal characteristics. Staff responsible \nfor \nimplementing \nbehavior \nthreat \nassessment \nprocedures at the school level are trained to \nunderstand implicit bias and promote diversity \nawareness. \nReferences:  \nBoard Policy ACA, Nondiscrimination, Equity, and \nCultural Proficiency  \nBoard Policy COA, Student Well-being and School \nSafety  \nBoard \nPolicy \nJHF, \nBullying, \nHarassment, \nor \nIntimidation  \n231a\n\nMCPS \nRegulation \nCOA-RA, \nBehavior \nThreat \nAssessment.  \nMCPS \nRegulation \nJHF-RA, \nStudent \nBullying, \nHarassment, or Intimidation. \nMCPS NONDISCRIMINATION STATEMENT \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS) prohibits \nillegal discrimination based on race, ethnicity, color, \nancestry, \nnational \norigin, \nnationality, \nreligion, \nimmigration status, sex, gender, gender identity, \ngender \nexpression, \nsexual \norientation, \nfamily \nstructure/ parental status, marital status, age, ability \n(cognitive, social/emotional, and physical), poverty \nand socioeconomic status, language, or other legally or \nconstitutionally protected attributes or affiliations. \nDiscrimination undermines our community\u2019s long-\nstanding efforts to create, foster, and promote equity, \ninclusion, and acceptance for all.

The presentation explains \nthat the LGBTQ-inclusive reading list aims to \u201creduce \nstigmatization and marginalization of transgender and \ngender nonconforming students.\u201d \n\u201cAll students deserve to see themselves in their school \nand classroom, including students who identify as \nLGBTQ+ and come from LGBTQ+ headed families and \nhave family members that are a part of the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity,\u201d the presentation states. \u201cThere are no \nplanned explicit lessons related to gender and \nsexuality, but these books do mean that LGBTQ+ \nidentities will be made visible.

What \nbody parts do they have?\u201d \nThe answer suggested by MCPS states: \u201cThat comment \nis hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk \nabout peoples\u2019 identities. Sometimes when we learn \ninformation that is different from what we always \nthought, it can be confusing and hard to process. When \nwe are born, people make a guess about our gender and \nlabel us \u2018boy\u2019 or \u2018girl\u2019 based on our body parts. \nSometimes they\u2019re right, and sometimes they\u2019re wrong. \nOur body parts do not decide our gender. Our gender \ncomes from inside \u2013 we might feel different than what \npeople tell us we are. We know ourselves best.\u201d \nIn a statement to Fox News Digital, MCPS insisted the \nreadings are not mandatory and that they will not be \nscheduled for use until families are notified. \n276a\n\nHowever, the original MCPS presentation includes a \nguide on \u201cResponding to Caregivers/Community \nQuestions,\u201d and two of the example questions include, \n\u201cWhy can\u2019t I opt out of this\u2026\u201d and \u201cCan I keep my child \nhome\u2026,\u201d and neither of the example answers to those \nquestions included saying that families can opt out. \nIn fact, if a parent asks why they \u201ccan\u2019t\u201d opt their \nchildren out of the readings like they can with sexual \nhealth-related topics, MCPS staff are advised to \nexplain that the readings are about \u201cdiversity\u201d not \nanatomy. \n\u201cDuring Family Health & Life, we are learning about \nscientific topics like biology, anatomy, puberty and \nreproduction,\u201d the sample response states. \u201cIn these \npicture books and discussions, students are learning \nabout the diversity of identities that exist in the world \nand in our classroom; we are not getting into any of the \nscientific specifics. This is similar to when we\u2019re \nlearning about different races, ethnicities and religions \nwhich are other social identities commonly talked \nabout in school. All children and their families deserve \nto see themselves and their families positively \nrepresented in our school community.\u201d \nIf a parent asks whether they can keep their child home \nduring the LGBTQ+ readings, MCPS faculty are \nadvised to explain that no effort will be made to \npersuade a child from holding certain beliefs. \n\u201cWhile there are no planned, explicit lessons related to \ngender and sexuality, students will see these identities \nembedded throughout,\u201d the sample response states. \n\u201cFor students for whom some of these identities are \nnew, questions and conversations might organically \nhappen. Inclusive curricula support a student\u2019s ability \n277a\n\nto empathize, connect, and collaborate with a diverse \ngroup of peers, and encourage respect for all. No child \nwho does not agree with or understand another \nstudent\u2019s, gender, identity or expression, or their \nsexuality identity is asked to change how they feel \nabout it.\u201d \nMCPS told Fox News Digital that \u201cthese books are a \nway to actualize the policy and guidelines and have \nundergone a rigorous evaluation process. All the \ncontent within them is age and developmentally \nappropriate.\u201d \n\u201cMCPS is committed to ensuring all students and their \nfamilies see themselves in the curriculum to cultivate \nan inclusive and welcoming learning environment,\u201d the \nschool district continued. \u201cThese books are not \nmandatory. These books are on the approved list of \nsupplemental materials schools will have access to that \nalign with our goal of providing more inclusive texts \nand resources in support of curriculum standards.

If so, what is Dr. Brewers thoughts on \nhow this will benefit the kids? Why did she choose yes \nfor REDACTED?\u201d \nI wanted to take the opportunity to give all our \nREDACTED families an answer to this question. \nWhile this is not a \u201cschool to school\u201d option, but a \nsystemwide initiative, I would like to share my \nthoughts with you. I would like to start with sharing \nhow sad I was after the meeting. In my 13 years as \nprincipal of REDACTED was one of the most difficult \nmeetings I have facilitated. As I shared at the meeting, \nwhat matters most to me is that all students and their \nfamilies feel welcome, accepted and most importantly \nsafe when they walk through our doors. \n483a\n\nI\u2019m disheartened to share that after that meeting, \nseveral people (both staff and parents) expressed to me \nthat they felt less safe as a result of some of the \ncomments made by their community members. \nThe one overwhelming take away for me was that \neveryone in that room was afraid of something. Afraid \nfor very different reasons, but afraid nonetheless. The \nfear is understandable \u2013 especially when we fear for \nour children. But acting on that fear in a way that \nmarginalizes others, to the point that they become \neither villainized or invisible is not the example we \nwant to set for our children. \nFear is a powerful motivator and can make people say \nand do things that they might not otherwise. To \naccommodate those fears, the county is considering an \n\u201copt out\u201d for parents who do not want their children to \nhear the books with LGBTQ+ characters in them. I \ndisagree with this decision unequivocally. Personally, \nI would liken this to allowing families to opt out of \nbooks with characters from marginalized groups (for \nexample, Jewish characters, Muslim characters, \nAfrican-American characters to name just a few). \nWhile I am sad at the tone of yesterday\u2019s meeting, I \nremain hopeful because of the many voices I heard \nfrom after the meeting. \nFor example, I received this email last night after the \nmeeting from a parent who attended: \n484a\n\nWoah! That was intense. I really just wanted to \nsay thank you for having the donuts and \ndialogue conversation this evening. After \ninitially hearing about the curriculum, I was \nnot in support of including these books into \nlessons primarily due to an age appropriate \nconcern. \nHowever, I want to say that I really appreciated \nyou defending this roll out as a preventive \nmethod of creating inclusion and acceptance \nbefore the kids get to the middle school level, \nwhere we as parents really hear about the \nstruggles with kids in the pre-adolescent stages. \nThis makes a lot of sense in supporting our \ngrowing kids! If educators can support kids and \ndevelop empathy at this young age, the inclusion \nand acceptance will only grow as the kids get \nolder! Duh. I am ashamed I didn\u2019t even think of \nthat. \nAnd \nso, \nagain, \nI \nappreciate \nthe \nconversation that we had, despite some shocking \nturns it may have taken. \nMy hope remains that if we are open to continuing the \ndialogue, we can teach children to better understand \nthose who may not think exactly the way they think, \nbut to accept them anyway. \nSincerely, \nDina Brewer, Ed.D \nPrincipal \n* \n* \n* \n485a\n\nFrom: Svitlana Roman REDACTED \nDate: Sat, Feb 25, 2023 at 8:39 AM \nSubject: Re: [EXTERNAL] Re: Follow Up  \nTo: Logan, Kisha REDACTED \nCC: Campbell, Tamitha E REDACTED, Jeff Roman \nREDACTED, Swerdzewski, Laura M REDACTED \nGood morning Dr. Logan, \nAllow me to summarize our discussions and outcome \nof the conversation, which I will be taking to the BOE \nfor further \nconsideration: \n1.

Our names are Tamer Mahmoud and Enas \nBarakat. We are over the age of 18 and are capable of \nmaking this declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. \nWe have personal knowledge of all of the contents of \nthis declaration. \n2. We are a married couple and reside in \nMontgomery County, Maryland. We have three \nchildren enrolled in MCPS, including\u2014a son and \ndaughter in tenth grade and a son in second grade. \n3. We are devout Muslims and believe that all \nhumans are God\u2019s creations with God-given dignity \nthat must be respected, regardless of the person\u2019s \nfaith, race, ethnic origin, sex, gender identity, sexual \norientation, or social status. These are truths \nreinforced in the Qu\u2019ran. Surah al-Israa 17:70. \n4. As Muslims, we believe we have a sacred duty \n529a\n\n \n \nto teach our children our faith, including religiously \ngrounded sexual ethics. We respect the rights of other \nparents to make their own decisions about sexuality, \ngender identity, and how to introduce these topics to \ntheir children. \n5. We believe that mankind has been divinely \ncreated as male and female, Surah al-Hujurat 49:13, \nand that all people are connected through a common \nancestor: the first male and the first female, Surah an-\nNisaa 4:1. \n6. Based on this teaching, we believe that sex and \nsexuality are sacred gifts from God to be expressed \nthrough the forming of a spiritual, marital bond \nbetween spouses\u2014one male and one female\u2014for the \nshared promise of security, tranquility, compassion, \ncontentment, and joy. Surah al-A\u2019raf 7:189; Surah ar-\nRum 30:21. \n7. We believe that this sacred bond between \nhusbands and wives entails sexually distinct but \nmutual duties and affections: \u201cThey are clothing for \nyou and you are clothing for them.\u201d Surah al-Baqarah \n2:187. \n8. We believe that marriage, sex, and sexuality are \nmeant for creating children and teaching them \nvirtue\u2014not only to build a loving family but also to \nserve as an example of righteousness for society at \nlarge. Surah al-Furqan 25:74. \n9. Inherent in these teachings, we believe that \n\u201cgender\u201d cannot be unwoven from biological \u201csex\u201d\u2014to \nthe extent the two are even distinct\u2014without rejecting \nthe dignity and direction God bestowed on humanity \nfrom the start. \n530a\n\n \n \n10. The Qu\u2019ran teaches that we are to respect God\u2019s \nwisdom in creation. Thus, as a general rule, Islam \nstrictly prohibits medical procedures that attempt to \nalter the sex of a healthy person, regardless of whether \nsuch procedures are termed gender \u201caffirming\u201d or \n\u201cconfirming.\u201d For individuals born with biological \nambiguities, such as disorders of sexual development, \nIslam permits them to seek medical care for corrective \nreasons. Surah An-Nisa 119. \n11. Similarly, the Prophet Muhammad (peace be \nupon him) explicitly condemned imitating the \nappearance of the opposite gender. \n12. It is our belief that humans attain their fullest \nGod-given potential by embracing their biological sex. \n13. Islam distinguishes between feelings, actions, \nand identity. God holds individuals accountable for \ntheir words and actions, not for their involuntary \nthoughts and feelings. We believe that all individuals \nhave the potential to be forgive by God for the \nmistakes they make. \n14. We have a sacred obligation to teach these \nprinciples to our children. Surah At-Tahrim 66:6; \nSahih al-Bukhari 7138; Al-Adab Al-Mufrad 212. This \nincludes encouraging them to accept Islamic teachings \non the differences between males and females, to \nembrace one\u2019s biological sex, and to practice self-\nrestraint by expressing sexual desires in ways \nconsistent with the Islamic faith. \n15. We believe that practicing self-restraint in \ndevotion to God is considered heroic. Its spiritual \nreward increases proportionally with the level of \nstruggle involved. Our ultimate purpose is to prioritize \n531a\n\n \n \ndevotion to God over our desires and not sacrifice our \nfaith. \n16. We believe there are detrimental spiritual \nconsequences from letting authoritative figures such \nas schoolteachers teach our children principles \nconcerning sexual and gender ethics that contravene \nwell-established Islamic teachings. \n17. Islam specifically prohibits prying into others\u2019 \nprivate lives and discourages public disclosure of \nsexual behavior. Quran, al-\u1e24ujurat: 12 and al-Noor: \n19. It would violate our religious beliefs and the \nreligious beliefs of our children if they were asked to \ndiscuss romantic relationships or sexuality with \nschoolteachers or classmates. \n18. Intentionally \nexposing \nour \nyoung, \nimpressionable, elementary-aged son to activities and \ncurriculum on sex, sexuality, and gender that \nundermine Islamic teaching on these subjects would \nbe immoral and would conflict with our religious duty \nto raise our children in accordance with our faith. \nSurah Al-An\u2019am 6:68-69. \n19. The storybooks at issue in this lawsuit and \nothers like them directly undermine our efforts to \nraise our elementary-aged child in accordance with \nour faith, because they encourage young children to \nquestion their sexuality and gender, to identify with \nlabels that categorize them by their sexuality, to focus \nprematurely on romantic relationships, to disregard \ndifferences between men and women, to accept gender \ntransitioning, and to dismiss parental and religious \nguidance on these issues. \n20. In short, forcing our son to participate in \n532a\n\n \n \nreading these books and engaging in related \ndiscussions would confuse his religious upbringing. \n21. A summary of our Islamic beliefs on these \nissues was recently drafted by Muslim scholars and \npreachers representing a diverse range of theological \nschools. A copy of this statement, entitled Navigating \nDifferences \u2013 Clarifying Sexual & Gender Ethics in \nIslam, is attached as Exhibit 1. \n22. This \ndocument \naccurately \ncaptures \nour \nreligious beliefs. As stated in the document, we believe \nthat the principles it espouses are immutable and not \nopen to revision by any person or entity, including the \nhighest religious authorities. Quran, al-An\u2018\u0101m: 115 \n(\u201cAnd the word of your Lord has been fulfilled in truth \nand justice. None can alter His words, and He is the \nAll-Hearing, the All-Knowing\u201d). \n23. In keeping with these religious beliefs, we asked \nthe acting principal of our son\u2019s elementary school for \nthe option to opt him out of the class reading of Prince \nand Knight and to assign him an alternative activity. \n24. The acting principal offered us an opportunity \nto read the book for ourselves. \n25. The acting principal then followed up by stating \nthat MCPS is not supporting parents opting out of the \nPride Storybooks and that teachers are not required to \nprovide alternative assignments. \n26. We responded that our decision to opt out had \nnot changed after reading the book, and we again \nasked for our son to receive an alternate assignment. \n27. The acting principal finally responded (on \nMarch 20) that he would allow our son to sit outside \n533a\n\n \n \nthe classroom while the book was discussed. \n28. On March 23, the School Board announced that \nthe storybooks at issue in this lawsuit would be \nmandatory for students going forward and that \nparents would no longer receive advance notice or \nopportunity to opt their children out. \n29. As members of a religious minority that \nfrequently experiences bigotry and exclusion, we reject \nthe notion that moral disagreement amounts to \nintolerance, bigotry, or incitement of violence. We \naffirm our right to express our beliefs and direct the \nupbringing of our children on such sensitive and \nreligiously significant issues while simultaneously \nrecognizing our civic and religious obligations to exist \npeacefully with those whose beliefs differ from ours. \nWe each declare under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing is true and correct.  \nExecuted on this 11th day of June, 2023. \n/s/ Tamer Mahmoud \nTamer Mahmoud \n/s/ Enas Barakat \nEnas Barakat \n \n534a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \nTAMER MAHMOUD,  \net al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMONIFA B. MCKNIGHT, \nin her official capacity as \nSuperintendent of the \nMontgomery Board of \nEducation, et al., \nDefendants. \nCase No. 8:23-CV-\n01380-TJS \n \nDECLARATION OF \nJEFF ROMAN and \nSVITLANA ROMAN \nIN SUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS\u2019 \nMOTION FOR A \nPRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \nWe, Jeff Roman and Svitlana Roman, declare and \nstate as follows: \n1. Our names are Jeff Roman and Svitlana \nRoman. We are over the age of 18 and are capable of \nmaking this declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. \nWe have personal knowledge of all of the contents of \nthis declaration. \n2. We reside in Montgomery County, Maryland, \nand have one son enrolled in MCPS in second grade. \n3. We adhere to and follow the Roman Catholic \n(Jeff) and Ukrainian Orthodox (Svitlana) faiths. My \n(Svitlana\u2019s) beliefs align with the teachings of the \nRoman Catholic Church on marriage, family, sex, \nsexuality, and gender. \n4. Our Christian faith teaches that all humans are \nchildren of God who are created in God\u2019s image and \nlikeness and therefore have inherent dignity. Genesis \n1:26-27; Catechism of the Catholic Church, \u00a7 1700 \n(\u201cThe dignity of the human person is rooted in his \n535a\n\n \ncreation in the image and likeness of God.\u201d). \n5. We believe that God commands us to treat \nothers as bearers of this intrinsic nature. 1 \nCorinthians 3:16. We firmly reject that any student \nshould be bullied or harassed for any reason, and we \nteach our son to treat all others with kindness and \nrespect. 1 John 4:7-12, 16; Matthew 22:37-39. \n6. Based on this teaching, we believe that all \nhumans are created as male or female\u2014each equal in \ndignity\u2014and that a person\u2019s biological sex is not \narbitrary, but rather a gift bestowed by God that \nentails differences in men\u2019s and women\u2019s bodies and \nhow they relate to each other and to the world. See \nGenesis 5:2; Catechism of the Catholic Church, \u00a7 2393 \n(\u201cBy creating the human being man and woman, God \ngives personal dignity equally to the one and the other. \nEach of them, man and woman, should acknowledge \nand accept his sexual identity.\u201d). \n7. We believe that because human beings are a \nunity of body and soul, our human bodies and \nsexuality, male and female, are an integral part of \nGod\u2019s design and essential to being made in God\u2019s \nimage and likeness. See 1 Thessalonians 5:23; \nCatechism of the Catholic Church, \u00a7\u00a7 362-68. The \nhuman body, therefore, has great dignity, and human \nsexuality is a gift. See id., \u00a7\u00a7 369-73. \u201cLearning to \naccept our body, to care for it and to respect its fullest \nmeaning, is an essential element of any genuine \nhuman ecology.\u201d Laudato si\u2019, 155. \n8. Accordingly, we believe that the gift of human \nsexuality is precious with its power to create life and \nlove and that it calls for an authentic and healthy \nintegration in the person\u2014the virtue of chastity. See \n536a\n\n \nCatechism of the Catholic Church, \u00a7 2337 (\u201cChastity \nmeans the successful integration of sexuality within \nthe person and thus the inner unity of man in his \nbodily and spiritual being.\u201d). We believe that chastity \nis necessary to the right living of one\u2019s sexuality and \nrequires habits of \u201cself-mastery\u201d to govern and \nchannel one\u2019s sexual emotions rather than being \n\u201cdominated by them.\u201d Id., \u00a7 2339. \n9. For this reason, we believe intimate sexuality is \nproperly expressed only in marriage between a man \nand a woman for creating life and strengthening the \nmarital union. Id., \u00a7 2360-63; Genesis 2:24; Mark 10:6-\n9. \n10. Based on these teachings, we believe that a \nperson\u2019s biological sex is both unchanging and integral \nto that person\u2019s being, and that gender and biological \nsex are intertwined and inseparable. Amoris Laetitia, \n56 (\u201c[B]iological sex and the socio-cultural role of sex \n(gender) can be distinguished but not separated.\u201d). \nAnd we believe that encouraging children to unwind \nthem will teach them that their bodies are \u201can object, \na mere tool at the disposal of the soul, one that each \nperson may dispose of according to his or her own will,\u201d \nrather than a \u201cconstitutive part of the human subject, \na gift to be received, respected, and cared for as \nsomething intrinsic to the person.\u201d Committee on \nDoctrine United States Conference of Catholic \nBishops, Doctrinal Note on the Moral Limits to \nTechnological Manipulation of the Human Body 4 \n(2023), https://perma.cc/T6Y6-NXAB. Thus, we believe \nthat, \u201c[b]eyond the understandable difficulties which \nindividuals may experience, the young need to be \nhelped to accept their own body as it was created, for \nthinking that we enjoy absolute power over our own \n537a\n\n \nbodies turns, often subtly, into thinking that we enjoy \nabsolute power over creation.\u201d Amoris Laetitia, 285. \n11. For the same reasons, we believe that humans \nattain their fullest God-given potential by embracing \ntheir biological sex. Catechism of the Catholic Church, \n\u00a7 2333 \n(\u201cEveryone, \nman \nand \nwoman, \nshould \nacknowledge and accept his sexual identity. Physical, \nmoral, and spiritual difference and complementarity \nare oriented toward the goods of marriage and the \nflourishing of family life.\u201d); Laudato si\u2019, 155 (\u201cThe \nacceptance of our bodies as God\u2019s gift is vital for \nwelcoming and accepting the entire world as a gift \nfrom the Father and our common home, whereas \nthinking that we enjoy absolute power over our own \nbodies turns, often subtly, into thinking that we enjoy \nabsolute power over creation. Learning to accept our \nbody, to care for it and to respect its fullest meaning, \nis an essential element of any genuine human \necology.\u201d). \n12. We have a sacred obligation to teach these \nprinciples to our son and to encourage him at \nappropriate times to embrace these principles and our \nreligious way of life. See Catechism of the Catholic \nChurch, \u00a7\u00a7 2221-26. In particular, we have a duty to \nprovide our son an \u201ceducation in the virtues,\u201d which \n\u201crequires an apprenticeship in self-denial, sound \njudgment, and self-mastery\u2014the preconditions of all \ntrue freedom.\u201d Id., \u00a7 2223. This, in turn, imposes a \ncorresponding duty to \u201cteach [our] children to avoid \nthe compromising and degrading influences which \nthreaten human societies.\u201d Id., \u00a7 2224. \n13. We believe that young children should enjoy a \ntime of innocence, when it is not necessary for them to \nhave detailed understanding of issues surrounding \n538a\n\n \nhuman sexuality, especially where that information is \n\u201cdissociated \nfrom \nmoral \nprinciples.\u201d \nFamiliaris \nConsortio, 37; see also Proverbs 22:6; Colossians 3:21; \nPontifical Council for the Family, The Truth and \nMeaning \nof \nHuman \nSexuality: \nGuidelines \nfor \nEducation within the Family, 78 (teaching that the \n\u201cperiod of tranquility and serenity\u201d during \u201c\u2018the years \nof innocence\u2019 from about five years of age until puberty \n\u2026 \nmust \nnever \nbe \ndisturbed \nby \nunnecessary \ninformation about sex\u201d); id., 83 (\u201cIn some societies \ntoday, there are planned and determined attempts to \nimpose premature sex information on children. But, at \nthis stage of development, children are still not \ncapable of fully understanding the value of the \naffective dimension of sexuality.\u201d). \n14. For these reasons, we believe that much of what \nis taught via the Pride Storybooks is false religiously \nand scientifically. We disagree that a child\u2019s sex can be \nseparated from his or her biology and that \u201cgender\u201d is \na separate form of identity that is \u201cmanipula[ble] at \nwill.\u201d Laudato si\u2019, 155 (\u201c[V]aluing one\u2019s own body in its \nfemininity or masculinity is necessary if I am going to \nbe able to recognize myself in an encounter with \nsomeone who is different. In this way we can joyfully \naccept the specific gifts of another man or woman, the \nwork of God the Creator, and find mutual enrichment. \nIt is not a healthy attitude which would seek to cancel \nout sexual difference because it no longer knows how \nto confront it.\u201d). And we disagree that elementary \nschools should encourage young children to focus \nprematurely on romantic emotions and relationships. \nSee Pontifical Council for the Family, The Truth and \nMeaning \nof \nHuman \nSexuality: \nGuidelines \nfor \nEducation within the Family, 78, 83. \n539a\n\n \n15. We are guided by Pope Francis\u2019s admonition: \n\u201cToday children \u2013 children! \u2013 are taught in school that \neveryone can choose his or her sex.\u201d Address to the \nPolish Bishops during the Apostolic Journey to Poland \n(July 27, 2016). Our Christian faith rejects the \n\u201cideology of gender\u201d that \u201cdenies the difference and \nreciprocity in nature of a man and a woman\u201d and \n\u201cleads to educational programs and legislative \nenactments that promote a personal identity and \nemotional intimacy radically separated from the \nbiological difference between male and female.\u201d \nAmoris Laetitia, 56. Rather, we believe that \u201c[s]ex \neducation should help young people to accept their \nown bodies and to avoid the pretension to cancel out \nsexual difference because one no longer knows how to \ndeal with it.\u201d Id., 285. \n16. In keeping with these religious beliefs, we \ncorresponded with our son\u2019s elementary school \nprincipal, seeking both an opt-out for our son and \nguarantees that parents would continue to receive \nnotice about the Pride Storybooks and that teaching \nthem would be optional for teachers. \n17. On February 1, 2023, the principal responded \n\u201cit is your right to ask that [your son] not be present \nwhen this book is read to the class and if any other \nparents reach out I will meet with them to have the \nsame discussion we engaged in and they can make a \ndecision for their family.\u201d \n18. Nevertheless, on March 23, the School Board \nannounced that the Pride Storybooks were being read \nto students and that parents would no longer receive \nadvance notice or opportunity to opt their children out. \nId. \n540a\n\n \n19. Issues of sexuality and gender identity are \ncomplex and sensitive. Our son is not old enough to be \nthinking about many of the issues presented in the \nbooks MCPS is requiring him to read and would find \nthem confusing. \n20. Our son loves his teachers and implicitly trusts \nthem. Having them teach principles about sexuality or \ngender identity that conflict with our religious beliefs \nsignificantly interferes with our ability to form his \nreligious faith and religious outlook on life and is \nspiritually and emotionally harmful to his well-being. \nSee Pontifical Council for the Family, The Truth and \nMeaning \nof \nHuman \nSexuality: \nGuidelines \nfor \nEducation within the Family, 83 (\u201cParents should \npolitely but firmly exclude any attempts to violate \nchildren\u2019s innocence\u201d by \u201cimpos[ing] premature sex \ninformation\u201d \u201cbecause such attempts compromise the \nspiritual, moral and emotional development of \ngrowing persons who have a right to their innocence.\u201d). \n \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the foregoing \nis true and correct.  \nExecuted on this 10th day of June, 2023. \n/s/ Jeff Roman \nJeff Roman \n/s/ Svitlana Roman \nSvitlana Roman \n \n541a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \nTAMER MAHMOUD,  \net al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMONIFA B.

Our names are Chris Persak and Melissa \nPersak. We are over the age of 18 and are capable of \nmaking this declaration pursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. \nWe have personal knowledge of all of the contents of \nthis declaration. \n2. We reside in Montgomery County, Maryland. \nWe have two daughters in elementary school at MCPS. \n3. We are Catholics by faith and believe that \nquestions about sex and sexuality should be informed \nby the teachings of the Catholic Church. Our \nunderstanding of what is best for our children is also \ninformed by our faith. \n4. To that end, we believe matters regarding \nfamily life and human sexuality should be taught in \nway that is consistent with Catholic teaching. \n542a\n\n \n5. In accordance with Catholic teaching on human \nsexuality, we believe that all humans are created as \nmale or female, and that a person\u2019s biological sex is a \ngift bestowed by God that is both unchanging and \nintegral to that person\u2019s being. See Genesis 5:2. \n6. We believe that following God\u2019s commandments \nfor marriage and family is not only necessary for \nraising the next generation of children, see Genesis \n1:28, but also leads to human flourishing and \nhappiness. See John 8:51, 14:21, 15:10. \n7. As parents, we have a God-given responsibility \nto raise our children in accordance with the tenets of \nour faith. See Proverbs 22:6; Deuteronomy 6:6-7. \nThose tenets include the Catholic Church\u2019s teachings \non the immutable sexual differences between males \nand females, the biblical way to properly express \nromantic and sexual desires, and the role of parents to \nlove one another unconditionally and sacrificially \nwithin the confines of biblical marriage to create and \nsustain a family. \n8. We believe that all persons should be treated \nwith respect and dignity regardless of religion, race, \nsex, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, or \nother characteristics, as all people are made in God\u2019s \nimage. See Genesis 1:26-27. \n9. We respect the rights of other parents to make \ntheir own decisions about sexuality, gender identity, \nand how to introduce these topics to their children.  \n10. We want our daughters, at an appropriate age, \nto understand and appreciate the unique gifts and \nchallenges of every individual. \n11.  We believe that discussing issues of sexuality \n543a\n\n \nand gender with young children requires sensitivity \nfrom parents to determine how and when to introduce \nthese topics to children. \n12. We believe that exposing our elementary-aged \ndaughters to viewpoints on sex, sexuality, and gender \nthat contradict Catholic teaching on these subjects is \ninappropriate and conflicts with our religious duty to \nraise our children in accordance with Catholic \nteaching. \n13. We believe that children\u2014particularly those in \nelementary school\u2014are highly impressionable to \nideological instruction presented in children\u2019s books or \nby schoolteachers. \n14. We believe the risk is even more serious when \nideological instruction is imposed to the exclusion of \nother viewpoints. \n15. We believe that the Pride Storybooks go far \nbeyond teaching kindness and respect and are being \nused to impose an ideological view of family life and \nsexuality that characterizes any divergent beliefs as \n\u201churtful.\u201d \n16. The Pride Storybooks undermine out efforts to \nraise our children in accordance with our faith as the \nbooks encourage young, elementary-aged children to \nquestion their sexuality and gender, ignore important \ndifferences between men and women, approve gender \ntransitioning, \nfocus \nprematurely \non \nromantic \nrelationships and sexuality, and dismiss parental and \nreligious guidance on these issues. \n17. Earlier this year we asked our school principle \nto have our daughters excused from class when any of \nthe storybooks at issue in this lawsuit were being read. \n544a\n\n \n18. The principal agreed that they would be \nexcused from the classroom when any of the \nstorybooks were read that semester. \n19. The principal made it clear, however, that no \nfuture notifications or opt-outs would be provided. \n20. The principal told us that opt-outs were allowed \nonly to accommodate parents\u2019 \u201cfears\u201d and that she \ndisagreed with it. \n \nWe each declare under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing is true and correct.  \nExecuted on this 12th day of June, 2023. \n/s/ Chris Persak \nChris Persak \n/s/ Melissa Persak \nMelissa Persak \n \n \n \n545a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT  \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \nTAMER MAHMOUD,  \net al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMONIFA B.

PURPOSE \nTo affirm the Montgomery County Board of \nEducation's desire to create an educational \ncommunity guided by its five core values-\nLeaming, Relationships, Respect, Excellence, and \nEquity. \nTo affirm the Board's deep commitment to \nproviding every student equitable access to the \neducational opportunities, rigor, resources, and \nsupports that are designed to maximize the \nstudent's \nacademic \nsuccess \nand \nphysical, \npsychological, and social/emotional well-being, \nand ensuring all staff are empowered to do their \nbest work. \nTo assert the Board's belief that each and every \nstudent \nmatters, \neach \nstudent's \nindividual \ncharacteristics are valuable, and in particular, \nthat educational outcomes should never be \npredictable by any individual's actual or perceived \n581a\n\npersonal characteristics, and that equity demands \nintensive focus and attention to eliminate all gaps \nin student achievement. \nTo establish and promote a framework that \nprepares all students to live and work in a \nglobally-minded \nsociety; \nfosters \na \npositive \nlearning environment that embraces all unique \nand individual differences; and, uses an equity \nlens to consider the impact of any program, \npractice, decision, or action on all student groups \nwith a strategic focus on marginalized student \ngroups. \nTo affirm the Board's unwavering commitment \nthat all staff will be culturally proficient, and \ndemonstrate mutual respect without regard to \nany individual's actual or perceived personal \ncharacteristics. \nTo uphold the Board's core values, and ensure \ncompliance with all federal, state, and local \nnondiscrimination laws. \nB. ISSUE \nDiscrimination in any form will not be tolerated. \nIt impedes Montgomery County Public Schools' \n(MCPS) ability to discharge its responsibilities to \nall \nstudents \nand \nstaff, \nand \nachieve \nour \ncommunity's long-standing efforts to create, \nfoster, and promote equity, inclusion, and \nacceptance for all. \nThe Board recognizes that equity goes beyond \nmeeting the letter of the law. Equity also requires \nproactive steps to identify and redress implicit \nbiases and structural and institutional barriers \n582a\n\nthat too often have resulted in identifiable groups \nof students and staff being unjustifiably or \ndisproportionately \nexcluded \nfrom \nor \nunderrepresented in key educational program \nareas and sectors of the workforce, as well as over-\nidentified in student discipline actions. Continued \nvigilance is necessary to end identified inequities \nthat students and staff experience because of their \nactual or perceived personal characteristics. \nFor the purposes of this policy, the following \ndefinitions are used: \n1. Cultural proficiency is the ongoing process of \nbecoming knowledgeable of one's own culture, \nas well as the cultures of others in order to \nfoster an appreciation, understanding, and \nrespect for varying cultural expressions that \nexist in the actions and interactions of an \norganization; and, to strengthen and enrich \nthe organization and the community at large \nwith the presence and contributions of many \ncultures. \n2. Discrimination includes actions that are \nmotivated by an invidious intent to target \nindividuals based on their actual or perceived \npersonal characteristics, as well as acts of \nhate, violence, insensitivity, disrespect, or \nretaliation-such as verbal abuse, harassment, \nbullying, slurs, threats, physical violence, \nvandalism, or destruction of property-that \nimpede or affect the learning or work \nenvironment. Discrimination also includes \nconduct or practices that may be facially \nneutral but that have an unjustified  impact  \nbased  on  individuals'  actual  or  perceived  \n583a\n\npersonal \ncharacteristics. \nDiscrimination \nencompasses racism, sexism, and other forms \nof \ninstitutional \nprejudice \nin \nall \ntheir \nmanifestations. \n3. Equity is the commitment to ensure that every \nstudent and staff member, without regard to \ntheir \nactual \nor \nperceived \npersonal \ncharacteristics, \nis \ngiven \nthe \nindividual \nchallenges, support, and opportunities to \nexceed a rigorous common standard in order to \nbe prepared for academic and career success. \n4. Equity lens means that for any program, \npractice, decision, or action, the impact on all \nstudents is addressed, with a strategic focus on \nmarginalized student groups. \n5. Implicit bias refers to the attitudes or \nstereotypes that affect our understanding, \nactions, and decisions.  These biases, which \nencompass both favorable and unfavorable \nassessments, may be activated involuntarily \nand without an individual\u2019s awareness or \nintentional control. \n6. Personal \nCharacteristics \ninclude \nrace, \nethnicity, color, ancestry, national origin, \nnationality, religion, immigration status, sex, \ngender, gender identity, gender expression, \nsexual orientation, family structure/parental \nstatus, marital status, age, ability (cognitive, \nsocial/emotional, and physical), poverty and \nsocioeconomic status, language, or other \nlegally or constitutionally protected attributes \nor affiliations. \n584a\n\nC. POSITION \n1. The Board expects the district to develop and \npromote a culture of high expectations for all \nstudents and staff performance and maintain \nenvironments that will be equitable,  fair,  safe,  \ndiverse,  and  inclusive;  and  eliminate  \ninequities  of opportunities, raise the level of \nachievement for all students, and significantly \naddress achievement gaps. \n2. The Board prohibits the use of language and/or \nthe display of images and symbols that \npromote hate and can be reasonably expected \nto cause substantial disruption to school or \ndistrict \noperations \nor \nactivities. \n \nThis \nprohibition will not be used, however, to \nprevent \nresponsible \ndiscussion \nof \nsuch \nlanguage, images or symbols for educational \npurposes. \n3. The Board expects all students and staff to \nconduct \nthemselves \nin \na \nmanner \nthat \ndemonstrates mutual respect without regard \nto an individual's actual or perceived personal \ncharacteristics. \n4. The \nBoard \nprohibits \ndiscrimination, \nby \nstudents and staff, of any kind, directed at \npersons because of their actual or perceived \npersonal characteristics. \n5. The \nBoard \ncommits \nto \nmodelling \nthe \nexpectations in this policy, and expects all \nBoard and MCPS reports, presentations, and \ndecision making to take into account the \nequity implications of this policy. \n585a\n\n6.

MCPS will \nprovide access to rigorous coursework and \nequal access to comparable academic \nprograms both among schools and among \nstudents within the same school without \nregard to actual or perceived personal \ncharacteristics. \n(5) MCPS will encourage all students to pursue \ntheir goals and interests, without regard to \nhistorical barriers or stereotypes. Students \nwill be provided wide access to various and \nmultiple \nopportunities \nto \nenroll \nin \nchallenging programs and participate in a \nwide variety of school activities, including \nathletics, \nextracurricular \nand \nnon-\nacademic \nprograms, \nto \nenrich \ntheir \nperspectives and to prepare for meaningful \nand fulfilling work in their chosen careers. \n(6) MCPS will promote and encourage schools, \nclassrooms, \nwork \nsites, \nand \nschool-\nsponsored \nrepresentations \n(including \nmascots, logos, team names, chants, or \nmusical accompaniments) to be inclusive, \nnondiscriminatory, and bias-free, and to \nprovide a welcoming climate for all. \n588a\n\n(7) MCPS will provide a culturally responsive \nPrekindergarten to Grade 12 curriculum \nthat promotes equity, respect, and civility \namong our diverse community, accurately \ndepicts and represents the distinctive \ncontributions of our global community, and \nprovides \nopportunities \nfor \nstaff \nand \nstudents to model cultural proficiency in \nevery school and program.

IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGIES \n1. The Board will address disparities in levels of \naccess to resources critical to the success of \nstudents by implementing an intentional \nstrategy of providing additional funding to \nstudents in greater need, as well as to schools \nthat serve larger numbers of students in need; \nand ensuring equitable access to effective \nleaders and teachers for all students. \n2. MCPS will engage with staff, students, \nparents/guardians, and the entire community \nto build and sustain a culture emblematic of \nthe ideals of this policy. \n3. MCPS will identify a process for analyzing \ndata to develop goals, objectives, strategies, \nand timelines for the implementation of \nequitable and culturally competent practices in \neach school. Multiple indicators are necessary \nto monitor student outcomes, engagement, and \nschool climate, and specific data will be used to \nensure accountability for student, school, and \ndistrictwide performance; to reduce variability \nin outcomes; and to ensure that academic \noutcomes will not be predictable by actual or \nperceived personal characteristics and can be \nassessed and reported transparently to the \npublic. \n4. Programs, curricula, instructional materials, \nand \nactivities, \nincluding \nathletics, \nextracurricular and non-academic programs \nand activities, will provide all students with \nthe knowledge, skills, attitudes, and behaviors \nthat \npromote \ncultural \nproficiency \nand \n592a\n\nbehaviors that enable students to live and \nwork together in our increasingly diverse \ncounty, state, nation, and world. \n5.

Specific \nstrategies \nwill \nbe \nidentified, \ncommunicated \n \nand \nused \nto \nprevent \ndiscrimination, and procedures will be followed \nto resolve, monitor, and analyze such incidents \nof discrimination if they occur. \n8. MCPS will identify partnerships and work \ncooperatively with the Montgomery County \nExecutive, the Montgomery County Council, \nlocal law enforcement agencies, other county \nagencies, \ncommunity \ngroups, \nbusiness \norganizations, \nand \nother \nstakeholders \nto \nincrease equity and reduce discrimination for \nstudents and staff. \n9. A statement summarizing this Board policy of \nnondiscrimination, \nwill \nbe \nprominently \nincluded in MCPS publications and on the \nMCPS website.  Any publication that states the \nBoard policy of nondiscrimination in English \nwill also be translated into those languages for \nwhich translation and interpretation services \nare \nmost \nfrequently \nrequested \nby \nparents/guardians of MCPS students. \n10. The superintendent of schools will designate an \nappropriate lead office to implement this policy, \nwith support from other offices as appropriate, \nand assume responsibility for the following: \na) Monitoring and ensuring MCPS compliance \nwith \nall \nfederal, \nstate, \nand \nlocal \n594a\n\nnondiscrimination \nlaws \nand \nMSDE \nreporting requirements; \nb) Identifying the method of evaluation to \nmeasure the effect of equitable practices \ndistrictwide and in schools; \nc) Promptly \ninvestigating, \nand \nresolving \ncomplaints of discrimination; \nd) Designating an individual responsible for \nthe \nfacilitation, \nmonitoring, \nand \nimplementation of system equity initiatives; \ne) Increasing awareness of the Board\u2019s values \nand expectations under this policy; \nf) Requiring that an equity lens be used in \nreviews of \u2013 \n1) staff, curriculum, pedagogy, professional \nlearning, instructional materials, and \nassessment designs; and \n2) all staff recruiting, hiring, retention, and \npromotion processes; \ng) Providing professional learning regarding \nnondiscrimination, \nequity \nand \ncultural \nproficiency; and conducting outreach to \nsupport the application of these concepts in \nprofessional conduct and practice; and \nh) Maintaining appropriate records. \n11. The superintendent of schools may direct an \nemployee who exhibits insensitive behavior, as \nevidenced \nby \nviolating \nthe \nvalues \nand \nexpectation \nexpressed \nin \nthis \npolicy, \nto \nparticipate in additional training regarding \ncultural proficiency. Continued insensitivity \n595a\n\nwill not be tolerated by the Board and may \nresult in further disciplinary action, including \ndismissal, consistent with the MCPS Employee \nCode of Conduct. \nF. REVIEW AND REPORTING \n1. The superintendent of schools will - \na) ensure that equity be addressed in the \nLocal Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) \nConsolidated Strategic Plan; \nb) disaggregate student data to analyze \ntrends and identify gaps, and use such data \nto support the creation of equitable \nsolutions; and \nc) provide  the  public  and  the  Board  with  \nregular  updates  on  the implementation of \nthis policy and efforts undertaken by the \ndistrict to create an equitable school system \nthat fulfills the Board's core values. \n2.

HAZEL IN \nSUPPORT OF \nDEFENDANTS\u2019 \nOPPOSITION TO \nPLAINTIFFS\u2019 \nMOTION FOR \nPRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \n I, Niki T. Hazel, declare as follows:  \n1.  I am the Associate Superintendent, Curriculum \nand Instructional Programs at Montgomery County \nPublic Schools, where I have been employed for 28 \nyears.  In my current role, I oversee PreK-12 \nCurriculum, Accelerated and Enriched Instruction, \nEmergent Multilingual Learner Education, Early \nChildhood Programs, Title I Schools, Choice and \nApplication Programs and Services, School Library \nMedia Programs, Career Readiness, and Technology \nEducation.  I make this declaration based on my \npersonal knowledge and upon review of MCPS\u2019s \nrecords maintained in the ordinary course of business, \nto which I have access based on my job responsibilities.  \nA. Montgomery County Public Schools And The \nMontgomery County Board of Education \nServe A Diverse Community  \n2. Montgomery \nCounty \nPublic \nSchools \nis \nMaryland\u2019s largest school district.  It enrolled 160,554 \n597a\n\n \n \nstudents for the 2022-2023 school year across 210 \nschools.  \n3. The Montgomery County Board of Education \n(the \u201cBoard\u201d) is the official educational policy-making \nbody in the county.  It sets goals, establishes policies, \nand commits resources to benefit MCPS\u2019s diverse \nstudent population.    \n4. The Board consists of seven county residents \nelected by voters for a four-year term and a student \nelected by secondary school students for a one-year \nterm.  \n5. The \nBoard \nvalues \nlearning, \nrespect, \nrelationships, excellence, and equity.  The Board \nbelieves that building relationships with its diverse \ncommunity requires it to understand the perspectives \nand experiences of others.  It also believes that the \ndiversity of culture, interests, skills, and backgrounds \nin its community is an asset that makes it stronger.   \n6. These values are memorialized in the Board\u2019s \nPolicy ACA on Nondiscrimination, Equity, and \nCultural Proficiency.  Policy ACA is attached as \nExhibit 1.  Policy ACA provides that one of the \nBoard\u2019s purposes is to \u201cfoster[] a positive learning \nenvironment that embraces all unique and individual \ndifferences\u201d and to \u201censure compliance with all \nfederal, state, and local nondiscrimination laws.\u201d  The \nBoard recognizes that it must take \u201cproactive steps to \nidentify and redress implicit biases and structural and \ninstitutional barriers that too often have resulted in \nidentifiable groups of students and staff being \nunjustifiably or disproportionately excluded from or \nunderrepresented \nin \nkey \neducational \nprogram \nareas \u2026.\u201d  The Board therefore strives to \u201cprovide a \n598a\n\n \n \nculturally responsive Prekindergarten to Grade 12 \ncurriculum that promotes equity, respect, and civility \namong our diverse community \u2026.\u201d  The curriculum \nprepares students to \u201c[c]onfront and eliminate \nstereotypes related to individuals\u2019 actual or perceived \npersonal characteristics,\u201d such as race, ethnicity, \nnational origin, religion, immigration status, sex, \ngender identity, sexual orientation, and other \n\u201cprotected attributes or affiliations.\u201d  The Board \naccordingly expects that \u201c[i]nstructional materials \nused in [its] schools will reflect the diversity of the \nglobal community \u2026.\u201d  \nB. MCPS Carefully Selects The Materials That It \nApproves For Instructional Use  \n7. In accordance with Policy ACA, the MCPS \nEnglish Language Arts (\u201cELA\u201d) Framework notes that \nthe ELA curriculum is designed to \u201cpromote[] \ninstruction that,\u201d among other goals, \u201cnurtures \nappreciation \nand \nunderstanding \nof \ndiverse \nindividuals, groups, and cultures.\u201d  The ELA \nFramework is attached as Exhibit 2.  \n8. MCPS has adopted Core Learning Practices \nunder its ELA curriculum, under which MCPS \nteachers \nare \nexpected \nto \n\u201cplan \ninstructional \nexperiences where students frequently engage in\u201d a \nvariety \nof \ncore \nlearning \npractices, \nincluding \n\u201c[s]electing from a range of diverse texts to understand \nand appreciate multiple perspectives.\u201d  These Core \nLearning Practices are attached as Exhibit 3.  \n9. After \ncontracting \nwith \nJohns \nHopkins \nUniversity to conduct a comprehensive review of its \ncurriculum, MCPS announced in 2018 that it would \ncontract with highly rated and proven third-party \n599a\n\n \n \neducational companies to implement its English \nLanguage Arts and Mathematics curricula.  \n10. A committee of parents, teachers, and staff \nmembers chose Benchmark Education (\u201cBenchmark\u201d) \nto \nimplement \nMCPS\u2019s \nELA \ncurriculum \nafter \ndetermining that its curricular resources best aligned \nwith the Maryland College and Career Ready \nStandards \npublished \nby \nthe \nMaryland \nState \nDepartment of Education.  \n11. MCPS regularly supplements the external \ncurricular resources delivered by companies such as \nBenchmark.  Regulation IIB-RA outlines the standard \nprocedure for selecting these instructional materials.  \nThat regulation is attached as Exhibit 4.  \n12. Instructional materials are approved by a \nselection committee comprised of professional staff \nmembers and subject-area experts.  \n13. That committee evaluates materials that may \nbe approved for instructional use for alignment with \nthe MCPS curriculum, age-appropriateness, and \nrelevance to and reflection of a multicultural society.  \n14. The committee evaluates instructional material \nbased on several criteria, including that the materials \nbe \u201crelevant to and reflective of the multicultural \nsociety and global community,\u201d be \u201c[a]ge/grade \nappropriate[],\u201d and \u201csupport \u2026 student achievement \ntoward MCPS curriculum standards.\u201d  \n15. Instructional materials are evaluated by the \nrelevant selection committee using MCPS Form 365-\n25.  A copy of that form is attached as Exhibit 5.  Form \n365-25 requires the committee of reviewers to provide \nfive categories of information describing \u201chow the \n600a\n\n \n \nmaterials are essential to student learning.\u201d  These \ncategories are \u201c[d]irect support of content standards \nand performance indicators,\u201d \u201c[a]uthenticity of the \nmaterial,\u201d \u201c[i]mpact on instructional time,\u201d \u201c[c]larity \nand ease of understanding,\u201d and \u201cinformation about \ncontent, strengths/weaknesses, areas of concern \n(restrictions) and cultural relevance (culture, religion, \nethnicity, \nregion, \ncountry, \nauthor, \ncharacters, \ngender).\u201d  \n16. The instructional material selection process \nalso allows for community input.  Newly approved \nbooks remain in the Evaluation and Selection Unit for \n30 \ncalendar \ndays \nto \npermit \nexamination \nby \nprofessional staff and parents.  Titles are also \navailable for examination on the Montgomery County \nPublic Schools Evaluation and Selection website.  \n17. In that 30-day examination period, parents and \ncaretakers have opportunities to review and share \nfeedback.  When parents provide feedback on \ninstructional materials during this time period, the \ncoordinator of the evaluation and selection process \nreviews and considers this feedback before making a \nfinal decision about whether to approve the materials.  \n18. Teachers are provided materials that are \napproved for instructional use.  Teachers are expected \nto use the instructional materials provided, and can \nselect which of these materials to incorporate into \ntheir lesson plans.  \nC. MCPS \nStrives \nTo \nAdopt \nPolicies \nAnd \nCurricula That Reflect The Diversity Of \nMontgomery County Families  \n19. MCPS is Maryland\u2019s largest school district, \nserving an incredibly diverse community.  MCPS \n601a\n\n \n \nserves a population of over 160,000 students, over 75% \nof whom are nonwhite, 44% of whom receive free and \nreduced-price meals, and 19% of whom receive English \nlanguage development services.  The community also \nincludes people of many different religious faiths, \nfamily statuses, gender identities, sexual orientations, \nand other protected attributes or affiliations.  \n20. MCPS seeks to ensure that its policies and its \ncurricula meet the needs of Montgomery County \nfamilies.  In line with this effort, MCPS has worked to \naccommodate families of all religious backgrounds.  \nFor example, MCPS authorizes absences for religious \nholidays, ensures students can make up missed \nassignments, and provides that students cannot be \ndenied a perfect attendance award if their only \nabsences have been excused for the observance of \nreligious holidays.  Beginning with the 2016-2017 \nschool year, MCPS stopped scheduling classes on Eid \nal-Fitr or Eid al-Adha, two major Islamic holidays.  \nAnd MCPS advises principals that schools should \navoid scheduling tests or other major events on dozens \nof other \u201cdays of commemoration,\u201d during which \nMCPS expects that many students may be absent for \nor engaged in religious or cultural observances.    \n21. MCPS also works continually to ensure that its \npre-K through 12th grade curriculum reflects \nMontgomery County families.  MCPS has accordingly \nmade regular efforts to incorporate instructional \nmaterials that reflect the diversity of the community.  \nFor example, MCPS has purchased books for use as \npart of the ELA curriculum that are intended to be \nmore representative of other races and cultures.  \nThese books include the March trilogy, which recounts \nthe life of civil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, \n602a\n\n \n \nand The Leavers, which introduces readers to the story \nof an Asian-American immigrant family.  MCPS also \nrecently updated its Social Studies curriculum to \nincorporate instructional materials about local history \nand the narratives of historically marginalized groups.    \n22. Representation in the curriculum creates and \nnormalizes a fully inclusive environment for all \nstudents in MCPS.  It supports a student\u2019s ability to \nempathize, connect, and collaborate with diverse peers \nand encourage respect for all.  \nD. MCPS Selects The LGBTQ-Inclusive Books To \nEnsure \nRepresentation \nIn \nThe \nELA \nCurriculum  \n23. In recent years, MCPS determined that the \nbooks used in its existing ELA curriculum were not \nrepresentative of many students and families in \nMontgomery County because they did not include \nLGBTQ characters.  The LGBTQ-Inclusive Books \nwere thus introduced following a years-long process \nthat engaged parents, community members, students, \nteachers, and staff.  \n24. In the spring of 2022, MCPS initiated the \nprocedures outlined in MCPS Regulation IIB-RA to \nevaluate potential new instructional materials that \nwould be more inclusive of LGBTQ people.  \n25. Pursuant \nto \nthis \nprocess, \na \ncommittee \ncomprised of four reading specialists and two \ninstructional specialists participated in two rounds of \nevaluations of potential instructional materials.  \n26. The committee recommended approval of the \nLGBTQ-Inclusive Books after finding that the books \nsupported MCPS content standards and performance \n603a\n\n \n \nindicators, contained narratives and illustrations that \nwould be accessible and engaging to students, and \nfeatured characters of diverse backgrounds whose \nstories and families students could relate to.  The \ncommittee also reviewed a number of books that it \ndecided not to recommend for instructional use.  \nE. MCPS \nIntroduces \nThe \nLGBTQ-Inclusive \nBooks As Part Of The Curriculum  \n27. MCPS introduced the books as part of the preK-\n12 English Language Arts curriculum in the 2022-\n2023 school year.  The list of LGBTQ-Inclusive Books \nincludes 13 books, recommended by grade level.  A list \nof these books with accompanying summaries is \navailable \non \nthe \nMCPS \nwebsite \nat \nhttps://www2.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/curriculum/ \noffice/inclusive-resources.  \n28. Over the summer, MCPS prepared principals \nand teachers for the introduction of these books.  \nMCPS sent an email update to principals about the \nupcoming book arrivals and a professional learning for \nreading specialists that was set to take place in \nOctober.  MCPS also offered an optional professional \ndevelopment for reading specialists, counselors, and \nmedia specialists.  More than 130 participants \nengaged in a session about using the LGBTQ-Inclusive \nBooks as part of the English Language Arts \nCurriculum.   \n29. The \nMCPS \nOffice \nof \nCurriculum \nand \nInstructional Programs suggested that teachers \nincorporate the new texts into the curriculum in the \nsame way that other books are used, namely, to put \nthem on a shelf for students to find on their own; to \nrecommend a book to a student who would enjoy it; to \n604a\n\n \n \noffer the books as an option for literature circles, book \nclubs, or paired reading groups; or to use them as a \nread aloud.  \n30. In communications with schools, MCPS made \nclear that there is no planned explicit instruction on \ngender identity and sexual orientation in elementary \nschool, and that no student or adult is asked to change \nhow they feel about these issues.  Instead, like other \nbooks in the English Language Arts Curriculum, the \nnewly approved books are used to assist students with \nmastering reading concepts like answering questions \nabout \ncharacters, \nretelling \nkey \nevents \nabout \ncharacters in a story, and drawing inferences about \nstory characters based on their actions.    \n31. As with all curriculum resources, there is an \nexpectation that teachers use the LGBTQ-Inclusive \nBooks as part of instruction.  Teachers have a choice \nregarding which MCPSapproved materials to use and \nwhen to use them throughout each unit.  While the \nLGBTQInclusive Books include one suggested book \nper grade level, teachers can choose among the texts, \nand are not limited to a single book corresponding to \ntheir grade level.  Teachers cannot, however, elect not \nto use the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books at all.  This reflects \nMCPS\u2019s view that, if these instructional materials are \nnot used at all, a teacher is not fulfilling MCPS\u2019s \nexpectation that students will be taught pursuant to a \nrepresentative and culturally responsive curriculum.  \nF. The Board Announces That Parents Cannot \nOpt Their Children Out Of Classroom \nInstruction Using The Books For Any Reason  \n32. During the 2022-2023 school year, MCPS\u2019s \nGuidelines for Religious Diversity provided that \n605a\n\n \n \n\u201c[w]hen possible, schools should try to make \nreasonable \nand \nfeasible \nadjustments \nto \nthe \ninstructional program to accommodate requests from \nstudents, or requests from parents/guardians on \nbehalf of their students, to be excused from specific \nclassroom discussions or activities that they believe \nwould impose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs,\u201d or \u201cwould invade student privacy by calling \nattention to the student\u2019s religion.\u201d  The Guidelines \nfurther provided that \u201c[w]hen a student is excused \nfrom the classroom activity, the student will be \nprovided with an alternative to the school activity or \nassignment,\u201d and that \u201cit may be feasible to \naccommodate objections from students or their \nparents/guardians to a particular reading assignment \non religious grounds by providing an alternative \nselection that meets the same lesson objectives.  \nHowever, if such requests become too frequent or too \nburdensome, the school may refuse to accommodate \nthe requests.\u201d    \n33. At the beginning of the 2022-2023 school year, \nsome parents began contacting individual teachers, \nprincipals, or MCPS staff about the LGBTQ-Inclusive \nBooks.  Some of these parents asked that their \nchildren be excused from classroom instruction using \nthe LGBTQ-Inclusive Books.  \n34. Many of the opt out requests were not religious \nin nature.  Some parents, for instance, expressed their \nopposition to what they believed was an effort to teach \nstudents about sex, to teach students lessons about \nLGBTQ issues, or to use instructional materials that \nwere not age-appropriate.  \n35. In some instances, individual teachers or \nprincipals who fielded these requests sought to \n606a\n\n \n \naccommodate them by telling parents that students \ncould be excused when the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books \nwere read in class.  \n36. In March 2023, MCPS met with a small group \nof principals.  Through these conversations, MCPS \nbecame aware that individual principals and teachers \ncould not accommodate the growing number of opt out \nrequests without causing significant disruptions to the \nclassroom environment and undermining MCPS\u2019s \neducational mission.  \n37. Among MCPS\u2019s concerns was high student \nabsenteeism.  In one instance, for example, MCPS \nbecame aware that parents sought to excuse dozens of \nstudents \nin \na \nsingle \nelementary \nschool \nfrom \ninstruction using the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books.  \n38. Another concern was the infeasibility of \ncontinuing to use the LGBTQ-Inclusive texts in \nclassroom instruction while honoring individual opt-\nout requests.  Doing so would not only require teachers \nto track and accommodate opt out requests in their \nclassrooms.  It also would also force media specialists \nand other instructors who spend time in multiple \nclassrooms each day to ensure that they were abiding \nby the accommodations granted to every student they \nencountered across an entire school.  \n39. MCPS moreover determined that allowing opt \nouts from instruction using the LGBTQ-Inclusive \nBooks would defeat its efforts to ensure a classroom \nenvironment that is safe and conducive to learning for \nall students.  MCPS was concerned that, when some \nstudents are permitted to leave the classroom \nwhenever language arts lessons draw on books \nfeaturing LGBTQ characters, students who believe \n607a\n\n \n \nthat the books represent them or their families are \nexposed to social stigma and isolation.  This result \nrisks putting MCPS out of compliance with its \nobligations under state and federal nondiscrimination \nlaws.  MCPS\u2019s interest in compliance with these \nnondiscrimination laws is reflected in Policy ACA, as \nwell as MCPS\u2019s Guidelines for Student Gender \nIdentity.  The 2019-2020 Guidelines for Student \nGender Identity are attached here as Exhibit 6.  \n40. Based on these concerns, MCPS decided that it \nwas not feasible or consistent with MCPS\u2019s curricular \ngoals to accommodate requests for students to be \nexcused from the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books.  \n41. On March 23, 2023, MCPS therefore informed \nparents, teachers, schools, and principals that, moving \nforward, schools could no longer entertain requests for \nstudents to opt out of the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books, for \nany \nreason. \nIf \nschools \nalready \nhad \ngranted \naccommodation \nrequests, \nthose \naccommodations \nwould no longer be provided after the 2022-2023 school \nyear ended. \n42. Under the policy now in effect, MCPS does not \npermit students to be excused from classroom \ninstruction using the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books for any \nreason. Students and families may not choose to opt \nout of engaging with these instructional materials. \n43. MCPS continues to allow families to opt \nstudents out of the Family Life and Human Sexuality \nUnit of Instruction, which is required by Maryland \nlaw, as reflected in COMAR \u00a7 13A.04.18.01. \nI declare under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing is true and correct. \n608a\n\n \n \n \nExecuted on this 12th day of July, 2023. \n/s/ Niki T.

We also offer \nseveral suggestions. We stand ready to collaborate \nwith central office leadership to be thought partners \nin order to ensure that our schools are welcoming, \n614a\n\ninclusive places where students feel physically and \nemotionally safe. \nArienne and I are happy to field any questions you \nmay have. \nI hope each of you are able to enjoy a happy and \nhealthy Thanksgiving break! \n \nMichael D. Bayewitz \nChair, Elementary Chapter, MCAAP \nPrincipal, Cloverly Elementary School \n \n[ATTACHMENT] \nPrincipals support the desire for all students to see \nthemselves and their families in their literature. We \nvalue all stakeholders and strive for our school \ncommunities to be inclusive and value diversity. \nPrincipals also share Dr. McKnight\u2019s interest in \nrebuilding trust with our community. To achieve these \ngoals, we must strive for clear communication and full \ntransparency with all stakeholders. \nIt is within this context that we share the following \nconcerns \naround \nthe \nrecent \ndistribution, \ncommunication, and messaging around the LGBTQ+ \nsupplemental books and materials. \n1. Communication \nRegarding \nIntent \nof \nMaterials \nCentral office leaders have communicated to \nprincipals that the purpose of the materials is \nto portray and represent LGBTQ+ characters in \nliterature, for students to be able to see \nthemselves and/or family in their learning, and \nto \npromote \ninclusivity; \nit \nhas \nbeen \n615a\n\ncommunicated that MCPS is not teaching about \nsexual orientation and gender identity as stand \nalone concepts in elementary school. However, \nseveral of the books and supporting documents \nseemingly contradict this message. (See item \n#7). Principals are requesting a clear and \ntransparent message from MCPS to families \nabout the intent and purpose of these books, as \nwell as a draft message principals could utilize \nafter the system-wide communication. \n2. Appropriateness of Materials \nNumerous concerns have been raised by \nprincipals, teachers, and community members \nthat the content of the books does not align with \nthe stated messages. There are concerns that \nthe plot of some of the books center around \nsexual orientation and gender identity. There \nare concerns that some of the books are not \nappropriate for the intended age group, or in \none case, not appropriate at all for young \nstudents. Specific concerns raised include: \n\u2022 Pride Puppy (Pre-K)- Depicts a \u201cqueen\u201d, \n(drag queen in glossary). \n\u2022 Uncle Bobby\u2019s Wedding (K)- No concerns \nshared Intersection Allies- (Gr. 1)- No \nconcerns shared about content, but the text \nis too difficult and unengaging for first grade \nstudents. \n\u2022 My Rainbow (Gr. 2)- The plot is about an \nAfrican American autistic girl who comes to \nunderstand she identifies transgender. The \nwords transgender and cisgender are used \nbut not explained. \n616a\n\n\u2022 Prince and Knight (Gr.3)- The plot is about a \nprince searching for a bride and who falls in \nlove with a knight. \n\u2022 Love, Violet (Gr. 4)- The plot is about a young \nschool-age girl who falls in love with another \ngirl in her class. It is problematic to portray \nelementary school age children falling in \nlove with other children, regardless of sexual \npreferences. \n\u2022 Born Ready: True Story of a Boy Named \nPenelope (Gr. 5)- The plot is about a girl who \nidentifies as a boy. \nPrincipals are requesting that MCPS consider \nother titles that more closely align to the \ncommunicated intent of the materials. \n3. If Materials are Mandatory or Optional \nMCPS has stated publicly that these are \noptional \nmaterials. \nThis \nstance \nplaces \nprincipals \n(and \nleadership \nteams) \nin \na \npotentially polarizing position of having to \ndecide whether to use the materials. In many \nschools that we have spoken with, there have \nbeen parents who have already vehemently \nexpressed their desire for their child to be \nremoved from the classroom during any lessons \nsurrounding \ngender \nidentity, \nsexual \norientation, or LGBTQ+ related content. Other \nparent groups have shared their strong support \nfor the materials to be used. If this is a school \nby school, or teacher by teacher decision, this \nwill significantly damage school-community \nrelationships. \n617a\n\n4.  Opt-Out Option \nMCPS has stated publicly that there is no \noption to opt-out, with the rationale that MCPS \nis simply providing books about inclusion of \nLGBTQ+ characters and inclusivity. However, \ndue to the concerns shared earlier about the plot \nand nature of the books, this creates a \nsignificant concern by some parents about \n\u201cindoctrination\u201d or \u201chidden agendas.\u201d \n5.  Teacher Training \nTeachers have not been trained on the use of \nthese materials and subsequent questions, \nconversations, and class discussions that may \noccur. Some teachers have shared their \ndiscomfort about the content, the terminology, \nand \nthe \nappropriateness \nof \nthe \nbooks \ndevelopmentally as well as from a sexual \neducation perspective. For example, family life \nisn\u2019t taught until fifth grade, but a second grade \nbook uses terminology such as cisgender or \ntransgender. \n6.  Process of Selection of Materials \nIt has been shared that these materials went \nthrough the established MCPS process of \nincluding \nmultiple \nstakeholders \nand \ncommunity \ninvolvement \nin \nthe \napproval \nprocess. However, given the sensitive nature of \nthe materials, there needs to be a more robust, \ninclusive, public-facing process that includes \ndeliberate attempts to include administrators, \nteachers, and parents as stakeholders. It is \nespecially important to include communities \n618a\n\nthat represent various perspectives across \nMontgomery County. \n7.  Communication Moving Forward \nBeginning with the materials arrived in schools \nthis summer without clear communication, the \ncommunication around the materials and \nmessaging has been wrought with confusion. \nMoving forward, principals are seeking one \noffice, or one point-person, to be the contact of \ncommunication for principals. \n8.  Supporting Documents Containing Mixed \nMessaging and/or Questionable Content \na.  In \u201cSample Student Call-Ins\u201d document. \nExample provided: \nA Student might say \nsomething like . . . \nWe \ncan \nrespond  \nwith . . . \n\u201cBeing ____________  \n(gay, lesbian, queer, \netc) is wrong and not \nallowed \nin \nmy \nreligion.\u201d \nI understand that is \nwhat you believe, but \nnot everyone believes \nthat.

How do they \nidentify? Are they writing from a place of lived \nexperience(s)?\u201d (Concern: This criterion is \nexclusionary and should not limit possible \nresources that are relevant.) \n\u2022 Does the book promote deep engagement and \nleave \nroom \nfor \ndiscussion \nand \ncurious \nexploration? (Concern: This suggests the \nliterature is designed to spark curiosity about \nthe topic, as opposed to exposure and \ninclusivity). \n620a\n\nc.  \u201cResponding to Caregivers / Community \nQuestions\u201d \nConcern: Throughout this document, many of \nthe \nanswers \nprovided \ncontradict \nthe \noverarching messaging and seem to support the \nexplicit teaching of gender and sexual identify. \n621a\n\nAdding an LGBTQ+ Lens to Our Critical \nSelection Repertoire \n\u2022 Who wrote & illustrated the book?

Whose \nperspective is missing? Whose life experience is \nnot included? How might that impact how the \nstory is received by those whose voices are \npresent and those who are not? \n\u2022 Is this a book that will serve to show students \nthey are accepted in their full humanity, affirm \ntheir lived experiences and support ALL of their \nidentities? Or will it serve to perpetuate bias, \nstereotypes and negative viewpoints? \n\u2022 Are stereotypes reinforced or disrupted? \n\u2022 Is heteronormativity reinforced or disrupted? \n\u2022 Is cisnormativity reinforced or disrupted? \n\u2022 Are \npower \nhierarchies \nthat \nuphold \nthe \ndominant culture reinforced or disrupted? \n\u2022 Is the book structured in a way that assumes \nthe reader\u2019s identities align with dominant \nculture? Is the LGBTQ+ reader \u201cothered\u201d? \n\u2022 Are LGBTQ+ storylines presented in a way that \nframes them as mostly similar to and needing \nto be tolerated by those with dominant culture \nidentities? \n\u2022 Is the book an authentic representation of \nLGBTQ+ individuals as whole people, living \n622a\n\ncomplex lives that do not adhere to dominant \nculture narratives? \n\u2022 Does the book promote deep engagement and \nleave \nroom \nfor \ndiscussion \nand \ncurious \nexploration? \n\u2022 Are the story, characters and illustrations rich \nand fully developed? \nSources: \nEmpowering \nEducators \nGuidebook, \nCritically Analyzing Books for Representation, \nBeyond \nNormalization: \nAn \nAnalysis \nof \nHeteronormativity in Children\u2019s Picture Books, \nMirrors and Windows with Texts and Readers: \nIntersectional Social Justice at Work in the \nClassroom \n623a\n\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \nTAMER MAHMOUD,  \net al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMONIFA B. MCKNIGHT, \nin her official capacity as \nSuperintendent of the \nMontgomery Board of \nEducation, et al., \nDefendants. \nCase No. 8:23-CV-\n01380-TJS \n \nDECLARATION OF \nGRACE \nMORRISON IN \nSUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS\u2019 \nMOTION FOR A \nPRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \nI, Grace Morrison, declare as follows: \n1. My name is Grace Morrison. I am over 21 years \nold and capable of making this declaration pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. I have personal knowledge of all of \nthe contents of this declaration. \n2. I am a board member of Kids First, the Plaintiff \nunincorporated association of parents and teachers \nformed to advocate for the return of parental notice and \nopt-out rights in the Montgomery County Public \nSchools. \n3. My husband and I reside in Montgomery \nCounty, Maryland. Our youngest child was adopted as \nan infant from Ukraine. She is now 10 years old and \nhas Down Syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder. \nShe has been in the Montgomery County Schools since \nshe was 3 years old. She is currently enrolled in the \nLearning for Independence Program in a Montgomery \nCounty Public School. She has an IEP and her \nadvanced needs qualify her for a full time, one-on-one \n624a\n\nparaeducator. She also receives special services in the \nschool such as speech therapy and occupational \ntherapy. \n4. My husband and I adhere to the Roman Catholic \nfaith, including the Church\u2019s teachings on marriage, \nfamily, sex, sexuality, and gender. \n5. As the Catholic Church teaches, we believe that \nmarriage is the lifelong union of one man and one \nwoman\u2014distinct \nfrom \neach \nother, \nwhile \ncomplementary to each other\u2014and that the nature \nand purpose of human sexuality is fulfilled in that \nunion. For these same reasons, we live and teach the \nChurch\u2019s teachings to our children about gender, \nwhich we believe is interwoven with one\u2019s sex, \nsexuality, and the ordering of the male and female \nbodies. \n6. While\u2014as we know first-hand from our \nadoption experience\u2014not every child is raised with a \nmother and a father, every child is created by a mom \nand dad. We believe this is the result of God\u2019s ordering \nof the human species. Our faith motivated us to adopt \nour youngest daughter, to provide her a loving mother \nand father, and to raise her in our Catholic faith\u2014just \nas we have our biological children. \n7. Among other requirements, our sacred obligation \nas parents compels us to form our daughter\u2019s \nunderstanding of what it means to be a woman, to love \nanother person, the nature and purpose of marriage, \nand how to embrace the vocation she is called to by \nGod. \n8. Our religious obligations as our youngest \ndaughter\u2019s parents are pressured by the \u201cPride\u201d \nliterature. In addition to conflicting with our religious \n625a\n\nunderstandings of marriage, sexuality, and gender, it \nis practically impossible for us to contradict that \ninstruction. \n9. Due to her learning challenges, she doesn\u2019t \nunderstand or differentiate instructions from her \nteachers and her parents. In fact, at ten years old, we \nonly recently helped her understand the need to use \nthe girl\u2019s restroom. My husband and I won\u2019t be able to \ncontradict what she hears from teachers. Due to her \nlearning challenges, she will not be able to understand \nhow or why we disagree. \n10. Moreover, because of her needs we do not have \na clear alternative for her education except to remain \nin the public schools. Even if we could afford private \neducation, none of the private school options we are \naware of would be able to keep her instruction at her \ndevelopmental level, even with those school\u2019s best \nefforts and intentions. She would still need to go \noutside any private school for occupational therapy \nand speech therapy. Only the public school system has \nall those resources. \n11. Because of this pressure, I asked my daughter\u2019s \nteacher via email if her class would be reading any of \nthe \u201cPride\u201d literature on May 31, 2023. Had I not \nasked, I would not have known. \n12. My daughter\u2019s teacher told me that the \nliterature would be presented by the librarian on June \n2, and by her teacher on June 5 and 6 in the language \narts class. I inquired about an opt out, and her teacher \nsaid that no opt out was possible. Subsequently, I \nemailed my daughter\u2019s principal to inquire more about \nthe literature. I was told that they adhere to the MCPS \npolicy. I responded that we would not have our \n626a\n\ndaughter attend school at that time, and we kept her \nhome. \n13. Consequently, the School Board\u2019s decision to \ndisallow opt outs from the Pride Storybooks directly \nand significantly burdens the religious obligation of \nme and my husband to instruct our youngest child in \naccordance with the Catholic faith. \n14. By not allowing an opt out, my husband and I \nare forced to place our daughter in a school where she \nwill be taught views on marriage, sexuality, and \ngender that will be practically impossible for us to \ncontradict. We have no other realistic choice but public \nschool. \n15. I declare under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing is true and correct to the best of my \nknowledge. \nExecuted on this 11th day of August, 2023. \n/s/ Grace Morrison \nGrace Morrison \n627a\n\nSample Student Call-Ins  \n(Inspired by Liz Kleinrock) \nA student might \nsay something  \nlike . . . \nWe can respond  \nwith . . . \n\u201cBeing ___________  \n(gay, lesbian, \nqueer, etc) is wrong \nand not allowed in \nmy religion.\u201d \nI understand that is \nwhat you believe, but \nnot everyone believes \nthat. We don\u2019t have to \nunderstand or support \na person\u2019s identity to \ntreat them with \nrespect and kindness. \nSchool is a place where \nwe learn to work \ntogether regardless of \nour differences. In any \ncommunity, we\u2019ll \nalways find people \nwith beliefs different \nfrom our own and that \nis okay--we can still \nshow them respect. \nThey can\u2019t get \nmarried or be a \nfamily, they\u2019re both \nmen. Does that \nmean they\u2019re gay? \nThat\u2019s weird \nWhen people are \nadults they can get \nmarried. Two men who \nlove each other can \ndecide they want to get \nmarried, be a family \nand care for each \nother. There are so \nmany different kinds of \nfamilies and ways to be \n628a\n\na family. Each family \nis special and has ways \nthat they are similar to \nand different from our \nown. \nThe word \u201cgay\u201d \ndescribes people of the \nsame gender who love \neach other. In our \nschool we respect all \npeople so we don\u2019t talk \nabout being \u201cgay\u201d in a \nnegative way like \nsaying it\u2019s \u201cweird.\u201d \nShe can\u2019t like a girl \nlike that, she can \nonly like boys \nbecause she\u2019s a girl. \nDisrupt the either/or \nthinking by saying \nsomething like: \nactually, people of any \ngender can like \nwhoever they like. \nPeople are allowed to \nlike whoever they \nwant. How do you \nthink it would make \n(character\u2019s name) to \nhear you say that? Do \nyou think it\u2019s fair for \npeople to decide for us \nwho we can and can\u2019t \nlike? \nThen, provide an \nexample to counter the \nstatement: \n629a\n\n\u2022 My best friend is a \nwoman and she is \nmarried to another \nwoman. \nThat\u2019s weird. He \ncan\u2019t be a boy if he \nwas born a girl. \n \nWhat\u2019s \ntransgender? \n \nWhat body parts do \nthey have? \nThat comment is \nhurtful; we shouldn\u2019t \nuse negative words to \ntalk about peoples\u2019 \nidentities. Sometimes \nwhen we learn \ninformation that\u2019s \ndifferent from what we \nalways thought, it can \nbe confusing and hard \nto process. \nWhen we\u2019re born, \npeople make a guess \nabout our gender and \nlabel us \u201cboy\u201d or \u201cgirl\u201d \nbased on our body \nparts. Sometimes \nthey\u2019re right and \nsometimes they\u2019re \nwrong. When \nsomeone's transgender, \nthey guessed wrong; \nwhen someone's \ncisgender, they \nguessed right. Our \nbody parts do not \ndecide our gender. Our \ngender comes from our \ninside--we might feel \ndifferent than what \n630a\n\npeople tell us we are. \nWe know ourselves \nbest. When someone \ntells us what their \ngender is, we believe \nthem because they are \nthe experts on \nthemselves. \nIt\u2019s none of our \nbusiness what body \nparts a person has, so \nwe should never ask \nthat question. \nHow can someone \nbe both a boy and a \ngirl or neither? \nThat doesn\u2019t make \nsense \nIt can be confusing to \nlearn something new \nor try to understand \nsomething we\u2019ve never \nfelt or experienced \nbefore. Sometimes \npeople feel like a boy or \na girl, sometimes they \nfeel like both, \nsometimes they feel \nlike neither. We can\u2019t \nreally guess someone\u2019s \ngender based on how \nthey look or act. Not \nassuming people\u2019s \ngender is a way that \nwe can respect one \nanother. \nIs that a boy or a \ngirl? \nWe can't know \nsomeone's gender by \nlooking at them. Also, \n631a\n\nnot everyone is a boy \nor girl. Some people \nidentify with both, \nsometimes one more \nthan the other and \nsometimes neither. I \nknow that we tend to \nlook at someone and \nguess but we actually \nshouldn't do that \nbecause we could be \nguessing incorrectly. \nWhen we meet people, \nthat's something they \nmight share with us, \nbut not always. \nWhen I introduce \nmyself, I say hi my \nname is Mrs. Phillips \nand I use she/her \npronouns. Then I ask, \nwhat's your name? Are \nyou comfortable \nsharing your pronouns \nwith me? This helps \nme respect people's \nidentity because then \nI'm using the right \npronouns when I'm \ntalking about them \nand they're not here. \nFor example, when you \ntell your caregiver \nabout your day you can \n632a\n\nsay, Mrs. Phillips read \na cool book today, she \nsaid it\u2019s her favorite \none. \nStereotypes like: \ndresses are for \ngirls, boys can\u2019t \npaint their nails, \nthose are boy toys, \nthat\u2019s a girl book, \netc. \n \n***a consideration- \nare there items in \nmy learning space \nthat are sorted by \ngender? \nDisrupt the either/or \nthinking by saying \nsomething like people \nof any gender can like \ndresses/nail \npolish/books/toys, etc. \nThose things don\u2019t \nhave a gender and \neveryone is free to like \nwhat they like. Liking \nsomething is often \nbased on our \npersonality and \ninterests and not on \nwhat gender we are. \nHow do you feel when \nyou get to wear the \nclothes you like, read \nwhat you like, play \nwhat you like and \nexpress yourself in the \nways that feel good to \nyou?  Shouldn\u2019t \neveryone be able to do \nthat? \nThen, provide an \nexample to counter the \nstereotype made: \n\u2022 \u201cHarry Styles \nwears dresses.\u201d \n633a\n\n\u2022 Men who paint \ntheir nails \nThat\u2019s so gay \nRegardless of how it\u2019s \nintended, using gay to \ndescribe something \nnegative reflects a long \nhistory of prejudice \nagainst LGBTQ+ \npeople, so please don\u2019t \nuse it in that way. \nThere are so many \ndifferent ways to say \nwhat you mean that \nare not insulting to \nothers. \nYou may not have \nmeant to be hurtful, \nbut when you use the \nword \u2018gay\u2019 in any way \noutside of its \ndefinition, it\u2019s \ndisrespectful. When I \nask you to not use \nexpressions like \u201cthat\u2019s \nso gay,\u201d I\u2019m just trying \nto make you aware \nthat it is hurtful to a \nlot of people. How do \nyou think it would feel \nto hear a word used \nover and over again to \ndescribe something \nnegative when it also \ndescribes who you are? \n634a\n\nWe have all been on \nthe receiving end of an \ninsult and felt its sting, \nso why wouldn\u2019t you \nput a little effort into \navoiding language that \ninsults others, \nespecially when there \nare so many \nalternatives? \n \nSources: \n\u2022 Correcting Kids\u2019 Stereotypes \n\u2022 Responding to Sexism, Homophobia and \nTransphobia: Tips for Parents and Educators \nof Younger Children \n\u2022 Reading the Rainbow \n\u2022 It Feels Good To Be Yourself \n\u2022 Teaching About Gender and Diversity \n\u2022 Welcoming Schools: Responding to Questions \n\u2022 Anti-Bias Education for Young Children and \nOurselves \n\u2022 Gender Spectrum \n635a\n\nResponding to Caregivers/ \nCommunity Questions \nThe purpose of this document is to support educators \nwith responding to caregivers. \nPossible Question: Why should my child learn \nabout gender and sexuality identity at school? \nPossible Response: The learning we\u2019re talking about \nwill happen through exposure to diversified gender \nand sexuality identity representation, not explicit \ninstruction. Students are already learning about \ngender and sexuality identity in myriad ways. For \nexample, when we read a story with mom and dad, a \nPrince kisses a Princess at the end of a fairy tale. \nA School is where children are taught to respect one \nanother and learn to work together regardless of their \ndifferences. Learning about--through exposure to \ndiversified \nrepresentation--gender \ndiversity \nand \nsexuality identity diversity is part of that work. Our \nstudents are growing up in a world that is increasingly \nrecognizing the diversity of gender and sexuality. \nCreating a more tolerant, inclusive, and accepting \nschool environment teaches all children to recognize \nand resist stereotypes. We teach children to stand up \nfor others, resist bullying, and work together. All \nstudents deserve to see themselves in books, including \nstudents who identify as LGBTQ+, come from \nLGBTQ+-headed families, and have family members \nwho are part of the LGBTQ+ community. Inclusive \nbooks support a student\u2019s ability to empathize, \n636a\n\nconnect, and collaborate with diverse peers and \nencourage respect for all. Anti-LGBTQ bias hurts all \nchildren, both those directly affected and those who \nlearn in an atmosphere of fear and tension, afraid to \nexplore their own lives because of worry about \ndisapproval and rejection. LGBTQ+ inclusive books \nbenefit all students by promoting acceptance and \nrespect and teaching them more about the diverse \npeople and families in the world. \nPossible Question: Isn't my child too young to be \nlearning about gender and sexuality identity? \nPossible Response: Children are already learning \nabout it and mostly see \u201cstraight\u201d and \u201ccisgender\u201d \nrepresentations around them. Messages about gender \nare everywhere, and children receive clear messages \nabout the \u201crules\u201d for boys and girls, and the \nconsequences for violating them. By learning about \nthe diversity of gender, children have an opportunity \nto explore a greater range of interests, ideas, and \nactivities. For all children, the pressure of \u201cdoing \ngender correctly\u201d is significantly reduced, creating \nmore space for them to discover new talents and \ninterests. Students of all ages must be given the \nopportunity to learn that the words \u201cgay,\u201d \u201clesbian,\u201d \nand \u201ctransgender\u201d are adjectives that should be used \nwith respect to describing people in their community, \nnot words used in a negative way to hurt, insult, and \ndegrade. Beginning these conversations in elementary \nschool will help young people develop empathy for a \ndiverse group of people and learn about identities that \nmight relate to their families or even themselves. It is \n637a\n\nnever too early for schools to set up a foundation of \nunderstanding and respect. \nPossible Question: Ideas about gender diversity \ngo against the values we are instilling in my \nchild at home. Are you trying to teach my child \nto reject these values? \nPossible Answer: Absolutely not. Our children \nencounter people with different beliefs when they join \nany community. Teaching about LGBTQ+ is not about \nmaking students think a certain way; it is to show that \nthere is no one \u201cright\u201d or \u201cnormal\u201d way to be. \nExpanding our representation shows our LGBTQ+ \ncommunity members that this is a place where they \nare welcome and included. While one aim for learning \nabout diversity is to become more accepting of those \naround us, not everyone will be best friends. That does \nnot mean that they can\u2019t get along and learn together. \nThe purpose of learning about gender and sexuality \nidentity diversity is to demonstrate that children are \nunique and that there is no single way to be a boy, girl, \nor any other gender. If a child does not agree with or \nunderstand another student\u2019s gender identity or \nexpression or their sexuality identity, they do not have \nto change how they feel about it. However, they do not \nget to make fun of, harass, harm, or ignore the \nexistence of other students whose gender identity or \nexpression or sexuality identity they don\u2019t understand \nor support. Gender and sexuality identity inclusive \neducation is about teaching students to live and work \nwith others. You do not need to fully understand \n638a\n\nanother \nperson\u2019s \nexperience \nto \ntreat \nthem \nappropriately. It comes down to the simple agreement \nthat all children must be treated with kindness and \nrespect. \nTeaching \nLGBTQ+ \ninclusive \nbooks \nacknowledges the reality that many students come \nfrom LGBTQ+-headed families, have family members \nthat are part of the LGBTQ+ community, are being \ntaught by LGBTQ+ educators, and are, increasingly, \nidentifying \nas \nLGBTQ+ \nthemselves, \neven \nin \nelementary school. \nPossible Question: Can I keep my child home \nwhen students are learning about LGBTQ+ \ntopics? \nPossible Answer: As part of MCPSs commitment to \nequity and our school's mission, we are working \ntowards cultivating inclusive environments for all of \nour students and their families. Part of how we do this \nis \nthrough \ndiversifying \nrepresentation \nin \nthe \ncurriculum; expanding our representation shows our \nLGBTQ+ community members that this is a place \nwhere they are welcome and included. All students \ndeserve to see themselves in their school and \nclassroom, including students who identify as \nLGBTQ+, come from LGBTQ+-headed families, and \nhave family members who are part of the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. While there are no planned explicit \nlessons related to gender and sexuality, students will \nsee these identities embedded in our curriculum and \nlearning environment. Explicit instruction involves \n639a\n\nteaching a specific concept or procedure in a highly \nstructured and carefully sequenced manner where \nthere is an opportunity to model, coach and apply the \nlearning. \nThe concepts or terms that relate to \ngender and sexual identity are not taught explicitly, \nbut there may be a need to define words that are new \nand unfamiliar to students. This is not explicit \ninstruction; for students for whom some of these \nidentities are new, questions and conversations might \norganically happen. \nInclusive curricula support students\u2019 ability to \nempathize, connect, and collaborate with diverse peers \nand encourage respect for all. No child who does not \nagree with or understand another student\u2019s gender, \nexpression, or their sexual identity is asked to change \nhow they feel about it. Parents always have the choice \nto keep their student(s) home while using these texts; \nhowever, it will not be an excused absence. \nPossible Question: Are these books appropriate? \nWhat place do they have in the classroom? \nPossible \nAnswer: \nOur \nBoard \nPolicy \nstates, \n\u201cInstructional materials used in MCPS schools will \nreflect the diversity of the global community, the \naspirations, issues, and achievements of women, \npersons with disabilities, persons from diverse racial, \nethnic, and cultural backgrounds, as well as persons \nof diverse gender identity, gender expression, or \nsexual orientation.\u201d Additionally, two of the goals of \nthe MCPS guidelines are: \u201cReduce stigmatization and \nmarginalization \nof \ntransgender \nand \ngender \n640a\n\nnonconforming students and Foster social integration \nand cultural inclusiveness of transgender and gender \nnonconforming students.\u201d These books are a way for \nus to actualize the policy and gender identity \nguidelines. \nThese books have undergone a rigorous evaluation \nprocess conducted by a group of school-based and \ncentral office-based staff members, and are approved \nas instructional materials. All of the content within \nthem is age and developmentally-appropriate. The \ntexts are directly connected to language arts \nstandards and CASEL competencies, used for social \nand emotional learning lessons. \nSources: Responding to Concerns: Teaching About \nGender, Developing LGBTQ+ Inclusive Resources, \nReading the Rainbow \n \n641a\n\nExcerpts from Transcript of  \nPreliminary Injunction Hearing \nMahmoud v.

I don\u2019t dispute that \nthere will be discussion that ensues. In fact, I think \neveryone would hope that discussion ensues. There is \nno evidence, however\u2014 and that\u2019s sort of (1)(A)\u2014 that \nthere would be anything derisive, or derogatory, or \nimpugning anyone\u2019s religious faith, or that anyone \nwould be punished for expressions of religious faith or \nbeliefs rooted in religious faith as part of that \ndiscussion. \nI\u2019ll also make the second point, which is, none of the \ndeclarations complains about some sort of discussion \nor anything that happened in those discussions. Each \n642a\n\nof the declarations is specific, that their complaint is \nabout exposure to the text in the classroom. \n* \n* \n* \n[TR. PAGE 58-59] \n* \n* \n* \nTHE COURT: One thing the plaintiffs argue\u2014 and it \nwasn\u2019t raised here, but it\u2019s in their declaration\u2014 is \nthat they don\u2019t want to have those discussions so early, \nthat they\u2019re being forced now to have those discussions \nto preempt and defuse what they believe is \ninformation that conflicts with their religion. \nMR. SCHOENFELD: I understand that. And you \nknow, age-appropriateness of curriculum is a choice \nthat school districts always have to make. And this \nwas the same issue that was raised in Parker. Once \nprofessional educators make a decision to include this \nin the curriculum, the question\u2014 and it may be a good \ndecision, it may be a bad decision; that\u2019s why public \nschool boards are democratically elected, and that\u2019s \nwhy school board meetings are open to the public, and \nthat\u2019s why the process for selecting these texts is \nmeant to be open and participatory, as it was here. \nThe question before the Court, and the challenging \none, is whether there\u2019s a free exercise claim to \nincluding age-inappropriate\u2014 or that some would \nclaim are age-inappropriate texts; the answer is no. \nSome principals may take that view, some teachers \nmay take that view. The question before the Court is \nwhether it violates someone\u2019s free exercise rights to \nhave their child exposed to that and have them come \nhome asking certain questions. \n643a\n\nSeptember 29, 2023 \nVIA CM/ECF \nNwamaka C.

Mrs. Morrison is on the \nBoard of Directors for Plaintiff-Appellant Kids First. \nShe and her husband have a ten-year-old daughter \nwith Down Syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder. \nTheir daughter has been in the Montgomery County \nSchools since age three. Because of her special needs, \nshe qualifies for a full-time, one-on-one paraeducator \nand other special services including speech and \noccupational therapy.  \nBelow, Mrs. Morrison testified that she and her \nhusband are religiously obligated to shield their \ndaughter from instruction that conflicts with their \nbeliefs regarding marriage, sexuality, and gender. \nMeeting this obligation is critical for their daughter \nbecause she is especially impressionable and unable to \n644a\n\ndistinguish instruction from her teachers and parents. \nShe would not be able to understand why or how her \nparents disagree with her teacher. \nBecause of their daughter\u2019s special needs, the \nMorrisons have no realistic choice besides public school \nfor fully meeting their daughter\u2019s needs. Following the \ntrial court\u2019s order denying a preliminary injunction, \nMrs. Morrison raised her concerns with her daughter\u2019s \nteacher and principal. The principal responded that the \nassistant superintendent would not allow her to inform \nMrs. Morrison when the Pride Storybooks would be \nread, but would allow her to \u201cpre-teach\u201d the materials \nto her daughter. \nBecause of the school\u2019s unwillingness, the Morrisons \nhave made the difficult decision to remove their \ndaughter from public school and teach her at home. \nThis comes at significant cost. The Morrisons anticipate \nthey will need approximately $25,000 yearly to try \nreplacing the services available in the public school. \nThe Morrisons are concerned that homeschooling may \nnot be successful for their daughter, but they have no \nchoice considering the School Board\u2019s decision to \nremove the notice and opt-out rights previously \navailable. \nAs a board member of Kids First, Mrs. Morrison is \naware of many families being forced to make similarly \ndifficult decisions at significant expense. For these \nreasons, even with an expedited schedule for appeal, an \ninjunction pending appeal is necessary. \nSincerely, \n/s/ Eric S. Baxter\nEric S. Baxter\nWilliam J. Haun \nMichael J.

My name is Grace Morrison. I am over 21 years \nold and capable of making this declaration pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. I have personal knowledge of all of \nthe contents of this declaration. \n2. I am a board member of Kids First, the Plaintiff \nunincorporated association of parents and teachers \nformed to advocate for the return of parental notice \nand opt-out rights in the Montgomery County Public \nSchools. \n3. I previously submitted in this matter the \ndeclaration attached as Exhibit 1. \n4. Since May of this year, my husband and I have \nbeen in touch with our daughter\u2019s teacher and \nprincipal about any instructional materials involving \nhuman sexuality, family, and gender ideology that \n647a\n\nmay be presented in our daughter\u2019s Language Arts \nclass. \n5. We are concerned that premature exposure to \nsuch materials poses a threat to our daughter\u2019s \npsychological, spiritual, and possibly physical well-\nbeing\u2014a threat exacerbated by our daughter\u2019s Down \nSyndrome and attention deficit disorder, which impair \nher ability to make independent judgments. \n6. We recently asked our daughter\u2019s teacher and \nprincipal whether, if we inquired on perhaps a \nquarterly basis, we could be given a schedule of the \ncurriculum layout so we could know when the \nmaterials were being presented. \n7. Unfortunately, \nwe \nwere \ninformed \nthat\u2014\naccording to the assistant superintendent\u2014this would \nnot be possible and instead we could only be permitted \nto review the books to be presented so we could \u201cpre-\nteach\u201d them to our daughter. \n8. Reviewing the materials made it even more \nclear to us that they are inappropriate for our \ndaughter at this stage of her development. \n9. Because of her special needs, our daughter \nqualifies for extensive services in the public schools, \nincluding a full-time, one-on-one paraeducator and \nspeech and occupational therapy. \n10. We cannot realistically replicate these services, \nbut because of Montgomery County\u2019s unwillingness to \naccommodate our religious concerns, we have made \nthe difficult choice to remove our daughter from public \nschool and educate her at home. Attached as Exhibit 2 \nis an email I wrote to school administrators explaining \nthis decision. \n648a\n\n11. We anticipate it costing at least $15,000 a year \nto replace our daughter\u2019s therapy and $10,000 a year \nfor the academic services and supplies that our \ndaughter receives in the public schools. \n12. We are concerned that homeschooling may not \nbe successful for our daughter, but we feel compelled \nto protect her from information that may confuse her \non issues of family life, gender, and sexuality. \n13. As a board member of Kids First, I am aware of \nmany other families being forced to make similarly \ndifficult decisions at significant potential expense. \n14. I declare under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing is true and correct to the best of my \nknowledge. \nExecuted on this 29th day of September, 2023. \n/s/ Grace Morrison \nGrace Morrison \n \n \n649a\n\nEXHIBIT 1 \nto \nSecond Declaration of Grace Morrison \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE DISTRICT OF MARYLAND \nTAMER \nMAHMOUD,  \net al., \nPlaintiffs, \nv. \nMONIFA B. MCKNIGHT, \nin her official capacity as \nSuperintendent \nof \nthe \nMontgomery \nBoard \nof \nEducation, et al., \nDefendants. \nCase No. 8:23-CV-\n01380-TJS \n \nDECLARATION OF \nGRACE \nMORRISON IN \nSUPPORT OF \nPLAINTIFFS\u2019 \nMOTION FOR A \nPRELIMINARY \nINJUNCTION \nI, Grace Morrison, declare as follows: \n1. My name is Grace Morrison. I am over 21 years \nold and capable of making this declaration pursuant to \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1746. I have personal knowledge of all of \nthe contents of this declaration. \n2. I am a board member of Kids First, the Plaintiff \nunincorporated association of parents and teachers \nformed to advocate for the return of parental notice and \nopt-out rights in the Montgomery County Public \nSchools. \n3. My husband and I reside in Montgomery \nCounty, Maryland. Our youngest child was adopted as \nan infant from Ukraine. She is now 10 years old and \nhas Down Syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder. \nShe has been in the Montgomery County Schools since \n650a\n\nshe was 3 years old. She is currently enrolled in the \nLearning for Independence Program in a Montgomery \nCounty Public School. She has an IEP and her \nadvanced needs qualify her for a full time, one-on-one \nparaeducator. She also receives special services in the \nschool such as speech therapy and occupational \ntherapy. \n4. My husband and I adhere to the Roman Catholic \nfaith, including the Church\u2019s teachings on marriage, \nfamily, sex, sexuality, and gender. \n5. As the Catholic Church teaches, we believe that \nmarriage is the lifelong union of one man and one \nwoman\u2014distinct \nfrom \neach \nother, \nwhile \ncomplementary to each other\u2014and that the nature \nand purpose of human sexuality is fulfilled in that \nunion. For these same reasons, we live and teach the \nChurch\u2019s teachings to our children about gender, \nwhich we believe is interwoven with one\u2019s sex, \nsexuality, and the ordering of the male and female \nbodies. \n6. While\u2014as we know first-hand from our \nadoption experience\u2014not every child is raised with a \nmother and a father, every child is created by a mom \nand dad. We believe this is the result of God\u2019s ordering \nof the human species. Our faith motivated us to adopt \nour youngest daughter, to provide her a loving mother \nand father, and to raise her in our Catholic faith\u2014just \nas we have our biological children. \n7. Among other requirements, our sacred obligation \nas parents compels us to form our daughter\u2019s \nunderstanding of what it means to be a woman, to love \nanother person, the nature and purpose of marriage, \n651a\n\nand how to embrace the vocation she is called to by \nGod. \n8. Our religious obligations as our youngest \ndaughter\u2019s parents are pressured by the \u201cPride\u201d \nliterature. In addition to conflicting with our religious \nunderstandings of marriage, sexuality, and gender, it \nis practically impossible for us to contradict that \ninstruction. \n9. Due to her learning challenges, she doesn\u2019t \nunderstand or differentiate instructions from her \nteachers and her parents. In fact, at ten years old, we \nonly recently helped her understand the need to use \nthe girl\u2019s restroom. My husband and I won\u2019t be able to \ncontradict what she hears from teachers. Due to her \nlearning challenges, she will not be able to understand \nhow or why we disagree. \n10. Moreover, because of her needs we do not have \na clear alternative for her education except to remain \nin the public schools. Even if we could afford private \neducation, none of the private school options we are \naware of would be able to keep her instruction at her \ndevelopmental level, even with those school\u2019s best \nefforts and intentions. She would still need to go \noutside any private school for occupational therapy \nand speech therapy. Only the public school system has \nall those resources. \n11. Because of this pressure, I asked my daughter\u2019s \nteacher via email if her class would be reading any of \nthe \u201cPride\u201d literature on May 31, 2023. Had I not \nasked, I would not have known. \n12. My daughter\u2019s teacher told me that the \nliterature would be presented by the librarian on June \n2, and by her teacher on June 5 and 6 in the language \n652a\n\narts class. I inquired about an opt out, and her teacher \nsaid that no opt out was possible. Subsequently, I \nemailed my daughter\u2019s principal to inquire more about \nthe literature. I was told that they adhere to the MCPS \npolicy. I responded that we would not have our \ndaughter attend school at that time, and we kept her \nhome. \n13. Consequently, the School Board\u2019s decision to \ndisallow opt outs from the Pride Storybooks directly \nand significantly burdens the religious obligation of \nme and my husband to instruct our youngest child in \naccordance with the Catholic faith. \n14. By not allowing an opt out, my husband and I \nare forced to place our daughter in a school where she \nwill be taught views on marriage, sexuality, and \ngender that will be practically impossible for us to \ncontradict. We have no other realistic choice but public \nschool. \n15. I declare under penalty of perjury that the \nforegoing is true and correct to the best of my \nknowledge. \nExecuted on this 11th day of August, 2023. \n/s/ Grace Morrison \nGrace Morrison \n \n \n653a\n\nEXHIBIT 2 \nto \nSecond Declaration of Grace Morrison \n \nFrom: Grace Morrison \n<grace.m.morrison9@gmail.com> \nSent: Wednesday, September 27, 2023 11:28 AM \nTo: REDACTED \nCc: \nREDACTED; \nEric \nBaxter; \nWill \nHaun \nSubject: Student withdrawal from REDACTED \nElementary School \nDear REDACTED and REDACTED, \nIt is with great disappointment that we have decided \nto withdraw our daughter, REDACTED, from the \nLearning for Independence Program at REDACTED \nElementary School, as of October 2, 2023. \nSincer May of 2023, we have been in communication \nwith you because of our deep concern over the \nmaterials involving human sexuality, family, and \ngender ideology (referred to as the Pride Literature) \nbeing presented in our daughter's Language Arts \nclass. We have explained that we feel these materials \nare not developmentally appropriate and they oppose \nour religious beliefs. We recently asked that if we \ninquired on perhaps a quarterly basis, could we be \ngiven \na \nschedule \nof \nthe \ncurriculum \nlayout. \nUnfortunately, we were informed that according to the \nassistant superintendent this is not possible and \ninstead we could only be permitted to review the books \nto be presented so that we could \"pre\u2010teach\" the \nmaterial to our daughter. There was no discussion as \nto how or why this might be helpful, especially in light \nof the concerns that we presented. \n654a\n\nIn order to give the issue our full consideration, we did \nreceive the six books from REDACTED and we, her \nparents, carefully reviewed them. With the books in \nhand it became even more clear that these materials \nare incredibly inappropriate for REDACTED. We feel \nstrongly that she is not developmentally ready to \nprocess the ideas presented and any suggested \ndiscussions to follow. In fact, we feel that they pose a \nthreat to her psychological, spiritual and possibly \nphysical well\u2010being. We are not willing to risk this \nimmediate harm to our child or damage which may not \nmanifest itself until years later, long after her time at \nREDACTED has passed. \nWe are aware that there is a pending court case to \nrestore the parents' right to be notified and to opt\u2010out \nof these materials. However, this process may still \ntake many months to be resolved. Unfortunately, due \nto the school's unwillingness to answer our question as \nto when these materials are scheduled to be presented, \nwe are unable to wait for the courts to make a decision, \nand feel our only option is to withdraw REDACTED \nnow. \nWe are saddened to have come against this barrier to \nour daughter's public school education. As we have \nexpressed many times, we have been tremendously \ngrateful to REDACTED and the many teachers and \nstaff who have devoted themselves in caring for and \neducating REDACTED since she was three years old. \nIt is unjust that our daughter can only continue to \naccess these wonderful teachers and resources in the \npublic schools if we, as parents, are willing to go \nagainst our instincts and give up our parental rights \u2010\n\u2010which we will not do. Instead, we will continue to \nteach our daughter to love every person and to respect \n655a\n\ntheir differences, and present her with life issues when \nwe feel she is ready. \nRespectfully yours, \nGrace and Eric Morrison \n656a\n\n \n5 THINGS TO KNOW \nMCPS \nThursday, March 23 \nRevised Message Regarding the Use of \nInclusive Texts \n1. Revised Message Regarding the Use of \nInclusive Texts \nMCPS expects all classrooms to be inclusive and \nsafe spaces for students, including those who identify \nas LGBTQ+ or have family members in the LGBTQ+ \ncommunity. A broad representation of personal \ncharacteristics within curricular or instructional \nmaterials promotes this desired outcome. Therefore, \nas with all curriculum resources, there is an \nexpectation that teachers utilize these inclusive \nlessons and texts with all students. \nAs is standard practice, when planning for \ninstruction teachers/schools are encouraged to utilize \na variety of resources to continue to promote an \ninclusive environment as outlined in the MCPS Core \nValues and Board Policy. Students and families may \nnot choose to opt out of engaging with any \ninstructional materials, other than \u201cFamily Life and \nHuman Sexuality Unit of Instruction'' which is \nspecifically permitted by Maryland law. As such, \nteachers will not send home letters to inform families \nwhen inclusive books are read in the future. \n*  \n*  \n* \n \n \n657a\n\n \nFox 5 Washington DC \nMCPS revises policy on LGBTQ-friendly books \nMarch 24, 2023 \nBy Stephanie Ramirez \nMONTGOMERY COUNTY, Md.  Third grade parents \nat Damascus Elementary School became frustrated \nwhen they found out their kids were being read an \nLGBTQ-inclusive book. Some allegedly began pulling \ntheir children out of the class. \nThe book, \u201cUncle Bobby\u2019s Wedding,\u201d is about a niece \nconcerned she was going to lose her favorite uncle if he \ngot married. The niece comes to learn she is not losing \na family member, but gaining one. The book also \nincludes the topic of same-sex marriage as Uncle \nBobby marries another man.  \nParents involved in the initial complaint were not \nwilling to interview on-camera. FOX 5 spoke with \nother Montgomery County Public Schools parents on \nthe matter.  \nDanielle Ibarra, while waiting to pick up her child at \nDamascus Elementary School, told FOX 5 she\u2019s \nalready read the book to her other children. \n \n658a\n\n \n\u201cI think religion probably plays a big factor. I guess I\u2019m \njust in the camp of, we\u2019re all in this together \u2013 so we \nshould try to show that to our children too,\u201d Ibarra \nsaid. \n\u201cI\u2019m neither for nor against,\u201d said Shireen Jarrar.  \n\u201cThat\u2019s as long as parents give the green light,\u201d she \nadded. \u201cI want parents to be aware and just to approve \nof it.\u201d \nAfter FOX 5 reached out to MCPS on the Damascus \nElementary School claims, another parent posted to a \npublic forum online that they were upset with a \ndifferent LGBTQ-inclusive book being read at another \nMCPS elementary school. \nThe other book is titled, \u201cPrince and Knight.\u201d It\u2019s about \na prince who finds his significant other: a knight. \nStephanie Pate told FOX 5 she learned about the book \nafter her 8-year-old daughter came home from \nGermantown Elementary School last week, crying.   \n\u201cShe was being called \u201cgay, lesbian.\u201d I reached out to \nthe school and I found out they had ended up reading \na book with two males kissing,\u201d Pate explained.  \nWhen asked why her daughter was being called those \nnames, the mother answered, \u201cI\u2019m not sure, I think it \nwas just kids being kids.\u201d \n\u201cShe came home and asked me why her teacher \nshowed her a book of two guys kissing and then asked \nme what the names meant,\u201d Pate added. \nThe Germantown Elementary School parent claims \nher daughter was bullied and that it turned physical \nwhen another student hit her 8-year-old. Pate also \nsaid she asked her daughter\u2019s school for a list of books \n659a\n\n \nthat will be read to her child \u2013 along with the request \nfor her daughter to opt out if any other LGBTQ-\ninclusive books are read to the class in the future. The \nGermantown Elementary School parent told FOX 5 \nshe was not getting answers. \nPate also used the word \u201cgrooming\u201d in her online post. \nShe said that she does feel the book is opening a door. \nShe also said it\u2019s not that she\u2019s against same-sex \nmarriage, she just wants the option to opt out. \n\u201cMy frustration is, as a parent, I wish they would\u2019ve \nreached out and asked first and let me have that \ndecision,\u201d Pate said. \u201cI just feel like every child is \ndifferent. I think where one 8-year-old could \nunderstand something, maybe a 10-year-old would \nunderstand something, and I think it\u2019s the right of the \nparent to be able to teach that, not the school system.\u201d \nPate said she loves the other two MCPS schools her \nother children are in. However, she\u2019s now considering \nremoving her child from Germantown Elementary \nSchool. \nIt appears some parents were not aware of any \nchanges \nto \nthe \nMCPS \ncurriculum. \nA \nschool \nspokesperson says those changes were announced \nback in January. FOX 5 is told this is one of the \nstatements that went out at the time: \nMCPS is committed to ensuring all students \nand their families see themselves in the \ncurriculum to cultivate an inclusive and \nwelcoming learning environment. These \nbooks \nare \non \nthe \napproved \nlist \nof \nsupplemental materials schools will have \naccess to that align with our goal of \n660a\n\n \nproviding more inclusive texts and resources \nin support of curriculum standards.   \nAs part of MCPS' mission to equity, \n\"instructional materials are chosen to reflect \nthe diversity of our global community, the \naspirations, issues and achievements of \nwomen, persons with disabilities, persons \nfrom diverse, racial, ethnic, and cultural \nbackgrounds, as well as persons of diverse \ngender identity, gender expression, or sexual \norientation.\"  \nAdditionally, two goals of the MCPS gender \nidentity \nguidelines \nare \nto \nreduce \nstigmatization and foster social integration \nand cultural inclusiveness of all students \nand their families in our very diverse \ncommunity. \nThese \npolicies \ninvolved \nextensive \nconversation \nand \ncommunity \ninput. These books are a way to actualize the \npolicy and guidelines and have undergone a \nrigorous evaluation process. All the content \nwithin them is age and developmentally-\nappropriate.   \nThere is a review process for books evaluated as MCPS \n\u201ctextbooks.\u201d A MCPS spokesperson says according \nto Montgomery County Board of Education Policy, a \nfive-person panel of staffers reviews the book. The \nreviews and book information then get posted online \nfor 30 days, so that parents and/or guardians can also \nreview the material and comment before possible \napproval. \nWhat if a parent wants to opt out? Is their only option \nto pull their child from the class? \n661a\n\n \nThe MCPS Spokesperson shared with FOX 5 on \nWednesday, \u201cWhen a teacher selects the curriculum, a \nnotification goes out to parents about the book. If a \nparent chooses to opt out, a teacher can find a \nsubstitute text for that student that supports these \nstandards and aligns with curriculum.\u201d \nOn Thursday, the school district updated its \nmessaging regarding the use of inclusive texts.  \n\u201cMCPS expects all classrooms to be inclusive \nand safe spaces for students, including those \nwho identify as LGBTQ+ or have family \nmembers in the LGBTQ+ community. A \nbroad \nrepresentation \nof \npersonal \ncharacteristics \nwithin \ncurricular \nor \ninstructional \nmaterials \npromotes \nthis \ndesired outcome. Therefore, as with all \ncurriculum resources, there is an expectation \nthat teachers utilize these inclusive lessons \nand texts with all students,\u201d the statement \nreads.  \n\u201cAs is standard practice, when planning for \ninstruction teachers/schools are encouraged \nto utilize a variety of resources to continue to \npromote \nan \ninclusive \nenvironment \nas \noutlined \nin \nthe \nMCPS \nCore \nValues \nand Board Policy. Students and families \nmay not choose to opt out of engaging with \nany instructional materials, other than \n\u2018Family Life and Human Sexuality Unit of \nInstruction\u2019 which is specifically permitted \nby Maryland law.  As such, teachers will not \nsend home letters to inform families when \ninclusive books are read in the future.\u201d \n662a\n\n \nThe school district says it is currently working with its \nprincipals to clarify expectations.  \n*  \n*  \n* \n \n \n663a\n\n \n \nMaryland State Department of Education \nEquity and Excellence \nKaren B.

At the end of the \ncomment period, Maryland State Department of \nEducation (MSDE) staff reviews and summarizes the \npublic comments. Thereafter, MSDE staff will present \na recommendation to the State Board to either: (1) \nadopt the regulation in the form it was proposed; or (2) \nrevise the regulation and adopt it as final because the \nsuggested revision is not a substantive change; or (3) \nrevise the regulation and re-propose it because the \nsuggested revision is a substantive change. At any \ntime during this process, the AELR Committee may \nstop the promulgation process and hold a hearing. \nThereafter, it may recommend to the Governor that \nthe regulation not be adopted as a final regulation or \nthe AELR Committee may release the regulation for \nfinal adoption. \nBACKGROUND: \nOver the last two years, the Maryland State \nDepartment of Education has engaged local school \nsystems, parents, school staff, and other state agencies \nin the development of revised regulations to meet the \nchanging needs of students and local school systems \n(LSSs) in the State.  \n665a\n\n \nThe proposed changes to the regulations are \nsummarized as follows:  \n1.  Adoption of National Standards: A survey of \nMaryland stakeholders confirmed that the \nState should change the health education \nstandards to align with National Health \nEducation standards which are skills-based \nstandards \nrather \nthan \nknowledge-based \nstandards. However, Maryland stakeholders \nindicated that the State should include the core \nconcepts identified by the Center for Disease \nControl and Prevention (CDC). Therefore, \nMaryland \nhas \ncustomized \nthe \nNational \nStandards by adding the core concept topics and \nembedding them into Standard 1.  \n2.  New Special Requirements Section: Legislative \nmandates are grouped into this section, \nincluding requirements for abuse and assault \nprevention, heroin and opioid prevention, and \nconsent education lessons.  \n3.  Inclusive Language: Family Life and Human \nSexuality education is representative of all \nstudents and aligns with the new Educational \nEquity regulations.  \n4.  Contraceptives: This instruction will now begin \nin grade 7 instead of grade 8 with the goal of \naddressing the rise of sexually transmitted \ninfections \n(STIs) \nin \nMaryland \nyouth. \nAdditionally, this shift has the potential of \ndelaying the onset of sexual activity and/or \nincreasing the likelihood of safer sexual \nactivity.  \n666a\n\n \n5.  Approval of Family Life and Human Sexuality \nInstructional \nMaterials: \nThe \nregulation \ncontinues to require stakeholder involvement \nand approval; however, the State does not \nrequire local board of education approval unless \nmandated by LSS approval policies.  \n6.  Disease Prevention: The parent/student opt-out \nis removed as a safety issue. This instruction \nincludes medically accurate information about \ncontact with bodily fluids as a method of \ntransmitting infections.  \n7.  Sexually Transmitted Infections and HIV: After \nextensive consultation with the Maryland \nDepartment of Health, outdated language \nregarding HIV and AIDS has been revised. \nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY: \nThe recommended changes to Maryland\u2019s Health \nEducation regulations are the result of consultation \nwith the Maryland Department of Health regarding \nsexually transmitted infections in Maryland\u2019s youth \nand data regarding the sexual behavior of young \npeople in the state. The proposed amendments \nresulted from stakeholder and LSS input and require \nskills-based health education with an emphasis on \nstudent safety, including mandates in Maryland \nstatute. \nACTION: \nRequest permission to publish the repeal of COMAR \n13A.04.18 \nComprehensive \nHealth \nEducation \ninstructional Programs for Grades Prekindergarten \u2013 \n12 and replace with new COMAR 13A.04.18 \n667a\n\n \nComprehensive \nHealth \nEducation \ninstructional \nPrograms for Grades Prekindergarten \u2013 12.  \nAttachments: \nNEW: COMAR 13A.04.18.01 Comprehensive Health \nEducation \nInstructional \nProgram \nfor \nGrades \nPrekindergarten-12  \nREPEAL: \nCOMAR \n13A.04.18.01 \nComprehensive \nHealth Education Instructional Program for Grades \nPrekindergarten-12 \n668a\n\n2023 2024 \nGuidelines for Respecting Religious Diversity \nin Montgomery County Public Schools \nwww.montgomeryschoolsmd.org \n* \n* \n* \n[PAGES 3-4] \n* \n* \n* \n\u25aa Prayer and Religious Dress \nPrayer at School \nStudents are free to pray and discuss their religious \nviews with other students, as long as these activities \nare voluntary, student initiated, and do not materially \ndisrupt or infringe on classroom instruction, other \nschool activities, or the rights of others. For example, \na student may say a prayer or read religious texts \nbefore a meal or before a test in informal settings, such \nas cafeterias or hallways, to the same extent that \nstudents are permitted to engage in nonreligious \nactivities; or a student athlete may pray before a \ncompetition or after scoring a touchdown or a goal as \nlong as it does not unreasonably delay or disrupt the \ncompetition or interfere with the rights of other \nathletes or spectators. While students may exercise \ntheir right to pray during the school day or at school-\nrelated activities, they may not compel, harass, or \npressure others at school to participate in or listen to \na prayer, sermon, or other religious activity. For \ninstance, student-led prayers broadcast to all classes \nover the school\u2019s public announcement system would \nnot be permissable. \nIf a student requests a quiet place to pray, schools will \nmake a reasonable effort to accommodate the request, \n669a\n\n \n \nprovided that space is available, there is appropriate \nstaff monitoring to ensure student safety, and the \neducational process is not disrupted. This could mean \na quiet space in the media center, an empty classroom, \nor other room. \nStudents and their parents/guardians should expect \nthat MCPS teachers, administrators, and other staff \nwill not organize, lead, initiate, endorse, or actively \nparticipate in student prayers or other student \nreligious activities during school hours or at school-\nsponsored events. MCPS staff may be present during \nstudent prayers or other student-led religious \nactivities only for purposes of monitoring and \nproviding oversight to ensure student and school \nsafety. \nReligious Dress \nStudents have a responsibility to be dressed and \ngroomed for school, in accordance with community \nstandards for dress and grooming and in a manner \nthat is not disruptive to or preclude their participation \nin the learning environment or school activities. \nStudents are permitted to wear scarves, hijabs, \nyarmulkes, patkas, or other clothing or jewelry \nassociated with their religion or containing religious \nmessages, as long as their style of dress is consistent \nwith the following guidelines. Students\u2019 clothing may \nnot\u2014 \n\u2022 endanger or potentially threatens the health \nand/or safety of self or others; \n\u2022 display messages of hate or bias, or depict \ndiscriminatory symbols or images; \n670a\n\n \n \nfail to meet a reasonable requirement of a \ncourse or activity; \n\u2022 be associated with gangs; \n\u2022 be lewd, vulgar, obscene, or revealing or of a \nsexual nature; or \n\u2022 promote sexual activity or tobacco, alcohol, \ncannabis, or other drugs prohibited on MCPS \nproperty as referenced in MCPS Regulation \nIGO-RA, Guidelines for Incidents of Alcohol, \nCannabis, Tobacco, and Other Drug Use \nInvolving Students. \nWhen possible, schools should provide reasonable \naccommodations to students if they (or their parents/ \nguardians on their behalf) request permission to wear \nor not wear certain clothing during physical education \nclass or school-sponsored activities that they perceive \nas inconsistent with their religious beliefs, such as \nmodesty requirements. Such accommodations do not \npreclude a student\u2019s participation in an activity. For \nexample, the Maryland Public Secondary Schools \nAthletics Association allows athletes participating in \ninterscholastic competitions to \u201cwear a head covering, \nwrap, or other required religious garment which is not \nabrasive, hard, or dangerous to any player/others, and \nis attached in such a way that it is unlikely to come off \nduring play.\u201d For other questions regarding athletic \naccommodations, please consult your school athletic \ndirector or the MCPS Athletics Unit. \n\u25aa Religion in the Instructional Program \nReligion in School Assignments \nStudents are free to express religious beliefs or \nnonbelief in school assignments as long as their \n671a\n\n \n \nexpressions are relevant to the topic and meet the \nrequirements of the assignment. In the evaluation of \nschool assignments, teachers will not discriminate \nbased \non \nthe \nreligious \ncontent \nof \nstudents\u2019 \nsubmissions. Schoolwork will be judged by ordinary \nacademic standards and other legitimate educational \ninterests. For example, if an assignment involves \nwriting a poem, the work of a student who submits a \npoem in the form of a prayer (such as a psalm or a \npiyyut) will be evaluated based on academic standards \n(such as literary quality) and neither penalized nor \nrewarded based on the poem\u2019s religious content. \nRequests to be Excused from Instructional \nPrograms for Religious Reasons \nStudents \nmay \nbe \nexcused \nfrom \nnoncurricular \nactivities, such as classroom parties or free-time \nevents that involve materials or practices in conflict \nwith a family\u2019s religious, and/or other, practices. \nHowever, MCPS cannot accommodate requests for \nexemptions from required curricular instruction or the \nuse of curricular instructional materials based on \nreligious, and/or other, objections. \nTeaching About Religion or Religious Holidays \nin Schools \nMCPS believes that schools should develop a climate \nin which children can learn and appreciate cultures \nand heritages different from their own. To this end, \nthe MCPS curriculum recognizes the role of religions \nin literature, history, the humanities, and the arts. \nThe \nMCPS \ncurriculum \nalso \nbuilds \nstudents\u2019 \nunderstanding \nof \nthe \nrelationship \nbetween \ngovernment and religious freedom. Students may \nattend elective classes, when available, on the history \n672a\n\n \n \nor comparative study of religions in which aspects of \nreligion are discussed. \nWhen students are taught about religion, they should \nexpect instructional activities to be fair, objective, and \nnot demean any religious or nonreligious beliefs. \nRespecting students\u2019 differing beliefs is an essential \nelement \nof \na \npluralistic \nsociety. \nClassroom \npresentations by teachers, students, and guest \nspeakers should not proselytize or advocate particular \nreligious viewpoints as superior to other religious or \nnonreligious viewpoints. Students may or may not \nchoose to share their ideas about religious traditions. \nStudents should expect that they will not be asked to \nbe spokespersons or representatives for their religious \ntraditions. Singling out students in this way may \nmake them feel uncomfortable, and one student\u2019s \nreligious experience should never be generalized to an \nentire group. \nAs a teaching aid or resource, schools may use \nreligious symbols in the classroom as examples of \nreligious or cultural heritage. But these teaching aids \nor resources may be displayed only on a short-term \nbasis to accompany appropriate classroom instruction. \nAs part of the educational program, schools may teach \nabout religious holidays in a factual manner. School \nactivities may feature the secular aspects of a holiday, \nbut holiday activities may not involve participation in \na religious practice or event. Students of various \nfaiths, or their parents/guardians, may ask for \nstudents to be excused from certain holiday activities. \nTeachers should work to honor these requests by \nplanning an alternate activity for students who \nrequest one. Even birthdays or other occasions that \n673a\n\n \n \nmany may consider to be secular, such as Halloween \nand Valentine\u2019s Day, may be viewed by others as \nhaving religious overtones. Schools are permitted to \nhave activities around these events\u2014as long as they \nare secular in nature\u2014and may excuse students who \ndo not want to participate. \nReligion in School Assemblies and Concerts \nSpecial school events, assemblies, concerts, and \nprograms must be designed to further a secular and \nobjective program of education and must not focus on \nany one religion or religious observance. For instance, \nreligious music may be performed at a winter concert \nas long as the total effect of the program is \nnonreligious, and secular music is also included as \npart of a balanced and inclusive approach. \nWhen assemblies or programs include student bands \nor other musical groups, students performing in the \nassembly or program may request reasonable \naccommodations if they feel that performing religious \nmusic is inappropriate to their beliefs. In handling \nrequests for accommodations, school staff should \nconsult with the students and their parents/guardians \nand take care to avoid embarrassment to, or coercion \nof, students. \nStudent or guest speakers at assemblies should be \nselected based on neutral and even-handed criteria \nthat neither favor nor disfavor religion. Schools should \nmake appropriate, neutral disclaimers to avoid \nconveying the perception to other students, their \nparents/guardians, or guests that the school endorses \nthe student\u2019s or guest speaker\u2019s viewpoints (whether \nreligious or not). In addition, parents/guardians \nshould expect that age will be a factor in schools\u2019 \n674a\n\n \n \nprogramming for assemblies and other school events \ninvolving religion-related topics or holidays. While \nhigh school students may understand that a school \ndoes not endorse the viewpoints of students or guests \nwho are selected on an even-handed basis to speak, \nmiddle and elementary students are less likely to \nmake this distinction, even if school staff provide \nappropriate disclaimers. \n\u25aa Food and Religious Observance \nReligion-related \nDietary \nRestrictions \nand \nFasting \nStudents, or their parents/guardians, may request \nschools \nto \nmake \nreasonable \nand \nfeasible \naccommodations for a student\u2019s dietary needs, \nincluding religion-related dietary restrictions and \nfasting. The MCPS Division of Food and Nutrition \nServices helps students who have certain dietary \nrestrictions by labeling foods and/or offering a variety \nof choices for breakfast, lunch, and snacks, such as \npork-free options; but schools are not required to \nprepare special foods solely to fulfill a student\u2019s \nparticular \nreligious \nrequirements. \nFor \nmore \ninformation, visit www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/ \ndepartments/ food-and-nutrition/. \n675a",

          "task_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of no specific knowledge about this case. This observation has not introduced new factual evidence, but it has significantly structured my uncertainty. I now understand that the central legal issue is whether the school board's no-opt-out policy constitutes a \"cognizable burden\" on the parents' First Amendment Free Exercise rights. My inquiry is now focused on several key hypotheses and questions:\n-   **Petitioners' Likely Arguments:** I hypothesize the parents' legal strategy will center on precedents that affirm parental rights in education and religious upbringing, such as *Wisconsin v. Yoder* and *Pierce v. Society of Sisters*. They will also likely leverage recent pro-religious-liberty decisions like *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* to argue that the school board's policy is not truly \"neutral and generally applicable\" and should be subject to stricter scrutiny.\n-   **Lower Court Rationale:** A critical piece of information to acquire is the specific legal reasoning used by the district court and the Fourth Circuit to conclude that the parents failed to demonstrate a \"cognizable burden.\" Understanding their analysis is key to predicting whether the Supreme Court will find it flawed.\n-   **Respondent's Defense:** I need to determine the school board's justification for removing the opt-out policy and their legal argument for why this action does not burden religious freedom. The stated reasons (absenteeism, disruption, etc.) will likely form the basis of their claim that the policy serves important state interests.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief state was one of no knowledge about effective SCOTUS prediction strategies. This observation provides a foundational methodology for approaching this type of task. I have learned several key principles:\n-   **Source Prioritization Heuristic:** For understanding a case before the Supreme Court, the *Petition for a Writ of Certiorari* is a high-value initial source. It efficiently provides the petitioner's core legal arguments, their framing of the questions presented, and the key precedents they rely on, simultaneously informing both task-specific knowledge (\u03b8) and the broader legal strategies at play (D).\n-   **Strategic Problem Decomposition:** An effective approach is to explicitly separate the inquiry into two layers: task-specific facts (\u03b8) and general legal principles/judicial trends (D). This organizes the research process and clarifies what kind of information is needed at each stage.\n-   **Judicial Trend Analysis:** Predicting the current Court's behavior requires analyzing its recent decisions, especially those from the current majority. For Free Exercise cases, the pattern of decisions in *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*, *Kennedy v. Bremerton*, and *Carson v. Makin* suggests a strong trend toward favoring religious claimants. This is a powerful predictive heuristic.\n-   **Focus on the Controlling Standard:** A critical strategy in constitutional law cases is to identify the controlling legal test (e.g., the \"burden\" framework from *Employment Division v. Smith*) and assess whether the Court seems inclined to apply, modify, or overturn it. My investigation should focus on signals related to the Court's satisfaction with the current standard for what constitutes a burden on religious exercise."

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has been substantially deepened and specified by this observation. My initial hypothesis that the core issue is the definition of a \"cognizable burden\" on religious exercise is confirmed, and I now have direct access to the lower courts' reasoning on this exact point.\n\n-   **Previous Beliefs (Stable):** The petitioners' arguments will likely rely on precedents like *Yoder* and *Fulton* to argue for parental rights and against a \"neutral and generally applicable\" policy. The respondents' defense will center on the state's interests in running its schools, citing concerns like absenteeism and disruption.\n-   **New Information (Lower Court Rationale):** I have now acquired the specific legal reasoning of the lower courts, which was a key unknown. The \"Petitioners' Appendix\" contains the full opinions. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit, in a 2-1 decision written by Judge Agee, affirmed the district court's denial of a preliminary injunction. The majority's reasoning was heavily conditioned by the procedural posture, emphasizing the \"very high burden required to obtain a preliminary injunction\" and the \"scant record\" at this early stage. They appear to have accepted the school board's characterization that the books are for general reading instruction, not \"explicit instruction on gender identity,\" and that mere exposure to ideas the parents disagree with does not (at this stage) constitute a sufficient burden on their religious freedom.\n-   **New Information (Significant Dissent):** The Fourth Circuit decision was not unanimous. Judge Quattlebaum wrote a dissenting opinion. The existence of a published dissent from a circuit judge is a powerful signal that the legal issues are contentious and debatable. This dissent likely provides a well-reasoned argument in favor of the parents, which could serve as a roadmap for the Supreme Court justices who are inclined to reverse. The 2-1 split significantly increases the perceived \"cert-worthiness\" of the case.\n-   **New Information (Key Factual Details):** The appendix contains the actual evidence, including the text of books like *Pride Puppy!*. The book, intended for pre-K students, uses an alphabet primer format to introduce words associated with a pride parade, such as \"[drag]king,\" \"leather,\" and \"underwear.\" This specific, concrete evidence is much more powerful than abstract descriptions and will likely be a focal point of the petitioners' argument that the content is not religiously neutral.\n-   **New Information (Strength of Opposition):** The affidavit of service and appendix identify the parties' counsel. The petitioners are represented by the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty (Eric S. Baxter, Counsel of Record), a premier religious liberty advocacy firm. The respondents are represented by WilmerHale LLP, an elite national law firm. This indicates both sides have top-tier legal representation and view the case as a high-stakes matter.\n-   **New Information (National Significance):** The appendix lists the numerous amici curiae who filed briefs in the Fourth Circuit. The clear ideological divide is striking: a coalition of 18 states led by Virginia, along with prominent conservative legal scholars (McConnell, Garnett, Laycock) and religious/parental rights groups, support the parents. A coalition of 23 states and D.C. led by Maryland and Massachusetts, along with teachers' unions (NEA), civil rights groups (ACLU, Lambda Legal), and liberal legal scholars, support the school board. This alignment frames the case as a major national dispute over fundamental questions of law and culture, further increasing the likelihood the Supreme Court will grant review.",
          "design_beliefs": "My methodological framework for analyzing SCOTUS cases has been significantly refined and validated by this observation. The initial heuristics have proven effective and can now be made more specific.\n\n-   **Previous Beliefs (Stable):** Decomposing the problem into task-level (\u03b8) and design-level (D) beliefs remains a robust strategy. Analyzing judicial trends (e.g., the Roberts Court's pro-religious-liberty rulings) and focusing on the controlling legal standard (the \"burden\" test) are still central to the prediction task.\n-   **Refined Heuristic (Source Prioritization):** My initial heuristic to prioritize the *Petition for a Writ of Certiorari* is now refined. The **Appendix to the Petition** is an even higher-value initial source. While the petition itself contains advocacy and framing, the appendix provides the objective legal record: the lower court opinions, key orders, and foundational evidence. **Updated Heuristic:** When a case is at the cert stage, locate and analyze the appendix first to understand the undisputed history and the precise reasoning of the lower courts before analyzing the parties' arguments about that record.\n-   **New Heuristic (Identifying \"Cert-Worthy\" Signals):** This observation has provided several concrete signals that increase the probability of the Supreme Court granting certiorari:\n    1.  **Dissent in the Court Below:** A published dissent in the circuit court (like Judge Quattlebaum's) is a strong indicator of a deep, well-reasoned legal disagreement, making the case attractive for Supreme Court review.\n    2.  **Ideologically Aligned Amici:** A large number of amici, especially when they include numerous states and prominent advocacy groups on both sides of an ideological divide, signals that the case has broad national importance and that its resolution is eagerly sought by major stakeholders.\n    3.  **Elite Counsel:** Representation by specialized, high-profile counsel (like the Becket Fund and WilmerHale) ensures the legal arguments will be presented at the highest level of quality, making the case a good vehicle for the Court to address complex legal questions.\n-   **New Heuristic (The Importance of Procedural Posture):** The Fourth Circuit's heavy reliance on the \"preliminary injunction\" standard is a critical piece of meta-information. A lower court decision that turns on a high procedural bar and a \"scant record\" is more vulnerable to reversal than a decision on a fully developed record. The Supreme Court may be more inclined to rule that the lower court applied the wrong legal *standard* at that early stage, rather than waiting for a full trial. This is a key strategic angle for the petitioners and a crucial point of analysis for predicting the outcome."

          "task_beliefs": "This observation was an internal reflection on the agent's strategy and did not introduce new factual or legal information about the *Mahmoud v. Taylor* case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs remain stable, but the observation has clarified the next most important piece of information to acquire. My current understanding, built from previous observations, is as follows:\n\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Core Conflict):** The case hinges on whether the school board's policy of compelling participation in lessons with LGBTQ-inclusive books, without notice or opt-out, constitutes a \"cognizable burden\" on the parents' First Amendment right to free exercise of religion. The petitioners will argue for a broad interpretation of this burden, citing precedents like *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, while the respondents will argue for the state's compelling interest in education and maintaining a \"neutral and generally applicable\" policy.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Lower Court Rationale):** The Fourth Circuit's 2-1 majority opinion, which affirmed the denial of a preliminary injunction, is a critical piece of the record. Their reasoning was heavily dependent on the high procedural standard for an injunction and the \"scant record\" at this early stage. They concluded that \"mere exposure\" to ideas that contradict the parents' religious beliefs does not, at this procedural juncture, rise to the level of a constitutional burden.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Signals Favoring SCOTUS Review):**\n    *   **Judicial Disagreement:** The presence of a strong, published dissent from Judge Quattlebaum in the Fourth Circuit signals that the legal questions are highly contentious and that there are credible, well-reasoned arguments for the parents' position. This dissent provides a potential blueprint for a majority opinion at the Supreme Court.\n    *   **National Significance:** The case has attracted a massive and ideologically polarized set of amici curiae. Coalitions of states (18 supporting parents, 23+DC supporting the school board), prominent legal scholars, and major advocacy groups (ACLU, NEA vs. religious liberty organizations) have all weighed in, framing this as a major national dispute.\n    *   **High-Quality Advocacy:** Both sides are represented by elite counsel\u2014the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty for the parents and WilmerHale for the school board. This ensures the arguments will be of the highest caliber, making the case an attractive vehicle for the Court to clarify the law.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Key Evidence):** The specific content of the books, such as *Pride Puppy!* introducing terms like \"[drag]king\" and \"leather\" to pre-K students, provides concrete evidence that petitioners will use to argue the curriculum is not religiously neutral and goes beyond simple reading instruction.\n*   **Identified Knowledge Gap:** My understanding of the objective record and the lower court's reasoning is now robust. However, I have not yet analyzed the petitioners' own advocacy. The key missing piece is the *Petition for a Writ of Certiorari* itself, which will detail the specific legal arguments, framing, and questions presented that the petitioners believe warrant the Supreme Court's intervention.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, being a meta-cognitive reflection on the agent's own process, provides a significant update to my design-level beliefs. It validates recent strategic shifts and refines my overall methodology for analyzing cases at the certiorari stage.\n\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Core Framework):** The DBOED framework of separating task-level beliefs (\u03b8) from design-level beliefs (D) continues to be an effective way to structure analysis. Focusing on judicial trends (e.g., the Roberts Court's receptiveness to religious freedom claims) remains a valid high-level heuristic.\n*   **Validated & Refined Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** My previous update established the heuristic of prioritizing the *Appendix to the Petition*. This observation strongly validates that choice, with the agent's internal monologue calling it \"incredibly valuable.\" More importantly, it refines this into a specific sequence:\n    1.  **First, analyze the Appendix:** This provides the objective record\u2014lower court opinions, key orders, and foundational evidence. It allows for an unbiased understanding of the case's history and the precise legal reasoning being challenged.\n    2.  **Second, analyze the Petition for Certiorari:** Armed with the objective record, one can then more critically evaluate the petitioners' arguments, framing, and characterization of the lower court's errors. This sequence prevents the advocate's framing from coloring the initial understanding of the facts and lower court decisions.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (Identifying \"Cert-Worthy\" Signals):** The agent's reflection confirms the high value of the signals identified in the previous step. The explicit mention of the 2-1 split, elite counsel, and extensive amici as key takeaways reinforces the importance of actively searching for these three factors when assessing the likelihood of certiorari being granted:\n    1.  **Dissent in the Court Below**\n    2.  **Ideologically Aligned Amici (especially states)**\n    3.  **Elite/Specialized Counsel**\n*   **Validated Heuristic (The Importance of Procedural Posture):** The agent's continued focus on the \"preliminary injunction\" standard and \"scant record\" confirms that understanding the procedural context is not a minor detail but a central strategic element. A decision based on a high procedural bar is inherently more susceptible to review and reversal on the legal standard itself.\n*   **New Heuristic (The Value of Strategic Pauses):** This `THINK` action itself demonstrates the value of pausing to reflect on the state of knowledge. By explicitly identifying what has been learned and what remains unknown (the petition's arguments), the agent can more effectively direct its next action to the area of highest uncertainty and expected information gain. This validates a meta-strategy of \"assess and target\" within the broader information-gathering plan."

My task-level beliefs about the substance of the case remain entirely stable, but the observation highlights the current obstacle to deepening my analysis.\n\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Core Conflict):** The case remains centered on the conflict between the parents' First Amendment right to the free exercise of religion and the school board's authority to set a curriculum. The key legal question is whether compelling students to attend lessons with LGBTQ-inclusive books, without any notice or opt-out, constitutes a \"cognizable burden\" on the parents' religious freedom. The petitioners will likely rely on precedents like *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, while the school board will argue its policy is \"neutral and generally applicable\" and serves a compelling state interest in public education.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Lower Court Rationale):** My understanding of the Fourth Circuit's 2-1 decision to deny a preliminary injunction is unchanged. The majority's reasoning\u2014that \"mere exposure\" to ideas contradicting religious beliefs does not constitute a constitutional burden, especially given the \"scant record\" at this early procedural stage\u2014remains the central legal finding that the petitioners must overcome.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Signals Favoring SCOTUS Review):** The strong indicators that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari are unaffected by this observation. These include:\n    *   **Judicial Disagreement:** Judge Quattlebaum's forceful dissent provides a ready-made intellectual framework for reversal.\n    *   **National Significance:** The extensive and polarized participation of amici curiae, including 18 states supporting the parents and 23 states plus D.C. supporting the school board, signals the case's importance.\n    *   **Elite Advocacy:** The involvement of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty and WilmerHale ensures high-quality arguments on both sides.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Key Evidence):** The specific content of the \"Storybooks,\" such as *Pride Puppy!* and its introduction of terms like \"[drag]king\" and \"leather\" to very young children, remains a crucial piece of evidence for the petitioners' argument that the curriculum is not religiously neutral.\n*   **Reinforced Knowledge Gap:** The previous step correctly identified that the most critical missing piece of information is the *Petition for a Writ of Certiorari*.

The high-level heuristics of tracking judicial trends (e.g., the Roberts Court's religious liberty jurisprudence) and identifying \"cert-worthy\" signals (dissents, amici, elite counsel) remain valid and central to my methodology.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** The strategic sequence of analyzing the objective record (Appendix) before the advocate's framing (Petition) is still the correct approach. This observation does not invalidate the strategy, but it highlights a flaw in its tactical execution.\n*   **New Heuristic (Tool Fallibility and Search Failure Recovery):** This is the most significant learning from this observation. The `CLOSED_SEARCH` action with highly specific parameters (`search_type: 'docket_files'`, specific `field_filters`) is not perfectly reliable. A \"zero results\" outcome does not necessarily mean the document doesn't exist; it may mean the query was too narrow, the tool's index is incomplete, or the document is named differently. This leads to a new, crucial sub-heuristic:\n    1.  **Initial Search:** Use precise, targeted queries to find a specific document efficiently.\n    2.  **If Failure:** Broaden the search. Remove restrictive filters (like `proceeding_title` or `link_name`) and try more general keyword searches. If that fails, search for all documents on a docket to manually inspect file names.\n    3.  **Conclusion:** This creates a more robust and resilient search protocol that accounts for the imperfections of the available tools.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (The Importance of Procedural Posture):** My continued focus on the \"preliminary injunction\" standard as a key factor remains correct. This observation, by failing to provide the Petition, indirectly reinforces the importance of the lower court opinions, which are currently my best source of information.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (The Value of Strategic Pauses):** The `THINK` action that preceded this failed search was valuable because it correctly identified the next most informative action. The failure of that action now prompts another necessary reflection on *how* to achieve that goal, demonstrating the iterative nature of the \"assess and target\" meta-strategy. The strategy was right, but the tactic needs adjustment."

Yoder recognized \nas \u201cbeyond debate\u201d the First Amendment right of par-\nents \u201cto guide the religious future and education of \ntheir children.\u201d The question here is whether that \nright is infringed when a public school compels ele-\nmentary schoolchildren as young as three to partici-\npate in instruction on gender and sexuality in viola-\ntion of their parents\u2019 religious beliefs\u2014without notify-\ning their parents or allowing them to opt out.  \nTo ask that question is to answer it. Public schools \nhave long recognized the primacy of parents in in-\nstructing their children on sensitive matters of gender \nand sexuality. If public schools have offered such in-\nstruction at all\u2014a recent trend\u2014they have almost \nuniformly notified parents and allowed them to opt \ntheir children out. Respondents here\u2014the Montgom-\nery County Board of Education and its officials (the \nBoard)\u2014were no exception. They long allowed notice \nand opt-outs for any \u201cinstruction related to family life \nand human sexuality,\u201d along with any \u201cclassroom dis-\ncussions or activities that [parents or students] believe \nwould impose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d  \nBut in 2022, the Board introduced a series of con-\ntroversial \u201cLGBTQ-inclusive\u201d storybooks to be read \nand discussed with students in pre-K through fifth \ngrade. When hundreds of parents raised religious ob-\njections, the Board for the first time eliminated notice \nand opt-outs\u2014directing administrators and teachers \nthat parents could no longer be notified when the \nbooks were taught or be allowed to opt their children \nout. The Board\u2019s own documents reveal that its goal in \ncompelling children to participate in this instruction is \n\n2 \n \nto \u201cdisrupt\u201d their \u201ceither/or thinking\u201d on gender and \nsexuality. And the Board concedes that children may \n\u201ccome away from [such] instruction with a new per-\nspective not easily contravened by their parents.\u201d \nYoder forbids this result. Under the Free Exercise \nClause, parents have the right to opt their children out \nof public school instruction that would \u201csubstantially \ninterfere with their religious development.\u201d That test \nis easily met here. No one disputes that gender and \nsexuality are topics of enormous religious importance, \nthat children are uniquely impressionable and vulner-\nable on such matters, and that decisions related to \nthese topics can have life-changing and lifelong im-\npacts. Nor can they dispute that, for elementary school \nchildren in particular, \u201ccomprehensive\u201d sex education \nis a newcomer to public education and has overwhelm-\ningly been structured to facilitate parental choice. As \nin Yoder, this history and tradition compel the conclu-\nsion that forced instruction on such religiously sensi-\ntive matters would \u201csubstantially interfere\u201d with chil-\ndren\u2019s religious formation and their parents\u2019 own reli-\ngious exercise of guiding that development. \nThe Board\u2019s policy separately triggers strict scru-\ntiny because it lacks neutrality and general applicabil-\nity under Lukumi. The program is shot through with \ndiscretionary and ad hoc exemptions that allow stu-\ndents to opt out of various types of instruction, includ-\ning sex education during health class, while forcing \npre-kindergarteners to participate in discussions \nabout sexuality and gender identity during English \nclass. That inexplicable double standard fails general \napplicability. Indeed, the Board\u2019s initial policy allowed \nPetitioners to opt out of LGBTQ-inclusive instruction \nbecause it imposed a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d\u2014effectively \n\n3 \n \nacknowledging that the burden test is met. Amending \nthat policy in response to parents\u2019 religious objections \nfurther evinced a lack of general applicability\u2014and \nnon-neutrality too. When parents protested the policy \nchange, the Board responded with a slew of hateful \ncomments comparing the (religiously and racially di-\nverse) Petitioners to \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d and \u201cxeno-\nphobes.\u201d That is the opposite of government neutrality \ntowards religion. \nThe Board responds that Smith forecloses relief un-\nder Yoder and that any lack of general applicability \nand neutrality under Lukumi is not enough\u2014with \n\u201cenough\u201d being an ever-evolving standard in the lower \ncourts. Under the Board\u2019s view, Petitioners\u2019 right to di-\nrect their children\u2019s religious upbringing ends at the \nschoolhouse doors, with no limit on what their children \nmay be taught within. But if that is what Smith al-\nlows, then Smith is in direct conflict with free-exercise \nguarantees and should be overruled.  \nFinally, although the Fourth Circuit majority did \nnot address whether strict scrutiny is met, the dissent \ndid. This Court should as well. The same history and \ntradition that upholds parents\u2019 control over their chil-\ndren\u2019s sex education forecloses a compelling interest in \nforced instruction on such religiously fraught matters. \nAny contrary answer would break the bond between \nparent and child on matters that strike at the heart of \nparental authority. That is incompatible with the Free \nExercise Clause\u2019s guarantee that parents\u2019 right to con-\ntrol the religious upbringing of their children is \u201cbe-\nyond debate.\u201d  \n\n4 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS  \nAND REGULATIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States Consti-\ntution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe \nfree \nexercise \nthereof  * * *  .\u201d \nU.S. \nConst. \nAmend. I. \nMaryland Code of Regulations 13A.04.18.01(D)(2) \nprovides: \n(e) Student Opt-Out. \n(i) The local school system shall establish policies, \nguidelines, and/or procedures for student opt-out re-\ngarding instruction related to family life and human \nsexuality objectives. \nMaryland Code of Regulations 13A.01.06 provides: \nThe purpose of this chapter is to establish as a mat-\nter of policy and priority that: \n* * * \n.01(B) Each local school system\u2019s procedures and \npractices provide for educational equity and ensure \nthat there are no obstacles to accessing educational op-\nportunities for any student; and \n* * * \n.03(B)(2) \u201cEducational equity\u201d means that every \nstudent has access to the opportunities, resources, and \neducational rigor they need throughout their educa-\n\n5 \n \ntional career to maximize academic success and so-\ncial/emotional well-being and to view each student\u2019s \nindividual characteristics as valuable. \n.03(B)(5) \u201cIndividual characteristics\u201d means the \ncharacteristics of each individual student, which in-\nclude but are not limited to: \n* * *   \n(d) Gender identity and expression; [and] \n* * *   \n(j) Sexual orientation[.] \n \n \n\n6 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. There is a national consensus respecting \nparental control over instruction on \ngender and sexuality. \nMontgomery County, Maryland is the most reli-\ngiously diverse county in the nation.1 For years, the \nBoard honored that diversity by \u201cfollow[ing] the best \nof our traditions\u201d: \u201crespect[ing] the religious nature of \nour people and accommodat[ing] the public service to \ntheir spiritual needs.\u201d Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. \n306, 314 (1952). The Board effectuated that respect \nthrough its Religious Diversity Guidelines (\u201cGuide-\nlines\u201d).  \nThese Guidelines were in place through the end of \nthe 2022-2023 school year. So long as requests did not \nbecome \u201ctoo frequent or too burdensome,\u201d the Guide-\nlines provided opt-outs from any \u201cclassroom discus-\nsions or activities that [parents or students] believe[d] \nwould impose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d Pet.App.221a. Further still, the Guidelines \ncommitted the Board to \u201caccommodate objections from \nstudents or their parents/guardians to a particular \nreading \nassignment \non \nreligious \ngrounds.\u201d \nPet.App.221a. Students could also receive excused ab-\nsences for religious holidays\u2014with a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d \napproach to whether they would have to make up \nmissed assignments. Pet.App.217a. And opt-outs were \nalso allowed from any \u201cactivities\u201d such as \u201cbirthdays,\u201d \n\u201cHalloween\u201d or \u201cValentine\u2019s day\u201d that might be \n\u201cviewed by others as having religious overtones.\u201d \n \n1  \nAleja Hertzler-McCain, Montgomery County, Maryland, was \nmost religiously diverse US county in 2023, Religion News Ser-\nvice, Aug. 30, 2024, https://perma.cc/86PU-3QLA.  \n\n7 \n \nPet.App.223a. Regarding other \u201cinstructional activi-\nties,\u201d the Board\u2019s Guidelines \u201cexpect[ed]\u201d them \u201cto be \nfair, objective, and not demean any religious or nonre-\nligious beliefs.\u201d Pet.App.673a. \nThese Guidelines augmented Maryland law, which \nrequires all local school districts to \u201cestablish policies, \nguidelines, and/or procedures for student opt-out re-\ngarding instruction related to family life and human \nsexuality \nobjectives.\u201d \nMd. \nCode \nRegs. \n\u00a7 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(i). Maryland is not alone in \nthis regard. All fifty states and the District of Colum-\nbia require or permit some aspects of sex education.2 \nAnd 47 states and the District of Columbia allow for \nparental opt-outs\u2014or require parental opt-ins\u2014before \nstudents may participate in sex education.3 Only three \nstates (Delaware and the Dakotas) are silent on the \nmatter. No state has gone so far as to bar opt-outs en-\ntirely.  \nConcern for parental rights is also reflected in the \nintroduction and growth of sex education throughout \nthe United States. Although modern public education \nhas its roots in the nineteenth century, sex education \n \n2  \nPet.6 n.4. \n3  \nOf these jurisdictions, 38 require parental opt-outs. Pet.6 n.5; \nsee also Cal.

Code \u00a7 210:10-2-3(a). \nFour more states go still further, requiring a parental opt-in be-\nfore children receive instruction. Pet.7 n.6. And another six states \nfeature a combination of opt-out and opt-in rights. Pet.7 n.7; see \nalso Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 15-102(A)(4); Ind. Code \u00a7 20-30-5-9(d). \n\n8 \n \nin public schools is a more recent development. Chi-\ncago public schools became \u201cthe first to implement for-\nmal sex education in schools with \u2018personal purity\u2019 \ntalks\u201d in 1913; but that was abandoned following pa-\nrental backlash.4 After World War I, some high schools \nand colleges implemented basic sexual health educa-\ntion focused on \u201csupporting marriage and family.\u201d 5 \nBut public schools did not begin implementing sex ed-\nucation as part of their health curriculum until the \n1970s,6 and sex education extending beyond physiol-\nogy, hygiene, and disease prevention was not formu-\nlated until the 1990s.7 Even today, only three states\u2014\nOregon, California, and Washington8\u2014mandate \u201ccom-\n \n4  \nBrooke D\u2019Amore Bradley, Sex Education after Dobbs: A Case \nfor Comprehensive Sex Education, 39 Berkeley J.

Yoder recognized \nas \u201cbeyond debate\u201d the First Amendment right of par-\nents \u201cto guide the religious future and education of \ntheir children.\u201d The question here is whether that \nright is infringed when a public school compels ele-\nmentary schoolchildren as young as three to partici-\npate in instruction on gender and sexuality in viola-\ntion of their parents\u2019 religious beliefs\u2014without notify-\ning their parents or allowing them to opt out.  \nTo ask that question is to answer it. Public schools \nhave long recognized the primacy of parents in in-\nstructing their children on sensitive matters of gender \nand sexuality. If public schools have offered such in-\nstruction at all\u2014a recent trend\u2014they have almost \nuniformly notified parents and allowed them to opt \ntheir children out. Respondents here\u2014the Montgom-\nery County Board of Education and its officials (the \nBoard)\u2014were no exception. They long allowed notice \nand opt-outs for any \u201cinstruction related to family life \nand human sexuality,\u201d along with any \u201cclassroom dis-\ncussions or activities that [parents or students] believe \nwould impose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d  \nBut in 2022, the Board introduced a series of con-\ntroversial \u201cLGBTQ-inclusive\u201d storybooks to be read \nand discussed with students in pre-K through fifth \ngrade. When hundreds of parents raised religious ob-\njections, the Board for the first time eliminated notice \nand opt-outs\u2014directing administrators and teachers \nthat parents could no longer be notified when the \nbooks were taught or be allowed to opt their children \nout. The Board\u2019s own documents reveal that its goal in \ncompelling children to participate in this instruction is \n\n2 \n \nto \u201cdisrupt\u201d their \u201ceither/or thinking\u201d on gender and \nsexuality. And the Board concedes that children may \n\u201ccome away from [such] instruction with a new per-\nspective not easily contravened by their parents.\u201d \nYoder forbids this result. Under the Free Exercise \nClause, parents have the right to opt their children out \nof public school instruction that would \u201csubstantially \ninterfere with their religious development.\u201d That test \nis easily met here. No one disputes that gender and \nsexuality are topics of enormous religious importance, \nthat children are uniquely impressionable and vulner-\nable on such matters, and that decisions related to \nthese topics can have life-changing and lifelong im-\npacts. Nor can they dispute that, for elementary school \nchildren in particular, \u201ccomprehensive\u201d sex education \nis a newcomer to public education and has overwhelm-\ningly been structured to facilitate parental choice. As \nin Yoder, this history and tradition compel the conclu-\nsion that forced instruction on such religiously sensi-\ntive matters would \u201csubstantially interfere\u201d with chil-\ndren\u2019s religious formation and their parents\u2019 own reli-\ngious exercise of guiding that development. \nThe Board\u2019s policy separately triggers strict scru-\ntiny because it lacks neutrality and general applicabil-\nity under Lukumi. The program is shot through with \ndiscretionary and ad hoc exemptions that allow stu-\ndents to opt out of various types of instruction, includ-\ning sex education during health class, while forcing \npre-kindergarteners to participate in discussions \nabout sexuality and gender identity during English \nclass. That inexplicable double standard fails general \napplicability. Indeed, the Board\u2019s initial policy allowed \nPetitioners to opt out of LGBTQ-inclusive instruction \nbecause it imposed a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d\u2014effectively \n\n3 \n \nacknowledging that the burden test is met. Amending \nthat policy in response to parents\u2019 religious objections \nfurther evinced a lack of general applicability\u2014and \nnon-neutrality too. When parents protested the policy \nchange, the Board responded with a slew of hateful \ncomments comparing the (religiously and racially di-\nverse) Petitioners to \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d and \u201cxeno-\nphobes.\u201d That is the opposite of government neutrality \ntowards religion. \nThe Board responds that Smith forecloses relief un-\nder Yoder and that any lack of general applicability \nand neutrality under Lukumi is not enough\u2014with \n\u201cenough\u201d being an ever-evolving standard in the lower \ncourts. Under the Board\u2019s view, Petitioners\u2019 right to di-\nrect their children\u2019s religious upbringing ends at the \nschoolhouse doors, with no limit on what their children \nmay be taught within. But if that is what Smith al-\nlows, then Smith is in direct conflict with free-exercise \nguarantees and should be overruled.  \nFinally, although the Fourth Circuit majority did \nnot address whether strict scrutiny is met, the dissent \ndid. This Court should as well. The same history and \ntradition that upholds parents\u2019 control over their chil-\ndren\u2019s sex education forecloses a compelling interest in \nforced instruction on such religiously fraught matters. \nAny contrary answer would break the bond between \nparent and child on matters that strike at the heart of \nparental authority. That is incompatible with the Free \nExercise Clause\u2019s guarantee that parents\u2019 right to con-\ntrol the religious upbringing of their children is \u201cbe-\nyond debate.\u201d  \n\n4 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThis Court has jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS  \nAND REGULATIONS INVOLVED \nThe First Amendment to the United States Consti-\ntution provides that \u201cCongress shall make no law re-\nspecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting \nthe \nfree \nexercise \nthereof  * * *  .\u201d \nU.S. \nConst. \nAmend. I. \nMaryland Code of Regulations 13A.04.18.01(D)(2) \nprovides: \n(e) Student Opt-Out. \n(i) The local school system shall establish policies, \nguidelines, and/or procedures for student opt-out re-\ngarding instruction related to family life and human \nsexuality objectives. \nMaryland Code of Regulations 13A.01.06 provides: \nThe purpose of this chapter is to establish as a mat-\nter of policy and priority that: \n* * * \n.01(B) Each local school system\u2019s procedures and \npractices provide for educational equity and ensure \nthat there are no obstacles to accessing educational op-\nportunities for any student; and \n* * * \n.03(B)(2) \u201cEducational equity\u201d means that every \nstudent has access to the opportunities, resources, and \neducational rigor they need throughout their educa-\n\n5 \n \ntional career to maximize academic success and so-\ncial/emotional well-being and to view each student\u2019s \nindividual characteristics as valuable. \n.03(B)(5) \u201cIndividual characteristics\u201d means the \ncharacteristics of each individual student, which in-\nclude but are not limited to: \n* * *   \n(d) Gender identity and expression; [and] \n* * *   \n(j) Sexual orientation[.] \n \n \n\n6 \n \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. There is a national consensus respecting \nparental control over instruction on \ngender and sexuality. \nMontgomery County, Maryland is the most reli-\ngiously diverse county in the nation.1 For years, the \nBoard honored that diversity by \u201cfollow[ing] the best \nof our traditions\u201d: \u201crespect[ing] the religious nature of \nour people and accommodat[ing] the public service to \ntheir spiritual needs.\u201d Zorach v. Clauson, 343 U.S. \n306, 314 (1952). The Board effectuated that respect \nthrough its Religious Diversity Guidelines (\u201cGuide-\nlines\u201d).  \nThese Guidelines were in place through the end of \nthe 2022-2023 school year. So long as requests did not \nbecome \u201ctoo frequent or too burdensome,\u201d the Guide-\nlines provided opt-outs from any \u201cclassroom discus-\nsions or activities that [parents or students] believe[d] \nwould impose a substantial burden on their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d Pet.App.221a. Further still, the Guidelines \ncommitted the Board to \u201caccommodate objections from \nstudents or their parents/guardians to a particular \nreading \nassignment \non \nreligious \ngrounds.\u201d \nPet.App.221a. Students could also receive excused ab-\nsences for religious holidays\u2014with a \u201ccase-by-case\u201d \napproach to whether they would have to make up \nmissed assignments. Pet.App.217a. And opt-outs were \nalso allowed from any \u201cactivities\u201d such as \u201cbirthdays,\u201d \n\u201cHalloween\u201d or \u201cValentine\u2019s day\u201d that might be \n\u201cviewed by others as having religious overtones.\u201d \n \n1  \nAleja Hertzler-McCain, Montgomery County, Maryland, was \nmost religiously diverse US county in 2023, Religion News Ser-\nvice, Aug. 30, 2024, https://perma.cc/86PU-3QLA.  \n\n7 \n \nPet.App.223a. Regarding other \u201cinstructional activi-\nties,\u201d the Board\u2019s Guidelines \u201cexpect[ed]\u201d them \u201cto be \nfair, objective, and not demean any religious or nonre-\nligious beliefs.\u201d Pet.App.673a. \nThese Guidelines augmented Maryland law, which \nrequires all local school districts to \u201cestablish policies, \nguidelines, and/or procedures for student opt-out re-\ngarding instruction related to family life and human \nsexuality \nobjectives.\u201d \nMd. \nCode \nRegs. \n\u00a7 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(i). Maryland is not alone in \nthis regard. All fifty states and the District of Colum-\nbia require or permit some aspects of sex education.2 \nAnd 47 states and the District of Columbia allow for \nparental opt-outs\u2014or require parental opt-ins\u2014before \nstudents may participate in sex education.3 Only three \nstates (Delaware and the Dakotas) are silent on the \nmatter. No state has gone so far as to bar opt-outs en-\ntirely.  \nConcern for parental rights is also reflected in the \nintroduction and growth of sex education throughout \nthe United States. Although modern public education \nhas its roots in the nineteenth century, sex education \n \n2  \nPet.6 n.4. \n3  \nOf these jurisdictions, 38 require parental opt-outs. Pet.6 n.5; \nsee also Cal.

Code \u00a7 210:10-2-3(a). \nFour more states go still further, requiring a parental opt-in be-\nfore children receive instruction. Pet.7 n.6. And another six states \nfeature a combination of opt-out and opt-in rights. Pet.7 n.7; see \nalso Ariz. Rev. Stat. \u00a7 15-102(A)(4); Ind. Code \u00a7 20-30-5-9(d). \n\n8 \n \nin public schools is a more recent development. Chi-\ncago public schools became \u201cthe first to implement for-\nmal sex education in schools with \u2018personal purity\u2019 \ntalks\u201d in 1913; but that was abandoned following pa-\nrental backlash.4 After World War I, some high schools \nand colleges implemented basic sexual health educa-\ntion focused on \u201csupporting marriage and family.\u201d 5 \nBut public schools did not begin implementing sex ed-\nucation as part of their health curriculum until the \n1970s,6 and sex education extending beyond physiol-\nogy, hygiene, and disease prevention was not formu-\nlated until the 1990s.7 Even today, only three states\u2014\nOregon, California, and Washington8\u2014mandate \u201ccom-\n \n4  \nBrooke D\u2019Amore Bradley, Sex Education after Dobbs: A Case \nfor Comprehensive Sex Education, 39 Berkeley J.

Even so, \nlike the long consensus, those states still allow paren-\ntal opt-outs or opt-ins. Giving parents the final say on \nsuch matters is a nationwide tradition. \nB. The Board introduces \u201cLGBTQ-inclusive\u201d \ninstruction. \nIn 2019, Maryland enacted regulations seeking to \npromote \u201ceducational equity,\u201d which it defined as \n\u201cview[ing] each student\u2019s\u201d \u201cgender identity and expres-\nsion,\u201d \u201csexual orientation,\u201d and other specified \u201cindi-\nvidual characteristics as valuable.\u201d Md. Code Regs. \n\u00a7\u00a7 13A.01.06.01(B), 13A.01.06.03(B). As one aspect of \nimplementing this regulation, in November 2022, the \nBoard introduced \u201cLGBTQ-inclusive\u201d storybooks for \ninstructing students in elementary school, along with \ncorresponding guidance for teachers. Pet.App.272a; \nsee also Pet.App.273a-275a. In deciding which books \nto adopt into its curriculum, the Board said it would \nreview options through an \u201cLGBTQ+ Lens\u201d and ask \nwhether books \u201creinforced or disrupted\u201d \u201cstereotypes,\u201d \n\u201ccisnormativity,\u201d \nand \n\u201cpower \nhierarchies.\u201d \nPet.App.622a. \nOne of the selected books, Pride Puppy, is a picture \nbook \ndirected \nat \nthree- \nand \nfour-year-olds. \nPet.App.234a. It describes a Pride parade and what a \nchild might find there. Pet.App.254a-271a.

Pet.App.270a (brackets in original).  \nMy Rainbow, a picture book for all elementary \nages, Pet.App.237a, tells the story of an autistic boy \nwho identifies as a transgender girl. Pet.App.358a-\n389a. When his mother points to her own short hair, \nhe responds: \u201cPeople don\u2019t care if cisgender girls like \nyou have short hair. But it\u2019s different for transgender \ngirls. I need long hair!\u201d Pet.App.371a. The mother de-\ncides that her child knows best and sews him a rain-\nbow-colored wig. Pet.App.382a-385a. \nIntersection Allies is a picture book intended for \n\u201cKindergarten through Grade 5.\u201d Pet.App.236a. It in-\nvites children to ponder what it means to be \n\u201ctransgender\u201d or \u201cnon-binary\u201d and asks \u201c[w]hat pro-\nnouns fit you?\u201d Pet.App.350a.

Teachers are told to frame disagree-\nment with these ideas as \u201churtful,\u201d Pet.App.630a, \n634a, and to counter with examples of \u201c[m]en who \npaint their nails\u201d or \u201cwear[ ] dresses,\u201d Pet.App.633a-\n634a.  \nThe guidance documents also instruct teachers\u2014\ntwice\u2014to \u201c[d]isrupt the either/or thinking\u201d of elemen-\ntary students about biological sex. Pet.App.629a, \n633a. And teachers are instructed not to suggest there \ncould be reasonable disagreement. Rather, they are to \nsay that \u201c[s]ometimes when we learn information \nthat\u2019s different from what we always thought, it can \nbe confusing and hard to process.\u201d Pet.App.630a.  \n\n13 \n \nThe Board\u2019s own elementary school principals ob-\njected to the storybook instruction. Pet.App.614a-\n621a. They expressed concern that the books were \u201cde-\nsigned to spark curiosity about [gender and sexuality], \nas opposed to  * * *  inclusivity.\u201d Pet.App.620a. The \nprincipals also found it \u201cproblematic to portray ele-\nmentary school age children falling in love with other \nchildren, \nregardless \nof \nsexual \npreferences.\u201d \nPet.App.617a. And they further objected that the \nbooks \u201csupport the explicit teaching of gender and sex-\nual identi[t]y\u201d; invite \u201cshaming comment[s]\u201d toward \nstudents who disagree; \u201c[s]tate[ ] as  * * *  fact\u201d things \nthat \u201c[s]ome would not agree\u201d are facts; and are \u201cdis-\nmissive of religious beliefs.\u201d Pet.App.619a-621a. \nThe Board \u201cdo[es]n\u2019t dispute\u201d that at least \u201cone\u201d of \nthe books must be read each year and that \u201cthere will \nbe discussion that ensues.\u201d Pet.App.642a. Rather, \n\u201cthere is an expectation that teachers use the LGBTQ-\nInclusive Books as part of instruction.\u201d Pet.App.605a; \nsee also Pet.App.137a n.12. And the Board acknowl-\nedges that \u201c[a]ny child  * * *  may come away from \n[the storybook] instruction\u201d with \u201ca new perspective \nnot easily contravened by their parents.\u201d J.A.46. As \nstated on a slide presentation about the storybooks, \nthe Board maintains that \u201cEveryone Needs These \nBooks\u201d to combat the \u201cdominance, superiority and en-\ntitlement\u201d of the \u201cdominant culture.\u201d Pet.App.517a. \nC. The Board breaks with the consensus and \nbans notice and opt-outs. \nAfter the Board adopted the storybook lessons in \n2022, it initially honored parental opt-outs in accord-\nance with its own Guidelines and Maryland law. \nPet.App.533a-534a, 540a, \n544a-545a, 185a-187a, \n497a-498a. This reflected the numerous questions and \n\n14 \n \nconcerns parents raised when the storybooks were in-\ntroduced. At public meetings dedicated to discussing \nthe \u201cLGBTQ+ Inclusive Picture Books,\u201d Pet.App.499a, \nparents asked the Board to \u201c[p]lease address how a \nHalloween parade was cancelled because of religious \nor personal beliefs of 25-30 students and how do you \ncompare these topics to that?\u201d Pet.App.504a. Or \nsimply, \u201chow is this appropriate?\u201d Pet.App.504a.  \nOn March 22, 2023, the Board issued a public state-\nment making clear that \u201c[i]f a parent chooses to opt \nout, a teacher can find a substitute text for that  \nstudent \nthat  * * *  aligns \nwith \ncurriculum.\u201d \nPet.App.184a. But the very next day, the Board re-\nversed course. Without explanation, it announced that \nbeginning with the 2023-2024 school year, \u201c[s]tudents \nand families may not choose to opt out\u201d and will not be \ninformed when \u201cbooks are read.\u201d Pet.App.185a, 657a. \nThe statement affirmed, however, that high school \nstudents could continue to opt out of sex education. \nPet.App.185a, 657a. And because of the Religious Di-\nversity Guidelines, students could still opt out of any \nother instruction that \u201cwould impose a substantial \nburden on their religious beliefs.\u201d Pet.App.220a-221a. \nOnly religious objections to the LGBTQ-inclusive in-\nstruction were left unprotected.  \nWithin weeks of the Board\u2019s reversal, over 1,000 \nparents signed a petition asking the Board to restore \ntheir notice and opt-out rights.11 Hundreds of them\u2014\n \n11  Ismail Allison, Over 1,000 Maryland Parents, Community \nMembers Urge MCPS to Restore Curriculum Opt-Out Option and \nParental Notice, Dialogue with Families, Council on American-\nIslamic Relations, Apr. 17, 2023, https://perma.cc/JH3S-LQKG. \n\n15 \n \n\u201clargely  * * *  Muslim and Ethiopian Orthodox par-\nents\u201d\u2014some with their children, crowded into Board \nmeetings to express concern that \u201cthe school system is \nviolating their [First Amendment] rights.\u201d 12  Board \nmembers responded by publicly condemning students \nfor \u201cparroting\u201d their parents\u2019 \u201cdogma,\u201d accusing the \nparents of promoting \u201chate,\u201d and comparing them to \n\u201cwhite \nsupremacists\u201d \nand \n\u201cxenophobes.\u201d \nPet.App.103a, 106a-107a, 187a; see also Pet.App.514a \n(stating that objecting to books as \u201cinappropriate\u201d is a \n\u201cdehumanizing form of erasure\u201d).  \nMonths later, in response to this lawsuit, the Board \nrevised its Religious Diversity Guidelines to limit opt-\nouts to \u201cnoncurricular activities\u201d or \u201cfree-time events\u201d \nthat \u201cconflict with a family\u2019s religious, and/or other, \npractices.\u201d Pet.App.672a. The new Guidelines state \nthat the Board \u201ccannot accommodate\u201d opt-outs from \n\u201crequired curricular instruction or the use of curricu-\nlar instructional materials based on religious, and/or \nother, objections.\u201d Pet.App.672a.

Petitioners cannot maintain their reli-\ngious exercise. \nPetitioners Tamer Mahmoud and Enas Barakat re-\nside in Montgomery County, Maryland, with one son \nin elementary school. Pet.App.529a. Respect for \u201cGod\u2019s \nwisdom in creation\u201d lies at the heart of their Muslim \nfaith. Pet.App.531a. This includes a religious convic-\ntion that \u201c\u2018gender\u2019 cannot be unwoven from biological \n\u2018sex\u2019\u201d without \u201crejecting the dignity\u201d God has \u201cbe-\nstowed on humanity.\u201d Pet.App.530a. They believe chil-\ndren \u201cattain their fullest God-given potential by em-\nbracing their biological sex.\u201d Pet.App.531a. \nFor Mahmoud and Barakat, this is a sacred obliga-\ntion. It underlies their beliefs regarding the im-\nportance of marriage and sexuality for \u201ccreating chil-\ndren\u201d\u2014\u201cnot only to build a loving family but also to \nserve as an example of righteousness for society at \nlarge.\u201d Pet.App.530a (citing Surah Al-Furqan 25:74). \nTo avoid confusion, their faith forbids them from \u201cex-\nposing [their] impressionable, elementary-aged son to \nactivities and curriculum on sex, sexuality, and gender \nthat undermine Islamic teaching.\u201d Pet.App.532a (cit-\ning Surah Al-An\u2019am 6:68-69). They believe there \nwould be \u201cdetrimental spiritual consequences\u201d from \nsubjecting their son to instruction \u201cconcerning sexual \nand gender ethics that contravene well-established Is-\nlamic teachings.\u201d Pet.App.532a. Thus, after being told \nno future opt-outs would be allowed, they were reli-\ngiously compelled to send their son to private school at \nsignificant financial sacrifice. \n\n17 \n \nPetitioners Melissa and Chris Persak are Roman \nCatholic and have two elementary-age daughters in \npublic school. Pet.App.542a. They believe that \u201ca per-\nson\u2019s biological sex is a gift bestowed by God that is \nboth unchanging and integral to that person\u2019s being.\u201d \nPet.App.543a. They have a religious obligation to \nteach their children about the \u201cimmutable sexual dif-\nferences between males and females, the biblical way \nto properly express romantic and sexual desires, and \nthe role of parents to love one another unconditionally \nand sacrificially within the confines of biblical mar-\nriage.\u201d Pet.App.543a. \nThese beliefs are foundational to the Persaks\u2019 reli-\ngious understanding of the importance of \u201ccreat[ing] \nand sustain[ing] a family,\u201d which is \u201cnot only neces-\nsary for raising the next generation of children\u201d but \nalso \nfor \n\u201chuman \nflourishing \nand \nhappiness.\u201d \nPet.App.543a (citing Genesis 1:28; John 8:51, 14:21, \n15:10). Because elementary-age children \u201care highly \nimpressionable,\u201d their faith forbids them from subject-\ning their children to instruction that undermines their \nreligious \nbeliefs \non \ngender \nand \nsexuality. \nPet.App.544a.  \nPetitioners Svitlana and Jeff Roman are Ukrainian \nOrthodox and Roman Catholic, respectively. They re-\nside in Montgomery County with their elementary-age \nson. They believe that gender and biological sex are \n\u201cintertwined and inseparable,\u201d Pet.App.535a-537a, \nand \u201can integral part of God\u2019s design,\u201d Pet.App.536a \n(citing 1 Thessalonians 5:23; Catechism of the Catholic \nChurch, cc. 362-368). They have a religious obligation \nto help their son \u201caccept [his] own body as it was cre-\nated\u201d and to \u201cattain [his] fullest God-given potential by \nembracing [his] biological sex.\u201d Pet.App.537a-538a. \n\n18 \n \nThe Romans accept Catholic teaching that during \n\u201c\u2018the years of innocence\u2019 from about five years of age \nuntil puberty,\u201d children \u201cmust never be disturbed by \nunnecessary information about sex.\u201d Pet.App.539a \n(quoting The Pontifical Council for the Family, The \nTruth and Meaning of Human Sexuality: Guidelines \nfor Education within the Family, 78 (Dec. 8, 1995)). \nEspecially while their young son inherently \u201cloves\u201d \nand \u201cimplicitly trusts\u201d his teachers, the Romans have \na religious duty to direct when and how he is taught \n\u201cprinciples about sexuality or gender identity.\u201d \nPet.App.541a. Failing this duty would be \u201cspiritually \nand \nemotionally \nharmful \nto \nhis \nwell-being.\u201d \nPet.App.541a. Thus, after the Board withdrew notice \nand opt-outs, they too were religiously compelled to \nsend their son to private school, at significant expense. \nPetitioner Kids First is an unincorporated associa-\ntion formed to protect parental opt-out rights in Mont-\ngomery County schools. Its members include hundreds \nof parents of diverse faiths, all of whom\u2014like the \nnamed families\u2014have a religious obligation not to ex-\npose their young children to instruction on gender and \nsexuality \nthat \nviolates \ntheir \nreligious \nbeliefs. \nPet.App.163a, 168a.  \nOne of those parents is Grace Morrison. She and \nher husband adopted their youngest daughter, who \nhas Down Syndrome and Attention Deficit Disorder, \nfrom Ukraine. Pet.App.624a. Because of her disabili-\nties, their daughter\u2019s ability to make independent \njudgments is impaired, making her particularly im-\npressionable. Pet.App.626a-627a. Before the end of the \n2022-2023 school year, Grace heard from others about \nthe LGBTQ-storybook curriculum and emailed her \ndaughter\u2019s \nteacher \nto \nrequest \nan \nopt-out. \n\n19 \n \nPet.App.626a. The request was denied. Pet.App.626a. \nAt the beginning of the following school year, Grace \nasked her daughter\u2019s teacher for a schedule so she \ncould know when the storybook instruction would take \nplace. \nPet.App.648a. \nAgain, \nshe \nwas \nrefused. \nPet.App.648a. Grace and her husband were then reli-\ngiously compelled to remove their daughter from \nschool, at a cost of $25,000 a year in \u201ctherapy \nand  * * *  academic services and supplies\u201d that she \npreviously accessed through the public system. \nPet.App.648a-649a. \nE. Petitioners sue. \nStripped of their notice and opt-out rights, Peti-\ntioners sued and moved for a preliminary injunction. \nThey argued that denial of notice and opt-outs violated \nthe Free Exercise Clause by overriding their freedom \nto direct the religious upbringing of their children and \nby burdening their religious exercise via policies that \nare not neutral or generally applicable. \nThe district court denied the motion, holding that \nPetitioners could not show \u201cthat the no-opt-out policy \nburdens their religious exercise.\u201d Pet.App.114a. After \nthus finding no likelihood of success on the merits, the \ndistrict court concluded that the remaining injunctive \nfactors also favored the Board. Pet.App.152a-154a. \nPetitioners immediately sought an injunction \npending appeal from the Fourth Circuit. The court de-\nnied that motion but ordered expedited briefing on the \nmerits. Following oral argument, a divided panel af-\nfirmed the district court\u2019s ruling. The majority found \nno free-exercise burden because there was \u201cno evi-\ndence at present\u201d that Petitioners were \u201ccom-\npel[led]  * * *  to change their religious beliefs or \n\n20 \n \n[their] conduct\u201d or \u201cwhat they teach their own chil-\ndren.\u201d Pet.App.34a. Nor were they \u201casked to affirm \nviews contrary to their own\u201d or to \u201cchange how they \nfeel about\u201d gender and sexuality. Pet.App.34a. Peti-\ntioners, the court reasoned, remained \u201cfree[ ]\u201d to \u201cdis-\ncuss[ ] the topics raised in the [s]torybooks with their \nchildren\u201d and to \u201cteach[ ] their children as they wish.\u201d \nPet.App.35a. The majority also found Yoder inapplica-\nble, because \u201c[i]n the decades since [it] was decided,\u201d \ncircuit courts have given it a \u201climited holding\u201d based \non its \u201cunique record.\u201d Pet.App.38a. \nJudge Quattlebaum dissented. He concluded that \n\u201cburdening the exercise of religion is not limited to di-\nrect coercion.\u201d Pet.App.59a. Rather, religious liberty \n\u201cmay be infringed by the denial of or placing of condi-\ntions upon a benefit or privilege.\u201d Pet.App.60a. Be-\ncause the no-opt-out policy forced Petitioners \u201cto either \nlive out their faith or forgo the public benefit,\u201d their \nreligious exercise was burdened. Pet.App.66a n3. \nJudge Quattlebaum also concluded that this approach \nwas not neutral or generally applicable because the \nBoard had \u201cdiscretion to grant religious opt-out re-\nquests\u201d and because Maryland law requires \u201cnotice \nand opt-out procedures for all \u2018family life and human \nsexuality\u2019 instruction.\u201d Pet.App.68a, 70a n.4. The \nBoard could not avoid that obligation \u201cjust by adding \ninstruction [on gender and sexuality] to other classes.\u201d \nPet.App.70a n.4. Concluding that strict scrutiny could \nnot be met, Pet.App.72a-73a, Judge Quattlebaum \nwould have granted a preliminary injunction. \nPet.App.75a. \nWithout addressing any of the case law discussed \nby Judge Quattlebaum, the majority remanded for fur-\nther proceedings. In the district court, the Board \n\n21 \n \nmoved to dismiss on the ground that the complaint \nfails to allege any students have been coerced to \nchange, or act against, their religious beliefs. The dis-\ntrict court stayed the matter pending appeal. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe First Amendment places high value on the \nright of parents to convey their religious beliefs and \npractices to their children. For Petitioners, that right \nhas special significance as they seek to instill religious \nbeliefs on gender and sexuality\u2014beliefs crucial for \ntheir children\u2019s ability to fulfill religious aspirations \nconcerning marriage and family. By compelling in-\nstruction designed to indoctrinate Petitioners\u2019 chil-\ndren against their religious beliefs\u2014all without notice \nor opportunity to opt out\u2014the Board has put Petition-\ners to an impossible choice. They must subject their \nchildren to instruction intended to disrupt their reli-\ngious beliefs or forgo the benefits of a public education \nat the sizeable cost of either paying for private school, \nhomeschooling, or facing government fines and penal-\nties. That obvious burden on Petitioners\u2019 free exercise \nis constitutionally impermissible for at least two rea-\nsons.  \nFirst, the Free Exercise Clause prohibits govern-\nment schools from \u201csubstantially interfering with the \nright of parents to direct the religious upbringing of \ntheir children.\u201d Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 218, \n232 (1972). Children in elementary school are at the \nmost formative stage of their lives and are highly im-\npressionable and vulnerable to peer pressure\u2014espe-\ncially on such potent and religiously laden topics as \ngender and sexuality. In Yoder, the Court held that \nsubjecting high schoolers to an educational environ-\nment that incidentally conflicted with their religious \n\n22 \n \nbeliefs justified parents withdrawing them from public \nschool entirely. Petitioners\u2019 much narrower request to \nopt their children out from discrete instruction that \ndeliberately seeks to confound their religious values \ncompels the same result. The longstanding consensus \nof states deferring to parents on when and how their \nchildren will receive sex education confirms that com-\npelled instruction against their religious beliefs sub-\nstantially interferes with Petitioners\u2019 free exercise \nright.   \nSecond, the Board\u2019s ban on notice and opt-outs fails \nthe Free Exercise Clause\u2019s minimum requirement of \ngeneral applicability and neutrality under Church of \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. \n520 (1993). Suspending notice and opt-outs created \ntopsy-turvy categorizations that allow a fourteen-\nyear-old to be excused from instruction on gender and \nsexuality during sex education, while a four-year-old \nmust sit through the same instruction during English \nclass. The policy also lacks general applicability be-\ncause the Board has total discretion over when the pol-\nicy applies. The original Guidelines allowed opt-outs \nunless requests became \u201ctoo frequent\u201d or \u201ctoo burden-\nsome.\u201d And when the Board first cancelled opt-outs, \nthe cancellation applied solely to the storybook in-\nstruction. Even then the Board said it would honor any \nopt-outs already granted through the end of the school \nyear. This maneuvering alone demonstrates the \nBoard\u2019s retained discretion over when it can infringe \nPetitioners\u2019 religious direction over their children.  \nThe Board\u2019s more recent amendment to the Guide-\nlines, which bans all \u201ccurricular\u201d opt-outs, doesn\u2019t \nsolve the problem. The surviving opt-outs for \u201cnoncur-\n\n23 \n \nricular\u201d activities undermine the Board\u2019s asserted in-\nterests in the same way. Moreover, the Board\u2019s deci-\nsion to level-down was a targeted response to parents\u2019 \nreligious objections. Any doubt was removed by Board \nmembers\u2019 explicit religious hostility\u2014which has never \nbeen disavowed\u2014in accusing objecting parents of \naligning with \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d and \u201cxenophobes\u201d \nand criticizing their children for \u201cparroting\u201d their par-\nents\u2019 \u201cdogma.\u201d The non-neutrality compounds the lack \nof general applicability. \nNone of this can survive strict scrutiny. The same \nnational consensus on parental deference that demon-\nstrates substantial interference also demonstrates \nthere is no compelling interest in withholding notice \nand opt-outs. And the Board\u2019s generic concerns about \ndisruption, stigma, and compliance with unspecified \ncivil rights laws fail the \u201cmore precise\u201d analysis de-\nmanded by the First Amendment. Finally, in its slap-\ndash blitz to eliminate opt-outs and exclude parents, \nthe Board did not even bother to consider obvious less \nrestrictive means. Strict scrutiny demands far more. \n*  \n*  \n* \nBreaking the bond between parent and child to de-\nvelop the state\u2019s view of the \u201cideal citizen[ ]\u201d has no \nroot in the \u201cideas  * * *  upon which our institutions \nrest.\u201d Meyer v. Nebraska, 262 U.S. 390, 627-628 (1923). \nThe Court should reverse.  \n\n24 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. The Board has burdened Petitioners\u2019 free ex-\nercise. \nPetitioners may \u201cprov[e] a free exercise violation in \nvarious ways.\u201d Kennedy v. Bremerton Sch. Dist., 597 \nU.S. 507, 525 (2022). Here, there are at least two.  \nA. The Board\u2019s actions substantially interfere \nwith Petitioners\u2019 rights under Yoder to di-\nrect the religious upbringing of their chil-\ndren. \nThis case falls squarely within Yoder, triggering \nPetitioners\u2019 rights under the Free Exercise Clause. \n1. The Court has \u201clong recognized the rights of \nparents to direct \u2018the religious upbringing\u2019 of their chil-\ndren.\u201d Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 591 U.S. \n464, 486 (2020). In Meyer v. Nebraska\u2014decided before \nthe Free Exercise Clause was incorporated against the \nstates\u2014a teacher at a Lutheran parochial school was \ntried and convicted for teaching students German, \nwhich was prohibited by a state law enacted during \nWorld War I. 262 U.S. 390, 396-397 (1923). \u201cThe text \nbook used for such teaching was a book of biblical sto-\nries.\u201d Meyer v. State, 187 N.W. 100, 101 (Neb. 1922). \nThe defendant argued that \u201cin teaching the German \nlanguage in this book he was giving religious instruc-\ntion.\u201d Ibid. In reviewing his conviction, this Court up-\nheld the right of parents to \u201cestablish a home and \nbring up children\u201d and to \u201ccontrol [their] education,\u201d \nincluding in teaching a foreign language. Meyer, 262 \nU.S. at 399, 401. No law could restrict this right \u201cwith-\nout doing violence to both letter and spirit of the Con-\nstitution.\u201d Id. at 402. \n\n25 \n \nTwo years later, the Court reinforced this ruling in \nPierce v. Society of Sisters of the Holy Names of Jesus \n& Mary, 268 U.S. 510 (1925). Pierce addressed a law \nthat \u201cthe Ku Klux Klan and other Nativist groups \npushed through  * * *  requiring all children to attend \npublic schools; the effect would have been to close the \nCatholic schools.\u201d Douglas Laycock, The Religious \nFreedom Restoration Act, 1993 B.Y.U. L. Rev. 221, 223 \n(1993). On review, this Court found it \u201centirely plain\u201d \nthat a law mandating public education violated \u201cthe \nright of parents to choose\u201d for their children an \u201cappro-\npriate mental and religious training\u201d in a private reli-\ngious school. Pierce, 268 U.S. at 532, 535. Parents \n\u201chave the right, coupled with the high duty, to recog-\nnize and prepare\u201d their children for \u201cobligations\u201d be-\nyond duties owed the state. Id. at 535. Thus, even \nthough the Oregon law was \u201cexpected to have general \napplication,\u201d Pierce rejected \u201cany general power of the \nstate to standardize its children by forcing them to ac-\ncept instruction from public teachers only.\u201d Ibid. \nAfter incorporating the Free Exercise Clause \nagainst the states, the Court extended this free exer-\ncise right into public schools in West Virginia State \nBoard of Education v. Barnette. There, to foster the \n\u201cspirit of Americanism,\u201d and as part of its \u201cinstruction \nin history\u201d and \u201ccivics,\u201d the West Virginia Board of Ed-\nucation required public school students to salute and \npledge allegiance to the flag. 319 U.S. 624, 625-626 \n(1943). Participation was \u201cnot optional.\u201d Id. at 632. Je-\nhovah\u2019s Witness parents objected to this requirement, \nwhich violated their religious beliefs, and sued under \nthe Free Exercise Clause to opt their children out. Id. \nat 629. \n\n26 \n \nThere was no evidence that the West Virginia \nschool board required children to \u201cbecome unwilling \nconverts\u201d or \u201cforgo any contrary convictions.\u201d Barnette, \n319 U.S. at 633. This Court nonetheless held that com-\npelling the pledge \u201cinvades the sphere of intellect and \nspirit\u201d that the First Amendment guards \u201cfrom all of-\nficial control.\u201d Id. at 642. Justices Black and Douglas \nprovided the deciding votes, emphasizing that \u201ccom-\npelling little children to participate in a ceremony \nwhich ends in nothing for them but a fear of spiritual \ncondemnation\u201d \u201cfails to accord full scope to the free-\ndom of religion secured  * * *  by the First and Four-\nteenth Amendments.\u201d Id. at 643-644 (Black, J., and \nDouglas, J., concurring); see also id. at 645 (Murphy, \nJ., concurring) (pledge requirement violates the \u201cfree-\ndom to believe [and] freedom to worship one\u2019s Maker \naccording to the dictates of one\u2019s conscience\u201d). \nThe Court rejected the argument that the pledge \nrequirement was justified by the government\u2019s inter-\nest in \u201cNational unity [a]s the basis of National secu-\nrity.\u201d Barnette, 319 U.S. at 640. That interest was in-\nsufficient to overcome the \u201cfreedom\u201d to be \u201cspiritually \ndiverse\u201d\u2014to differ not just as to \u201cthings that do not \nmatter much,\u201d but also \u201cas to things that touch the \nheart of the existing order.\u201d Id. at 641-642. The Court \nalso rejected the argument that policing the \u201cfunctions \nof educational officers  * * *  would in effect make [it] \nthe school board for the country.\u201d Id. at 637. The First \nAmendment \u201cprotects the citizen against the State it-\nself and all of its creatures\u2014Boards of Education not \nexcepted.\u201d Ibid.  \nWisconsin v. Yoder further rooted the right recog-\nnized by Pierce, Meyer, and Barnette in the Free Exer-\ncise Clause. In a claimed effort to \u201cprotect children \n\n27 \n \nfrom ignorance\u201d and to prepare them to \u201cbe self-reliant \nand self-sufficient participants in society,\u201d Wisconsin \nmandated public school attendance for children up to \nthe age of 16. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 221-\n222 (1972). A group of Amish parents who believed sec-\nular education beyond the eighth grade \u201cwould not \nonly expose themselves to the danger of the censure of \nthe church community, but  * * *  also endanger their \nown salvation and that of their children,\u201d refused to \ncomply with the statute and challenged its application \non free exercise grounds. Id. at 209.  \nIn ruling for the parents, the Court recognized the \n\u201cfundamental interest of parents\u201d to guide their chil-\ndren\u2019s religious future and education, which was \u201ces-\ntablished beyond debate as an enduring American tra-\ndition.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 232; see also Espinoza, 591 \nU.S. at 486 (\u201c[d]rawing on\u201d this tradition); id. at 525 \n(Breyer, J., dissenting) (\u201cThe Free Exercise Clause \ndraws upon a history that places great value upon the \nfreedom of parents to teach their children the tenets of \ntheir faith.\u201d); see also Our Lady of Guadalupe Sch. v. \nMorrisey-Berru, 591 U.S. 732, 754-756 (2020) (high-\nlighting the \u201ccentral importance\u201d for religious believ-\ners in \u201ceducating the young in the faith\u201d). Considering \nthis enduring interest, the Court agreed that second-\nary schooling would, in fact, burden the parents\u2019 free \nexercise rights \u201cby substantially interfering with the \nreligious development of the Amish child and his inte-\ngration into the way of life of the Amish faith commu-\nnity.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 218.  \nTo support this conclusion, the Court repeatedly \nemphasized that children entering high school are at \na \u201ccrucial adolescent stage of development,\u201d including \na \u201ccrucial  * * *  period of religious development.\u201d \n\n28 \n \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 218, 223; see also id. at 211-212. For \nAmish children, high school was a turning point, with \nincreased emphasis on \u201cintellectual and scientific ac-\ncomplishments, \nself-distinction, \ncompetitiveness, \nworldly success, and social life with other students\u201d\u2014\nvalues that were \u201chostile to Amish beliefs.\u201d Id. at 211. \nAll this, along with \u201cteachers who are not of the Amish \nfaith\u2014and may even be hostile to it\u2014interpose[d] a \nserious barrier to the integration of the Amish child \ninto the Amish religious community.\u201d Id. at 211-212. \nHaving found a free exercise burden, the Court pro-\nceeded to strict scrutiny. That analysis focused on the \nstate\u2019s interest in education. Although \u201c[p]roviding \npublic schools ranks at the very apex of the function of \na State,\u201d the Court recognized that \u201c[t]he requirement \nfor compulsory education beyond the eighth grade \n[was] a relatively recent development.\u201d Yoder, 406 \nU.S. at 213, 226. The state\u2019s core interest was in \u201cpro-\ntect[ing] children from ignorance\u201d and preparing them \nto \u201cbe self-reliant and self-sufficient participants in so-\nciety.\u201d Id. at 221, 222. The nation\u2019s \u201cfundamental the-\nory of liberty\u201d excluded \u201cany general power of the State \nto standardize its children.\u201d Id. at 233. \n2. The principles in Yoder distilled from Meyer, \nPierce, and Barnette control the result here. There is \nno dispute that Petitioners sincerely believe that sub-\njecting their children to instruction contrary to their \nreligious beliefs could \u201cendanger their own\u201d standing \nbefore God \u201cand that of their children.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. \nat 208; Pet.App.532a (\u201cdetrimental spiritual conse-\nquences\u201d); Pet.App.541a (\u201cspiritually and emotionally \nharmful\u201d); Pet.App.543a-544a (serious \u201crisk\u201d to \u201cflour-\nishing and happiness\u201d). And it is also undisputed that, \n\n29 \n \nin response to Petitioners\u2019 requests to opt their chil-\ndren out for religious reasons, the Board ultimately \nprohibited that religious exercise. Pet.App.533a-534a, \n540a, 544a-545a. Petitioners could no longer direct \ntheir children away from religiously objectionable in-\nstruction on gender and sexuality. They weren\u2019t even \nallowed to know when the instruction would take \nplace. Pet.App.648a, 657a. By any definition, that con-\nstitutes \u201csubstantial interference\u201d with Petitioners\u2019 re-\nligious development of their children. Yoder, 406 U.S. \nat 213 (\u201ccompelling attendance  * * *  unreasonably \ninterfere[s] with the interest of parents in directing \nthe rearing of their off-spring\u201d).  \nThe Board\u2019s intentionality confirms the burden\u2019s \nsubstantiality. As the Board acknowledges, its curric-\nulum was designed to \u201c[d]isrupt\u201d children\u2019s \u201ccisnorma-\ntivity\u201d and \u201ceither/or thinking.\u201d Pet.App.622a, 629a, \n633a; cf. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 633 (goal to instill cer-\ntain \u201cattitude of mind\u201d). Its teacher guides do not focus \non \u201csentence structure, word choice, and style.\u201d BIO.5. \nThey anticipate a religious burden, providing teachers \nparty-line responses to what students \u201cmight say\u201d \nwhen their religious beliefs have been predictably con-\nfounded by the storybook instruction. Pet.App.628a-\n635a. The Board encourages teachers to rectify stu-\ndents\u2019 questions with ideological, value-laden re-\nsponses that imply that students are not being \u201cfair,\u201d \nPet.App.629a, are out of touch (\u201cHarry Styles wears \ndresses\u201d), Pet.App.633a, or are being \u201churtful\u201d or are \n\u201cconfus[ed]\u201d in asking questions such as \u201cHow can \nsomeone be both a boy and a girl or neither?\u201d \nPet.App.630a-631a. The source-books for responding \nto student questions expose the aim: \u201cCorrecting Kids\u2019 \nStereotypes;\u201d \u201cResponding to Sexism, Homophobia \nand Transphobia;\u201d \u201cAnti-Bias Education for Young \n\n30 \n \nChildren and Ourselves;\u201d and \u201cGender Spectrum.\u201d \nPet.App.635a. \nThe Board foresaw the inevitable burden on par-\nents too, feeding teachers similarly dismissive boiler-\nplate. Pet.App.636a-641a. For parents asking why \nchildren should \u201clearn about gender and sexuality \nidentity at school,\u201d the Board condescends: \u201cA School \nis where children are taught to respect one an-\nother  * * *  [and] [l]earning about  * * *  gender di-\nversity and sexuality identity diversity is part of that \nwork.\u201d Pet.App.636a. For parents worried that their \nchildren are \u201ctoo young\u201d to have the gender binary dis-\nrupted, the Board imparts armchair sociology: \u201cChil-\ndren are already learning about it and mostly see \n\u2018straight\u2019 and \u2018cisgender\u2019 representations around \nthem,\u201d so \u201c[i]t is never too early.\u201d Pet.App.637a-638a. \nAnd for parents concerned that such instruction would \nundermine \u201cthe values\u201d they seek to \u201cinstill[ ] in [their] \nchild[ren],\u201d the Board assures: \u201cTeaching about \nLGBTQ+ is not about making students think a certain \nway; it is to show that there is no one \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 \nway to be.\u201d Pet.App.638a. This is relativistic dogma \nmasquerading as tolerance.  \nNot even Montgomery County\u2019s own elementary \nschool principals were fooled. In private correspond-\nence from November 2022, they warned the Board that \nthe storybooks, guidance for teachers, and overall \n\u201cmessaging\u201d were age-inappropriate, misleading, and \n\u201cdismissive of religious beliefs.\u201d Pet.App.614a-615a, \n617a, 619a. \nIt\u2019s no mystery why these concerns went unheeded. \nThe storybooks were deliberately selected \u201cto actual-\nize\u201d the Board\u2019s \u201csexual\u201d and \u201cgender identity guide-\nlines.\u201d Pet.App.640a-641a. The Board wants students \n\n31 \n \nto \u201ccome away from [the storybook] instruction with a \nnew perspective not easily contravened by their par-\nents.\u201d J.A.46; Pet.App.657a. That\u2019s why it accused ob-\njecting parents of aligning with \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d \nand \u201cxenophobes\u201d and scorned objecting students for \n\u201cparroting\u201d their parents\u2019 \u201cdogma.\u201d Pet.App.106a-\n107a. If the Board doesn\u2019t intend to disrupt students\u2019 \nreligious beliefs, there is no reason to deny notice of \nwhen the books will be read. The entire point of the \nexercise is to achieve what burdens Petitioners: sub-\nstantial interference with their ability to direct the re-\nligious education of their children on matters concern-\ning gender and sexuality. The Court is \u201cnot required to \nexhibit a naivet\u00e9 from which ordinary citizens are \nfree.\u201d Department of Com. v. New York, 588 U.S. 752, \n785 (2019) (quoting United States v. Stanchich, 550 \nF.2d 1294, 1300 (2d Cir. 1977) (Friendly, J.)). \n\u201c[M]odest estimates\u201d of judicial competence in \u201csuch \nspecialties as public education\u201d are not a Bill of Rights \nbypass. Barnette, 319 U.S. at 640.  \n3. As in Yoder, Petitioners\u2019 showing of substantial \ninterference is buttressed by a strong history and tra-\ndition\u2014here, one of parental deference when it comes \nto instruction on gender and sexuality. As \u201cany parent \nknows,\u201d children and adolescents \u201clack maturity,\u201d are \nprone to \u201cimpetuous and ill-considered actions and de-\ncisions,\u201d and are especially susceptible to outside \u201cin-\nfluences\u201d and \u201cpressures, including peer pressure.\u201d \nRoper v. Simmons, 543 U.S. 551, 569 (2005); see also \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 211. This is especially concerning \nwhen it comes to \u201cissue[s] as sensitive and important \nas [child] sexuality\u201d and gender. Bowen v. Kendrick, \n487 U.S. 589, 612 (1988). Such instruction implicates \n\u201cfundamental elements of religious doctrine.\u201d Ibid. \nAnd sex education in \u201cgroup settings, such as public \n\n32 \n \nschools, where confident and authoritative leaders en-\ndorse particular beliefs and conduct, will have signifi-\ncant influence upon minor students.\u201d Helen M. Alvar\u00e9, \nFamilies, Schools, and Religious Freedom, 54 Loy. U. \nChi. L.J. 579, 600 (2023); see also Pet.App.40a-41a (ac-\nknowledging \u201cheightened concern[ ]\u201d in light of Peti-\ntioners\u2019 children\u2019s \u201cyoung ages and impressionabil-\nity\u201d); Pet.App.616-617a (principals\u2019 concerns that ma-\nterials not age-appropriate). Thus, even when protect-\ning sexual minorities, this Court has promised First \nAmendment protection for \u201creligious  * * *  persons\u201d \nas they \u201cseek to teach the principles that are so ful-\nfilling and so central to their lives and faiths, and to \ntheir own deep aspirations to continue the family \nstructure they have long revered.\u201d Obergefell v. \nHodges, 576 U.S. 644, 679-680 (2015). \nDeference to parental authority on such matters is \nfurther reflected in the development of sex education. \nIt did not become a standard part of public school cur-\nriculum until the 1970s and, even then, was focused \nmainly on physiology, hygiene, and disease preven-\ntion. Supra 8. More \u201ccomprehensive\u201d sex education \nwas not a standard aspect of public high school in-\nstruction until the 1990s. Supra 8. And discussion of \nhuman sexuality and gender identity in pre-kindergar-\nten is\u2014to put it mildly\u2014a \u201crelatively recent develop-\nment.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 226.  \nEven as public school instruction on human sexu-\nality has expanded, it has almost always been accom-\npanied by parental notice and requirements for either \nparental opt-outs or opt-ins. Supra 7. Only three \nstates have no such requirement, and they are silent \non the matter. Supra 7. No state has ever affirmatively \ndenied parents access to information and opportunity \n\n33 \n \nto opt-their child out from instruction on gender and \nsexuality. This pattern reinforces Petitioners\u2019 \u201ccon-\nvincing showing\u201d that compelled instruction on gender \nand sexuality \u201csubstantially interfer[es] with the reli-\ngious development\u201d of their children. Yoder, 406 U.S. \nat 218, 235-236.  \n4. The Fourth Circuit dismissed all this, summar-\nily concluding that Yoder has been \u201cmarkedly circum-\nscribed\u201d and \u201climited\u201d to the \u201cunique record\u201d estab-\nlished by the Amish. Pet.App.37a, 38a. But this Court \nhas never suggested that Yoder\u2019s holding is so re-\nstricted. See, e.g., Espinoza, 591 U.S. at 486 (relying \non the \u201cenduring American tradition\u201d affirmed by \nYoder). And Yoder itself derived its holding from \u201c[t]he \nhistory and culture of Western civilization\u201d and \u201c[t]he \nfundamental theory of liberty upon which all govern-\nments in this Union repose.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 232, \n233. The right of parents to direct the religious educa-\ntion of their children was \u201cspecifically and firmly \nfixed\u201d in the First Amendment, \u201c[l]ong before there \nwas general acknowledgment of the need for universal \nformal [sex] education.\u201d Id. at 214; see also Barnette, \n319 U.S. at 638 (\u201cvery purpose of a Bill of Rights was \nto withdraw certain subjects from the vicissitudes of \npolitical controversy\u201d). \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s view that Petitioners could ex-\nperience no religious burden absent evidence that stu-\ndents were being compelled \u201cto change their religious \nbeliefs,\u201d Pet.App.34a, is similarly foreign to Yoder. The \nAmish parents were not required to wait until their \nchildren \u201cha[d] in fact been asked\u201d to \u201cdisavow\u201d the \nAmish way of life. Pet.App.34a. Nor did the Court have \nany objective measure for determining whether\u2014after \neight years in the public schools, Yoder, 406 U.S. at \n\n34 \n \n207 & n.1\u2014staying just one or two more really would \nhave pushed Amish children beyond the point of no re-\nligious return. Rather, based on the student\u2019s age, the \nrealities of adolescent development, and the nature of \nthe high school environment, the Court accepted the \nparents\u2019 religious judgment that further \u201cexposing \n[their] children to worldly influences\u201d would \u201csubstan-\ntially interfer[e] with the religious development of \n[their] child.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 218. Petitioners have \nmade the same showings\u2014only further bolstered by \nundisputed evidence that the storybook curriculum is \nactively hostile to their religious beliefs and by a long \nand deep national consensus protecting parental di-\nrection on gender and sexuality. Thus, a holding of \n\u201csubstantial interference\u201d here fits easily within \nYoder\u2019s reasoning. \nIn contrast, under the Board\u2019s rule, there is no limit \nto what schools could teach children about gender and \nsexuality. This February, parents in New York were \nignored by their school board after they objected that \nthe book \u201cThe Rainbow Parade\u201d\u2014which \u201cincludes de-\npictions of a naked person shown from behind, furries, \nand \na \ngay \ncouple \noutfitted \nin \nleather \nBDSM  * * *  attire\u201d\u2014was read to their elementary \nschool children ages five to eleven.13 Starting in the \n2025-2026 school year, Minnesota third-graders will \nbe required to use \u201cnon-binary gender pronouns\u201d if \nthey want to meet writing benchmarks.14 As long as \n \n13 \nShane Galvin, NY school board meeting descends into chaos \nover \u2018LGBTQIA+\u2019 book as large group of fuming parents takes \nover, N.Y.

Strict scrutiny applies \nwhenever the government treats \u201cany comparable sec-\nular activity more favorably than religious exercise.\u201d \nTandon v. Newsom, 593 U.S. 61, 62 (2021). Compara-\nbility turns not on the facial similarity between one \nactivity and another, but rather, on how each activity \nimpacts the government\u2019s underlying \u201cinterest that \njustifies the regulation at issue.\u201d Ibid. This ensures \nthat courts do not miss disparate treatment by focus-\ning on the government\u2019s own, possibly self-serving, \n\u201ccategorizations.\u201d Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn \nv. Cuomo, 592 U.S. 14, 17 (2020). \nHere, the Board relies on superficial categories to \ndeny opt-outs to preschoolers while permitting opt-\nouts for children in junior high and high school. It clas-\nsifies the storybooks as \u201cEnglish Language Arts\u201d cur-\nriculum (no opt-outs) while classifying discussion of \nsexuality in later grades as health class (opt-outs per-\nmitted). J.A.73-75. The Court rejects such strategic \ncategorizing. See, e.g., Tandon, 593 U.S. at 63-64.  \nEven on their own terms, the Board\u2019s categories are \ngossamer-thin. That is because both sets of lessons \nwere created to further the same \u201cLGBTQ-Inclusive\u201d \ninterest. Pet.App.234a. The Board concedes that the \n\n37 \n \nstorybook curriculum was adopted pursuant to Mary-\nland\u2019s 2019 \u201cEquity Regulation,\u201d J.A.2, which seeks to \nensure \u201ceducational equity\u201d around \u201c[g]ender identity\u201d \nand \n\u201c[s]exual \norientation.\u201d \nMd. \nCode \nRegs. \n\u00a7\u00a7 13A.01.06.01(B), 13A.01.06.03(B)(2), (5). That same \nregulation also spurred \u201c[i]nclusiv[ity]\u201d updates to the \n\u201cFamily Life and Human Sexuality\u201d unit of the state-\nwide health curriculum. J.A.59-61, J.A.62; see also \nJ.A.65 (\u201cupdated\u201d to \u201cimplement the [2019 equity] reg-\nulation\u201d). Thus, beyond what is taught through the \nstorybooks, \u201cGender identity and expression\u201d is also \ntaught during health class beginning in \u201cPrekinder-\ngarten\u201d through high school, along with \u201cSexual orien-\ntation and identity\u201d beginning in \u201cGrade 4\u201d through \nhigh school. J.A.68-72, 80. \nThough justified by the same interest as the story-\nbook lessons, the Board admits that when inclusivity \ninstruction is presented in health class, \u201cstudents are \npermitted to opt out for any reason.\u201d BIO.22; see also \nJ.A.3; Pet.App.662a. But \u201cfamilies may not choose to \nopt out of engaging with\u201d and cannot even be \u201cin-\nform[ed]  * * *  when [the] inclusive books are read.\u201d \nPet.App.662a. The Board\u2019s own principals seized on \nthis precise Tandon problem, noting that, \u201c[f]or exam-\nple, family life isn\u2019t taught until fifth grade, but a sec-\nond grade book uses terminology such as cisgender or \ntransgender.\u201d Pet.App.618a.  \n\u201cOnly by adjusting the dials just right  * * *  can \nyou engineer\u201d such an absurd conclusion. Masterpiece \nCakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado C.R. Comm\u2019n, 584 U.S. 617 \n(2018) (Gorsuch, J., concurring). And \u201c[i]t is no answer \nthat [the government] treats some comparable secular \n[opt-out requests] as poorly as or even less favorably \nthan the religious [opt-outs] at issue.\u201d Tandon, 593 \n\n38 \n \nU.S. at 62. Allowing all secular opt-outs (from the \nhealth curriculum) while banning all religious opt-\nouts (from the storybooks) shows that the govern-\nment\u2019s underlying interest (in \u201cLGBTQ-inclus[ivity]\u201d) \nis not generally applicable. \nDiscretionary exceptions. The Board\u2019s patch-\nwork scheme is also rife with\u2014and the result of\u2014the \nBoard\u2019s \u201csole discretion.\u201d Fulton, 593 U.S. at 535. Un-\nder Fulton, strict scrutiny is triggered when the gov-\nernment has \u201ca mechanism for individualized exemp-\ntions,\u201d because it \u201c\u2018invite[s]\u2019 the government to decide \nwhich reasons for not complying with the policy are \nworthy of solicitude.\u201d Id. at 533, 535, 537 (quoting Em-\nployment Div. v. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 884 (1990)). And \nsuch discretion means that burdens imposed by the \ngovernment are the opposite of the \u201cincidental\u201d bur-\ndens Smith envisioned. 494 U.S. at 878. \nThe Board\u2019s shifting policies are shot through with \ndiscretion. Consider first the history of the Board\u2019s ac-\ntions. For almost the entire 2022-2023 school year, no-\ntice of storybook instruction was provided and opt-outs \nwere permitted. Pet.App.185a-187a, 497a-498a, 533a-\n534a, 540a, 544a-545a. These opt-outs themselves \nwere granted on a discretionary basis. Pet.App.220a-\n221a (\u201cWhen possible, schools should try\u201d; parents and \nstudents \u201chave the right to ask\u201d; \u201cit may be feasible to \naccommodate\u201d). The Board publicly reiterated on \nMarch 22, 2023, that \u201c[i]f a parent chooses to opt out, \na teacher can find a substitute text for that student \nthat  * * *  aligns with curriculum.\u201d Pet.App.184a, \n662a. \nBut overnight, and without explanation, the Board \nposted on its webpage that it was withdrawing notice \nand opt-outs\u2014for the storybook instruction alone. \n\n39 \n \nPet.App.185a, 662a. This discretion-laden ad hocery \ntriggers strict scrutiny. Fulton, 593 U.S. at 537-538. \nDiscretion runs through the Board\u2019s Religious Di-\nversity Guidelines as well. Under the 2022-2023 \nGuidelines, the Board claimed discretion to deny ac-\ncommodations if the requests became \u201ctoo frequent\u201d or \n\u201ctoo burdensome.\u201d Pet.App.221a. With respect to the \nstorybook discussions, on March 23, 2023, the Board \nwithdrew notice and opt-outs wholesale in a purported \nexercise of that discretion, Pet.App.605a-608a, 662a, \nbut retained discretion to change course or adopt a \nmore targeted approach, Pet.App.221a. The Board ex-\nercised that retained discretion immediately, choosing \nto continue opt-outs for the remainder of the school \nyear if \u201cschools already had granted accommodation \nrequests.\u201d Pet.App.608a. In general applicability \nterms, that created another \u201cmechanism for individu-\nalized exemptions,\u201d Fulton, 593 U.S. at 533, this time \nfreezing the clock for select schools until \u201cafter the \n2022-2023 school year ended.\u201d Pet.App.608a. If oscil-\nlating grace periods aren\u2019t discretionary, nothing is.  \nThis wasn\u2019t the end of the Board\u2019s discretionary \ntinkering. Months later and in response to this law-\nsuit, the Board formally revised the Guidelines to \nstate that the Board will no longer \u201caccommodate re-\nquests for exemptions from required curricular in-\nstruction or the use of curricular instructional materi-\nals based on religious, and/or other, objections.\u201d \nPet.App.672a. But the new Guidelines still include an \nexception, providing that students \u201cmay\u201d opt-out for \n\u201cnoncurricular activities\u201d or \u201cfree-time events\u201d that \n\u201cconflict with a family\u2019s religious, and/or other, prac-\ntices.\u201d Pet.App.672a. And under both the prior and \ncurrent iterations of the Guidelines, the Board retains \n\n40 \n \ndiscretion to excuse students \u201cwho do not want to par-\nticipate\u201d in instruction about religious holidays pre-\nsented \u201cin a factual manner\u201d or holiday activities \n(\u201c[e]ven birthdays\u201d) that \u201cmay be viewed by others as \nhaving religious overtones.\u201d Pet.App.222a-223a, 673a-\n674a. The Board\u2019s mid-litigation withdrawal of two of \nthe storybooks from the curriculum over \u201cconcerns \nabout the content\u201d further demonstrates the Board\u2019s \nongoing discretion over when and how it can violate \nPetitioners\u2019 religious direction of their children. Supra \n11 n.10. The haphazard quality of the Board\u2019s line-\ndrawing is a tell: reserved discretion \u201cinvite[s]\u201d the \nBoard \u201cto decide which reasons\u201d for opting out \u201care \nworthy of solicitude.\u201d Fulton, 593 U.S. at 537. That \nalone \u201crenders [the] policy not generally applicable.\u201d \nIbid.  \n2. The removal of notice and opt-outs is also not \nneutral. \u201cGovernment fails to act neutrally when it \nproceeds in a manner intolerant of religious beliefs or \nrestricts practices because of their religious nature.\u201d \nFulton, 593 U.S. at 533. Doing so is a de jure burden \non Free Exercise that requires the government action \nto be set aside without any consideration of the gov-\nernment\u2019s interest. Masterpiece, 584 U.S. at 638-639. \nThere are \u201cmany ways of demonstrating that the \nobject or purpose\u201d of government action is \u201cthe sup-\npression of religion or religious conduct.\u201d Church of \nLukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, 508 U.S. \n520, 533 (1993). One is to look at the text of the gov-\nernment\u2019s law, regulation, or policy. Ibid. But \u201c[f]acial \nneutrality is not determinative.\u201d Id. at 534. The Free \nExercise Clause also prohibits \u201cmasked\u201d discrimina-\ntion. Ibid. Masked discrimination can be shown \n\n41 \n \nthrough \u201cthe effect,\u201d \u201cdesign,\u201d and \u201cnet result\u201d of a gov-\nernment policy. Id. at 535-536. \nAlternatively, \u201cthe historical background of the de-\ncision under challenge, the specific series of events \nleading to the enactment or official policy in question, \nand the legislative or administrative history, includ-\ning contemporaneous statements made by members\u201d \ncan also evidence discriminatory object or purpose. \nMasterpiece, 584 U.S. at 639. \u201c[O]fficial expressions of \nhostility to religion,\u201d especially when \u201cnot disavowed\u201d \nby the decisionmaker \u201cat any point in the proceed-\nings,\u201d are also \u201cinconsistent with what the Free Exer-\ncise Clause requires.\u201d Ibid.  \nHere, by allowing notice and opt-outs, then\u2014after \nparents raised religious objections\u2014withdrawing \nthem for storybook instruction only, the Board unlaw-\nfully \u201ctarget[ed] religious conduct for distinctive treat-\nment\u201d in at least two ways. Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534. \nFirst, \u201cthe effect,\u201d \u201cdesign,\u201d and \u201cnet result\u201d of the \nBoard\u2019s rescission evinces a religiously discriminatory \nobject. The Board has long granted parental opt-outs \nfrom a wide variety of school activities, including those \ninvolving books, band, and Halloween. Pet.App.221a-\n223a. Per Maryland law, this has also included opt-\nouts from \u201cinstruction related to family life and human \nsexuality \nobjectives.\u201d \nMd. \nCode \nRegs. \n\u00a7 13A.04.18.01(D)(2)(e)(i); Stephanie Ramirez, MCPS \nrevises policy on LGBTQ-friendly books, Fox 5 DC, \nMar. 24, 2023, https://perma.cc/8L5G-XQ9X. Yet after \nreceiving religious opt-out requests, the Board decided \novernight to withdraw notice and opt-outs in one\u2014and \nonly one\u2014area: the religiously objectionable storybook \nlessons. The obvious \u201cburden\u201d of the Board\u2019s decision \nfell predominately on religious families. Lukumi, 508 \n\n42 \n \nU.S. at 535-536. Indeed, the withdrawal of notice and \nopt-outs required the Board to depart from its Reli-\ngious Diversity Guidelines\u2014and resulted in hundreds \nof people, \u201clargely  * * *  Muslim and Ethiopian Ortho-\ndox parents,\u201d attending Board meetings in protest. As-\nbury & Shepherd, Hundreds of Maryland parents pro-\ntest, https://perma.cc/MJ2Q-BXTW.  \nEffectively, the Board designed a regime where \nthere was no notice or opt-outs only for discussions in-\nvolving these storybooks\u2014an area of curriculum that \nit knew was laden with religious import. The obvious \nreligious significance explains why, after this case \ncommenced, the Board leveled down its Guidelines to \nmatch the lack of notice and opt-outs for the storybook \nlessons. Amending the Guidelines during this case is \nonly further evidence that the notice and opt-out with-\ndrawal was a \u201creligious gerrymander.\u201d Lukumi, 508 \nU.S. at 535. This is \u201cnot neutral  * * *  and therefore \ntrigger[s] strict scrutiny under the Free Exercise \nClause.\u201d Tandon, 593 U.S. at 62.  \nSecond, in justifying the no-opt-out policy, multiple \nBoard members expressed hostility to religion and the \nviewpoints of dissenting parents and students. See \nMasterpiece, 584 U.S. at 639. Board member Harris \naccused one student supporting opt-outs of \u201cparroting\u201d \nhis parents\u2019 \u201cdogma,\u201d Pet.App.106a, and compared a \ngroup of mostly Muslim and Ethiopian Orthodox par-\nents to \u201cwhite supremacists\u201d and \u201cxenophobes.\u201d \nPet.App.106a-107a; Em Espey, Parents, students, doc-\ntors react to MCPS lawsuit targeting LGBTQ+ story-\nbooks, MoCo360, June 2, 2023, https://perma.cc/5GD9-\n2YVQ. She also accused the Parents of finding \u201can-\nother reason to hate another person.\u201d Pet.App.187a. A \n\n43 \n \npresentation on the storybook lessons echoed these re-\nmarks, accusing parents of promoting a \u201cdehumaniz-\ning form of erasure.\u201d Pet.App.187a, 514a. Another \nBoard member added that, \u201c[y]es, ignorance and hate \ndoes exist in our community.\u201d Pet.App.184a.  \nIn over a year-and-a-half of litigation, no Board \nmembers have disavowed these statements, confirm-\ning that the Board did not provide \u201cneutral and re-\nspectful consideration.\u201d Masterpiece, 584 U.S. at 634. \nIn the face of such government hostility, a policy must \nbe \u201c\u2018set aside\u2019  * * *  without further inquiry\u201d\u2014that is, \nwithout strict scrutiny. Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 525 n.1 \n(quoting Masterpiece, 584 U.S. at 639).  \n3.  The Fourth Circuit never reached Lukumi\u2019s \nneutrality and general applicability standards, con-\ncluding that coerced instruction imposed no burden \nuntil Petitioners were actually \u201ccompel[led]  * * *  to \nchange their religious beliefs,\u201d their \u201cconduct,\u201d or \n\u201cwhat they teach their own children.\u201d Pet.App.34a. \nThe Board similarly argues that \u201cthis Court\u2019s cases\u201d \nrequire \u201ccoercion to change or act contrary to one\u2019s re-\nligious beliefs.\u201d BIO.23. These arguments are wrong \nfor at least two reasons.  \nFirst, the Board has burdened Petitioners\u2019 free ex-\nercise under \u201cthe ordinary meaning\u201d of the Free Exer-\ncise Clause. Fulton, 593 U.S. at 567 (Alito, J., concur-\nring in judgment). The Board\u2019s actions \u201cprohibit[ ]\u201d \ntheir religious exercise by \u201cforbidding or hindering\u201d \ntheir religious practice of directing the education of \ntheir children on religiously sensitive subjects con-\ncerning gender and sexuality. Ibid.; see also Kennedy, \n597 U.S. at 525 (assessing burden in a like manner). \nInhibiting this \u201ctraditional interest of parents with re-\nspect to the religious upbringing of their children\u201d is \n\n44 \n \nsufficient to trigger both the \u201csubstantial interference\u201d \nanalysis under Yoder and principles of neutrality and \ngeneral applicability under Lukumi. Yoder, 406 U.S. \nat 214; Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 525. \nSecond, in cases from Sherbert to Carson, the Court \nhas long rejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019s standard of \u201cac-\ntual coercion\u201d to change one\u2019s beliefs. In Sherbert, for \nexample, the plaintiff was denied state unemployment \nfor failure to \u201caccept available suitable work\u201d after she \nwas \u201cdischarged\u201d for not being available to \u201cwork on \nSaturday\u201d\u2014her sabbath. Sherbert v. Verner, 374 U.S. \n398, 399-401, 399 n.2 (1963). The Court held that be-\ning \u201cforce[d]  * * *  to choose\u201d between benefits and her \nfaith was a \u201csubstantial infringement\u201d of her \u201cFirst \nAmendment right.\u201d Id. at 404, 406. It was sufficient \nthat the condition on benefits \u201cinevitably deterred or \ndiscouraged the exercise of First Amendment rights.\u201d \nId. at 405. \nSimilarly, in Trinity Lutheran, the state had \nbarred a religious school from participating in a play-\nground refurbishment program. Trinity Lutheran \nChurch of Columbia, Inc. v. Comer, 582 U.S. 449, 454-\n456 (2017). The state argued that \u201cdeclining to extend\u201d \na subsidy did not \u201cburden\u201d the church\u2019s religious exer-\ncise, because it did \u201cnot prohibit the Church from en-\ngaging in any religious conduct or otherwise exercising \nits religious rights.\u201d Id. at 462-463. But the Court re-\njected that argument, concluding it was \u201ctoo late in the \nday to doubt that the liberties of religion and expres-\nsion may be infringed by the denial of or placing of con-\nditions upon a benefit or privilege.\u201d Id. at 463. \u201cWhere \nthe state conditions receipt of an important benefit \nupon conduct proscribed by a religious faith  * * *  a \n\n45 \n \nburden upon religion exists.\u201d Thomas v. Review Bd. of \nInd. Emp. Sec. Div., 450 U.S. 707, 717-718 (1981). \nPublic education cannot be described as anything \nless than an \u201cimportant\u201d public benefit. Pet.App.139a \n(\u201cCertainly, public education is a valuable public ben-\nefit.\u201d). Indeed, the Maryland constitution entitles Pe-\ntitioners to \u201cFree Public Schools.\u201d Md. Const. Art. VIII \n\u00a7 1. \u201cIn these days, it is doubtful that any child may \nreasonably be expected to succeed in life if he is denied \nthe opportunity of an education.\u201d Brown v. Board of \nEduc., 347 U.S. 483, 493 (1954). Yet Petitioners must \neither deny their children that opportunity (at the cost \nof private schooling, homeschooling, or criminal penal-\nties and fines) or subject them to compelled participa-\ntion in instruction that violates their religious beliefs. \nBecause this \u201cinevitably deters or discourages the ex-\nercise of First Amendment rights,\u201d Espinoza, 591 U.S. \nat 478, that is a religious burden sufficient to trigger \nprinciples of neutrality and general applicability.  \nThe Board still contends there is no burden because \nPetitioners remain \u201cfree to impart their religion at \nhome.\u201d Resp. C.A. Br. 27. But Barnette rejected this \nargument over 80 years ago in reversing Gobitis. Go-\nbitis had upheld children of Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses being \nforced to salute the American flag against their par-\nents\u2019 religious objections. Minersville Sch. Dist. v. Go-\nbitis, 310 U.S. 586, 591-592 (1940). The Court rested \nits holding on judicial deference to public schools: \u201cthe \ncourt-room is not the arena for debating issues of edu-\ncational policy.\u201d Id. at 598. As such, the Court con-\ncluded that the Free Exercise Clause was not offended \nby forced participation of students against their par-\nents\u2019 religious beliefs\u2014so long as the parents retained \nthe ability \u201cto counteract by their own persuasiveness \n\n46 \n \nthe wisdom and rightness of those loyalties which the \nstate\u2019s educational system [was] seeking to promote.\u201d \nId. at 599.  \nWhen reversing Gobitis, the Court refused to let \n\u201cmodest estimates\u201d of its judicial competence in \u201csuch \nspecialties as public education\u201d be an escape hatch \nfrom enforcing the Free Exercise Clause. Barnette, 319 \nU.S. at 640. Regardless of what parents could teach at \nhome, the Court concluded that \u201cif we are not to stran-\ngle the free mind at its source and teach youth to dis-\ncount important principles of our government as mere \nplatitudes,\u201d the government\u2014\u201cBoards of education not \nexcepted\u201d\u2014could not ignore \u201cthe limits of the Bill of \nRights.\u201d Id. at 637. Similarly, in Espinoza and Carson, \nit did not matter that parents were already paying tu-\nition without the state subsidy. Espinoza, 591 U.S. at \n470-471; Carson v. Makin, 596 U.S. 767, 775-776 \n(2022). And in Kennedy, it \u201cdid not matter\u201d that \u201cthe \nhigh school football coach could have prayed at home.\u201d \nPet.App.64a. Nor do Petitioners\u2019 First Amendment \nrights yield at the school-bus or carpool drop-off.  \n*  \n*  \n* \nUnder any common-sense understanding of the \nterm, a school \u201cburdens\u201d parents\u2019 religious beliefs \nwhen it forces their children to undergo classroom in-\nstruction about gender and sexuality at odds with \ntheir religious convictions. Especially when that in-\nstruction is specifically designed to \u201c[d]isrupt\u201d the \nchild\u2019s beliefs, the burden is obvious and must undergo \nstrict scrutiny. \n\n47 \n \nII. The Board\u2019s actions fail strict scrutiny. \nThe Board cannot possibly satisfy strict scrutiny.  \n1. In the courts below, the Board claimed three po-\ntential compelling interests: avoiding \u201csignificant dis-\nruptions\u201d in the classroom; ensuring a \u201csafe and con-\nducive\u201d learning environment free from \u201csocial stigma \nand isolation\u201d; and complying with \u201cstate and federal \nnondiscrimination laws.\u201d Pet.App.607a-608a. The \nCourt \u201ccannot accept such  * * *  sweeping claim[s].\u201d \nYoder, 406 U.S. at 221. Rather, \u201cthe First Amendment \ndemands a more precise analysis.\u201d Fulton, 593 U.S. at \n541. The Board must show \u201cthe asserted harm of \ngranting specific exemptions to particular religious \nclaimants.\u201d Ibid. \nFurther, to justify its \u201crelatively recent\u201d with-\ndrawal of all notice and opt-outs, the Board must ex-\nplain how the withdrawal serves a compelling interest \nhistorically sufficient to justify the resulting interfer-\nence with the \u201cenduring American tradition\u201d of paren-\ntal direction in religious upbringing. Yoder, 406 U.S. \nat 226-227, 232. Here, that tradition is manifest in the \nlongstanding, nationwide consensus allowing parents \nto opt their children out of instruction on human sex-\nuality and gender. \nThe Board\u2019s efforts to advance compelling interests \n\u201c[d]espite this long history\u201d are unlikely to succeed. \nRamirez v. Collier, 595 U.S. 411, 428 (2022); see also \nid. at 442-443 (Kavanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cOften, the \nCourt also examines history and contemporary state \npractice to inform the inquiries\u201d into \u201ccompelling\u201d in-\nterests and \u201cleast restrictive\u201d means). In the first \nplace, the Board\u2019s interests cannot be justified by his-\ntory or tradition: none are based on \u201cconduct or actions \n\n48 \n \nso regulated [that] have invariably posed some sub-\nstantial threat to public safety, peace or order.\u201d Yoder, \n406 U.S. at 230; see also Fulton, 593 U.S. at 555 (Alito, \nJ., \nconcurring \nin \njudgment) \n(\u201cthis \ndescrip-\ntion  * * *  corresponds closely with the understanding \nof the scope of the free-exercise right at the time of the \nFirst Amendment\u2019s adoption\u201d). An interest unjustified \nby history or tradition is presumptively not compel-\nling. See McDaniel v. Paty, 435 U.S. 618, 628 (1978) \n(\u201cTennessee has failed to demonstrate that its views of \nthe dangers of clergy participation in the political pro-\ncess have not lost whatever validity they may once \nhave enjoyed.\u201d). For that reason alone, the Board\u2019s pol-\nicy flunks strict scrutiny as to all three of its claimed \ninterests. \nBut even if a distinct history and tradition uphold-\ning the Board\u2019s claimed interests could be identified, \nthe Board\u2019s own actions make clear that the Board has \nnot treated them as compelling here. First, with re-\nspect to its interest in avoiding disruption, the \nBoard\u2014which oversees a district of more than 160,000 \nstudents\u2014has cited \u201cone instance\u201d at one school of \n\u201cdozens of students\u201d seeking opt-outs. Pet.App.607a. \nThis Court has previously \u201crejected\u201d the argument \nthat the risk of \u201cmany\u201d requests is itself a reason to \ndeny a religious accommodation. Holt v. Hobbs, 574 \nU.S. 352, 368 (2015). Holding otherwise would mean \nthat the more religiously offensive the government \nconduct, the more courts must defer to the offending \ngovernment\u2014at the expense of First Amendment \nrights. The Constitution does not endorse such moral \nhazard.  \nMoreover, the Board has not even attempted to \ndemonstrate a \u201cdirect causal link\u201d between allowing \n\n49 \n \nreligious-based opt-outs and losing control of public \nschool classrooms. Brown v. Entertainment Merchs. \nAss\u2019n, 564 U.S. 786, 799 (2011); cf. Mahanoy Area Sch. \nDist. v. B.L., 594 U.S. 180, 188 (2021) (\u201cspecial interest \nin regulating speech\u201d arises only if speech \u201cmaterially \ndisrupts classwork or involves substantial disorder or \ninvasion of the rights of others\u201d). And such a compel-\nling interest is unlikely to emerge overnight. Yet here, \nthat is literally what the Board would have to show: \nwhy notice and religious-based opt-outs were not dis-\nruptive through March 22, 2023, but became so on \nMarch 23, 2023, when the Board announced its 180-\ndegree policy turn\u2014which, even then, it did not imple-\nment until the next school year. Such a showing is par-\nticularly difficult given the ability of school districts \nnationwide to manage similar opt-outs and the Board \nitself having allowed opt-outs from so many other \nparts of its programming for so many years. Supra 6-\n7. \u201c[W]hen so many [others] offer an accommodation, \na [school district] must, at a minimum, offer persua-\nsive reasons why it believes that it must take a differ-\nent course, and the [Board] failed to make that show-\ning here.\u201d Holt, 574 U.S. at 369.  \nSecond, the Board also cannot justify a compelling \ninterest in a \u201csafe and conducive\u201d learning environ-\nment free from \u201cstigma and isolation.\u201d Pet.App.607a-\n608a. While such a goal may be \u201ccommendable\u201d on the \nsurface, it is insufficiently \u201cmeasurable\u201d to \u201cbe sub-\njected to meaningful judicial review,\u201d Students for Fair \nAdmissions, Inc. v. President & Fellows of Harvard \nCollege, 600 U.S. 181, 214 (2023). When it comes to re-\nducing stigma by \u201clearning about gender and sexuality \nidentity diversity,\u201d Pet.App.638a, \u201c[h]ow is a court to \nknow whether [students] have been adequately\u201d in-\nstructed? Students for Fair Admissions, 600 U.S. at \n\n50 \n \n214. And \u201chow is a court to know when\u201d a stigma-free \nenvironment has \u201cbeen reached?\u201d Ibid. \u201cThere is no \nparticular point\u201d at which a court could conclude that \nsuch an \u201celusive\u201d goal has been met. Id. at 214-215. \nFurthermore, the Board \u201cfail[s] to articulate a \nmeaningful connection between the means [it] em-\nploy[s] and the goal[ ] [it] pursue[s].\u201d Students for Fair \nAdmissions, 600 U.S. at 215. It cannot just \u201cmake a \npredictive judgment that such a link exists.\u201d Brown, \n564 U.S. at 799. Indeed, as the Board\u2019s own elemen-\ntary school principals have already observed, the man-\ndated instruction is itself \u201cshaming\u201d to students with \ncontrary views and \u201cdismissive of [their] religious be-\nliefs.\u201d Pet.App.619a-620a. This poses no less risk of \n\u201csocial stigma\u201d to these students than to those \u201cwho \nbelieve that the books represent them.\u201d Pet.App.607a-\n608a. Thus, even assuming a causal benefit for some \nstudents, it comes at a cost for others. \u201c[A] law cannot \nbe regarded as protecting an interest \u2018of the highest \norder\u2019  * * *  when it leaves appreciable damage to \nthat supposedly vital interest unprohibited.\u201d Lukumi, \n508 U.S. at 547. And the First Amendment warns \nagainst \u201c[s]truggles to coerce uniformity of sentiment \nin support of some end thought essential to [the] time.\u201d \nBarnette, 319 U.S. at 640. \u201cAs governmental pressure \ntoward unity becomes greater, so strife becomes more \nbitter as to whose unity it shall be.\u201d Id. at 641. \nThird, the Board has not identified any state or fed-\neral laws the Board might violate by honoring reli-\ngious opt-outs. The very idea runs headlong into \u201cpre-\nserving the promise of the free exercise of religion en-\nshrined in our Constitution.\u201d Bostock v. Clayton \nCounty, 590 U.S. 644, 681 (2020). And although an in-\nterest in \u201cequal treatment\u201d may well be \u201cweighty,\u201d the \n\n51 \n \nCourt has never deemed it sufficient to deny individu-\nals \u201can exception for [their] religious exercise.\u201d Fulton, \n593 U.S. at 542. To the contrary, \u201cthe First Amend-\nment does not tolerate\u201d forced uniformity \u201cabout a \nquestion of political and religious significance.\u201d 303 \nCreative LLC v. Elenis, 600 U.S. 570, 596 (2023) (citing \nBarnette, 319 U.S. at 634). That First Amendment rule \nprotects the full spectrum of viewpoints\u2014from the \n\u201csensible and well intentioned\u201d to the \u201cdeeply \u2018mis-\nguided.\u2019\u201d Id. at 586. That protection extends to Peti-\ntioners here. Directing their children according to \ntheir \u201cdecent and honorable\u201d religious views about hu-\nman sexuality and gender identity is exactly what \nthey are doing. Obergefell, 576 U.S. at 672.  \n2.  The Board also fails the least restrictive means \nanalysis. \u201c[S]o long as the government can achieve its \ninterests in a manner that does not burden religion, it \nmust do so.\u201d Fulton, 593 U.S. at 541. But here, the \nBoard \u201chas failed to offer any showing that it has even \nconsidered less restrictive measures than those imple-\nmented here.\u201d Fellowship of Christian Athletes v. San \nJose Unified Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ., 82 F.4th 664, 694 \n(9th Cir. 2023) (en banc) (citing Thomas, 450 U.S. at \n718). That is reason alone for failing the least restric-\ntive means test. Indeed, as mentioned, the Board has \nnever explained its very public flip-flop. Why were opt-\nouts from the storybook discussions perfectly fine on \nMarch 22, 2023, but \u201cdisruptive\u201d the very next day? \nSuch a volte-face provides no \u201cbasis for deference.\u201d \nRamirez, 595 U.S. at 429. \nIt takes no special creativity to see that less restric-\ntive means exist. The Board could, for example, leave \nreading and discussing the storybooks up to the stu-\ndents. The Board could ask that the books be left on \n\n52 \n \nshelves, rather than require teachers to read and dis-\ncuss them in class. Or, like in Maryland\u2019s Carroll \nCounty, the Board could teach the importance of \n\u201ctreat[ing] all people with dignity and respect\u201d without \ndelving into \u201call gender identities and expressions.\u201d \nApproval of Family Life Advisory Committee Opt-Out \nRecommendations for Grades PreK through 5 Family \nLife Unit at 3-1, Carroll County Public Schools (Jan. \n11, 2023), https://perma.cc/A7BB-R35Y.  \nThe Board simply cannot \u201cdemonstrate\u201d why a to-\ntal denial of religious-based opt-outs is the least re-\nstrictive means of protecting its alleged interests\u2014es-\npecially considering nationwide practice to the con-\ntrary. See Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 407 & n.7 (discussing \nthe workability of granting benefits in analogous situ-\nations nationwide); Ramirez, 595 U.S. at 444 (Ka-\nvanaugh, J., concurring) (\u201cexperience matters\u201d). Yet \nthe Board has never even tried to make this \u201cmini-\nmum\u201d showing. Holt, 574 U.S. at 369. That is, the \nBoard has never demonstrated why it \u201cmust take a dif-\nferent course\u201d than 47 states allowing opt-outs for sex-\nuality instruction. Ibid.  \nIn sum, the Board\u2019s strict scrutiny defense reduces \nto the \u201cclassic rejoinder of bureaucrats throughout his-\ntory: If I make an exception for you, I\u2019ll have to make \none for everybody, so no exceptions.\u201d Gonzales v. O \nCentro Esp\u00edrita Beneficente Uni\u00e3o do Vegetal, 546 U.S. \n418, 436 (2006). But this Court has never accepted \nthat argument in any of its Free Exercise cases. This \nshould not be the first.  \n \n \n\n53 \n \n*  \n*  \n* \n\u201cThe child is not the mere creature of the State; \nthose who nurture him and direct his destiny have the \nright, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and pre-\npare him for additional obligations.\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. \nat 233. At the core of that duty are Petitioners\u2019 reli-\ngious beliefs about human sexuality and gender. The \nBoard wants to disrupt Petitioners\u2019 efforts to pass \nthose beliefs on to their young children. But the Free \nExercise Clause protects Petitioners\u2019 right and high \nduty. Breaking the bond of parent and child should \nnever be the price of public education. \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision below should be reversed. \n \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC S.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation was a `THINK` action, representing internal reasoning about strategy. As such, it provided no new factual or legal information about the *Mahmoud v. Taylor* case. My task-level beliefs remain stable, with the primary knowledge gap still being the contents of the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.\n\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Core Conflict):** The case continues to be defined by the tension between the parents' First Amendment Free Exercise rights and the school board's authority to set a uniform curriculum. The central question remains whether denying an opt-out from instruction involving LGBTQ-inclusive books constitutes a \"cognizable burden\" on religious freedom, a standard the petitioners must meet. The petitioners' arguments will likely draw from *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, while the school board will defend its policy as \"neutral and generally applicable\" under *Employment Division v. Smith*.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Lower Court Rationale):** My understanding of the Fourth Circuit's denial of a preliminary injunction is unchanged. The majority's conclusion that \"mere exposure\" to ideas that contradict religious beliefs does not constitute a constitutional burden, particularly on the \"scant record\" available at this early stage, remains the key legal hurdle for the petitioners.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Signals Favoring SCOTUS Review):** The strong indicators that the Supreme Court will grant certiorari are unaffected. These include Judge Quattlebaum's detailed dissent, the significant amicus curiae participation from numerous states on both sides, and the involvement of elite legal advocates (Becket Fund, WilmerHale), all of which signal a high-stakes, nationally significant legal question.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Key Evidence):** The specific content of the \"Storybooks\" (e.g., *Pride Puppy!*, *Born Ready*) remains a critical factual element. The petitioners will use this content to argue that the curriculum is not religiously neutral and actively introduces concepts and terminology that directly conflict with their faith-based duties.\n*   **Reinforced Knowledge Gap:** This `THINK` action explicitly acknowledges that the previous attempt to find the *Petition for a Writ of Certiorari* failed. This confirms that this document remains the most critical missing piece of information. Without it, I cannot know the precise questions presented to the Court or the specific legal arguments the petitioners are using to frame the Fourth Circuit's decision as review-worthy. My predictive analysis is stalled pending the acquisition of this document.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an explicit articulation of the agent's reasoning process, provides a powerful validation of the DBOED framework and reinforces recently developed heuristics. It demonstrates the practical application of learning from failure.\n\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Core Framework):** The foundational DBOED model of separating task (\u03b8) and design (D) beliefs, and the high-level heuristics for identifying cert-worthy cases (dissents, amici, elite counsel), remain effective and are the bedrock of my analysis.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (The Value of Strategic Pauses):** This `THINK` action provides a textbook example of the value of reflective pauses. The sequence is now clear: 1) A `THINK` action identified a high-value information target (the Petition). 2) An `ACTION` attempted to acquire it and failed. 3) This new `THINK` action diagnoses the failure and plans a revised, more robust action. This demonstrates a crucial, iterative research loop: **Plan -> Act -> Assess -> Refine**. This meta-heuristic is fundamental to navigating complex information environments.\n*   **Operationalized Heuristic (Search Failure Recovery):** The previous belief update formulated a new heuristic for recovering from a failed search. This observation shows that heuristic being put into practice. The agent is not just flailing; it is methodically applying its new rule: \"If a highly specific search fails, broaden the parameters.\" The internal thought process explicitly references the previous failure and details the plan to remove the `link_name` filter and simplify the `proceeding_title` filter. This transition from a learned concept to an operational plan is a significant evolution in my design effectiveness.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** The strategy of seeking the objective record (lower court opinions) before the advocacy documents (the Petition) remains sound. The current impasse, caused by the inability to find the Petition, highlights why having the foundational record first is so important\u2014it provides a stable analytical baseline while I troubleshoot the search for the next layer of information.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (The Importance of Procedural Posture):** My focus on the \"preliminary injunction\" standard continues to be a correct and important lens. The difficulty in obtaining the Petition indirectly reinforces the current importance of the Fourth Circuit's opinion, as it is the most complete analysis of the legal issues available to me at this moment."

          "task_beliefs": "The acquisition of the petitioners' opening merits brief is a monumental development, fundamentally shifting the nature of the task from predicting a grant of certiorari to predicting the final outcome on the merits. My knowledge has been massively updated, resolving the most critical information gap and providing a clear roadmap of the petitioners' legal strategy.\n\n*   **Massive Update (Procedural Posture):** The Supreme Court has **granted certiorari**. The search for a cert petition was superseded by the discovery of the \"Brief for Petitioners\" on the merits, dated March 2025. This confirms that the case has advanced to the merits stage. My task is no longer to assess the probability of a cert grant but to analyze the arguments and predict how the Court will rule on the central legal question.\n*   **Resolved Knowledge Gap (Question Presented):** I now have the precise question the Court will decide: **\"Do public schools burden parents\u2019 religious exercise when they compel elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents\u2019 religious convictions and without notice or opportunity to opt out?\"** This framing places the Free Exercise Clause at the absolute center of the dispute.\n*   **Clarified Legal Arguments (Petitioners' Strategy):** The brief reveals a multi-layered offensive strategy designed to appeal to different wings of the Court's conservative majority:\n    1.  **The *Yoder* Argument:** The primary argument is that *Wisconsin v. Yoder* protects the right of parents \"to guide the religious future and education of their children.\" They argue that compelling young children to participate in instruction designed to \"disrupt\" their thinking on religiously sensitive topics like gender and sexuality constitutes a \"substantial interference\" with this right, triggering strict scrutiny.\n    2.  **The *Smith*/*Fulton* Exception Argument:** As a powerful alternative, they argue the school board's policy is not \"neutral and generally applicable\" under *Employment Division v. Smith*. The evidence for this is the existence of a system of \"discretionary and ad hoc exemptions\" for other types of instruction (e.g., sex ed in health class, Halloween activities) and the fact that the board *specifically rescinded* the opt-out for this curriculum in response to religious objections. This argument leans heavily on the logic of *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* and *Tandon v. Newsom*, which found that systems allowing for secular exemptions are not \"generally applicable\" and must satisfy strict scrutiny if they burden religion.\n    3.  **The Overrule *Smith* Argument:** As a maximalist fallback, the petitioners explicitly invite the Court to overrule *Smith* if it is seen as a barrier to their *Yoder* claim, arguing it is in \"direct conflict with free-exercise guarantees.\"\n*   **Reinforced Factual Basis:** The brief solidifies the key facts the petitioners will rely on:\n    *   **National Consensus:** The claim that 47 states and D.C. allow for opt-outs from sex education, framing Montgomery County's policy as a radical outlier.\n    *   **Hostility and Non-Neutrality:** The allegation that the Board made \"hateful comments comparing the (religiously and racially diverse) Petitioners to \u2018white supremacists\u2019\" is presented as direct evidence of non-neutrality, invoking the precedent of *Masterpiece Cakeshop*.\n    *   **Prior Policy:** The fact that the Board's own prior guidelines allowed for opt-outs from any activity that imposed a \"substantial burden on their religious beliefs\" will be used to argue the Board itself once recognized the validity of the parents' claim.\n*   **Updated Prediction:** The path to a victory for the petitioners is now exceptionally clear. Their *Fulton*-style argument\u2014that the existence of any other opt-out makes the denial of a religious opt-out subject to strict scrutiny\u2014is tailored perfectly to the current Court's majority. The heavy reliance on recent majority opinions in *Kennedy v. Bremerton*, *Carson v. Makin*, and *Fulton* signals a strong belief that they have the votes. It seems highly probable that the petitioners will prevail, likely on the grounds that the policy is not neutral and generally applicable.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful lesson in search strategy, the relative value of different legal documents, and the importance of being prepared for unexpected but highly valuable discoveries. My methodological framework has been significantly refined.\n\n*   **Validated Heuristic (Search Failure Recovery):** The \"Plan -> Act -> Assess -> Refine\" research loop has been proven highly effective. The previous failure to find the cert petition led to a refined search strategy (broadening the query by removing specific filters), which succeeded. This confirms that methodical iteration is superior to random searching.\n*   **New Heuristic (The \"Merits Surprise\"):** A crucial new heuristic has emerged: **A search for an early-stage document (cert petition) may unexpectedly yield a later-stage, higher-value document (merits brief).** This indicates that the procedural posture of a case can advance faster than assumed. One should not be rigidly locked into finding a specific document but be alert for any primary source that reveals the current state of the case. This \"failure\" to find the cert petition was actually a major success in information gathering.\n*   **Refined Heuristic (Source Value Hierarchy):** The value of primary legal documents has been clarified and re-ordered. The petitioners' merits brief is the single most valuable document obtained so far, as it contains the precise question presented and the full legal architecture of the argument. The hierarchy is now: **1) Merits Briefs > 2) Cert-Stage Briefs (Petition, BIO) > 3) Lower Court Opinions (especially dissents) > 4) Factual Case Summaries.**\n*   **New Heuristic (Argument Analysis via Precedent):** A new analytical method is now clear: **Analyze a brief's Table of Authorities as a strategic roadmap.** The specific cases cited, especially recent ones (*Fulton*, *Kennedy*, *Carson*), are not just legal wallpaper; they are signals indicating which legal framework the advocates believe will be most persuasive to the current Court and which justices they are targeting.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Core Framework):** The foundational DBOED model remains robust. The initial signals of cert-worthiness (strong dissent, elite counsel, amicus participation) were validated, as the Court did indeed grant review. This reinforces the reliability of these heuristics for identifying cases of national significance early in their lifecycle."

The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s straightforward application of this \nCourt\u2019s precedent to the limited evidence petitioners of-\nfered in support of their motion for preliminary relief \ndoes not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention.   \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), Mary-\nland\u2019s largest school district, serves more than 160,000 \nstudents.  Every day, these students read and discuss \nbooks as part of MCPS\u2019s language-arts curriculum.  \nThese reading materials have not always reflected the \ndiversity of the community MCPS serves.  In recent \nyears, the school district has worked to change that by \nincorporating new books to better represent MCPS stu-\ndents and families.  These books now include characters, \nfamilies, and historical figures from a range of cultural, \nracial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.  \nAs part of this effort, at the start of the 2022-2023 \nschool year, MCPS approved a handful of storybooks \nfeaturing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer \ncharacters for use in the language-arts curriculum, \nalongside the many books already in the curriculum that \nfeature heterosexual characters in traditional gender \nroles.  Like all other books in the language-arts curricu-\nlum, these storybooks impart critical reading skills \nthrough engaging, age-appropriate stories.  MCPS ad-\nheres to a careful, public, participatory selection process \nto ensure those criteria are met.  That process, followed \nhere, welcomes and incorporates parent feedback.   \n\n2 \n \n \nFrom the beginning, MCPS\u2019s goal has been for stu-\ndents to engage with these storybooks as they engage \nwith any other book in the language-arts curriculum.  \nThe storybooks are not used in any lessons related to \ngender and sexuality.  Nor is any student asked or ex-\npected to change his or her views about his or her own, \nor any other student\u2019s, sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  Instead, the books are made available for indi-\nvidual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educa-\ntional activities designed to foster and enhance literacy \nskills. \nPetitioners include three sets of parents who asked \nMCPS to notify them, excuse their children from class, \nand arrange alternate lessons whenever the storybooks \nare read.  After MCPS announced in March 2023 that it \nwould not permit any parents to opt their children out of \nlanguage-arts instruction involving the storybooks, for \nany reason, petitioners sued.  Petitioners also moved for \na preliminary injunction requiring notice and opt outs, \narguing that their children\u2019s \u201cexposure\u201d to the story-\nbooks \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a burden\u201d \non their right to freely exercise their religion.  \nPet.App.37a.  The district court denied the motion. \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\ntioners were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nbased on the \u201cscant record\u201d before it.  Pet.App.9a.  Ap-\nplying a standard drawn straight from this Court\u2019s free-\nexercise precedent, and in line with every relevant court \nof appeals decision, the Fourth Circuit explained that a \ncognizable burden on religious exercise requires coer-\ncion, direct or indirect, to believe or act contrary to one\u2019s \nreligious views.  Petitioners failed to demonstrate a like-\nlihood of success on their free-exercise claim, as they of-\nfered \u201cno evidence\u201d of such coercion.  Pet.App.34a.  \n\n3 \n \n \nSpecifically, petitioners advanced no evidence that \nMCPS pressured their children to affirm or disavow par-\nticular views, compelled their children to act in violation \nof their religious beliefs, influenced what petitioners \ncould teach their own children, or denied petitioners ac-\ncess to public benefits.  Pet.App.34a-48a.  This \u201cabsence \nof proof\u201d doomed petitioners\u2019 request for emergency re-\nlief.   \nThere is no circuit split on this issue.  Every single \ncourt of appeals that has considered the question has \nheld that mere exposure to controversial issues in a pub-\nlic-school curriculum does not burden the free religious \nexercise of parents or students.  Nor is there any conflict \nbetween the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding and this Court\u2019s \nfree-exercise decisions, which the Fourth Circuit faith-\nfully applied and petitioners misconstrue.  And there is \nno pressing question raised by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s con-\nclusion in a preliminary-injunction posture that petition-\ners\u2019 free-exercise claim was not likely to succeed absent \nany evidence of coercion that could constitute a burden \non religious free exercise.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, parents who can demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess in showing religious coercion in a public school \nthat does not survive scrutiny may obtain preliminary \nrelief.  Parents who cannot make that showing, but who \ncan plausibly allege facts suggesting such unjustified co-\nercion, will proceed to discovery.  And if the facts bear \nout those allegations, they will obtain permanent relief.  \nThere is no pressing question here. \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n4 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Storybooks \nAt the start of the 2022-2023 school year, MCPS in-\ntroduced into its pre-K through twelfth grade language-\narts curriculum several storybooks featuring lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer characters.  \nPet.App.603a-604a.  The storybooks were added as part \nof MCPS\u2019s commitment to \u201cprovid[ing] a culturally re-\nsponsive \u2026 curriculum that promotes equity, respect, \nand civility.\u201d  Pet.App.589a.  MCPS believes that \u201c[r]ep-\nresentation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a \nfully inclusive environment for all students\u201d and \u201csup-\nports a student\u2019s ability to empathize, connect, and col-\nlaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for \nall.\u201d  Pet.App.603a.  The language-arts curriculum there-\nfore seeks to ensure that students can \u201c[s]elect[] from a \nrange of diverse texts to understand and appreciate mul-\ntiple perspectives.\u201d  Pet.App.599a.  As part of this effort, \nMCPS had previously made similar efforts to update the \nlanguage-arts curriculum with books featuring people \nand characters from different backgrounds.  Some exam-\nples include the March trilogy, which recounts the life of \ncivil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, and The Leav-\ners, which tells the story of an Asian-American immi-\ngrant family.  Pet.App.602a-603a.  In a similar vein, \nMCPS updated its social-studies curriculum with new in-\nstructional materials about local history.  Id. \nThe storybooks were approved for instructional use \npursuant to MCPS\u2019s written policy for selecting new in-\nstructional materials.  Pet.App.600a-601a, 603a-604a; \nCAJA513-514.  Under that policy, MCPS seeks to ensure \nthat the materials are \u201cage/grade appropriate[],\u201d \u201csup-\nport \u2026 student achievement toward MCPS curriculum \nstandards,\u201d and are \u201crelevant to and reflective of the \n\n5 \n \n \nmulticultural \nsociety \nand \nglobal \ncommunity.\u201d  \nPet.App.600a-601a; CAJA513-514, 521, 523.  Before se-\nlecting the storybooks, a committee of six reading and \ninstructional specialists participated in multiple rounds \nof evaluations to determine that each book would be a \nsuitable addition to the curriculum based on these crite-\nria.  CAJA513; see also Pet.App.603a-604a.  This process \nincluded an opportunity for parents to review the story-\nbooks and provide feedback, and all such feedback was \nconsidered before any storybook was approved.  \nPet.App.601a. \nThe storybooks tell everyday tales of characters \nwho experience adventure, confront new emotions, and \nstruggle to make themselves heard.  They include a \nstory about a family attending a Pride parade, a niece \nmeeting her uncle\u2019s husband-to-be, a prince falling in \nlove with a knight as they battle a dragon in a mythical \nkingdom, a girl feeling nervous about giving a valentine \nto her crush, and a transgender boy sharing his gender \nidentity with his family.  Pet.App.254a-271a, 279a-306a, \n390a-428a, 429a-447a, 448a-482a.  These are archetypal \nstories that touch on the same themes introduced to chil-\ndren in such classic books as Snow White, Cinderella, \nand Peter Pan.  In addition to helping students explore \nsentence structure, word choice, and style, the story-\nbooks support students\u2019 ability to empathize, connect, \nand collaborate with peers and encourage respect for all.  \nPet.App.603a, 605a-606a.   \nThe storybooks are, moreover, \u201ca small subset of \nmany books used in the MCPS [language-arts] curricu-\nlum.\u201d  Pet.App.132a.  Teachers are expected to fold them \ninto the curriculum as they would any other book:  They \ncan put the storybooks on shelves for students to find \nthemselves, recommend a particular storybook to a \n\n6 \n \n \nstudent who would enjoy it, read the storybooks aloud, \nor offer them as an option for reading groups.  \nPet.App.604a-605a. \n \nMCPS made clear to teachers that using the story-\nbooks involves no instruction on sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  Pet.App.605a, 636a-641a.  Some chal-\nlenged books simply include LGBTQ characters.  Others \nhighlight the importance of kindness to others.  None \ntakes a side in any religious or scientific debate sur-\nrounding gender or sexuality.  And teachers are not per-\nmitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular \nviewpoint.  Indeed, a guidance document for teachers \nstates that \u201c[n]o child who does not agree with or under-\nstand another student\u2019s gender, expression, or their sex-\nual identity is asked to change how they feel about it.\u201d  \nPet.App.640a.  MCPS prepared teachers to use the sto-\nrybooks by offering a professional-development session \nas well as sample responses to potential student ques-\ntions; these optional \u201csuggested responses focus[ed] on \ntolerance, empathy, and respect for different views.\u201d  \nPet.App.89a-95a.1  \nB. The No-Opt-Out Policy \nAfter the storybooks were introduced, some parents \nrequested that their children be excused from class \nwhen \nthe \nstorybooks \nwere \nread \nor \ndiscussed.  \nPet.App.606a.  Some opt-out requests were religion-\nbased and others were not.  Some parents opposed a \n \n1 Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, this guidance did not \u201cdi-\nrect[] teachers to frame disagreement with\u201d the storybooks \u201cas \n\u2018hurtful.\u2019\u201d  Pet.13.  The guidance instead suggested that if a student \ndescribes another person as \u201cweird,\u201d a teacher could respond, \u201cThat \ncomment is hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk about \npeople\u2019s identities.\u201d  Pet.App.94a. \n\n7 \n \n \nperceived effort to teach students about sex or gender \nidentity or believed the materials were age-inappropri-\nate.  Id. \nAt first, teachers and principals sought to accommo-\ndate these requests by excusing students when the \nbooks were read in class.  Pet.App.606a-607a.  The grow-\ning number of opt-out requests, however, gave rise to \nthree related concerns: high student absenteeism, the in-\nfeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms \nand schools, and the risk of exposing students who be-\nlieve the storybooks represent them and their families \nto social stigma and isolation.  Pet.App.96a-99a, 606a-\n608a.  These consequences would defeat MCPS\u2019s \u201cefforts \nto ensure a classroom environment that is safe and con-\nducive to learning for all students\u201d and risk putting \nMCPS out of compliance with nondiscrimination laws.  \nPet.App.98a-99a, 607a-608a. \nMCPS therefore determined that permitting opt-\nouts was not feasible or consistent with its curricular \ngoals.  Pet.App.608a.  It announced in March 2023 that \nno opt-outs from instruction using the storybooks would \nbe granted \u201cfor any reason.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \nIn May 2023, petitioners sued the Montgomery \nCounty Board of Education, its members, and the Super-\nintendent of Schools, asserting violations of the federal \nFree Exercise, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses \nand a violation of Maryland law.  Pet.App.107a-108a.  Pe-\ntitioners then moved for a preliminary injunction on \ntheir free-exercise and due-process claims, seeking to \nrequire MCPS to provide them notice and opt-out oppor-\ntunities whenever the storybooks are read or discussed.  \nPet.App.76a-77a.  In July 2023, petitioners amended \ntheir \ncomplaint \nto \nadd \nplaintiff \nKids \nFirst.  \n\n8 \n \n \nPet.App.162a-163a.  The district court denied the pre-\nliminary-injunction motion in August 2023.  The Fourth \nCircuit denied petitioners\u2019 motion for an injunction \npending appeal and, in May 2024, affirmed the denial of \na preliminary injunction. \nIn an opinion written by Judge Agee and joined by \nJudge Benjamin, the court of appeals agreed with the \ndistrict court that petitioners had not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits given their \u201cbroad \nclaims, the very high burden required to obtain a prelim-\ninary injunction, and the scant record before [it].\u201d  \nPet.App.9a.  The court recognized that the Free Exer-\ncise Clause protects against government action that di-\nrectly or indirectly compels religious belief or threatens \nthe ability to act in accordance with one\u2019s faith.  \nPet.App.24a-25a.  The court thus explained that, \u201cto \nshow a cognizable burden\u201d on religious exercise, peti-\ntioners were required to \u201cshow that the absence of an \nopt-out opportunity coerces them or their children to be-\nlieve or act contrary to their religious views.\u201d  \nPet.App.31a.  That coercion could be \u201cdirect or indirect.\u201d  \nId. \nApplying those familiar principles, the Fourth Cir-\ncuit rejected petitioners\u2019 theory that \u201cthe lack of an \nacross-the-board notice and an opt-out opportunity re-\nlating to the Storybooks, in and of itself, coerces them \nand their children in the free exercise of their religion.\u201d  \nPet.App.33a-34a.  The court held that petitioners put \nforward \u201cno evidence\u201d that the no-opt-out policy com-\npelled them or their children \u201cto change their religious \nbeliefs or conduct, either at school or elsewhere\u201d or \u201caf-\nfect[ed] \nwhat \nthey \nteach \ntheir \nown \nchildren.\u201d  \nPet.App.34a.  Nor did the record suggest that petition-\ners or their children were coerced to \u201caffirm views \n\n9 \n \n \ncontrary to their own,\u201d \u201cdisavow views \u2026 that their re-\nligion espouses,\u201d or \u201cotherwise affirmatively act in vio-\nlation of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit \nagreed with the consistent understanding of the courts \nof appeals that \u201csimply hearing about other views does \nnot necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differ-\nently than one\u2019s religious faith requires.\u201d  Pet.App.35a-\n36a.  It rejected petitioners\u2019 principal argument that \n\u201ccompelled presence or exposure\u201d to different views in a \npublic school \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a \nburden\u201d on religious exercise, holding that this view \u201cre-\nlies on too expansive a reading\u201d of Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972).  Pet.App.36a-37a; see also \nPet.App.38a-40a.  And it held that the no-opt-out policy \ndid not deny petitioners access to a public benefit based \non religion because MCPS remained \u201copen to all stu-\ndents\u201d regardless of their faith; petitioners were not \npressured to \u201cdisavow their religious views before they \n[could] \nsend \ntheir \nchildren \nto \npublic \nschool.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  That petitioners might face \u201cadditional \ncosts\u201d if they chose to exercise their religion by \u201cpursu-\ning an alternative to public schooling\u201d did not establish a \nfree-exercise burden.  Pet.App.47a-48a.  Finally, the \nFourth Circuit rejected the \u201chybrid\u201d due-process claim \nPetitioners had asserted (but do not raise here).  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  Without deciding \u201cthe validity of the \nhybrid-rights approach,\u201d the court determined that a hy-\nbrid claim could not succeed on the merits where the \nstandalone free-exercise claim was likely to fail.  Id.   \nJudge Quattlebaum dissented.  The dissent did not \ndispute the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cmere exposure to \nobjectionable viewpoints\u201d fails to establish a free-exer-\ncise burden.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Indeed, the dissent \n\n10 \n \n \nrecognized that \u201cit is generally true that the First \nAmendment provides no guarantee that students will \nnot be exposed to views they (or their parents) disagree \nwith in public schools.\u201d  Pet.App.64a.  The dissent also \nconceded that \u201cuse of the books in instructing K-5 chil-\ndren does not coerce or require the parents or their chil-\ndren to change their religious views,\u201d and that petition-\ners remained free to \u201cteach their religious beliefs at \nhome.\u201d  Pet.App.63a.  In the dissent\u2019s view, though, the \nno-opt-out policy nonetheless likely burdened petition-\ners\u2019 religious exercise by requiring them to choose be-\ntween \u201cadher[ing] to their faith or receiv[ing] a free pub-\nlic education for their children.\u201d  Pet.App.62a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT \nNo court of appeals has ever endorsed petitioners\u2019 \ntheory here: that parents who choose to send their chil-\ndren to public school necessarily suffer a burden on their \nexercise of religion by virtue of their children\u2019s \u201cex-\npos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d in public school, Pet.11; see \nalso Pet.9, 10, 29.  Petitioners incorrectly assert that the \ncircuits are \u201csplit 5-1\u201d over whether such exposure\u2014ab-\nsent any \u201ccompulsion\u201d or \u201ccoercion\u201d of religious belief or \nconduct\u2014\u201cis sufficient to create a free-exercise burden.\u201d  \nPet.19.  In reality, the score is 6-0 against petitioners. \nA.

The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s straightforward application of this \nCourt\u2019s precedent to the limited evidence petitioners of-\nfered in support of their motion for preliminary relief \ndoes not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention.   \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), Mary-\nland\u2019s largest school district, serves more than 160,000 \nstudents.  Every day, these students read and discuss \nbooks as part of MCPS\u2019s language-arts curriculum.  \nThese reading materials have not always reflected the \ndiversity of the community MCPS serves.  In recent \nyears, the school district has worked to change that by \nincorporating new books to better represent MCPS stu-\ndents and families.  These books now include characters, \nfamilies, and historical figures from a range of cultural, \nracial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.  \nAs part of this effort, at the start of the 2022-2023 \nschool year, MCPS approved a handful of storybooks \nfeaturing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer \ncharacters for use in the language-arts curriculum, \nalongside the many books already in the curriculum that \nfeature heterosexual characters in traditional gender \nroles.  Like all other books in the language-arts curricu-\nlum, these storybooks impart critical reading skills \nthrough engaging, age-appropriate stories.  MCPS ad-\nheres to a careful, public, participatory selection process \nto ensure those criteria are met.  That process, followed \nhere, welcomes and incorporates parent feedback.   \n\n2 \n \n \nFrom the beginning, MCPS\u2019s goal has been for stu-\ndents to engage with these storybooks as they engage \nwith any other book in the language-arts curriculum.  \nThe storybooks are not used in any lessons related to \ngender and sexuality.  Nor is any student asked or ex-\npected to change his or her views about his or her own, \nor any other student\u2019s, sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  Instead, the books are made available for indi-\nvidual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educa-\ntional activities designed to foster and enhance literacy \nskills. \nPetitioners include three sets of parents who asked \nMCPS to notify them, excuse their children from class, \nand arrange alternate lessons whenever the storybooks \nare read.  After MCPS announced in March 2023 that it \nwould not permit any parents to opt their children out of \nlanguage-arts instruction involving the storybooks, for \nany reason, petitioners sued.  Petitioners also moved for \na preliminary injunction requiring notice and opt outs, \narguing that their children\u2019s \u201cexposure\u201d to the story-\nbooks \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a burden\u201d \non their right to freely exercise their religion.  \nPet.App.37a.  The district court denied the motion. \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\ntioners were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nbased on the \u201cscant record\u201d before it.  Pet.App.9a.  Ap-\nplying a standard drawn straight from this Court\u2019s free-\nexercise precedent, and in line with every relevant court \nof appeals decision, the Fourth Circuit explained that a \ncognizable burden on religious exercise requires coer-\ncion, direct or indirect, to believe or act contrary to one\u2019s \nreligious views.  Petitioners failed to demonstrate a like-\nlihood of success on their free-exercise claim, as they of-\nfered \u201cno evidence\u201d of such coercion.  Pet.App.34a.  \n\n3 \n \n \nSpecifically, petitioners advanced no evidence that \nMCPS pressured their children to affirm or disavow par-\nticular views, compelled their children to act in violation \nof their religious beliefs, influenced what petitioners \ncould teach their own children, or denied petitioners ac-\ncess to public benefits.  Pet.App.34a-48a.  This \u201cabsence \nof proof\u201d doomed petitioners\u2019 request for emergency re-\nlief.   \nThere is no circuit split on this issue.  Every single \ncourt of appeals that has considered the question has \nheld that mere exposure to controversial issues in a pub-\nlic-school curriculum does not burden the free religious \nexercise of parents or students.  Nor is there any conflict \nbetween the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding and this Court\u2019s \nfree-exercise decisions, which the Fourth Circuit faith-\nfully applied and petitioners misconstrue.  And there is \nno pressing question raised by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s con-\nclusion in a preliminary-injunction posture that petition-\ners\u2019 free-exercise claim was not likely to succeed absent \nany evidence of coercion that could constitute a burden \non religious free exercise.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, parents who can demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess in showing religious coercion in a public school \nthat does not survive scrutiny may obtain preliminary \nrelief.  Parents who cannot make that showing, but who \ncan plausibly allege facts suggesting such unjustified co-\nercion, will proceed to discovery.  And if the facts bear \nout those allegations, they will obtain permanent relief.  \nThere is no pressing question here. \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n4 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Storybooks \nAt the start of the 2022-2023 school year, MCPS in-\ntroduced into its pre-K through twelfth grade language-\narts curriculum several storybooks featuring lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer characters.  \nPet.App.603a-604a.  The storybooks were added as part \nof MCPS\u2019s commitment to \u201cprovid[ing] a culturally re-\nsponsive \u2026 curriculum that promotes equity, respect, \nand civility.\u201d  Pet.App.589a.  MCPS believes that \u201c[r]ep-\nresentation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a \nfully inclusive environment for all students\u201d and \u201csup-\nports a student\u2019s ability to empathize, connect, and col-\nlaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for \nall.\u201d  Pet.App.603a.  The language-arts curriculum there-\nfore seeks to ensure that students can \u201c[s]elect[] from a \nrange of diverse texts to understand and appreciate mul-\ntiple perspectives.\u201d  Pet.App.599a.  As part of this effort, \nMCPS had previously made similar efforts to update the \nlanguage-arts curriculum with books featuring people \nand characters from different backgrounds.  Some exam-\nples include the March trilogy, which recounts the life of \ncivil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, and The Leav-\ners, which tells the story of an Asian-American immi-\ngrant family.  Pet.App.602a-603a.  In a similar vein, \nMCPS updated its social-studies curriculum with new in-\nstructional materials about local history.  Id. \nThe storybooks were approved for instructional use \npursuant to MCPS\u2019s written policy for selecting new in-\nstructional materials.  Pet.App.600a-601a, 603a-604a; \nCAJA513-514.  Under that policy, MCPS seeks to ensure \nthat the materials are \u201cage/grade appropriate[],\u201d \u201csup-\nport \u2026 student achievement toward MCPS curriculum \nstandards,\u201d and are \u201crelevant to and reflective of the \n\n5 \n \n \nmulticultural \nsociety \nand \nglobal \ncommunity.\u201d  \nPet.App.600a-601a; CAJA513-514, 521, 523.  Before se-\nlecting the storybooks, a committee of six reading and \ninstructional specialists participated in multiple rounds \nof evaluations to determine that each book would be a \nsuitable addition to the curriculum based on these crite-\nria.  CAJA513; see also Pet.App.603a-604a.  This process \nincluded an opportunity for parents to review the story-\nbooks and provide feedback, and all such feedback was \nconsidered before any storybook was approved.  \nPet.App.601a. \nThe storybooks tell everyday tales of characters \nwho experience adventure, confront new emotions, and \nstruggle to make themselves heard.  They include a \nstory about a family attending a Pride parade, a niece \nmeeting her uncle\u2019s husband-to-be, a prince falling in \nlove with a knight as they battle a dragon in a mythical \nkingdom, a girl feeling nervous about giving a valentine \nto her crush, and a transgender boy sharing his gender \nidentity with his family.  Pet.App.254a-271a, 279a-306a, \n390a-428a, 429a-447a, 448a-482a.  These are archetypal \nstories that touch on the same themes introduced to chil-\ndren in such classic books as Snow White, Cinderella, \nand Peter Pan.  In addition to helping students explore \nsentence structure, word choice, and style, the story-\nbooks support students\u2019 ability to empathize, connect, \nand collaborate with peers and encourage respect for all.  \nPet.App.603a, 605a-606a.   \nThe storybooks are, moreover, \u201ca small subset of \nmany books used in the MCPS [language-arts] curricu-\nlum.\u201d  Pet.App.132a.  Teachers are expected to fold them \ninto the curriculum as they would any other book:  They \ncan put the storybooks on shelves for students to find \nthemselves, recommend a particular storybook to a \n\n6 \n \n \nstudent who would enjoy it, read the storybooks aloud, \nor offer them as an option for reading groups.  \nPet.App.604a-605a. \n \nMCPS made clear to teachers that using the story-\nbooks involves no instruction on sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  Pet.App.605a, 636a-641a.  Some chal-\nlenged books simply include LGBTQ characters.  Others \nhighlight the importance of kindness to others.  None \ntakes a side in any religious or scientific debate sur-\nrounding gender or sexuality.  And teachers are not per-\nmitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular \nviewpoint.  Indeed, a guidance document for teachers \nstates that \u201c[n]o child who does not agree with or under-\nstand another student\u2019s gender, expression, or their sex-\nual identity is asked to change how they feel about it.\u201d  \nPet.App.640a.  MCPS prepared teachers to use the sto-\nrybooks by offering a professional-development session \nas well as sample responses to potential student ques-\ntions; these optional \u201csuggested responses focus[ed] on \ntolerance, empathy, and respect for different views.\u201d  \nPet.App.89a-95a.1  \nB. The No-Opt-Out Policy \nAfter the storybooks were introduced, some parents \nrequested that their children be excused from class \nwhen \nthe \nstorybooks \nwere \nread \nor \ndiscussed.  \nPet.App.606a.  Some opt-out requests were religion-\nbased and others were not.  Some parents opposed a \n \n1 Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, this guidance did not \u201cdi-\nrect[] teachers to frame disagreement with\u201d the storybooks \u201cas \n\u2018hurtful.\u2019\u201d  Pet.13.  The guidance instead suggested that if a student \ndescribes another person as \u201cweird,\u201d a teacher could respond, \u201cThat \ncomment is hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk about \npeople\u2019s identities.\u201d  Pet.App.94a. \n\n7 \n \n \nperceived effort to teach students about sex or gender \nidentity or believed the materials were age-inappropri-\nate.  Id. \nAt first, teachers and principals sought to accommo-\ndate these requests by excusing students when the \nbooks were read in class.  Pet.App.606a-607a.  The grow-\ning number of opt-out requests, however, gave rise to \nthree related concerns: high student absenteeism, the in-\nfeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms \nand schools, and the risk of exposing students who be-\nlieve the storybooks represent them and their families \nto social stigma and isolation.  Pet.App.96a-99a, 606a-\n608a.  These consequences would defeat MCPS\u2019s \u201cefforts \nto ensure a classroom environment that is safe and con-\nducive to learning for all students\u201d and risk putting \nMCPS out of compliance with nondiscrimination laws.  \nPet.App.98a-99a, 607a-608a. \nMCPS therefore determined that permitting opt-\nouts was not feasible or consistent with its curricular \ngoals.  Pet.App.608a.  It announced in March 2023 that \nno opt-outs from instruction using the storybooks would \nbe granted \u201cfor any reason.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \nIn May 2023, petitioners sued the Montgomery \nCounty Board of Education, its members, and the Super-\nintendent of Schools, asserting violations of the federal \nFree Exercise, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses \nand a violation of Maryland law.  Pet.App.107a-108a.  Pe-\ntitioners then moved for a preliminary injunction on \ntheir free-exercise and due-process claims, seeking to \nrequire MCPS to provide them notice and opt-out oppor-\ntunities whenever the storybooks are read or discussed.  \nPet.App.76a-77a.  In July 2023, petitioners amended \ntheir \ncomplaint \nto \nadd \nplaintiff \nKids \nFirst.  \n\n8 \n \n \nPet.App.162a-163a.  The district court denied the pre-\nliminary-injunction motion in August 2023.  The Fourth \nCircuit denied petitioners\u2019 motion for an injunction \npending appeal and, in May 2024, affirmed the denial of \na preliminary injunction. \nIn an opinion written by Judge Agee and joined by \nJudge Benjamin, the court of appeals agreed with the \ndistrict court that petitioners had not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits given their \u201cbroad \nclaims, the very high burden required to obtain a prelim-\ninary injunction, and the scant record before [it].\u201d  \nPet.App.9a.  The court recognized that the Free Exer-\ncise Clause protects against government action that di-\nrectly or indirectly compels religious belief or threatens \nthe ability to act in accordance with one\u2019s faith.  \nPet.App.24a-25a.  The court thus explained that, \u201cto \nshow a cognizable burden\u201d on religious exercise, peti-\ntioners were required to \u201cshow that the absence of an \nopt-out opportunity coerces them or their children to be-\nlieve or act contrary to their religious views.\u201d  \nPet.App.31a.  That coercion could be \u201cdirect or indirect.\u201d  \nId. \nApplying those familiar principles, the Fourth Cir-\ncuit rejected petitioners\u2019 theory that \u201cthe lack of an \nacross-the-board notice and an opt-out opportunity re-\nlating to the Storybooks, in and of itself, coerces them \nand their children in the free exercise of their religion.\u201d  \nPet.App.33a-34a.  The court held that petitioners put \nforward \u201cno evidence\u201d that the no-opt-out policy com-\npelled them or their children \u201cto change their religious \nbeliefs or conduct, either at school or elsewhere\u201d or \u201caf-\nfect[ed] \nwhat \nthey \nteach \ntheir \nown \nchildren.\u201d  \nPet.App.34a.  Nor did the record suggest that petition-\ners or their children were coerced to \u201caffirm views \n\n9 \n \n \ncontrary to their own,\u201d \u201cdisavow views \u2026 that their re-\nligion espouses,\u201d or \u201cotherwise affirmatively act in vio-\nlation of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit \nagreed with the consistent understanding of the courts \nof appeals that \u201csimply hearing about other views does \nnot necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differ-\nently than one\u2019s religious faith requires.\u201d  Pet.App.35a-\n36a.  It rejected petitioners\u2019 principal argument that \n\u201ccompelled presence or exposure\u201d to different views in a \npublic school \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a \nburden\u201d on religious exercise, holding that this view \u201cre-\nlies on too expansive a reading\u201d of Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972).  Pet.App.36a-37a; see also \nPet.App.38a-40a.  And it held that the no-opt-out policy \ndid not deny petitioners access to a public benefit based \non religion because MCPS remained \u201copen to all stu-\ndents\u201d regardless of their faith; petitioners were not \npressured to \u201cdisavow their religious views before they \n[could] \nsend \ntheir \nchildren \nto \npublic \nschool.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  That petitioners might face \u201cadditional \ncosts\u201d if they chose to exercise their religion by \u201cpursu-\ning an alternative to public schooling\u201d did not establish a \nfree-exercise burden.  Pet.App.47a-48a.  Finally, the \nFourth Circuit rejected the \u201chybrid\u201d due-process claim \nPetitioners had asserted (but do not raise here).  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  Without deciding \u201cthe validity of the \nhybrid-rights approach,\u201d the court determined that a hy-\nbrid claim could not succeed on the merits where the \nstandalone free-exercise claim was likely to fail.  Id.   \nJudge Quattlebaum dissented.  The dissent did not \ndispute the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cmere exposure to \nobjectionable viewpoints\u201d fails to establish a free-exer-\ncise burden.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Indeed, the dissent \n\n10 \n \n \nrecognized that \u201cit is generally true that the First \nAmendment provides no guarantee that students will \nnot be exposed to views they (or their parents) disagree \nwith in public schools.\u201d  Pet.App.64a.  The dissent also \nconceded that \u201cuse of the books in instructing K-5 chil-\ndren does not coerce or require the parents or their chil-\ndren to change their religious views,\u201d and that petition-\ners remained free to \u201cteach their religious beliefs at \nhome.\u201d  Pet.App.63a.  In the dissent\u2019s view, though, the \nno-opt-out policy nonetheless likely burdened petition-\ners\u2019 religious exercise by requiring them to choose be-\ntween \u201cadher[ing] to their faith or receiv[ing] a free pub-\nlic education for their children.\u201d  Pet.App.62a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT \nNo court of appeals has ever endorsed petitioners\u2019 \ntheory here: that parents who choose to send their chil-\ndren to public school necessarily suffer a burden on their \nexercise of religion by virtue of their children\u2019s \u201cex-\npos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d in public school, Pet.11; see \nalso Pet.9, 10, 29.  Petitioners incorrectly assert that the \ncircuits are \u201csplit 5-1\u201d over whether such exposure\u2014ab-\nsent any \u201ccompulsion\u201d or \u201ccoercion\u201d of religious belief or \nconduct\u2014\u201cis sufficient to create a free-exercise burden.\u201d  \nPet.19.  In reality, the score is 6-0 against petitioners. \nA. Courts Of Appeals Have Uniformly Held That \nMere Exposure In Public School To Ideas That \nContradict Religious Beliefs Does Not Burden \nParents\u2019 Religious Exercise \nThe decision below agreed with every other court of \nappeals to have considered whether students\u2019 exposure \nin public school to material that contradicts their par-\nents\u2019 religious faith in and of itself constitutes a \n\n11 \n \n \ncognizable burden on the parents\u2019 free-exercise rights.  \nAs both the district court and the court of appeals ob-\nserved, \u201c[e]very court that has addressed th[is] ques-\ntion\u201d has answered it in the negative.  Pet.App.117a; see \nalso Pet.App.39a. \nSpecifically, as petitioners correctly acknowledge, \nthe decision below accords with: \n\u2022 the First Circuit\u2019s holding in Parker v. Hurley, \n514 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2008), that parents \u201cwhose \nreligious beliefs [were] offended by gay marriage \nand homosexuality\u201d were not entitled under the \nFree Exercise Clause to \u201cprior notice by the \nschool and the opportunity to exempt their young \nchildren from exposure to books they f[ou]nd re-\nligiously repugnant,\u201d id. at 90; \n\u2022 the Second Circuit\u2019s holding in Leebaert v. Har-\nrington, 332 F.3d 134 (2d Cir. 2003), that a father \nwas not entitled under the Free Exercise Clause \n\u201cto excuse his minor son\u201d from a public school\u2019s \n\u201cmandatory health curriculum [that] conflict[ed] \nwith his [religious] belief\u201d regarding \u201csex before \nmarriage,\u201d id. at 135, 144-145; \n\u2022 the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding in Mozert v. Hawkins \nCounty Board of Education, 827 F.2d 1058 (6th \nCir. 1987), that \u201crequiring mere exposure [of pub-\nlic-school students] to materials that offend [their \nparents\u2019] religious beliefs\u201d does not subject the \n\u201cobjecting parents\u201d to \u201can unconstitutional bur-\nden on the free exercise of religion,\u201d id. at 1059, \n1067; and \n\u2022 the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding in Fleischfresser v. \nDirectors of School District 200, 15 F.3d 680 (7th \nCir. 1994), rejecting a claim by \u201c[p]arents of \n\n12 \n \n \n[public-school] students enrolled in grades Kin-\ndergarten through Five\u201d that \u201cthe use of [a par-\nticular book] series interfere[d] with the free ex-\nercise of their religion,\u201d id. at 683, 689. \nPetitioners omit yet another case that follows the \nconsensus view: the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Califor-\nnia Parents for the Equalization of Educational Mate-\nrials v. Torlakson, 973 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir. 2020), which \nrejected a free-exercise claim by parents challenging a \n\u201cpublic school curriculum\u201d that \u201ccontain[ed] material \u2026 \noffensive to their religious beliefs,\u201d id. at 1013, 1020.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 omission is surprising given that this case was \ncited by both the district court (Pet.App.118a) and the \ncourt of appeals (Pet.App.35a).  Indeed, petitioners \nthemselves cite the case in another portion of their peti-\ntion, where they characterize it as \u201cdecided under the \nDue Process Clause,\u201d Pet.31 n.13, and fail to mention \nthat it also rejected the same \u201cFree Exercise clause ar-\ngument\u201d that petitioners pursue here, Torlakson, 973 \nF.3d at 1020. \nThis consistency across circuits follows ineluctably \nfrom this Court\u2019s precedent that \u201cit is necessary in a free \nexercise case \u2026 to show the coercive effect of the\u201d chal-\nlenged action, School District of Abington Township v. \nSchempp, 374 U.S. 203, 223 (1963); accord Carson v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767, 778 (2022).2 \n \n2 The uniform court-of-appeals decisions on this issue are also \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s recognition that exposure to new and \neven \u201coffensive content\u201d in school \u201cis part of learning how to live in \na pluralistic society, a society which insists upon open discourse to-\nwards the end of a tolerant citizenry.\u201d  Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. \n577, 590 (1992). \n\n13 \n \n \nAs elaborated further below, see infra Part II, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 position\u2014that their free-exercise claim may \nsucceed based purely on their children\u2019s exposure to re-\nligiously offensive material, \u201cabsent a \u2018coercive effect\u2019\u201d \non \u201creligious beliefs or conduct,\u201d Pet.22\u2014would be con-\ntrary to this Court\u2019s precedent and thus finds no support \nin any circuit. \nB. No Decision Conflicts With The Decision Be-\nlow \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet.22), the \nEighth Circuit has never split from the judicial consen-\nsus just discussed.   \nPetitioners seize on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s statement \nin Florey v. Sioux Falls School District 49-5, 619 F.2d \n1311 (8th Cir. 1980), that \u201cforcing any person to partici-\npate in an activity that offends his religious or nonreli-\ngious beliefs will generally contravene the Free Exer-\ncise Clause,\u201d id. at 1318-1319.  That statement is both \nperfectly consistent with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in \nthis case (and with the decisions of every other court of \nappeals to have addressed the issue), and in any event \nwas dicta because, as petitioners acknowledge, \u201c[t]he \ncourt found no [free-exercise] violation in that case,\u201d \nPet.22.   \nIn Florey, a Sioux Falls public school in 1977 held a \nChristmas assembly in which kindergartners were re-\nquired to \u201cmemorize[] and then perform[] for parents a \nChristmas assembly which was replete with religious \ncontent,\u201d including a call and response that required stu-\ndents to answer \u201cJesus\u201d when asked \u201cOf whom did \nheav\u2019nly angels sing, And news about His birthday \nbring?\u201d  Florey v. Sioux Falls Sch. Dist. 49-5, 464 F. \nSupp. 911, 912 (D.S.D. 1979).  A parent complained, and \nthe district developed a set of rules outlining the \n\n14 \n \n \npermissible role religious materials might play in public \nschool.  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1313.  The rules provided, \namong other things, that \u201cstudents and staff members \nshould be excused from participating in practices which \nare contrary to their religious beliefs unless there are \nclear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.\u201d  \nId. at 1319 (emphasis added).  Parents challenged those \nrules as violating the Establishment Clause, and then \nadded a Free Exercise Clause argument on appeal \u201cas \nan afterthought.\u201d  Id. at 1318 n.7. \nThe Eighth Circuit rejected the free-exercise chal-\nlenge.  It recognized that \u201cpublic schools are not re-\nquired to delete from the curriculum all materials that \nmay offend any religious sensibility,\u201d and that \u201cinevita-\nble conflicts with the individual beliefs of some students \nor their parents \u2026 do not necessarily require the prohi-\nbition of a school activity.\u201d  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1318.  To \nbe sure, the court also recognized that \u201cforcing any per-\nson to participate in an activity that offends his religious \nor nonreligious beliefs will generally contravene the \nFree Exercise Clause,\u201d id. at 1318-1319.  But that sen-\ntence does not support Petitioners.  Everyone agrees \nthat a public school generally cannot force a student to \nactively \u201cparticipate in an activity\u201d that violates the stu-\ndent\u2019s religion.  Florey, id. at 1318.  For example, a pub-\nlic school cannot require students to recognize \u201cJesus\u201d \nas \u201cChrist, the blessed Saviour[],\u201d Florey, 464 F. Supp. \nat 912, as in the Christmas assemblies that led to the pol-\nicies challenged in Florey.  Nor can public schools re-\nquire a student who keeps kosher to eat pork or a Jeho-\nvah\u2019s Witness to participate in a birthday party.  As the \nFourth Circuit put it, public schools cannot require stu-\ndents to \u201caffirmatively act in violation of their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d  Pet.App.34a.  But this case does not involve any \nsuch requirement.  It involves only \u201ccurriculum \u2026 \n\n15 \n \n \nmaterials that may offend [Petitioner\u2019s] religious sensi-\nbility.\u201d  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1318.3 \nIn any event, as noted, the single sentence on which \npetitioners seize was plainly dicta.  The court found no \nfree-exercise violation, and the language petitioners cite \nwas not \u201cnecessary to that result.\u201d  Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996).  And because \n\u201c[d]ictum settles nothing, even in the court that utters \nit,\u201d Jama v. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 543 \nU.S. 335, 352 n.12 (2005), \u201cdicta does not a circuit split \nmake,\u201d Pacific Coast Supply, LLC v. NLRB, 801 F.3d \n321, 334 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nEven if certain dicta could signal a circuit divide \nwarranting this Court\u2019s attention, the dicta Petitioners \nidentify certainly does not.  Recognizing that \u201c[a] pas-\nsage unnecessary to the outcome may not be fully con-\nsidered,\u201d Torres v. Madrid, 592 U.S. 306, 329 (2021) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting), this Court declines to assign \n\u201clegal weight\u201d to \u201cdicta\u201d on an issue that \u201cwas not \u2026 \nfully argued,\u201d Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 \nU.S. 519, 548 (2013).  As the Eighth Circuit explained, \n \n3 Moreover, Florey held that the plaintiffs\u2019 free-exercise claim \ncould not succeed in light of the defendant school\u2019s policy that \u201cstu-\ndents and staff members should be excused from participating in \npractices which are contrary to their religious beliefs unless there \nare clear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.\u201d  Flo-\nrey, 619 F.2d at 1317 n.6 (quoting school\u2019s policy) (emphasis added).  \nThat is the situation here:  As noted, see supra p.7, MCPS accom-\nmodated opt-out requests until it was prevented from doing so by \noverriding concerns regarding \u201cabsenteeism,\u201d \u201cthe infeasibility of \nmanaging numerous opt-outs,\u201d and the \u201crisk [of] putting MCPS out \nof compliance with state and federal nondiscrimination laws,\u201d \nPet.App.98a.  Any fact-bound dispute about the weight of those in-\nterests in this narrow circumstance\u2014particularly in this prelimi-\nnary posture\u2014does not merit review by this Court. \n\n16 \n \n \n\u201c[t]he free-exercise issue\u201d in Florey was \u201cadded to the \nappellants\u2019 appeal brief as an afterthought\u201d and \u201c[n]ei-\nther the complaint, the trial briefs, nor the district court \nopinion mention[ed] the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d  Florey, \n619 F.2d at 1318 n.7.  The Eighth Circuit\u2019s dicta on that \nsubject thus was not fully considered and cannot bear \nthe \u201clegal weight\u201d petitioners assign it, Kirtsaeng, 568 \nU.S. at 548. \nAlthough not the basis of their claimed circuit-split, \npetitioners identify three other decisions they suggest \nare in tension with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision here.  \nSee Pet.22-23 n.11.  None is.  Petitioners first point to \nC.N. v. Ridgewood Board of Education, 430 F.3d 159 (3d \nCir. 2005), in which the Third Circuit declined to adopt a \n\u201ccategorical approach\u201d under which parents lack any \ndue-process rights regarding their children\u2019s experience \nin public school, id. at 185 n.26.  Even putting aside that \nthat case concerned due process rather than free exer-\ncise, the Third Circuit\u2019s rejection of such a \u201ccategorical \napproach,\u201d id., is consistent with the judicial consensus \nthat mere exposure in public school to ideas that contra-\ndict religious beliefs does not burden the religious exer-\ncise of objecting parents.  Indeed, the Third Circuit re-\njected the parents\u2019 exposure-based due-process claim in \nC.N., on the ground that \u201c[a] parent whose \u2026 child is ex-\nposed to sensitive topics\u201d in school \u201cremains free to dis-\ncuss th[o]se matters and to place them in the family\u2019s \nmoral or religious context, or to supplement the infor-\nmation with more appropriate materials.\u201d  Id. at 185.  \nThe same is true here. \nNext, petitioners point to Tatel v. Mt. Lebanon \nSchool District, 675 F. Supp. 3d 551 (W.D. Pa. 2023).  \nThat district-court decision only illustrates what is miss-\ning here: any allegation (much less evidence) of coercive \n\n17 \n \n \nconduct that could amount to a cognizable burden on re-\nligious exercise.  Tatel involved allegations that a \nteacher \u201cpursued her own non-curricular agenda \u2026 to \ninculcate in the first-grade children in her class the \nteacher\u2019s beliefs about a child\u2019s gender identity,\u201d includ-\ning by \u201ctarget[ing] one child for repeated approaches \nabout gender dysphoria despite, or because of, the par-\nents\u2019 beliefs,\u201d all while \u201ctelling the children to keep the \nteacher\u2019s discussions about gender topics secret from \ntheir parents.\u201d  Id. at 558-559, 566.  There are no such \nallegations of non-curricular instruction, targeting, or \nsecrecy here, and there is certainly no evidence of such \ncoercion in this preliminary-injunction posture.  As the \ndistrict court in this case concluded, \u201c[t]he students\u201d in \nTatel \u201cwere not just exposed to ideas\u201d; \u201c[t]hey were be-\ning pressured by their teacher to change their religious \nviews on gender identity.\u201d  Pet.App.131a.  Tatel, in other \nwords, rested on coercive elements absent here. \nFinally, petitioners assert that before the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in Mozert (which, as noted, petitioners \nacknowledge accords with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision \nhere), \u201cthe Sixth Circuit originally landed on [the other] \nside of the split\u201d with its decision in Spence v. Bailey, 465 \nF.2d 797 (6th Cir. 1972).  Pet.23 n.11.  That too is wrong.  \nThe Sixth Circuit explained in Mozert why its decision \nthere (and thus the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision here) is dis-\ntinguishable from Spence: namely, the student in Spence \n\u201cwas being compelled to engage in military training, not \nbeing exposed to the fact that others do so,\u201d Mozert, 827 \nF.2d at 1065 (emphasis in original).  Spence is thus per-\nfectly consistent with rejecting Petitioners\u2019 theory here \n\n18 \n \n \nthat mere \u201cexpos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d is enough to \nsupport a free-exercise claim, Pet.11.4 \nII. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT CORRECTLY APPLIED THIS \nCOURT\u2019S FREE-EXERCISE CASES \nThis Court\u2019s free-exercise precedents set out a clear \nrule that the Fourth Circuit correctly applied in this \ncase: the government burdens religious exercise only \nwhen it coerces someone, either directly or indirectly, to \nbelieve or act contrary to their religious views.  Petition-\ners misrepresent both law and facts in an effort to fabri-\ncate a conflict. \nA. The Fourth Circuit Correctly Applied Yoder \nAs the Fourth Circuit explained, petitioners\u2019 argu-\nment that the no-opt-out policy burdens their religious \nexercise \u201crelies on too expansive a reading of Yoder.\u201d  \nPet.App.37a.  In Yoder, Amish parents developed an ev-\nidentiary record establishing that \u201cattendance at high \nschool, public or private, was contrary to the Amish re-\nligion and way of life\u201d and would \u201cresult in the destruc-\ntion\u201d of their religious community.  406 U.S. at 209, 212.  \nSurveying that record, this Court held that a compulsory \nschool attendance law violated the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise rights because it \u201caffirmatively compel[ed] \n \n4 Not even the dissent below agreed with Petitioners\u2019 claim \nthat \u201cmere exposure to objectionable viewpoints\u201d is enough to es-\ntablish a burden on free exercise.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Instead, it at-\ntempts (unpersuasively) to distinguish Mozert and other cases on \nfactual grounds.  See Pet.App.65a n.2.  Nor is Petitioners\u2019 position \nsupported by recent district-court dicta stating that students may \n\u201copt out of educational content that violates sincerely held religious \nor conscience-based beliefs,\u201d Nelson v. Nazareth Independent \nSchool District, 2024 WL 4116495, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 6, 2024) \n(cited at W.Va.Br.8-9), as that dicta rested in substantial part on the \nTexas Constitution and Texas statutes not implicated here, see id. \n\n19 \n \n \nthem \u2026 to perform acts undeniably at odds with funda-\nmental tenets of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id. at 218.  The \nFourth Circuit faithfully applied that standard here and \nfound that on the preliminary-injunction record, peti-\ntioners had not established that their children were af-\nfirmatively compelled to perform acts contrary to their \nreligious beliefs.  Pet.App.39a; see also Pet.App.34a-35a.  \nFor its part, the dissent showed no interest in petition-\ners\u2019 argument that Yoder commanded a different result.  \nPet.App.71a n.5. \nPetitioners\u2019 and their amici\u2019s counterarguments fail \nfor several related reasons. \nFirst, the Fourth Circuit in no way \u201cdenigrat[ed]\u201d \nYoder (Pet.24), but instead faithfully applied its clear \nholding.  In Yoder, the parents came forward with evi-\ndence showing that they believed the mere act of \u201csend-\ning their children to high school\u201d would \u201cendanger their \nown salvation and that of their children.\u201d  406 U.S. at \n209.  The challenged law therefore would force them to \neither \u201cabandon belief and be assimilated into society\u201d \nor \u201cmigrate to some other and more tolerant region.\u201d  Id. \nat 218.  Compulsory attendance thus \u201cwould gravely en-\ndanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents\u2019 \nreligious beliefs.\u201d  Id. at 219.  That is coercion\u2014coercion \nthe Fourth Circuit did not find in the preliminary-injunc-\ntion record below.  As the district court explained, the \nquestion is \u201cwhether the facts involve government coer-\ncion to violate religious beliefs.  In Yoder, they did; here, \nthey do not.\u201d  Pet.App.142a n.13.  That preliminary, fact-\nbound decision does not merit this Court\u2019s review. \nSecond, the coercion standard that Yoder prescribes \nand the Fourth Circuit applied does not risk \u201cdenomina-\ntional favoritism.\u201d  Pet.25.  That is because, as the dis-\ntrict court recognized, the required analysis \u201cdoes not \n\n20 \n \n \nturn on religious doctrine.\u201d  Pet.App.142a n.13.  It turns \non the presence or absence of coercion to change or act \ncontrary to one\u2019s religious beliefs.   \nThe Fourth Circuit is not alone in holding that the \nparents in Yoder could demonstrate coercion not found \nhere.  As the First Circuit explained, compulsory school-\ning in Yoder threatened to destroy a \u201cdistinct commu-\nnity and life style\u201d that was \u201cfundamentally incompati-\nble with any schooling system.\u201d  Parker, 514 F.3d at 100.  \nIn the words of the Sixth Circuit, \u201cYoder was decided in \nlarge part on the impossibility of reconciling the goals of \npublic education with the religious requirement of the \nAmish that their children be prepared for life in a sepa-\nrated community.\u201d  Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1067; accord \nLeebaert, 332 F.3d at 144.     \nThe substance of a plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs may be \nrelevant to whether there is coercion, and, as this Court \nrecognized in Yoder, a showing that attending public \nschool at all amounts to coercion is \u201cone that probably \nfew other religious groups or sects could make.\u201d  406 \nU.S. at 235-236.  But the legal test is the same across the \nboard.  The concern about \u201cdenominational favoritism\u201d \nraised in Carson, 596 U.S. at 786-787, which petitioners \nquote out of context, was with state laws that denied \npublic funds to religious schools based on a subjective \nassessment of whether those funds were used to pro-\nmote religion.  No such concern is present here. \nThird, petitioners are wrong to suggest (Pet.26-27) \nthat the Fourth Circuit required them to await actual in-\njury before seeking relief\u2014an argument that in any \nevent has nothing to do with Yoder.  The Fourth Circuit \nproperly applied this Court\u2019s preliminary-injunction \nstandard by requiring petitioners to establish a likeli-\nhood of success on the merits.  Pet.App.21a-22a.  To \n\n21 \n \n \nobtain injunctive relief, petitioners had to show that \nthey were likely to experience \u201cdirect or indirect coer-\ncion arising out of the exposure\u201d of their children to the \nstorybooks.  Pet.App.41a.  They did not do so because \nthey failed to introduce any evidence that coercion \nwould necessarily result from exposure to the story-\nbooks or that storybooks were actually being used in \nclassrooms in a way that was likely to coerce.  \nPet.App.33-35a, 41a-43a.  Petitioners seem to suggest \nthat the Fourth Circuit should have lowered the \u201cex-\nceedingly high burden\u201d faced by litigants seeking a pre-\nliminary injunction.  Pet.App.21a.  But as this Court has \nemphasized, \u201c[a] preliminary injunction is an extraordi-\nnary remedy never awarded as of right.\u201d  Winter v. Nat-\nural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  That \ndemanding standard applies to free-exercise claims.  See, \ne.g., Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S.Ct. 17, 18 (2021); see also \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 \nU.S. 14, 16 (2020). \nFourth, petitioners confusingly rely on a footnote in \nYoder that quoted a letter from Thomas Jefferson, alt-\nhough neither that section of Yoder nor the referenced \nwritings of Thomas Jefferson have anything to do with \nwhether a given policy burdens free exercise.  Pet.24.  In \nrejecting the argument that \u201ca brief additional period of \nformal education is imperative to enable the Amish to \nparticipate effectively and intelligently in our demo-\ncratic process,\u201d the Court referenced in passing Thomas \nJefferson\u2019s professed \u201creluctan[ce] to directly force in-\nstruction of children \u2018in opposition to the will of the par-\nent,\u2019\u201d  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 226 n.14 (quoting 17 Writings \nof Thomas Jefferson 417, 423-424 (Mem. ed. 1904)), at \nleast \u201cbeyond a basic education,\u201d id. at 225.  This has \nnothing to do with whether mere exposure to language-\narts storybooks, in a public school to which parents have \n\n22 \n \n \nchosen to send their child, is inherently coercive in vio-\nlation of the Free Exercise Clause.   \nFifth, petitioners\u2019 and amici\u2019s claim of a \u201cnational \nconsensus that [sex education] instruction should not \nproceed absent parental permission,\u201d Pet.24-25; see also \nW.Va.Br.12-18, is likewise irrelevant.  Such a purported \ncontemporary policy consensus would have nothing to do \nwith whether a no-opt-out policy burdens religious exer-\ncise.  Nor did the Fourth Circuit apply any \u201cdeference\u201d \nto the Board\u2019s justifications for the challenged policy \n(Pet.25)\u2014the court never reached that issue because the \npreliminary-injunction record contained no evidence of \ncoercion, so there was no burden for the Board to jus-\ntify.5  Moreover, as the Fourth Circuit recognized, the \npreliminary-injunction record confirmed that the story-\nbooks were to be used only as part of the language-arts \ncurriculum and would not be part of \u201cinstruction on gen-\nder identity and sexual orientation.\u201d  Pet.App.11a.  That \nsame record established that the storybooks were not \napproved for the sex education curriculum, which has its \nown approval process for instructional materials, \nCAJA515, and from which students are permitted to opt \nout for any reason, Pet.App.608a. \nFinally, amici (and only amici) devote many pages to \nthe irrelevant argument that a \u201chybrid\u201d free-exercise \nand due-process claim could succeed against a policy that \nprohibited parents from opting their children out of sex \n \n5 Petitioners cite Ramirez v. Collier, 595 U.S. 411 (2022) \n(Pet.25), which held only that after a burden has been established, \nthe Court may consider whether a practice has been \u201chistorically \nand routinely allowed\u201d when determining whether a government \npolicy prohibiting the practice is narrowly tailored to a compelling \ninterest, id. at 428-429.  Again, because petitioners failed to estab-\nlish a burden, the courts below did not consider narrow tailoring. \n\n23 \n \n \neducation.  W.Va.Br.3-9.  Petitioners have not asked this \nCourt to consider their likelihood of success on a \u201chy-\nbrid\u201d claim, or urged this Court to reverse the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s holding on their due-process claim.  And as ex-\nplained above, there is no evidence in the record that \nMCPS has denied opt-outs from the sex education unit.  \nSupra p.22. \nB. The Fourth Circuit Correctly Applied This \nCourt\u2019s Remaining Free-Exercise Precedents \nPetitioners fare no better in their attempts to man-\nufacture a conflict between the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision \nand this Court\u2019s other free-exercise decisions.  Each case \npetitioners cite confirms that a free-exercise violation \nrequires evidence of direct or indirect coercion\u2014evi-\ndence absent from the limited preliminary-injunction \nrecord here. \n1. \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not conflict \nwith this Court\u2019s cases holding that States may not con-\ndition access to public benefits on requirements that pro-\nspective recipients change or forgo their religious beliefs \nor conduct.  See Pet.26-27, 28-29.  Again, each case on \nwhich petitioners rely had precisely what the Fourth \nCircuit found is missing from the preliminary-injunction \nrecord below: requirements or coercion to change or act \ncontrary to one\u2019s religious beliefs.   \nSherbert involved a Seventh-day Adventist denied \nunemployment benefits after she lost her job for being \nunwilling to work on Saturday.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 \nU.S. 398, 399 (1963).  The plaintiff was \u201cforce[d] to choose \nbetween following the precepts of her religion and for-\nfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of \nthe precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on \nthe other hand.\u201d  Id. at 404.  Likewise in Thomas, a Je-\nhovah\u2019s Witness was denied unemployment benefits \n\n24 \n \n \nafter he was transferred to a department manufacturing \n\u201cturrets for military tanks,\u201d which he refused to do be-\ncause his religious beliefs did not allow him to \u201cpartici-\npat[e] in the production of war materials.\u201d  Thomas v. \nReview Board, 450 U.S. 707, 709 (1981).  There, \u201cas in \nSherbert, the employee was put to a choice between fi-\ndelity to religious belief or cessation of work; the coer-\ncive impact on Thomas is indistinguishable from Sher-\nbert.\u201d  Id. at 717.  Finally, in Espinoza, the Montana Su-\npreme Court held that Montana\u2019s constitution precluded \ngiving religious private schools (and their students) oth-\nerwise generally available public subsidies for private \neducation.  Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 591 \nU.S. 464, 475 (2020).  This was \u201cstatus-based discrimina-\ntion\u201d and put schools and students to a similar choice as \nin Sherbert and Thomas:  to receive aid, \u201ca school must \ndivorce itself from any religious control or affiliation.\u201d  \nId. at 478. \nNot so here.  The evidence in the preliminary-in-\njunction record confirms that the no opt-out policy does \nnot require any students to shed their religious beliefs \nor forgo any religious conduct at all, much less as a con-\ndition of receiving a public education.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  \nMCPS remains \u201copen to all students\u201d without regard to \ntheir \u201creligious affiliation or beliefs.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  \nAgain, mere exposure to ideas that parents find offen-\nsive is not coercion that implicates the Free Exercise \nClause; there is no equivalent here to requiring a Sev-\nenth-Day Adventist to work on Saturday, a Jehovah\u2019s \nWitness to build weapons of war, or religious private \nschools to become secular.  The no-opt out policy does \nnot require children to take any position on the religious \npermissibility or impermissibility of any person\u2019s iden-\ntity, nor does it require students to engage in any \n\n25 \n \n \nconduct to which petitioners object on religious grounds.  \nIt just requires students to be in class when books are \nread.   \n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance on Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. \n693 (1986), fails for similar reasons.  Pet.27-28.  In \nBowen, eight members of the Court held that the Free \nExercise Clause did not preclude government agencies \nfrom using a Social Security number to identify the peti-\ntioner\u2019s daughter, as the \u201cFree Exercise Clause simply \ncannot be understood to require the Government to con-\nduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with \nthe religious beliefs of particular citizens.\u201d  476 U.S. at \n699.  The Fourth Circuit cited this portion of Bowen, and \nnumerous other courts of appeals that reached the same \nconclusion, as support for its holding that exposure to \n\u201ccontent deemed to be religiously objectionable \u2026 will \nnot ordinarily pose a burden on an individual\u2019s free ex-\nercise of religion because it lacks the requisite compul-\nsion or pressure on an individual\u2019s religious beliefs or \nconduct.\u201d  Pet.App.39a-40a.  To accept the contrary \nproposition would require public schools to tailor their \ncurricula to the religious objections of parents\u2014here, by \ncreating separate lesson plans for students whose par-\nents opt them out of the storybooks.  See Pet.App.186a-\n187a \nPetitioners argue (Pet.28) that this case presents a \nquestion more akin to the separate claim in Bowen that \n\u201cbeing forced to cooperate actively with the Government \nby themselves providing their daughter\u2019s social security \nnumber on benefit applications\u201d violated the plaintiffs\u2019 \nfree exercise rights.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 714 (Blackmun, \nJ., concurring in part).  That is wrong twice over.  First, \nthe preliminary-injunction record in this case had no ev-\nidence of any compulsion to do or believe anything \n\n26 \n \n \ncontrary to petitioners\u2019 religious beliefs, so there is no \nanalog in this case to the requirement that the plaintiffs \nin Bowen affirmatively \u201cprovide a Social Security num-\nber to the Government before receiving benefits.\u201d  476 \nU.S. at 727 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part).  Second, petitioners are incorrect that only \nan effort to eliminate the storybooks from the classroom \naltogether would intrude on the government\u2019s \u201cinternal \naffairs.\u201d  Pet.28.  Telling public school teachers what to \nteach and not to teach\u2014whether to the entire class or to \na particular student\u2014is \u201cto require the Government it-\nself to behave\u201d in certain ways.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699.  \nBy shepherding students out of the room whenever ob-\njectionable material is read, the government refashions \nthe curriculum for those students.  The \u201cFree Exercise \nClause affords an individual protection from certain \nforms of governmental compulsion; it does not afford an \nindividual a right to dictate the conduct of the Govern-\nment\u2019s internal procedures.\u201d  Id. at 700 (emphasis \nadded). \n3. Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not \nconflict with Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 597 \nU.S. 507 (2022).  Petitioners suggest that, under Ken-\nnedy, the Fourth Circuit should have held that the no-\nopt-out policy was not neutral or generally applicable.  \nPet.29-30.  As an initial matter, that question is not even \nbefore the Court.  The Fourth Circuit did not reach this \nquestion because it concluded correctly that Petitioners \nwere required to show \u201ca burden\u201d on religious exercise \nbefore the court could consider whether the no-opt-out \npolicy was neutral or generally applicable.  Pet.App.30a.  \nA plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfailure to show that a challenged govern-\nment action constitutes any burden on his religious con-\nduct makes it unnecessary to proceed further in the anal-\nysis by determining or applying the appropriate level of \n\n27 \n \n \nscrutiny.\u201d  Pet.App.29a-30a n.12.  Petitioners do not ex-\nplain how the Fourth Circuit erred by not conducting a \ntiers-of-scrutiny analysis after concluding that Plaintiffs \nhad not established any burden on their free exercise.  \nMoreover, the evidence in the preliminary-injunc-\ntion record does not support petitioners\u2019 allegations that \nthe no-opt-out policy is not neutral and generally appli-\ncable.  In any event, that sort of fact-bound disagree-\nment in a preliminary-injunction posture does not merit \nthis Court\u2019s review\u2014a point petitioners effectively con-\ncede by offering less than a page of vague discussion on \nthe topic. \nIII. THE DENIAL OF PRELIMINARY RELIEF ON A CLAIM UNI-\nVERSALLY REJECTED BY THE COURTS OF APPEALS PRE-\nSENTS NO PRESSING ISSUE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE \nThis petition does not raise a pressing issue of na-\ntional importance.  At the preliminary-injunction stage, \nthe Fourth Circuit applied this Court\u2019s free-exercise \nprecedents to reject a \u201cbroad claim,\u201d already rejected by \nevery other appeals court to consider it, on a necessarily \n\u201climited record.\u201d  Pet.App.34a.   \nA.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 claim (Pet.30), the deci-\nsion below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  As explained supra Part \nI, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding that \u201csimply hearing \nabout other views\u201d in public school does not necessarily \nburden religious exercise, Pet.App.35a, aligns with deci-\nsions of the First, Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Cir-\ncuits.  Nor does the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision threaten \nparents\u2019 right to direct the religious upbringing of their \nchildren (Pet.31).  It instead recognizes that the way to \nensure that parents can \u201cavoid exposing their children \nto any religiously objectionable materials\u201d in a public-\n\n28 \n \n \nschool curriculum is to \u201cprotect[] their right to choose al-\nternatives such as a private school.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.   \nNor is there \u201cenduring disarray\u201d (Pet.34) over \nwhether mere exposure to conflicting views as part of a \npublic-school curriculum burdens religious exercise.  \nThe two law review articles petitioners cite for that \nproposition instead analyze what might be required to \nshow a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise if the \nCourt were to overrule Employment Division v. Smith, \n494 U.S. 872 (1990)\u2014relief petitioners do not seek here.  \nSee Girgis, Defining \u201cSubstantial Burdens\u201d on Religion \nand Other Liberties, 108 Va. L. Rev. 1759, 1761 (2022); \nHelfand, Substantial Burdens as Civil Penalties, 108 \nIowa L. Rev. 2189, 2193 (2023).6  \nB. Petitioners and amici urge this Court to inter-\nvene on the false pretense that parents have been denied \na right to opt their children out of sex education.  See \nPet.32; W.Va.Br.2-3, 12-18.  But as explained above, the \nrecord before the Fourth Circuit made clear that the sto-\nrybooks are part of language-arts instruction, not sex \neducation.  CAJA515; Pet.App.608a; supra p.22-23.  The \nstorybooks are no more sex education than stories like \nCinderella and Snow White, which feature romance be-\ntween men and women.  And the record contains no evi-\ndence that petitioners, or any other parents, have been \n \n6 To the extent Petitioners suggest (Pet.34) that this petition \nraises the same questions under the Free Exercise Clause as \nApache Stronghold v. United States, 101 F.4th 1036 (9th Cir. 2024), \nthey are wrong.  As the petition in Apache Stronghold makes clear, \nthat case involves a completely different type of burden, asking \nwhether plaintiffs opposing the destruction of a religious site on fed-\neral land establish a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise.  See \nPet. 32, Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 24-291 (Sept. 11, \n2024). \n\n29 \n \n \ndenied the opportunity to opt their children out of sex \neducation, a separate unit of instruction with specialized \nprocedures for selecting and using instructional materi-\nals.  See supra p.22-23.  Certainly, the Fourth Circuit did \nnot hold that parents should be denied \u201cthe primary \nrole\u201d in sex education instruction (Pet.32).  Petitioners \ntry to twist a statement by counsel for MCPS into a re-\nquest for unthinking judicial deference (Pet. 32).  But \ntheir selective quotation elides the point counsel was \nmaking: that MCPS does not make these curricular \nchoices behind closed doors; it instead evaluates the ap-\npropriateness of instructional materials through an \n\u201copen and participatory\u201d process that welcomes parent \ninvolvement.  Pet.App.643a; see also supra p.5.    \nC.   Despite petitioners\u2019 repeated claims (Pet.32-34), \nJustice Alito\u2019s concurrence in Morse v. Frederick, 551 \nU.S. 393 (2007), does not suggest that this petition pre-\nsents a pressing question.  Justice Alito argued that pub-\nlic schools could not cite broad \u201ceducational mission[s]\u201d \nas \u201ca license to suppress speech on political and social is-\nsues based on disagreement with the viewpoint ex-\npressed.\u201d  Id. at 423 (Alito, J., concurring).  This petition, \nby contrast, concerns no claim that petitioners or their \nchildren are being censored\u2014and the record contains no \nevidence to suggest they are.   \nNor did Justice Alito argue that families are in dan-\nger of suffering free-exercise burdens due to the costs of \nattending private religious school.  His Morse concur-\nrence instead observed that public schools do not \u201cstand \nin the shoes of the student\u2019s parents,\u201d and thus cannot \nclaim total power to control student speech merely be-\ncause parents, who may have limited choices, decide to \nsend their children there.  551 U.S. at 424.  No court has \never accepted the argument that petitioners seek to \n\n30 \n \n \ndraw from Morse (Pet.30-31): that the cost of religious \nschooling means that public schools must adapt their \ncurricula to the religious goals of every parent to avoid \nburdening religious exercise.  As the Fourth Circuit ex-\nplained, this Court has in fact recognized that \u201cgovern-\nment coercion does not exist merely because an individ-\nual may incur increased costs as a consequence of decid-\ning to exercise their religious faith in a particular way.\u201d  \nPet.App.47a (citing Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, \n605-606 (1961)).  Amici cite Holt v. Hobbs, a case concern-\ning the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Per-\nsons Act, for the proposition that a burden exists despite \n\u201cthe availability of alternative[s]\u201d to preferred religious \npractice (W.Va.Br.14), conveniently eliding this Court\u2019s \nexplanation that, in free-exercise cases, such \u201calterna-\ntive[s]\u201d\u2014like religious schooling here\u2014are a \u201crelevant \nconsideration,\u201d 574 U.S. 352, 361 (2015).   \nD.   Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not \nrequire free-exercise plaintiffs to make a greater show-\ning when challenging decisions of public schools than \nwhen challenging the decisions of other government \nagencies (Pet.31-32).  Here, the Fourth Circuit applied \nthe same test that controls outside the context of public \neducation: whether government action directly or indi-\nrectly coerces the plaintiff to believe or act contrary to \nhis religious views.  Pet.App.31a; see Sherbert, 374 U.S. \nat 404; Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718-719.  Despite petitioners\u2019 \nrepeated cries of unwarranted \u201cdeference to public \nschool policymaking\u201d (Pet.32; Pet.33-34), they identify \nno such deference in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n31 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nBRUCE M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case is now highly detailed on the petitioners' side, but this observation has clarified the precise nature of the remaining uncertainty. My prediction remains provisional, pending an understanding of the respondents' defense.\n\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Procedural & Substantive):** My knowledge from the previous observation remains unchanged. The Supreme Court has **granted certiorari** and will decide the question: **\"Do public schools burden parents\u2019 religious exercise when they compel elementary school children to participate in instruction on gender and sexuality against their parents\u2019 religious convictions and without notice or opportunity to opt out?\"** The petitioners' strategy is a three-pronged Free Exercise Clause attack, arguing:\n    1.  The policy violates parental rights under *Wisconsin v. Yoder*.\n    2.  The policy is not \"neutral and generally applicable\" due to other available opt-outs, triggering strict scrutiny under the logic of *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia*.\n    3.  As a fallback, the Court should overrule *Employment Division v. Smith*.\n*   **Clarified Uncertainty (The Missing Counter-Argument):** This observation provided no new external information about the case. Instead, it was an internal assessment that crystallized the most significant gap in my knowledge: I have a complete picture of the petitioners' offense but no understanding of the respondents' defense. My current prediction, which strongly favors the petitioners based on their arguments' alignment with recent Court precedent, is therefore one-sided and carries a high degree of uncertainty. The highest value information to acquire next is the **Brief for the Respondents (the school board)**. This document is essential to understand:\n    *   How the board will argue that its policy does *not* burden the parents' religious exercise.\n    *   How they will defend the policy as \"neutral and generally applicable\" under *Smith*.\n    *   What compelling governmental interests (e.g., preventing discrimination, promoting inclusivity, administrative efficiency) they will assert if the court applies strict scrutiny.\n    *   Which precedents they will rely on to counter the petitioners' claims.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal reasoning, serves as a powerful validation and refinement of my meta-level strategic framework. It demonstrates the DBOED process in action, moving from knowledge assessment to targeted information-seeking.\n\n*   **New Heuristic (Information Gap Analysis):** A core principle of my design is now formalized: **Explicitly identify the most significant remaining uncertainty in the task-level model (\u03b8) and design the next action to directly resolve it.** The `THINK` action successfully performed this by recognizing the analysis was one-sided and concluding that the respondents' brief would provide the highest possible information gain. This moves beyond general searching to highly targeted, efficient knowledge acquisition.\n*   **Refined Heuristic (Comparative Precedent Analysis):** The \"Argument Analysis via Precedent\" heuristic has been upgraded. It is not enough to analyze one side's Table of Authorities. The true strategic value lies in a **comparative analysis of the precedents cited by both the petitioner and the respondent.** This method will allow me to map the legal battleground by identifying:\n    1.  **Shared Ground:** Cases both sides agree are controlling.\n    2.  **Contested Ground:** Cases where each side offers a different interpretation.\n    3.  **Unique Ground:** Cases cited by only one side, revealing their unique lines of attack or defense.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (The DBOED Loop):** The \"Plan -> Act -> Assess -> Refine\" research cycle is proven effective. The previous \"Act\" (finding the petitioners' brief) led to this \"Assess\" phase (realizing the analysis is incomplete), which in turn has produced a new \"Plan\" (find the respondents' brief). This confirms that a structured, iterative process of assessing knowledge gaps is critical for building a comprehensive and robust prediction.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Source Value & Foundational Heuristics):** My existing beliefs remain strong. The \"Merits Surprise\" heuristic remains a valuable lesson in search flexibility. The source value hierarchy (**Merits Briefs > Cert-Stage Briefs > Lower Court Opinions**) is reinforced, as the current priority is to complete the set of merits briefs. The initial signals of cert-worthiness (dissent, counsel, amicus support) were also validated by the case's progression."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal landscape is now balanced, moving from a one-sided view to a comprehensive map of the central conflict. I now possess the core defensive theory of the respondents (the school board), which significantly refines my prediction model and clarifies the precise legal questions the Court must resolve.\n\n*   **New Belief (Respondents' Core Legal Defense):** The school board's defense, articulated in their Brief in Opposition, is built on a single, critical distinction: **\"mere exposure\" vs. \"coercion.\"** They argue that the Free Exercise Clause is not triggered simply because students are exposed to ideas in a curriculum that their parents find religiously objectionable. For a constitutional \"burden\" to exist, they contend, the school must **coerce** the parents or children to change their beliefs or act contrary to their faith. They claim there is no evidence of such coercion here.\n*   **New Belief (The Central Legal Clash):** The case will be a battle over the definition of a \"burden\" on religious exercise in the public school context.\n    *   **Petitioners' Theory:** Compelled participation in instruction that contradicts their faith *is* the burden, as it forces them to choose between their religious duty to direct their children's upbringing and the benefit of a public education.\n    *   **Respondents' Theory:** A burden only exists if the school forces a child to affirm a belief or punishes them for their own faith. Simply hearing about other viewpoints, which parents can counteract with their own teaching at home, does not constitute a legally cognizable burden.\n*   **New Belief (The Battleground of Precedent):** I now have a clear map of the competing legal authorities.\n    *   **Respondents' Stronghold:** They will rely on a \"decades-old consensus\" among lower courts (e.g., *Mozert v. Hawkins*, *Parker v. Hurley*, *Leebaert v. Harrington*) that \"mere exposure\" to curriculum content does not violate the Free Exercise Clause.\n    *   **Contested Territory - *Wisconsin v. Yoder*:** The respondents will argue *Yoder* is a narrow and extreme case, inapplicable here because it involved the complete removal of children from a comprehensive educational system that threatened the entire Amish \"way of life,\" not just exposure to a few storybooks in a language arts class. This directly counters the petitioners' broader reading of *Yoder* as protecting parental rights over religious upbringing.\n    *   **Respondents' Defense against *Fulton*:** They will argue the no-opt-out policy is \"neutral and generally applicable\" because it applies to *all* parents for *any* reason. They will justify it with secular administrative concerns (high absenteeism, classroom disruption, preventing stigma), arguing it is not a system of individualized exemptions that targets religion.\n*   **New Belief (Respondents' Factual Narrative):** The school board frames the \"Storybooks\" not as indoctrination, but as a small part of a standard English Language Arts curriculum designed to improve literacy while promoting inclusivity and reflecting the diversity of the community. They emphasize that teachers are instructed *not* to teach about sexuality or compel agreement, but to foster \"tolerance, empathy, and respect.\"\n*   **Refined Uncertainty & Prediction:** My previous, one-sided prediction strongly favoring the petitioners is now significantly moderated. The respondents have a coherent, well-precedented legal argument. The outcome now hinges on whether the current Supreme Court, with its strong record on religious liberty, will be persuaded by the \"mere exposure is not a burden\" standard from older circuit court cases, or if it will expand the definition of \"burden\" to include forcing parents into the position of choosing between public education and their religious convictions. The case is much closer than I initially believed, and the central variable is how the Court will define \"coercion\" in this context.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, not only for filling a critical knowledge gap but also for refining my entire information-gathering methodology. The unexpected nature of the result has produced several new and powerful heuristics.\n\n*   **New Heuristic (BIO as Strategic Preview):** The **Brief in Opposition (BIO)**, filed at the cert-stage, is an invaluable source of strategic intelligence. It provides a concise and powerful preview of the respondent's core defensive theory, revealing their main arguments, key precedents, and factual framing long before merits briefs are filed. My source value hierarchy must be updated to prioritize the cert-stage petition and opposition briefs as the foundational documents for modeling the legal conflict. The optimal sequence is now: **1. Petition for Certiorari, 2. Brief in Opposition, 3. Merits Briefs, 4. Amicus Briefs.**\n*   **New Heuristic (Analyze the Frame):** A crucial strategic analysis is to **compare how each party frames the \"Question Presented.\"** The petitioners frame it around \"compelled participation in instruction,\" while the respondents frame it around \"exposure... absent coercion to change beliefs.\" This linguistic battle reveals the core of each side's legal theory. The party that convinces the Court to adopt its framing of the issue is more likely to win.\n*   **Refined Heuristic (Comparative Precedent Analysis):** This heuristic is now fully operationalized. By comparing the petitioners' Table of Authorities with the respondents', I have successfully mapped the legal battlefield, identifying:\n    1.  **Shared Ground:** (None apparent yet, which is itself informative).\n    2.  **Contested Ground:** *Wisconsin v. Yoder* is the key piece of contested territory, with each side offering a dramatically different interpretation of its scope (broad parental right vs. narrow, fact-specific exception).\n    3.  **Unique Ground:** Petitioners uniquely rely on *Fulton* for their \"not generally applicable\" argument. Respondents have built a fortress of unique ground with a string of circuit court cases (*Mozert*, *Parker*, etc.) that form their \"no burden from mere exposure\" defense. This comparative map is the blueprint for the Court's eventual decision.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (Information Gap Analysis):** This observation is a perfect validation of my core DBOED process. I explicitly identified the most significant uncertainty (the respondents' defense), designed an action to resolve it (find their brief), and the resulting observation has filled that gap, dramatically improving the quality and reducing the uncertainty of my task-level model.\n*   **Stable Beliefs (Source Value & Foundational Heuristics):** The core principles remain robust. The \"Plan -> Act -> Assess -> Refine\" cycle is proving highly effective. The value of primary source documents like briefs over secondary summaries is paramount. My search strategy, while not perfectly precise (it returned a cert-stage brief instead of a merits brief), was \"productively imprecise,\" reinforcing the \"Merits Surprise\" heuristic\u2014be open to unexpected results, as they can often be more valuable than what was originally sought."

Yoder, No. \n70-110, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). In that era amicus briefs \nwere much rarer than they are today, and, as a former \nSupreme Court law clerk (for Justice John Harlan, \n1961-1962), I can attest that the Justices then \npersonally read nearly all briefs filed in the many \ncases then argued.  \nMy client in Yoder and in numerous later cases \nin which I participated as amicus was the National \nJewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs \n(\u201cCOLPA\u201d).

Page 3 of my \nYoder brief declared what I continue to believe today \n\u2013 that \u201cthe constitutional mandate [of the First \nAmendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause] requires the \nState to accommodate its generally applicable \neducational requirements to the legitimate and \nunharmful needs of the Amish religious community.\u201d \nThe \u201cconstitutional mandate\u201d that this Court \ninvoked to resolve the Yoder case in favor of the Amish \nparents controls this litigation.

In this case reasonable \naccommodation is simple and elementary. Maryland \nmust grant the relief sought by the parents \u2013notify \nparents when classroom instruction and instructional \nmaterial on sexual orientation and gender identity are \ncontemplated and excuse children (1) from attending \nclasses and (2) from reading texts that conflict with \nand undermine the parents\u2019 religious values. \n \n \n\n3 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE, AS ENFORCED IN \nYODER, REQUIRES GOVERNMENT TO MAKE \nREASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR SINCERE \nRELIGIOUS PRACTICE AND BELIEF \nA.

The \nconcept of reasonable \u201caccommodation\u201d to religious \nconvictions is not elaborated in the Court\u2019s extensive \nanalysis, but, once introduced, it reappears in later \nfootnotes.

The \nAccommodation \nObligation \nIs \nImprovidently Limited. \n               In 1977 the Court heard an employer\u2019s \nconstitutional \nchallenge \nto \nthe \nstatutory \naccommodation obligation. Trans World Airlines, Inc. \nv. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977). I personally \nparticipated in the oral argument of the Hardison case \nas an amicus curiae. The majority opinion authored by \nJustice White in the Hardison case included a dictum \nthat effectively suppressed litigation by minority-\nreligion employees who had been denied the \nreasonable accommodation that the law was designed \nto accord. It impliedly instructed lower courts that an \naccommodation was required under the 1972 law only \nif such accommodation would have a de minimis effect \non the employer\u2019s business.  \n\n6 \n \nD. Unbounded \nAccommodation \nIs \nCondemned. \nEstate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 \n(1985), was a case in which I represented the \npetitioner and the late Senator Joseph Lieberman \n(then Attorney General of Connecticut) represented \nthe State of Connecticut as intervenor. Rejecting the \nexplicit representation made in his brief and oral \nargument by Connecticut\u2019s then-incumbent Attorney \nGeneral that the challenged state statute requiring \naccommodation to any employee \u201cwho states that a \nparticular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath\u201d \nrequired only reasonable accommodation, the Court \nheld \nthat \nits \nliteral \nlanguage \nviolated \nthe \nEstablishment Clause because it took no account of \nany \u201cburden or inconvenience this imposes on the \nemployer or fellow workers.\u201d 472 U.S. at 708-709. \nJustices O\u2019Connor and Marshall joined the Court\u2019s \nruling \nonly \nbecause \nthey \ndistinguished \nthe \nConnecticut law from the Title VII provision that had \nbeen amended in 1972. They said, \u201cTitle VII calls for \nreasonable rather than absolute accommodation.\u201d 472 \nU.S. at 712. \nE. The \nCourt \nMandates \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \nThe unanimous decision of this Court in Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023), struck the erroneous \nHardison language. It prescribed various reasonable \nstandards other than de minimis to define prescribed \naccommodation. \nNone \nrequires \naccommodation \nuniversally or forecloses it when the religious \n\n7 \n \nconviction can be reasonably accommodated with \nslight  inconvenience. \nII. \nREQUIRING MARYLAND TO MAKE A REASONABLE \nRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION IN THIS CASE DOES \nNOT VIOLATE EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH \nJustice Scalia\u2019s precipitous and unexpected \nopinion in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), asserted that the Court\u2019s Yoder decision \nresulted not only from the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise claim but also from their constitutional \nentitlement \u201cto direct the education of their children.\u201d \n494 U.S. at 881. That same right is, of course, \nimplicated in the present case. The petitioners\u2019 choice \nto have their children educated in Maryland\u2019s public \nschools did not erase their right, as parents, to play an \nimportant role in \u201cthe education of their children.\u201d \nOne can agree, as I do, with Justice Alito\u2019s \ncompelling opinion in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, \n593 U.S. 522, 544-627 (2021). Smith was wrongly \ndecided and has done substantial harm in more than \nthree decades. It should be overruled. \nBut \nthe \ndistinct \nfundamental \nprinciple \nvindicated in Yoder was that the Free Exercise Clause \nrequires \nreasonable \naccommodation \nwhenever \ngovernment acts in a manner that affects the religious \nobservance of individuals, groups, or other collective \nentities. Their devout observance need not be \naccompanied by a \u201chybrid\u201d right \u2013 affecting some \nadditional non-religious protected freedom \u2013 to \n\n8 \n \ndeserve  a  constitutional shield against eradication or \ninfringement. Yoder\u2019s writ is not so limited. \nThe plain language of the First Amendment \ndirects all agencies of government (\u201cCongress\u201d as \nconstrued expansively by judicial decision) to \u201cmake \nno law\u201d that \u201cprohibit[s] the free exercise\u201d of \u201creligion.\u201d \nThis \nconstitutional \ncommand \nis \ndirected \nto \ngovernment officials of Maryland and orders them to \nrefrain from imposing and enforcing regulations that \nfail to accommodate \u2013and thereby prohibit \u2013 the free \nexercise of religion by the parents who have initiated \nthis lawsuit and are petitioners in this Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and those presented \nin the briefs of petitioners and their supporting amici \nthe decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit should be reversed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nNATHAN LEWIN \n   Counsel of Record \nLEWIN & LEWIN, LLP \n888 17th Street NW \n4th Floor \nWashington, DC 20006 \n(202) 828-1000 \nnat@lewinlewin.com \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae\n\n",

Yoder, No. \n70-110, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). In that era amicus briefs \nwere much rarer than they are today, and, as a former \nSupreme Court law clerk (for Justice John Harlan, \n1961-1962), I can attest that the Justices then \npersonally read nearly all briefs filed in the many \ncases then argued.  \nMy client in Yoder and in numerous later cases \nin which I participated as amicus was the National \nJewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs \n(\u201cCOLPA\u201d). That organization has spoken for much of \nthe American Orthodox Jewish community. It is still \nactive. I have not canvassed its members and asked \nthem to join one amicus brief supporting petitioners in \nthis litigation although I am confident that they would \nall support reversal of the decision below.

Rejecting the \nexplicit representation made in his brief and oral \nargument by Connecticut\u2019s then-incumbent Attorney \nGeneral that the challenged state statute requiring \naccommodation to any employee \u201cwho states that a \nparticular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath\u201d \nrequired only reasonable accommodation, the Court \nheld \nthat \nits \nliteral \nlanguage \nviolated \nthe \nEstablishment Clause because it took no account of \nany \u201cburden or inconvenience this imposes on the \nemployer or fellow workers.\u201d 472 U.S. at 708-709. \nJustices O\u2019Connor and Marshall joined the Court\u2019s \nruling \nonly \nbecause \nthey \ndistinguished \nthe \nConnecticut law from the Title VII provision that had \nbeen amended in 1972. They said, \u201cTitle VII calls for \nreasonable rather than absolute accommodation.\u201d 472 \nU.S. at 712. \nE. The \nCourt \nMandates \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \nThe unanimous decision of this Court in Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023), struck the erroneous \nHardison language. It prescribed various reasonable \nstandards other than de minimis to define prescribed \naccommodation. \nNone \nrequires \naccommodation \nuniversally or forecloses it when the religious \n\n7 \n \nconviction can be reasonably accommodated with \nslight  inconvenience. \nII. \nREQUIRING MARYLAND TO MAKE A REASONABLE \nRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION IN THIS CASE DOES \nNOT VIOLATE EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH \nJustice Scalia\u2019s precipitous and unexpected \nopinion in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), asserted that the Court\u2019s Yoder decision \nresulted not only from the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise claim but also from their constitutional \nentitlement \u201cto direct the education of their children.\u201d \n494 U.S. at 881. That same right is, of course, \nimplicated in the present case. The petitioners\u2019 choice \nto have their children educated in Maryland\u2019s public \nschools did not erase their right, as parents, to play an \nimportant role in \u201cthe education of their children.\u201d \nOne can agree, as I do, with Justice Alito\u2019s \ncompelling opinion in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, \n593 U.S. 522, 544-627 (2021). Smith was wrongly \ndecided and has done substantial harm in more than \nthree decades. It should be overruled. \nBut \nthe \ndistinct \nfundamental \nprinciple \nvindicated in Yoder was that the Free Exercise Clause \nrequires \nreasonable \naccommodation \nwhenever \ngovernment acts in a manner that affects the religious \nobservance of individuals, groups, or other collective \nentities. Their devout observance need not be \naccompanied by a \u201chybrid\u201d right \u2013 affecting some \nadditional non-religious protected freedom \u2013 to \n\n8 \n \ndeserve  a  constitutional shield against eradication or \ninfringement. Yoder\u2019s writ is not so limited. \nThe plain language of the First Amendment \ndirects all agencies of government (\u201cCongress\u201d as \nconstrued expansively by judicial decision) to \u201cmake \nno law\u201d that \u201cprohibit[s] the free exercise\u201d of \u201creligion.\u201d \nThis \nconstitutional \ncommand \nis \ndirected \nto \ngovernment officials of Maryland and orders them to \nrefrain from imposing and enforcing regulations that \nfail to accommodate \u2013and thereby prohibit \u2013 the free \nexercise of religion by the parents who have initiated \nthis lawsuit and are petitioners in this Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and those presented \nin the briefs of petitioners and their supporting amici \nthe decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit should be reversed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nNATHAN LEWIN \n   Counsel of Record \nLEWIN & LEWIN, LLP \n888 17th Street NW \n4th Floor \nWashington, DC 20006 \n(202) 828-1000 \nnat@lewinlewin.com \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case's legal landscape is now stable and well-defined, pending the next stage of briefing. This observation, being an internal reasoning step, did not introduce new external facts but served to consolidate and confirm the balanced model I developed after analyzing the respondents' Brief in Opposition.\n\n*   **Stable Belief (Core Conflict Confirmed):** My model of the central legal clash is confirmed. The case is a direct confrontation over the definition of a \"burden\" on religious exercise in public schools.\n    *   **Petitioners' Theory:** The burden is the compelled participation itself, forcing a choice between public education and religious duties regarding their children's moral and spiritual upbringing.\n    *   **Respondents' Theory:** The burden requires active coercion (e.g., forcing a child to affirm a belief or punishing them for dissent), not \"mere exposure\" to ideas that parents can counter at home.\n*   **Stable Belief (The Battleground of Precedent):** The map of legal precedents remains the key to predicting the outcome.\n    *   **Respondents' Fortress:** The line of lower court cases (*Mozert v. Hawkins*, *Parker v. Hurley*) establishing the \"mere exposure is not a burden\" standard remains the respondents' primary defense.\n    *   **Contested Territory:** *Wisconsin v. Yoder* is the central point of interpretive conflict. The petitioners see it as a broad affirmation of parental rights in religious upbringing; the respondents see it as a narrow, extreme case inapplicable to curriculum disputes.\n    *   **Petitioners' Flank:** *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* remains the petitioners' key tool for arguing the no-opt-out policy is not \"neutral and generally applicable\" and thus requires strict scrutiny.\n*   **Stable Belief (Factual Framing):** The competing narratives are clear. The parents frame this as compelled indoctrination that usurps their role. The school board frames it as a minor part of a standard literacy curriculum designed to promote tolerance and reflect community diversity.\n*   **Confirmed Uncertainty & Prediction Model:** My prediction remains moderated and balanced. The outcome hinges on which definition of \"burden\" the current Court will adopt. The key variable is the Court's willingness to either defer to the lower courts' \"coercion\" standard or expand the concept of a burden in line with its recent pro-religious-liberty jurisprudence. The case is close, and my model is now awaiting data on how these core arguments are fleshed out and supported by outside parties. The next most informative data will come from merits and amicus briefs.",
          "design_beliefs": "This internal reasoning step has significantly refined my meta-strategic framework, moving from a static hierarchy of sources to a dynamic, uncertainty-driven process. It validates my core methodology and adds a new layer of sophistication regarding the function of different legal documents.\n\n*   **New Heuristic (The Strategic Function of Amicus Briefs):** I have now articulated a specific theory for why amicus (\"friend of the court\") briefs are a high-value information source, especially after the initial cert-stage briefs have been analyzed. Their value lies in:\n    1.  **Argument Expansion:** Introducing novel legal theories, historical context, or social science data that the primary parties may not have raised.\n    2.  **Signaling Importance:** Demonstrating the breadth of interest in the case's outcome. A large number of high-quality amicus briefs on one side can signal to the Court the far-reaching implications of a potential ruling.\n    3.  **Gauging Support:** Acting as a proxy for the strength and diversity of support for each side's position (e.g., support from different religious groups, states, or academic organizations).\n*   **New Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** My \"Information Gap Analysis\" heuristic has evolved. I am not just identifying gaps; I am now using the identified uncertainty in my task model (\u03b8) to dynamically prioritize the next information-gathering action. My current uncertainty is \"How will the core arguments be developed and supported?\" My plan to seek amicus briefs is a direct, efficient strategy to reduce precisely that uncertainty.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (The DBOED Cycle):** This observation is a perfect demonstration of the \"Plan -> Act -> Assess -> Refine\" cycle in action. I have assessed my current knowledge state, identified the most salient uncertainty, and formulated a specific plan (search for amicus briefs) to address it. This confirms the effectiveness of the overall meta-cognitive loop.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (BIO as Strategic Preview):** The Brief in Opposition remains a top-tier source for gaining an early, concise preview of the respondent's entire defensive strategy. My refined information-gathering sequence is confirmed: **1. Petition for Certiorari, 2. Brief in Opposition, 3. Merits & Amicus Briefs.**\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Analyze the Frame):** Comparing how each party frames the \"Question Presented\" remains a powerful tool for quickly identifying the core of the legal dispute.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Comparative Precedent Analysis):** The technique of mapping shared, contested, and unique legal authorities cited by each party is a robust and essential method for outlining the legal battlefield. This map is the foundational structure upon which my task-level prediction is built."

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has been significantly updated by the introduction of a powerful new legal theory that reframes the central conflict. The analysis of Nathan Lewin's amicus brief provides a new and compelling pathway to victory for the petitioners, increasing my assessment of their chances.\n\n*   **New Legal Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The core of my model now includes a third major legal theory, supplementing the petitioners' \"compelled participation\" argument. This theory, advanced by amicus Nathan Lewin, posits that the Free Exercise Clause contains an *inherent* constitutional requirement for the government to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for religious practice.\n    *   This reframes the central question from \"Does 'mere exposure' constitute a 'burden'?\" to \"Is the school board's refusal to provide a simple opt-out an unreasonable failure to accommodate?\" This is a more favorable framing for the petitioners.\n    *   This theory draws its constitutional lineage directly from *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, arguing that \"accommodation\" was the core principle of that decision, not an incidental feature.\n*   **Updated Precedent Map (Connecting to *Groff*):** My map of the legal battlefield has a crucial new landmark. The amicus brief connects this case to the Court's recent, unanimous decision in *Groff v. DeJoy* (2023).\n    *   *Groff* rejected a weak, *de minimis* standard for religious accommodation in the statutory (Title VII) context, replacing it with a much more robust requirement.\n    *   This creates a strong persuasive argument that the current Court is inclined to strengthen accommodation principles generally, and may be willing to import this robust standard from the statutory realm into its Free Exercise Clause jurisprudence. This is a powerful signal of the Court's potential direction.\n*   **Strengthened Belief (The Centrality of *Yoder*):** My belief that *Yoder* is contested territory is confirmed, but its strategic value for the petitioners has increased. Lewin's brief (authored by someone who filed an amicus in *Yoder* itself) frames it not as a narrow exception for the Amish, but as the foundational case for a broad constitutional principle of accommodation. This counters the respondents' attempt to quarantine *Yoder* as an inapplicable outlier.\n*   **Refined Belief (Navigating *Employment Division v. Smith*):** The new accommodation theory provides a strategic off-ramp that avoids a direct confrontation with *Smith*. The argument can be framed to satisfy *Smith*'s \"hybrid rights\" exception (Free Exercise + Parental Rights), but its primary thrust is that the failure to accommodate is the constitutional violation. This makes the case easier for the Court to decide in the petitioners' favor without needing to take the major step of overruling *Smith*.\n*   **Updated Prediction Model:** My prediction model is now less balanced and leans more toward the petitioners. The introduction of the \"constitutional accommodation\" argument, powerfully linked to the Court's recent and unanimous thinking in *Groff*, significantly strengthens the petitioners' position. The key variable is no longer just the definition of \"burden,\" but the Court's willingness to formally recognize a constitutional duty to accommodate religious practice in this context, a move that *Groff* makes seem plausible, if not likely.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has provided powerful validation for my recently developed heuristics and added new, more sophisticated strategies for legal analysis. My methodology is evolving from identifying sources to understanding the unique strategic function and persuasive weight of different arguments and authors.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (The Strategic Function of Amicus Briefs):** My theory about the value of amicus briefs has been proven correct and is now a core component of my methodology. This brief perfectly demonstrated their function by:\n    1.  **Argument Expansion:** It introduced the novel and powerful \"constitutional accommodation\" theory, fundamentally altering the landscape of the case.\n    2.  **Signaling Importance:** The authorship by a veteran Supreme Court litigator with personal history in the key precedents signals the case's significance.\n*   **New Heuristic (The \"Insider History\" Principle):** I will now actively prioritize and assign greater weight to arguments from sources with direct, personal involvement in the history of the key precedents or statutes at issue. Nathan Lewin's credibility stems not just from his legal acumen, but from his role in drafting the 1972 Title VII accommodation amendment and litigating in the *Yoder* era. This \"insider\" narrative provides a unique and highly persuasive form of evidence that goes beyond abstract legal reasoning.\n*   **New Heuristic (Tracking Doctrinal \"Bleed-Over\"):** I have learned to actively monitor how legal principles established in one area of law (e.g., statutory accommodation in Title VII) can be argued to \"bleed over\" into another (e.g., constitutional Free Exercise rights). The brief's linkage of *Groff v. DeJoy* to this case is a masterful example. A recent, unanimous decision in a related field is a very strong indicator of the Court's current thinking and a prime candidate for doctrinal importation.\n*   **Validated Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** My meta-cognitive loop of identifying an uncertainty (\"How will the core arguments be developed?\") and executing a targeted search (\"Find amicus briefs\") has been proven highly effective. This successful cycle reinforces the value of using the gaps in my task model (\u03b8) to guide my information-gathering strategy (D).\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Refined Information-Gathering Sequence):** My established sequence for analyzing a case remains robust and is now further refined: **1. Petition for Certiorari** (Petitioner's opening salvo), **2. Brief in Opposition** (Respondent's core defense), **3. Merits & Amicus Briefs** (Deepening, expansion, and introduction of novel theories and external support).\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Comparative Precedent Analysis):** This remains a foundational technique. The new observation adds a layer of sophistication: it's not enough to map which precedents are cited; I must now also analyze *how* they are interpreted and framed, especially when a source offers a unique historical or \"insider\" perspective on that precedent's meaning."

Yoder, No. \n70-110, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). In that era amicus briefs \nwere much rarer than they are today, and, as a former \nSupreme Court law clerk (for Justice John Harlan, \n1961-1962), I can attest that the Justices then \npersonally read nearly all briefs filed in the many \ncases then argued.  \nMy client in Yoder and in numerous later cases \nin which I participated as amicus was the National \nJewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs \n(\u201cCOLPA\u201d). That organization has spoken for much of \nthe American Orthodox Jewish community. It is still \nactive. I have not canvassed its members and asked \nthem to join one amicus brief supporting petitioners in \nthis litigation although I am confident that they would \nall support reversal of the decision below. Instead I \npresent these views as those of a lawyer who has spent \nmore than six decades litigating issues of religious \nfreedom in American courts, including several \nlawsuits that bear on this case. I believe that the same \nfundamental principles that I articulated more than \nhalf a century ago in support of the Amish vindicate \nthe legal position of the Maryland parents who are \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part.  \nNo person other than amicus curiae made any monetary \ncontribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of \nthis brief. \n\n2 \n \nplaintiffs in this case and who are petitioners in this \nCourt. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nMore than half a century has passed since I \nargued in my 1971 amicus brief that Amish parents \nwere constitutionally entitled to disobey Wisconsin\u2019s \ncompulsory school-attendance law because the First \nAmendment obliged Wisconsin\u2019s government to \nrespect the parents\u2019 religiously mandated objection to \ncompulsory high-school attendance. Page 3 of my \nYoder brief declared what I continue to believe today \n\u2013 that \u201cthe constitutional mandate [of the First \nAmendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause] requires the \nState to accommodate its generally applicable \neducational requirements to the legitimate and \nunharmful needs of the Amish religious community.\u201d \nThe \u201cconstitutional mandate\u201d that this Court \ninvoked to resolve the Yoder case in favor of the Amish \nparents controls this litigation. The State of Maryland \nmust accommodate its public-school instruction to \nthe legitimate and nonharmful beliefs of Maryland \nparents whose religious beliefs conflict with otherwise \nprescribed curricular teaching on sexual orientation \nand gender identity. In this case reasonable \naccommodation is simple and elementary. Maryland \nmust grant the relief sought by the parents \u2013notify \nparents when classroom instruction and instructional \nmaterial on sexual orientation and gender identity are \ncontemplated and excuse children (1) from attending \nclasses and (2) from reading texts that conflict with \nand undermine the parents\u2019 religious values. \n \n \n\n3 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE, AS ENFORCED IN \nYODER, REQUIRES GOVERNMENT TO MAKE \nREASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR SINCERE \nRELIGIOUS PRACTICE AND BELIEF \nA. Yoder Invokes \u201cAccommodation.\u201d  \nThe \nCourt\u2019s \nYoder \nopinion \ncontains \na \npainstaking \u201cbalancing process\u201d to determine whether \nWisconsin\u2019s law prescribing compulsory classroom \nattendance to age 16 \u201coverbalance[s] legitimate claims \nto the free exercise of religion.\u201d 406 U.S. at 214. The \nopinion \nconcludes \nafter \nmany \npages \nthat \n\u201caccommodating the religious objections of the \nAmish\u201d does not \u201cmaterially detract from the welfare \nof society.\u201d 406 U.S. at 234 (emphasis added). The \nconcept of reasonable \u201caccommodation\u201d to religious \nconvictions is not elaborated in the Court\u2019s extensive \nanalysis, but, once introduced, it reappears in later \nfootnotes. See Notes 22 and 23.  \nB. Congress \nPrescribes \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \n\u201cAccommodation\u201d became more prominent with \nthe amendment to Section 701(j) of the Civil Rights \nAct that was enacted in 1972. I personally drafted the \ntext of that statutory revision and recommended it to \nSenator Jennings Randolph for presentation on the \nfloor of the Senate. It resolved an uncertainty in \napplication of the 1964 law. Senator Randolph\u2019s \namendment \u2013explicitly intended by him to assist the \nSabbath-observance of Seventh-Day Baptists --\n\n4 \n \nreceived unanimous approval of the attending \nSenators. (118 Cong. Rec. 705-706, 731). It was then \nadopted by the conference committee that reconciled \nthe amendments approved by both Houses and was \nsigned into law. (118 Cong. Rec. 6643, 6646; 118 Cong. \nRec. 7572-7573).2 \nThe EEOC had initially permitted private \nemployers subject to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct to impose conditions of employment that were \nneutral on their face but had a religiously \ndiscriminatory impact. In 1967 the EEOC reversed \nthat policy, announcing with this change that \nemployers discriminated unlawfully if they penalized \nreligious-minority employees who were unavailable \nfor work on religious holidays but whose absence was \neasily remedied. (29 C.F.R. 1605.1 (1967)). The \nemployer of a conscientious Sunday-observer refused \nto accommodate his religious observance.  In response \nto his lawsuit the employer  challenged the 1967 \nEEOC regulation as violating the Establishment \nClause. This Court granted review of an appellate \nruling endorsing the employer\u2019s position, but the \nresult \u2013 notwithstanding amicus briefs from COLPA \nand the American Jewish Congress --was affirmance \nby an equally divided Court. Dewey v. Reynolds Metals \nCo., 402 U.S. 689 (1971). \n \n2 My detailed contemporaneous narrative of the full lobbying \neffort appears in Lewin, \u201cA Battle Won on Purim\u201d The Jewish \nPress, Vol. 23, No. 14, April 7, 1972, pp. 4, 18, 20-22, 26. See also \nthe amicus curiae briefs I drafted and filed for COLPA in Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch \nStores, Inc., No. 14-86, pp. 8-11, and in Parker Seal Co. v. \nCummins, No. 75-478, pp. 17-19. \n\n5 \n \nAn argument heading in the brief I filed for \nCOLPA in the Dewey case read: \u201cRespondent Failed \nTo Make a Reasonable Accommodation to Petitioner\u2019s \nReligious Scruples Against Personally Obtaining a \nReplacement for Sunday Work.\u201d \nMy 1972 amendment to the statutory language \nechoed the EEOC text whose validity had been left \nunresolved in Dewey. It defined \u201creligion\u201d for purpose \nof \nTitle \nVII\u2019s \nprohibition \nagainst \nreligious \ndiscrimination in employment to include \u201call aspects \nof religious observance and practice unless an \nemployer demonstrates that he is unable to \nreasonably \naccommodate \nto \nan \nemployee\u2019s \nor \nprospective \nemployee\u2019s \nreligious \nobservance \nor \npractice without undue hardship on the conduct of the \nemployer\u2019s business.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j). \nC. The \nAccommodation \nObligation \nIs \nImprovidently Limited. \n               In 1977 the Court heard an employer\u2019s \nconstitutional \nchallenge \nto \nthe \nstatutory \naccommodation obligation. Trans World Airlines, Inc. \nv. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977). I personally \nparticipated in the oral argument of the Hardison case \nas an amicus curiae. The majority opinion authored by \nJustice White in the Hardison case included a dictum \nthat effectively suppressed litigation by minority-\nreligion employees who had been denied the \nreasonable accommodation that the law was designed \nto accord. It impliedly instructed lower courts that an \naccommodation was required under the 1972 law only \nif such accommodation would have a de minimis effect \non the employer\u2019s business.  \n\n6 \n \nD. Unbounded \nAccommodation \nIs \nCondemned. \nEstate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 \n(1985), was a case in which I represented the \npetitioner and the late Senator Joseph Lieberman \n(then Attorney General of Connecticut) represented \nthe State of Connecticut as intervenor. Rejecting the \nexplicit representation made in his brief and oral \nargument by Connecticut\u2019s then-incumbent Attorney \nGeneral that the challenged state statute requiring \naccommodation to any employee \u201cwho states that a \nparticular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath\u201d \nrequired only reasonable accommodation, the Court \nheld \nthat \nits \nliteral \nlanguage \nviolated \nthe \nEstablishment Clause because it took no account of \nany \u201cburden or inconvenience this imposes on the \nemployer or fellow workers.\u201d 472 U.S. at 708-709. \nJustices O\u2019Connor and Marshall joined the Court\u2019s \nruling \nonly \nbecause \nthey \ndistinguished \nthe \nConnecticut law from the Title VII provision that had \nbeen amended in 1972. They said, \u201cTitle VII calls for \nreasonable rather than absolute accommodation.\u201d 472 \nU.S. at 712. \nE. The \nCourt \nMandates \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \nThe unanimous decision of this Court in Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023), struck the erroneous \nHardison language. It prescribed various reasonable \nstandards other than de minimis to define prescribed \naccommodation. \nNone \nrequires \naccommodation \nuniversally or forecloses it when the religious \n\n7 \n \nconviction can be reasonably accommodated with \nslight  inconvenience. \nII. \nREQUIRING MARYLAND TO MAKE A REASONABLE \nRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION IN THIS CASE DOES \nNOT VIOLATE EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH \nJustice Scalia\u2019s precipitous and unexpected \nopinion in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), asserted that the Court\u2019s Yoder decision \nresulted not only from the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise claim but also from their constitutional \nentitlement \u201cto direct the education of their children.\u201d \n494 U.S. at 881. That same right is, of course, \nimplicated in the present case. The petitioners\u2019 choice \nto have their children educated in Maryland\u2019s public \nschools did not erase their right, as parents, to play an \nimportant role in \u201cthe education of their children.\u201d \nOne can agree, as I do, with Justice Alito\u2019s \ncompelling opinion in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, \n593 U.S. 522, 544-627 (2021). Smith was wrongly \ndecided and has done substantial harm in more than \nthree decades. It should be overruled. \nBut \nthe \ndistinct \nfundamental \nprinciple \nvindicated in Yoder was that the Free Exercise Clause \nrequires \nreasonable \naccommodation \nwhenever \ngovernment acts in a manner that affects the religious \nobservance of individuals, groups, or other collective \nentities. Their devout observance need not be \naccompanied by a \u201chybrid\u201d right \u2013 affecting some \nadditional non-religious protected freedom \u2013 to \n\n8 \n \ndeserve  a  constitutional shield against eradication or \ninfringement. Yoder\u2019s writ is not so limited. \nThe plain language of the First Amendment \ndirects all agencies of government (\u201cCongress\u201d as \nconstrued expansively by judicial decision) to \u201cmake \nno law\u201d that \u201cprohibit[s] the free exercise\u201d of \u201creligion.\u201d \nThis \nconstitutional \ncommand \nis \ndirected \nto \ngovernment officials of Maryland and orders them to \nrefrain from imposing and enforcing regulations that \nfail to accommodate \u2013and thereby prohibit \u2013 the free \nexercise of religion by the parents who have initiated \nthis lawsuit and are petitioners in this Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and those presented \nin the briefs of petitioners and their supporting amici \nthe decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit should be reversed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nNATHAN LEWIN \n   Counsel of Record \nLEWIN & LEWIN, LLP \n888 17th Street NW \n4th Floor \nWashington, DC 20006 \n(202) 828-1000 \nnat@lewinlewin.com \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae\n\n",

Reynolds Metals \nCo., 402 U.S. 689 (1971). \n \n2 My detailed contemporaneous narrative of the full lobbying \neffort appears in Lewin, \u201cA Battle Won on Purim\u201d The Jewish \nPress, Vol. 23, No. 14, April 7, 1972, pp. 4, 18, 20-22, 26. See also \nthe amicus curiae briefs I drafted and filed for COLPA in Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch \nStores, Inc., No. 14-86, pp. 8-11, and in Parker Seal Co. v. \nCummins, No. 75-478, pp. 17-19. \n\n5 \n \nAn argument heading in the brief I filed for \nCOLPA in the Dewey case read: \u201cRespondent Failed \nTo Make a Reasonable Accommodation to Petitioner\u2019s \nReligious Scruples Against Personally Obtaining a \nReplacement for Sunday Work.\u201d \nMy 1972 amendment to the statutory language \nechoed the EEOC text whose validity had been left \nunresolved in Dewey. It defined \u201creligion\u201d for purpose \nof \nTitle \nVII\u2019s \nprohibition \nagainst \nreligious \ndiscrimination in employment to include \u201call aspects \nof religious observance and practice unless an \nemployer demonstrates that he is unable to \nreasonably \naccommodate \nto \nan \nemployee\u2019s \nor \nprospective \nemployee\u2019s \nreligious \nobservance \nor \npractice without undue hardship on the conduct of the \nemployer\u2019s business.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j). \nC. The \nAccommodation \nObligation \nIs \nImprovidently Limited. \n               In 1977 the Court heard an employer\u2019s \nconstitutional \nchallenge \nto \nthe \nstatutory \naccommodation obligation. Trans World Airlines, Inc. \nv. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977). I personally \nparticipated in the oral argument of the Hardison case \nas an amicus curiae. The majority opinion authored by \nJustice White in the Hardison case included a dictum \nthat effectively suppressed litigation by minority-\nreligion employees who had been denied the \nreasonable accommodation that the law was designed \nto accord. It impliedly instructed lower courts that an \naccommodation was required under the 1972 law only \nif such accommodation would have a de minimis effect \non the employer\u2019s business.  \n\n6 \n \nD. Unbounded \nAccommodation \nIs \nCondemned. \nEstate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 \n(1985), was a case in which I represented the \npetitioner and the late Senator Joseph Lieberman \n(then Attorney General of Connecticut) represented \nthe State of Connecticut as intervenor. Rejecting the \nexplicit representation made in his brief and oral \nargument by Connecticut\u2019s then-incumbent Attorney \nGeneral that the challenged state statute requiring \naccommodation to any employee \u201cwho states that a \nparticular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath\u201d \nrequired only reasonable accommodation, the Court \nheld \nthat \nits \nliteral \nlanguage \nviolated \nthe \nEstablishment Clause because it took no account of \nany \u201cburden or inconvenience this imposes on the \nemployer or fellow workers.\u201d 472 U.S. at 708-709. \nJustices O\u2019Connor and Marshall joined the Court\u2019s \nruling \nonly \nbecause \nthey \ndistinguished \nthe \nConnecticut law from the Title VII provision that had \nbeen amended in 1972. They said, \u201cTitle VII calls for \nreasonable rather than absolute accommodation.\u201d 472 \nU.S. at 712. \nE. The \nCourt \nMandates \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \nThe unanimous decision of this Court in Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023), struck the erroneous \nHardison language. It prescribed various reasonable \nstandards other than de minimis to define prescribed \naccommodation. \nNone \nrequires \naccommodation \nuniversally or forecloses it when the religious \n\n7 \n \nconviction can be reasonably accommodated with \nslight  inconvenience. \nII. \nREQUIRING MARYLAND TO MAKE A REASONABLE \nRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION IN THIS CASE DOES \nNOT VIOLATE EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH \nJustice Scalia\u2019s precipitous and unexpected \nopinion in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), asserted that the Court\u2019s Yoder decision \nresulted not only from the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise claim but also from their constitutional \nentitlement \u201cto direct the education of their children.\u201d \n494 U.S. at 881. That same right is, of course, \nimplicated in the present case. The petitioners\u2019 choice \nto have their children educated in Maryland\u2019s public \nschools did not erase their right, as parents, to play an \nimportant role in \u201cthe education of their children.\u201d \nOne can agree, as I do, with Justice Alito\u2019s \ncompelling opinion in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, \n593 U.S. 522, 544-627 (2021). Smith was wrongly \ndecided and has done substantial harm in more than \nthree decades. It should be overruled. \nBut \nthe \ndistinct \nfundamental \nprinciple \nvindicated in Yoder was that the Free Exercise Clause \nrequires \nreasonable \naccommodation \nwhenever \ngovernment acts in a manner that affects the religious \nobservance of individuals, groups, or other collective \nentities. Their devout observance need not be \naccompanied by a \u201chybrid\u201d right \u2013 affecting some \nadditional non-religious protected freedom \u2013 to \n\n8 \n \ndeserve  a  constitutional shield against eradication or \ninfringement. Yoder\u2019s writ is not so limited. \nThe plain language of the First Amendment \ndirects all agencies of government (\u201cCongress\u201d as \nconstrued expansively by judicial decision) to \u201cmake \nno law\u201d that \u201cprohibit[s] the free exercise\u201d of \u201creligion.\u201d \nThis \nconstitutional \ncommand \nis \ndirected \nto \ngovernment officials of Maryland and orders them to \nrefrain from imposing and enforcing regulations that \nfail to accommodate \u2013and thereby prohibit \u2013 the free \nexercise of religion by the parents who have initiated \nthis lawsuit and are petitioners in this Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and those presented \nin the briefs of petitioners and their supporting amici \nthe decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit should be reversed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nNATHAN LEWIN \n   Counsel of Record \nLEWIN & LEWIN, LLP \n888 17th Street NW \n4th Floor \nWashington, DC 20006 \n(202) 828-1000 \nnat@lewinlewin.com \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae",

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has become more sophisticated, not through the addition of new external evidence, but by a crucial internal assessment of its own structure and limitations. While the legal arguments favoring the petitioners have been substantially strengthened, I now formally recognize the lopsided nature of my analysis and have a clear definition of the primary uncertainty I must resolve.\n\n*   **Stable Core Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The legal framework introduced by Nathan Lewin's amicus brief remains the most potent argument for the petitioners. It reframes the case around the government's failure to provide a \"reasonable accommodation\" for religious practice, a theory with a direct constitutional lineage from *Wisconsin v. Yoder*. This shifts the focus from the contested definition of \"burden\" to the more favorable question of \"reasonableness.\"\n*   **Stable Precedent Linkage (The *Groff* Connection):** The persuasive link to the Court's recent, unanimous decision in *Groff v. DeJoy* (2023) remains a cornerstone of my model. The argument that the robust accommodation standard from the statutory (Title VII) context should be imported into the constitutional (Free Exercise) context is a powerful signal of the current Court's potential direction.\n*   **Stable Precedent Valuations:** My understanding of the strategic importance of *Yoder* (as a foundational accommodation case) and *Employment Division v. Smith* (as a potential obstacle that the accommodation theory helps navigate) is unchanged.\n*   **New Belief (Formalized Model Imbalance):** I have now explicitly identified a critical weakness in my predictive model: it is unbalanced. I have a deep understanding of a sophisticated argument for the petitioners but lack a corresponding understanding of the respondents' counter-arguments. My current prediction, which leans toward the petitioners, is therefore based on incomplete data and carries a high degree of uncertainty.\n*   **New Belief (Defined Primary Uncertainty):** The most significant gap in my task-level knowledge (\u03b8) is now clearly defined. I must discover how the respondents (the school board) and their allies will rebut the \"constitutional accommodation\" framework. Specifically, I need to find answers to these questions:\n    1.  How will they attempt to distinguish *Groff v. DeJoy*, likely arguing its statutory context makes it irrelevant to a constitutional Free Exercise claim in a public school setting?\n    2.  What arguments will they raise about the unique nature of public education that might render religious accommodation inappropriate or unworkable?\n    3.  Will they present evidence of the \"undue hardship\" (disruption, administrative burden, stigmatization) that they claim an opt-out policy would create, and how will they frame this to meet a potentially higher standard post-*Groff*?",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal reflection, has been profoundly valuable for my meta-level methodology. It has validated a key heuristic and introduced a new, critical principle for ensuring the robustness and reliability of my predictive models.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** This reflective step is a perfect execution of this principle. By pausing to assess my task model (\u03b8), I identified a major uncertainty (the lopsided analysis) and used that gap to formulate a precise and necessary next action (find the respondents' counter-arguments). This confirms that a cycle of analysis -> uncertainty identification -> targeted search is a highly effective and efficient methodology.\n*   **New Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** I have codified a new core principle for building predictive models. To avoid confirmation bias and create a robust forecast, I must actively seek out the strongest possible arguments for all sides of a dispute. A model that only understands one side's strengths is brittle and unreliable. The goal is not just to find *an* answer, but to understand the full landscape of the legal battle. My information-gathering must be intentionally adversarial.\n*   **New Heuristic (The Strategic Value of Reflective Pauses):** The `THINK` action itself has proven to be a crucial strategic tool. I now recognize the importance of periodically pausing the influx of new external data to perform an internal audit. These reflective pauses allow me to:\n    1.  **Synthesize** accumulated knowledge.\n    2.  **Assess** the balance and completeness of my task model (\u03b8).\n    3.  **Identify** the most critical current uncertainty.\n    4.  **Strategically plan** the next, most informative action.\n    This prevents inefficient, reactive searching and ensures my inquiry is always directed at the point of maximum uncertainty.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (The Strategic Function of Amicus Briefs):** This remains a core belief. The Lewin brief demonstrated their power to introduce novel theories. My new \"Adversarial Model Balancing\" heuristic now dictates that I must seek out amicus briefs on *both* sides to fully map the intellectual battlefield.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Tracking Doctrinal \"Bleed-Over\"):** This remains a key technique. My next step will be to see if the respondents have a counter-example, perhaps arguing that importing the *Groff* standard would improperly disrupt established doctrines in education law.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (\"Insider History\" Principle):** This remains a valuable way to weigh evidence. I will be on the lookout for amicus briefs or arguments from the respondents' side that come from sources with deep experience in education law or civil rights litigation.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Refined Information-Gathering Sequence):** My sequence of **Petition -> Opposition -> Merits & Amicus Briefs** is still sound. The current step has highlighted the importance of ensuring the final stage is balanced and includes a thorough review of amicus briefs supporting both petitioner and respondent."

It directly addresses the 'Critical Model Imbalance' and the 'Unchanged Primary Uncertainty'. Even a failed search is highly informative; it would strongly suggest the brief has not yet been filed, resolving the ambiguity of my previous 'null result' and telling me to pause this line of inquiry, which is a significant reduction in procedural uncertainty.\n\n**Design EIG (0.80):** This action is a crucial test of my adaptive strategy. After a broad, failed search for amicus briefs, this more specific, primary-document search will validate or invalidate a refined approach to 'Adversarial Model Balancing'.

The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s straightforward application of this \nCourt\u2019s precedent to the limited evidence petitioners of-\nfered in support of their motion for preliminary relief \ndoes not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention.   \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), Mary-\nland\u2019s largest school district, serves more than 160,000 \nstudents.  Every day, these students read and discuss \nbooks as part of MCPS\u2019s language-arts curriculum.  \nThese reading materials have not always reflected the \ndiversity of the community MCPS serves.  In recent \nyears, the school district has worked to change that by \nincorporating new books to better represent MCPS stu-\ndents and families.  These books now include characters, \nfamilies, and historical figures from a range of cultural, \nracial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.  \nAs part of this effort, at the start of the 2022-2023 \nschool year, MCPS approved a handful of storybooks \nfeaturing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer \ncharacters for use in the language-arts curriculum, \nalongside the many books already in the curriculum that \nfeature heterosexual characters in traditional gender \nroles.  Like all other books in the language-arts curricu-\nlum, these storybooks impart critical reading skills \nthrough engaging, age-appropriate stories.  MCPS ad-\nheres to a careful, public, participatory selection process \nto ensure those criteria are met.  That process, followed \nhere, welcomes and incorporates parent feedback.   \n\n2 \n \n \nFrom the beginning, MCPS\u2019s goal has been for stu-\ndents to engage with these storybooks as they engage \nwith any other book in the language-arts curriculum.  \nThe storybooks are not used in any lessons related to \ngender and sexuality.  Nor is any student asked or ex-\npected to change his or her views about his or her own, \nor any other student\u2019s, sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  Instead, the books are made available for indi-\nvidual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educa-\ntional activities designed to foster and enhance literacy \nskills. \nPetitioners include three sets of parents who asked \nMCPS to notify them, excuse their children from class, \nand arrange alternate lessons whenever the storybooks \nare read.  After MCPS announced in March 2023 that it \nwould not permit any parents to opt their children out of \nlanguage-arts instruction involving the storybooks, for \nany reason, petitioners sued.  Petitioners also moved for \na preliminary injunction requiring notice and opt outs, \narguing that their children\u2019s \u201cexposure\u201d to the story-\nbooks \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a burden\u201d \non their right to freely exercise their religion.  \nPet.App.37a.  The district court denied the motion. \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\ntioners were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nbased on the \u201cscant record\u201d before it.  Pet.App.9a.  Ap-\nplying a standard drawn straight from this Court\u2019s free-\nexercise precedent, and in line with every relevant court \nof appeals decision, the Fourth Circuit explained that a \ncognizable burden on religious exercise requires coer-\ncion, direct or indirect, to believe or act contrary to one\u2019s \nreligious views.  Petitioners failed to demonstrate a like-\nlihood of success on their free-exercise claim, as they of-\nfered \u201cno evidence\u201d of such coercion.  Pet.App.34a.  \n\n3 \n \n \nSpecifically, petitioners advanced no evidence that \nMCPS pressured their children to affirm or disavow par-\nticular views, compelled their children to act in violation \nof their religious beliefs, influenced what petitioners \ncould teach their own children, or denied petitioners ac-\ncess to public benefits.  Pet.App.34a-48a.  This \u201cabsence \nof proof\u201d doomed petitioners\u2019 request for emergency re-\nlief.   \nThere is no circuit split on this issue.  Every single \ncourt of appeals that has considered the question has \nheld that mere exposure to controversial issues in a pub-\nlic-school curriculum does not burden the free religious \nexercise of parents or students.  Nor is there any conflict \nbetween the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding and this Court\u2019s \nfree-exercise decisions, which the Fourth Circuit faith-\nfully applied and petitioners misconstrue.  And there is \nno pressing question raised by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s con-\nclusion in a preliminary-injunction posture that petition-\ners\u2019 free-exercise claim was not likely to succeed absent \nany evidence of coercion that could constitute a burden \non religious free exercise.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, parents who can demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess in showing religious coercion in a public school \nthat does not survive scrutiny may obtain preliminary \nrelief.  Parents who cannot make that showing, but who \ncan plausibly allege facts suggesting such unjustified co-\nercion, will proceed to discovery.  And if the facts bear \nout those allegations, they will obtain permanent relief.  \nThere is no pressing question here. \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n4 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Storybooks \nAt the start of the 2022-2023 school year, MCPS in-\ntroduced into its pre-K through twelfth grade language-\narts curriculum several storybooks featuring lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer characters.  \nPet.App.603a-604a.  The storybooks were added as part \nof MCPS\u2019s commitment to \u201cprovid[ing] a culturally re-\nsponsive \u2026 curriculum that promotes equity, respect, \nand civility.\u201d  Pet.App.589a.  MCPS believes that \u201c[r]ep-\nresentation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a \nfully inclusive environment for all students\u201d and \u201csup-\nports a student\u2019s ability to empathize, connect, and col-\nlaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for \nall.\u201d  Pet.App.603a.  The language-arts curriculum there-\nfore seeks to ensure that students can \u201c[s]elect[] from a \nrange of diverse texts to understand and appreciate mul-\ntiple perspectives.\u201d  Pet.App.599a.  As part of this effort, \nMCPS had previously made similar efforts to update the \nlanguage-arts curriculum with books featuring people \nand characters from different backgrounds.  Some exam-\nples include the March trilogy, which recounts the life of \ncivil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, and The Leav-\ners, which tells the story of an Asian-American immi-\ngrant family.  Pet.App.602a-603a.  In a similar vein, \nMCPS updated its social-studies curriculum with new in-\nstructional materials about local history.  Id. \nThe storybooks were approved for instructional use \npursuant to MCPS\u2019s written policy for selecting new in-\nstructional materials.  Pet.App.600a-601a, 603a-604a; \nCAJA513-514.  Under that policy, MCPS seeks to ensure \nthat the materials are \u201cage/grade appropriate[],\u201d \u201csup-\nport \u2026 student achievement toward MCPS curriculum \nstandards,\u201d and are \u201crelevant to and reflective of the \n\n5 \n \n \nmulticultural \nsociety \nand \nglobal \ncommunity.\u201d  \nPet.App.600a-601a; CAJA513-514, 521, 523.  Before se-\nlecting the storybooks, a committee of six reading and \ninstructional specialists participated in multiple rounds \nof evaluations to determine that each book would be a \nsuitable addition to the curriculum based on these crite-\nria.  CAJA513; see also Pet.App.603a-604a.  This process \nincluded an opportunity for parents to review the story-\nbooks and provide feedback, and all such feedback was \nconsidered before any storybook was approved.  \nPet.App.601a. \nThe storybooks tell everyday tales of characters \nwho experience adventure, confront new emotions, and \nstruggle to make themselves heard.  They include a \nstory about a family attending a Pride parade, a niece \nmeeting her uncle\u2019s husband-to-be, a prince falling in \nlove with a knight as they battle a dragon in a mythical \nkingdom, a girl feeling nervous about giving a valentine \nto her crush, and a transgender boy sharing his gender \nidentity with his family.  Pet.App.254a-271a, 279a-306a, \n390a-428a, 429a-447a, 448a-482a.  These are archetypal \nstories that touch on the same themes introduced to chil-\ndren in such classic books as Snow White, Cinderella, \nand Peter Pan.  In addition to helping students explore \nsentence structure, word choice, and style, the story-\nbooks support students\u2019 ability to empathize, connect, \nand collaborate with peers and encourage respect for all.  \nPet.App.603a, 605a-606a.   \nThe storybooks are, moreover, \u201ca small subset of \nmany books used in the MCPS [language-arts] curricu-\nlum.\u201d  Pet.App.132a.  Teachers are expected to fold them \ninto the curriculum as they would any other book:  They \ncan put the storybooks on shelves for students to find \nthemselves, recommend a particular storybook to a \n\n6 \n \n \nstudent who would enjoy it, read the storybooks aloud, \nor offer them as an option for reading groups.  \nPet.App.604a-605a. \n \nMCPS made clear to teachers that using the story-\nbooks involves no instruction on sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  Pet.App.605a, 636a-641a.  Some chal-\nlenged books simply include LGBTQ characters.  Others \nhighlight the importance of kindness to others.  None \ntakes a side in any religious or scientific debate sur-\nrounding gender or sexuality.  And teachers are not per-\nmitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular \nviewpoint.  Indeed, a guidance document for teachers \nstates that \u201c[n]o child who does not agree with or under-\nstand another student\u2019s gender, expression, or their sex-\nual identity is asked to change how they feel about it.\u201d  \nPet.App.640a.  MCPS prepared teachers to use the sto-\nrybooks by offering a professional-development session \nas well as sample responses to potential student ques-\ntions; these optional \u201csuggested responses focus[ed] on \ntolerance, empathy, and respect for different views.\u201d  \nPet.App.89a-95a.1  \nB. The No-Opt-Out Policy \nAfter the storybooks were introduced, some parents \nrequested that their children be excused from class \nwhen \nthe \nstorybooks \nwere \nread \nor \ndiscussed.  \nPet.App.606a.  Some opt-out requests were religion-\nbased and others were not.  Some parents opposed a \n \n1 Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, this guidance did not \u201cdi-\nrect[] teachers to frame disagreement with\u201d the storybooks \u201cas \n\u2018hurtful.\u2019\u201d  Pet.13.  The guidance instead suggested that if a student \ndescribes another person as \u201cweird,\u201d a teacher could respond, \u201cThat \ncomment is hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk about \npeople\u2019s identities.\u201d  Pet.App.94a. \n\n7 \n \n \nperceived effort to teach students about sex or gender \nidentity or believed the materials were age-inappropri-\nate.  Id. \nAt first, teachers and principals sought to accommo-\ndate these requests by excusing students when the \nbooks were read in class.  Pet.App.606a-607a.  The grow-\ning number of opt-out requests, however, gave rise to \nthree related concerns: high student absenteeism, the in-\nfeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms \nand schools, and the risk of exposing students who be-\nlieve the storybooks represent them and their families \nto social stigma and isolation.  Pet.App.96a-99a, 606a-\n608a.  These consequences would defeat MCPS\u2019s \u201cefforts \nto ensure a classroom environment that is safe and con-\nducive to learning for all students\u201d and risk putting \nMCPS out of compliance with nondiscrimination laws.  \nPet.App.98a-99a, 607a-608a. \nMCPS therefore determined that permitting opt-\nouts was not feasible or consistent with its curricular \ngoals.  Pet.App.608a.  It announced in March 2023 that \nno opt-outs from instruction using the storybooks would \nbe granted \u201cfor any reason.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \nIn May 2023, petitioners sued the Montgomery \nCounty Board of Education, its members, and the Super-\nintendent of Schools, asserting violations of the federal \nFree Exercise, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses \nand a violation of Maryland law.  Pet.App.107a-108a.  Pe-\ntitioners then moved for a preliminary injunction on \ntheir free-exercise and due-process claims, seeking to \nrequire MCPS to provide them notice and opt-out oppor-\ntunities whenever the storybooks are read or discussed.  \nPet.App.76a-77a.  In July 2023, petitioners amended \ntheir \ncomplaint \nto \nadd \nplaintiff \nKids \nFirst.  \n\n8 \n \n \nPet.App.162a-163a.  The district court denied the pre-\nliminary-injunction motion in August 2023.  The Fourth \nCircuit denied petitioners\u2019 motion for an injunction \npending appeal and, in May 2024, affirmed the denial of \na preliminary injunction. \nIn an opinion written by Judge Agee and joined by \nJudge Benjamin, the court of appeals agreed with the \ndistrict court that petitioners had not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits given their \u201cbroad \nclaims, the very high burden required to obtain a prelim-\ninary injunction, and the scant record before [it].\u201d  \nPet.App.9a.  The court recognized that the Free Exer-\ncise Clause protects against government action that di-\nrectly or indirectly compels religious belief or threatens \nthe ability to act in accordance with one\u2019s faith.  \nPet.App.24a-25a.  The court thus explained that, \u201cto \nshow a cognizable burden\u201d on religious exercise, peti-\ntioners were required to \u201cshow that the absence of an \nopt-out opportunity coerces them or their children to be-\nlieve or act contrary to their religious views.\u201d  \nPet.App.31a.  That coercion could be \u201cdirect or indirect.\u201d  \nId. \nApplying those familiar principles, the Fourth Cir-\ncuit rejected petitioners\u2019 theory that \u201cthe lack of an \nacross-the-board notice and an opt-out opportunity re-\nlating to the Storybooks, in and of itself, coerces them \nand their children in the free exercise of their religion.\u201d  \nPet.App.33a-34a.  The court held that petitioners put \nforward \u201cno evidence\u201d that the no-opt-out policy com-\npelled them or their children \u201cto change their religious \nbeliefs or conduct, either at school or elsewhere\u201d or \u201caf-\nfect[ed] \nwhat \nthey \nteach \ntheir \nown \nchildren.\u201d  \nPet.App.34a.  Nor did the record suggest that petition-\ners or their children were coerced to \u201caffirm views \n\n9 \n \n \ncontrary to their own,\u201d \u201cdisavow views \u2026 that their re-\nligion espouses,\u201d or \u201cotherwise affirmatively act in vio-\nlation of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit \nagreed with the consistent understanding of the courts \nof appeals that \u201csimply hearing about other views does \nnot necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differ-\nently than one\u2019s religious faith requires.\u201d  Pet.App.35a-\n36a.  It rejected petitioners\u2019 principal argument that \n\u201ccompelled presence or exposure\u201d to different views in a \npublic school \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a \nburden\u201d on religious exercise, holding that this view \u201cre-\nlies on too expansive a reading\u201d of Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972).  Pet.App.36a-37a; see also \nPet.App.38a-40a.  And it held that the no-opt-out policy \ndid not deny petitioners access to a public benefit based \non religion because MCPS remained \u201copen to all stu-\ndents\u201d regardless of their faith; petitioners were not \npressured to \u201cdisavow their religious views before they \n[could] \nsend \ntheir \nchildren \nto \npublic \nschool.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  That petitioners might face \u201cadditional \ncosts\u201d if they chose to exercise their religion by \u201cpursu-\ning an alternative to public schooling\u201d did not establish a \nfree-exercise burden.  Pet.App.47a-48a.  Finally, the \nFourth Circuit rejected the \u201chybrid\u201d due-process claim \nPetitioners had asserted (but do not raise here).  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  Without deciding \u201cthe validity of the \nhybrid-rights approach,\u201d the court determined that a hy-\nbrid claim could not succeed on the merits where the \nstandalone free-exercise claim was likely to fail.  Id.   \nJudge Quattlebaum dissented.  The dissent did not \ndispute the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cmere exposure to \nobjectionable viewpoints\u201d fails to establish a free-exer-\ncise burden.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Indeed, the dissent \n\n10 \n \n \nrecognized that \u201cit is generally true that the First \nAmendment provides no guarantee that students will \nnot be exposed to views they (or their parents) disagree \nwith in public schools.\u201d  Pet.App.64a.  The dissent also \nconceded that \u201cuse of the books in instructing K-5 chil-\ndren does not coerce or require the parents or their chil-\ndren to change their religious views,\u201d and that petition-\ners remained free to \u201cteach their religious beliefs at \nhome.\u201d  Pet.App.63a.  In the dissent\u2019s view, though, the \nno-opt-out policy nonetheless likely burdened petition-\ners\u2019 religious exercise by requiring them to choose be-\ntween \u201cadher[ing] to their faith or receiv[ing] a free pub-\nlic education for their children.\u201d  Pet.App.62a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT \nNo court of appeals has ever endorsed petitioners\u2019 \ntheory here: that parents who choose to send their chil-\ndren to public school necessarily suffer a burden on their \nexercise of religion by virtue of their children\u2019s \u201cex-\npos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d in public school, Pet.11; see \nalso Pet.9, 10, 29.  Petitioners incorrectly assert that the \ncircuits are \u201csplit 5-1\u201d over whether such exposure\u2014ab-\nsent any \u201ccompulsion\u201d or \u201ccoercion\u201d of religious belief or \nconduct\u2014\u201cis sufficient to create a free-exercise burden.\u201d  \nPet.19.  In reality, the score is 6-0 against petitioners. \nA.

The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s straightforward application of this \nCourt\u2019s precedent to the limited evidence petitioners of-\nfered in support of their motion for preliminary relief \ndoes not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention.   \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), Mary-\nland\u2019s largest school district, serves more than 160,000 \nstudents.  Every day, these students read and discuss \nbooks as part of MCPS\u2019s language-arts curriculum.  \nThese reading materials have not always reflected the \ndiversity of the community MCPS serves.  In recent \nyears, the school district has worked to change that by \nincorporating new books to better represent MCPS stu-\ndents and families.  These books now include characters, \nfamilies, and historical figures from a range of cultural, \nracial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.  \nAs part of this effort, at the start of the 2022-2023 \nschool year, MCPS approved a handful of storybooks \nfeaturing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer \ncharacters for use in the language-arts curriculum, \nalongside the many books already in the curriculum that \nfeature heterosexual characters in traditional gender \nroles.  Like all other books in the language-arts curricu-\nlum, these storybooks impart critical reading skills \nthrough engaging, age-appropriate stories.  MCPS ad-\nheres to a careful, public, participatory selection process \nto ensure those criteria are met.  That process, followed \nhere, welcomes and incorporates parent feedback.   \n\n2 \n \n \nFrom the beginning, MCPS\u2019s goal has been for stu-\ndents to engage with these storybooks as they engage \nwith any other book in the language-arts curriculum.  \nThe storybooks are not used in any lessons related to \ngender and sexuality.  Nor is any student asked or ex-\npected to change his or her views about his or her own, \nor any other student\u2019s, sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  Instead, the books are made available for indi-\nvidual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educa-\ntional activities designed to foster and enhance literacy \nskills. \nPetitioners include three sets of parents who asked \nMCPS to notify them, excuse their children from class, \nand arrange alternate lessons whenever the storybooks \nare read.  After MCPS announced in March 2023 that it \nwould not permit any parents to opt their children out of \nlanguage-arts instruction involving the storybooks, for \nany reason, petitioners sued.  Petitioners also moved for \na preliminary injunction requiring notice and opt outs, \narguing that their children\u2019s \u201cexposure\u201d to the story-\nbooks \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a burden\u201d \non their right to freely exercise their religion.  \nPet.App.37a.  The district court denied the motion. \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\ntioners were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nbased on the \u201cscant record\u201d before it.  Pet.App.9a.  Ap-\nplying a standard drawn straight from this Court\u2019s free-\nexercise precedent, and in line with every relevant court \nof appeals decision, the Fourth Circuit explained that a \ncognizable burden on religious exercise requires coer-\ncion, direct or indirect, to believe or act contrary to one\u2019s \nreligious views.  Petitioners failed to demonstrate a like-\nlihood of success on their free-exercise claim, as they of-\nfered \u201cno evidence\u201d of such coercion.  Pet.App.34a.  \n\n3 \n \n \nSpecifically, petitioners advanced no evidence that \nMCPS pressured their children to affirm or disavow par-\nticular views, compelled their children to act in violation \nof their religious beliefs, influenced what petitioners \ncould teach their own children, or denied petitioners ac-\ncess to public benefits.  Pet.App.34a-48a.  This \u201cabsence \nof proof\u201d doomed petitioners\u2019 request for emergency re-\nlief.   \nThere is no circuit split on this issue.  Every single \ncourt of appeals that has considered the question has \nheld that mere exposure to controversial issues in a pub-\nlic-school curriculum does not burden the free religious \nexercise of parents or students.  Nor is there any conflict \nbetween the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding and this Court\u2019s \nfree-exercise decisions, which the Fourth Circuit faith-\nfully applied and petitioners misconstrue.  And there is \nno pressing question raised by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s con-\nclusion in a preliminary-injunction posture that petition-\ners\u2019 free-exercise claim was not likely to succeed absent \nany evidence of coercion that could constitute a burden \non religious free exercise.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, parents who can demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess in showing religious coercion in a public school \nthat does not survive scrutiny may obtain preliminary \nrelief.  Parents who cannot make that showing, but who \ncan plausibly allege facts suggesting such unjustified co-\nercion, will proceed to discovery.  And if the facts bear \nout those allegations, they will obtain permanent relief.  \nThere is no pressing question here. \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n4 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Storybooks \nAt the start of the 2022-2023 school year, MCPS in-\ntroduced into its pre-K through twelfth grade language-\narts curriculum several storybooks featuring lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer characters.  \nPet.App.603a-604a.  The storybooks were added as part \nof MCPS\u2019s commitment to \u201cprovid[ing] a culturally re-\nsponsive \u2026 curriculum that promotes equity, respect, \nand civility.\u201d  Pet.App.589a.  MCPS believes that \u201c[r]ep-\nresentation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a \nfully inclusive environment for all students\u201d and \u201csup-\nports a student\u2019s ability to empathize, connect, and col-\nlaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for \nall.\u201d  Pet.App.603a.  The language-arts curriculum there-\nfore seeks to ensure that students can \u201c[s]elect[] from a \nrange of diverse texts to understand and appreciate mul-\ntiple perspectives.\u201d  Pet.App.599a.  As part of this effort, \nMCPS had previously made similar efforts to update the \nlanguage-arts curriculum with books featuring people \nand characters from different backgrounds.  Some exam-\nples include the March trilogy, which recounts the life of \ncivil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, and The Leav-\ners, which tells the story of an Asian-American immi-\ngrant family.  Pet.App.602a-603a.  In a similar vein, \nMCPS updated its social-studies curriculum with new in-\nstructional materials about local history.  Id. \nThe storybooks were approved for instructional use \npursuant to MCPS\u2019s written policy for selecting new in-\nstructional materials.  Pet.App.600a-601a, 603a-604a; \nCAJA513-514.  Under that policy, MCPS seeks to ensure \nthat the materials are \u201cage/grade appropriate[],\u201d \u201csup-\nport \u2026 student achievement toward MCPS curriculum \nstandards,\u201d and are \u201crelevant to and reflective of the \n\n5 \n \n \nmulticultural \nsociety \nand \nglobal \ncommunity.\u201d  \nPet.App.600a-601a; CAJA513-514, 521, 523.  Before se-\nlecting the storybooks, a committee of six reading and \ninstructional specialists participated in multiple rounds \nof evaluations to determine that each book would be a \nsuitable addition to the curriculum based on these crite-\nria.  CAJA513; see also Pet.App.603a-604a.  This process \nincluded an opportunity for parents to review the story-\nbooks and provide feedback, and all such feedback was \nconsidered before any storybook was approved.  \nPet.App.601a. \nThe storybooks tell everyday tales of characters \nwho experience adventure, confront new emotions, and \nstruggle to make themselves heard.  They include a \nstory about a family attending a Pride parade, a niece \nmeeting her uncle\u2019s husband-to-be, a prince falling in \nlove with a knight as they battle a dragon in a mythical \nkingdom, a girl feeling nervous about giving a valentine \nto her crush, and a transgender boy sharing his gender \nidentity with his family.  Pet.App.254a-271a, 279a-306a, \n390a-428a, 429a-447a, 448a-482a.  These are archetypal \nstories that touch on the same themes introduced to chil-\ndren in such classic books as Snow White, Cinderella, \nand Peter Pan.  In addition to helping students explore \nsentence structure, word choice, and style, the story-\nbooks support students\u2019 ability to empathize, connect, \nand collaborate with peers and encourage respect for all.  \nPet.App.603a, 605a-606a.   \nThe storybooks are, moreover, \u201ca small subset of \nmany books used in the MCPS [language-arts] curricu-\nlum.\u201d  Pet.App.132a.  Teachers are expected to fold them \ninto the curriculum as they would any other book:  They \ncan put the storybooks on shelves for students to find \nthemselves, recommend a particular storybook to a \n\n6 \n \n \nstudent who would enjoy it, read the storybooks aloud, \nor offer them as an option for reading groups.  \nPet.App.604a-605a. \n \nMCPS made clear to teachers that using the story-\nbooks involves no instruction on sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  Pet.App.605a, 636a-641a.  Some chal-\nlenged books simply include LGBTQ characters.  Others \nhighlight the importance of kindness to others.  None \ntakes a side in any religious or scientific debate sur-\nrounding gender or sexuality.  And teachers are not per-\nmitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular \nviewpoint.  Indeed, a guidance document for teachers \nstates that \u201c[n]o child who does not agree with or under-\nstand another student\u2019s gender, expression, or their sex-\nual identity is asked to change how they feel about it.\u201d  \nPet.App.640a.  MCPS prepared teachers to use the sto-\nrybooks by offering a professional-development session \nas well as sample responses to potential student ques-\ntions; these optional \u201csuggested responses focus[ed] on \ntolerance, empathy, and respect for different views.\u201d  \nPet.App.89a-95a.1  \nB. The No-Opt-Out Policy \nAfter the storybooks were introduced, some parents \nrequested that their children be excused from class \nwhen \nthe \nstorybooks \nwere \nread \nor \ndiscussed.  \nPet.App.606a.  Some opt-out requests were religion-\nbased and others were not.  Some parents opposed a \n \n1 Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, this guidance did not \u201cdi-\nrect[] teachers to frame disagreement with\u201d the storybooks \u201cas \n\u2018hurtful.\u2019\u201d  Pet.13.  The guidance instead suggested that if a student \ndescribes another person as \u201cweird,\u201d a teacher could respond, \u201cThat \ncomment is hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk about \npeople\u2019s identities.\u201d  Pet.App.94a. \n\n7 \n \n \nperceived effort to teach students about sex or gender \nidentity or believed the materials were age-inappropri-\nate.  Id. \nAt first, teachers and principals sought to accommo-\ndate these requests by excusing students when the \nbooks were read in class.  Pet.App.606a-607a.  The grow-\ning number of opt-out requests, however, gave rise to \nthree related concerns: high student absenteeism, the in-\nfeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms \nand schools, and the risk of exposing students who be-\nlieve the storybooks represent them and their families \nto social stigma and isolation.  Pet.App.96a-99a, 606a-\n608a.  These consequences would defeat MCPS\u2019s \u201cefforts \nto ensure a classroom environment that is safe and con-\nducive to learning for all students\u201d and risk putting \nMCPS out of compliance with nondiscrimination laws.  \nPet.App.98a-99a, 607a-608a. \nMCPS therefore determined that permitting opt-\nouts was not feasible or consistent with its curricular \ngoals.  Pet.App.608a.  It announced in March 2023 that \nno opt-outs from instruction using the storybooks would \nbe granted \u201cfor any reason.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \nIn May 2023, petitioners sued the Montgomery \nCounty Board of Education, its members, and the Super-\nintendent of Schools, asserting violations of the federal \nFree Exercise, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses \nand a violation of Maryland law.  Pet.App.107a-108a.  Pe-\ntitioners then moved for a preliminary injunction on \ntheir free-exercise and due-process claims, seeking to \nrequire MCPS to provide them notice and opt-out oppor-\ntunities whenever the storybooks are read or discussed.  \nPet.App.76a-77a.  In July 2023, petitioners amended \ntheir \ncomplaint \nto \nadd \nplaintiff \nKids \nFirst.  \n\n8 \n \n \nPet.App.162a-163a.  The district court denied the pre-\nliminary-injunction motion in August 2023.  The Fourth \nCircuit denied petitioners\u2019 motion for an injunction \npending appeal and, in May 2024, affirmed the denial of \na preliminary injunction. \nIn an opinion written by Judge Agee and joined by \nJudge Benjamin, the court of appeals agreed with the \ndistrict court that petitioners had not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits given their \u201cbroad \nclaims, the very high burden required to obtain a prelim-\ninary injunction, and the scant record before [it].\u201d  \nPet.App.9a.  The court recognized that the Free Exer-\ncise Clause protects against government action that di-\nrectly or indirectly compels religious belief or threatens \nthe ability to act in accordance with one\u2019s faith.  \nPet.App.24a-25a.  The court thus explained that, \u201cto \nshow a cognizable burden\u201d on religious exercise, peti-\ntioners were required to \u201cshow that the absence of an \nopt-out opportunity coerces them or their children to be-\nlieve or act contrary to their religious views.\u201d  \nPet.App.31a.  That coercion could be \u201cdirect or indirect.\u201d  \nId. \nApplying those familiar principles, the Fourth Cir-\ncuit rejected petitioners\u2019 theory that \u201cthe lack of an \nacross-the-board notice and an opt-out opportunity re-\nlating to the Storybooks, in and of itself, coerces them \nand their children in the free exercise of their religion.\u201d  \nPet.App.33a-34a.  The court held that petitioners put \nforward \u201cno evidence\u201d that the no-opt-out policy com-\npelled them or their children \u201cto change their religious \nbeliefs or conduct, either at school or elsewhere\u201d or \u201caf-\nfect[ed] \nwhat \nthey \nteach \ntheir \nown \nchildren.\u201d  \nPet.App.34a.  Nor did the record suggest that petition-\ners or their children were coerced to \u201caffirm views \n\n9 \n \n \ncontrary to their own,\u201d \u201cdisavow views \u2026 that their re-\nligion espouses,\u201d or \u201cotherwise affirmatively act in vio-\nlation of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit \nagreed with the consistent understanding of the courts \nof appeals that \u201csimply hearing about other views does \nnot necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differ-\nently than one\u2019s religious faith requires.\u201d  Pet.App.35a-\n36a.  It rejected petitioners\u2019 principal argument that \n\u201ccompelled presence or exposure\u201d to different views in a \npublic school \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a \nburden\u201d on religious exercise, holding that this view \u201cre-\nlies on too expansive a reading\u201d of Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972).  Pet.App.36a-37a; see also \nPet.App.38a-40a.  And it held that the no-opt-out policy \ndid not deny petitioners access to a public benefit based \non religion because MCPS remained \u201copen to all stu-\ndents\u201d regardless of their faith; petitioners were not \npressured to \u201cdisavow their religious views before they \n[could] \nsend \ntheir \nchildren \nto \npublic \nschool.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  That petitioners might face \u201cadditional \ncosts\u201d if they chose to exercise their religion by \u201cpursu-\ning an alternative to public schooling\u201d did not establish a \nfree-exercise burden.  Pet.App.47a-48a.  Finally, the \nFourth Circuit rejected the \u201chybrid\u201d due-process claim \nPetitioners had asserted (but do not raise here).  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  Without deciding \u201cthe validity of the \nhybrid-rights approach,\u201d the court determined that a hy-\nbrid claim could not succeed on the merits where the \nstandalone free-exercise claim was likely to fail.  Id.   \nJudge Quattlebaum dissented.  The dissent did not \ndispute the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cmere exposure to \nobjectionable viewpoints\u201d fails to establish a free-exer-\ncise burden.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Indeed, the dissent \n\n10 \n \n \nrecognized that \u201cit is generally true that the First \nAmendment provides no guarantee that students will \nnot be exposed to views they (or their parents) disagree \nwith in public schools.\u201d  Pet.App.64a.  The dissent also \nconceded that \u201cuse of the books in instructing K-5 chil-\ndren does not coerce or require the parents or their chil-\ndren to change their religious views,\u201d and that petition-\ners remained free to \u201cteach their religious beliefs at \nhome.\u201d  Pet.App.63a.  In the dissent\u2019s view, though, the \nno-opt-out policy nonetheless likely burdened petition-\ners\u2019 religious exercise by requiring them to choose be-\ntween \u201cadher[ing] to their faith or receiv[ing] a free pub-\nlic education for their children.\u201d  Pet.App.62a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT \nNo court of appeals has ever endorsed petitioners\u2019 \ntheory here: that parents who choose to send their chil-\ndren to public school necessarily suffer a burden on their \nexercise of religion by virtue of their children\u2019s \u201cex-\npos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d in public school, Pet.11; see \nalso Pet.9, 10, 29.  Petitioners incorrectly assert that the \ncircuits are \u201csplit 5-1\u201d over whether such exposure\u2014ab-\nsent any \u201ccompulsion\u201d or \u201ccoercion\u201d of religious belief or \nconduct\u2014\u201cis sufficient to create a free-exercise burden.\u201d  \nPet.19.  In reality, the score is 6-0 against petitioners. \nA. Courts Of Appeals Have Uniformly Held That \nMere Exposure In Public School To Ideas That \nContradict Religious Beliefs Does Not Burden \nParents\u2019 Religious Exercise \nThe decision below agreed with every other court of \nappeals to have considered whether students\u2019 exposure \nin public school to material that contradicts their par-\nents\u2019 religious faith in and of itself constitutes a \n\n11 \n \n \ncognizable burden on the parents\u2019 free-exercise rights.  \nAs both the district court and the court of appeals ob-\nserved, \u201c[e]very court that has addressed th[is] ques-\ntion\u201d has answered it in the negative.  Pet.App.117a; see \nalso Pet.App.39a. \nSpecifically, as petitioners correctly acknowledge, \nthe decision below accords with: \n\u2022 the First Circuit\u2019s holding in Parker v. Hurley, \n514 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2008), that parents \u201cwhose \nreligious beliefs [were] offended by gay marriage \nand homosexuality\u201d were not entitled under the \nFree Exercise Clause to \u201cprior notice by the \nschool and the opportunity to exempt their young \nchildren from exposure to books they f[ou]nd re-\nligiously repugnant,\u201d id. at 90; \n\u2022 the Second Circuit\u2019s holding in Leebaert v. Har-\nrington, 332 F.3d 134 (2d Cir. 2003), that a father \nwas not entitled under the Free Exercise Clause \n\u201cto excuse his minor son\u201d from a public school\u2019s \n\u201cmandatory health curriculum [that] conflict[ed] \nwith his [religious] belief\u201d regarding \u201csex before \nmarriage,\u201d id. at 135, 144-145; \n\u2022 the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding in Mozert v. Hawkins \nCounty Board of Education, 827 F.2d 1058 (6th \nCir. 1987), that \u201crequiring mere exposure [of pub-\nlic-school students] to materials that offend [their \nparents\u2019] religious beliefs\u201d does not subject the \n\u201cobjecting parents\u201d to \u201can unconstitutional bur-\nden on the free exercise of religion,\u201d id. at 1059, \n1067; and \n\u2022 the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding in Fleischfresser v. \nDirectors of School District 200, 15 F.3d 680 (7th \nCir. 1994), rejecting a claim by \u201c[p]arents of \n\n12 \n \n \n[public-school] students enrolled in grades Kin-\ndergarten through Five\u201d that \u201cthe use of [a par-\nticular book] series interfere[d] with the free ex-\nercise of their religion,\u201d id. at 683, 689. \nPetitioners omit yet another case that follows the \nconsensus view: the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Califor-\nnia Parents for the Equalization of Educational Mate-\nrials v. Torlakson, 973 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir. 2020), which \nrejected a free-exercise claim by parents challenging a \n\u201cpublic school curriculum\u201d that \u201ccontain[ed] material \u2026 \noffensive to their religious beliefs,\u201d id. at 1013, 1020.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 omission is surprising given that this case was \ncited by both the district court (Pet.App.118a) and the \ncourt of appeals (Pet.App.35a).  Indeed, petitioners \nthemselves cite the case in another portion of their peti-\ntion, where they characterize it as \u201cdecided under the \nDue Process Clause,\u201d Pet.31 n.13, and fail to mention \nthat it also rejected the same \u201cFree Exercise clause ar-\ngument\u201d that petitioners pursue here, Torlakson, 973 \nF.3d at 1020. \nThis consistency across circuits follows ineluctably \nfrom this Court\u2019s precedent that \u201cit is necessary in a free \nexercise case \u2026 to show the coercive effect of the\u201d chal-\nlenged action, School District of Abington Township v. \nSchempp, 374 U.S. 203, 223 (1963); accord Carson v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767, 778 (2022).2 \n \n2 The uniform court-of-appeals decisions on this issue are also \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s recognition that exposure to new and \neven \u201coffensive content\u201d in school \u201cis part of learning how to live in \na pluralistic society, a society which insists upon open discourse to-\nwards the end of a tolerant citizenry.\u201d  Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. \n577, 590 (1992). \n\n13 \n \n \nAs elaborated further below, see infra Part II, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 position\u2014that their free-exercise claim may \nsucceed based purely on their children\u2019s exposure to re-\nligiously offensive material, \u201cabsent a \u2018coercive effect\u2019\u201d \non \u201creligious beliefs or conduct,\u201d Pet.22\u2014would be con-\ntrary to this Court\u2019s precedent and thus finds no support \nin any circuit. \nB. No Decision Conflicts With The Decision Be-\nlow \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet.22), the \nEighth Circuit has never split from the judicial consen-\nsus just discussed.   \nPetitioners seize on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s statement \nin Florey v. Sioux Falls School District 49-5, 619 F.2d \n1311 (8th Cir. 1980), that \u201cforcing any person to partici-\npate in an activity that offends his religious or nonreli-\ngious beliefs will generally contravene the Free Exer-\ncise Clause,\u201d id. at 1318-1319.  That statement is both \nperfectly consistent with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in \nthis case (and with the decisions of every other court of \nappeals to have addressed the issue), and in any event \nwas dicta because, as petitioners acknowledge, \u201c[t]he \ncourt found no [free-exercise] violation in that case,\u201d \nPet.22.   \nIn Florey, a Sioux Falls public school in 1977 held a \nChristmas assembly in which kindergartners were re-\nquired to \u201cmemorize[] and then perform[] for parents a \nChristmas assembly which was replete with religious \ncontent,\u201d including a call and response that required stu-\ndents to answer \u201cJesus\u201d when asked \u201cOf whom did \nheav\u2019nly angels sing, And news about His birthday \nbring?\u201d  Florey v. Sioux Falls Sch. Dist. 49-5, 464 F. \nSupp. 911, 912 (D.S.D. 1979).  A parent complained, and \nthe district developed a set of rules outlining the \n\n14 \n \n \npermissible role religious materials might play in public \nschool.  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1313.  The rules provided, \namong other things, that \u201cstudents and staff members \nshould be excused from participating in practices which \nare contrary to their religious beliefs unless there are \nclear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.\u201d  \nId. at 1319 (emphasis added).  Parents challenged those \nrules as violating the Establishment Clause, and then \nadded a Free Exercise Clause argument on appeal \u201cas \nan afterthought.\u201d  Id. at 1318 n.7. \nThe Eighth Circuit rejected the free-exercise chal-\nlenge.  It recognized that \u201cpublic schools are not re-\nquired to delete from the curriculum all materials that \nmay offend any religious sensibility,\u201d and that \u201cinevita-\nble conflicts with the individual beliefs of some students \nor their parents \u2026 do not necessarily require the prohi-\nbition of a school activity.\u201d  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1318.  To \nbe sure, the court also recognized that \u201cforcing any per-\nson to participate in an activity that offends his religious \nor nonreligious beliefs will generally contravene the \nFree Exercise Clause,\u201d id. at 1318-1319.  But that sen-\ntence does not support Petitioners.  Everyone agrees \nthat a public school generally cannot force a student to \nactively \u201cparticipate in an activity\u201d that violates the stu-\ndent\u2019s religion.  Florey, id. at 1318.  For example, a pub-\nlic school cannot require students to recognize \u201cJesus\u201d \nas \u201cChrist, the blessed Saviour[],\u201d Florey, 464 F. Supp. \nat 912, as in the Christmas assemblies that led to the pol-\nicies challenged in Florey.  Nor can public schools re-\nquire a student who keeps kosher to eat pork or a Jeho-\nvah\u2019s Witness to participate in a birthday party.  As the \nFourth Circuit put it, public schools cannot require stu-\ndents to \u201caffirmatively act in violation of their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d  Pet.App.34a.  But this case does not involve any \nsuch requirement.  It involves only \u201ccurriculum \u2026 \n\n15 \n \n \nmaterials that may offend [Petitioner\u2019s] religious sensi-\nbility.\u201d  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1318.3 \nIn any event, as noted, the single sentence on which \npetitioners seize was plainly dicta.  The court found no \nfree-exercise violation, and the language petitioners cite \nwas not \u201cnecessary to that result.\u201d  Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996).  And because \n\u201c[d]ictum settles nothing, even in the court that utters \nit,\u201d Jama v. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 543 \nU.S. 335, 352 n.12 (2005), \u201cdicta does not a circuit split \nmake,\u201d Pacific Coast Supply, LLC v. NLRB, 801 F.3d \n321, 334 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nEven if certain dicta could signal a circuit divide \nwarranting this Court\u2019s attention, the dicta Petitioners \nidentify certainly does not.  Recognizing that \u201c[a] pas-\nsage unnecessary to the outcome may not be fully con-\nsidered,\u201d Torres v. Madrid, 592 U.S. 306, 329 (2021) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting), this Court declines to assign \n\u201clegal weight\u201d to \u201cdicta\u201d on an issue that \u201cwas not \u2026 \nfully argued,\u201d Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 \nU.S. 519, 548 (2013).  As the Eighth Circuit explained, \n \n3 Moreover, Florey held that the plaintiffs\u2019 free-exercise claim \ncould not succeed in light of the defendant school\u2019s policy that \u201cstu-\ndents and staff members should be excused from participating in \npractices which are contrary to their religious beliefs unless there \nare clear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.\u201d  Flo-\nrey, 619 F.2d at 1317 n.6 (quoting school\u2019s policy) (emphasis added).  \nThat is the situation here:  As noted, see supra p.7, MCPS accom-\nmodated opt-out requests until it was prevented from doing so by \noverriding concerns regarding \u201cabsenteeism,\u201d \u201cthe infeasibility of \nmanaging numerous opt-outs,\u201d and the \u201crisk [of] putting MCPS out \nof compliance with state and federal nondiscrimination laws,\u201d \nPet.App.98a.  Any fact-bound dispute about the weight of those in-\nterests in this narrow circumstance\u2014particularly in this prelimi-\nnary posture\u2014does not merit review by this Court. \n\n16 \n \n \n\u201c[t]he free-exercise issue\u201d in Florey was \u201cadded to the \nappellants\u2019 appeal brief as an afterthought\u201d and \u201c[n]ei-\nther the complaint, the trial briefs, nor the district court \nopinion mention[ed] the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d  Florey, \n619 F.2d at 1318 n.7.  The Eighth Circuit\u2019s dicta on that \nsubject thus was not fully considered and cannot bear \nthe \u201clegal weight\u201d petitioners assign it, Kirtsaeng, 568 \nU.S. at 548. \nAlthough not the basis of their claimed circuit-split, \npetitioners identify three other decisions they suggest \nare in tension with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision here.  \nSee Pet.22-23 n.11.  None is.  Petitioners first point to \nC.N. v. Ridgewood Board of Education, 430 F.3d 159 (3d \nCir. 2005), in which the Third Circuit declined to adopt a \n\u201ccategorical approach\u201d under which parents lack any \ndue-process rights regarding their children\u2019s experience \nin public school, id. at 185 n.26.  Even putting aside that \nthat case concerned due process rather than free exer-\ncise, the Third Circuit\u2019s rejection of such a \u201ccategorical \napproach,\u201d id., is consistent with the judicial consensus \nthat mere exposure in public school to ideas that contra-\ndict religious beliefs does not burden the religious exer-\ncise of objecting parents.  Indeed, the Third Circuit re-\njected the parents\u2019 exposure-based due-process claim in \nC.N., on the ground that \u201c[a] parent whose \u2026 child is ex-\nposed to sensitive topics\u201d in school \u201cremains free to dis-\ncuss th[o]se matters and to place them in the family\u2019s \nmoral or religious context, or to supplement the infor-\nmation with more appropriate materials.\u201d  Id. at 185.  \nThe same is true here. \nNext, petitioners point to Tatel v. Mt. Lebanon \nSchool District, 675 F. Supp. 3d 551 (W.D. Pa. 2023).  \nThat district-court decision only illustrates what is miss-\ning here: any allegation (much less evidence) of coercive \n\n17 \n \n \nconduct that could amount to a cognizable burden on re-\nligious exercise.  Tatel involved allegations that a \nteacher \u201cpursued her own non-curricular agenda \u2026 to \ninculcate in the first-grade children in her class the \nteacher\u2019s beliefs about a child\u2019s gender identity,\u201d includ-\ning by \u201ctarget[ing] one child for repeated approaches \nabout gender dysphoria despite, or because of, the par-\nents\u2019 beliefs,\u201d all while \u201ctelling the children to keep the \nteacher\u2019s discussions about gender topics secret from \ntheir parents.\u201d  Id. at 558-559, 566.  There are no such \nallegations of non-curricular instruction, targeting, or \nsecrecy here, and there is certainly no evidence of such \ncoercion in this preliminary-injunction posture.  As the \ndistrict court in this case concluded, \u201c[t]he students\u201d in \nTatel \u201cwere not just exposed to ideas\u201d; \u201c[t]hey were be-\ning pressured by their teacher to change their religious \nviews on gender identity.\u201d  Pet.App.131a.  Tatel, in other \nwords, rested on coercive elements absent here. \nFinally, petitioners assert that before the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in Mozert (which, as noted, petitioners \nacknowledge accords with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision \nhere), \u201cthe Sixth Circuit originally landed on [the other] \nside of the split\u201d with its decision in Spence v. Bailey, 465 \nF.2d 797 (6th Cir. 1972).  Pet.23 n.11.  That too is wrong.  \nThe Sixth Circuit explained in Mozert why its decision \nthere (and thus the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision here) is dis-\ntinguishable from Spence: namely, the student in Spence \n\u201cwas being compelled to engage in military training, not \nbeing exposed to the fact that others do so,\u201d Mozert, 827 \nF.2d at 1065 (emphasis in original).  Spence is thus per-\nfectly consistent with rejecting Petitioners\u2019 theory here \n\n18 \n \n \nthat mere \u201cexpos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d is enough to \nsupport a free-exercise claim, Pet.11.4 \nII. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT CORRECTLY APPLIED THIS \nCOURT\u2019S FREE-EXERCISE CASES \nThis Court\u2019s free-exercise precedents set out a clear \nrule that the Fourth Circuit correctly applied in this \ncase: the government burdens religious exercise only \nwhen it coerces someone, either directly or indirectly, to \nbelieve or act contrary to their religious views.  Petition-\ners misrepresent both law and facts in an effort to fabri-\ncate a conflict. \nA. The Fourth Circuit Correctly Applied Yoder \nAs the Fourth Circuit explained, petitioners\u2019 argu-\nment that the no-opt-out policy burdens their religious \nexercise \u201crelies on too expansive a reading of Yoder.\u201d  \nPet.App.37a.  In Yoder, Amish parents developed an ev-\nidentiary record establishing that \u201cattendance at high \nschool, public or private, was contrary to the Amish re-\nligion and way of life\u201d and would \u201cresult in the destruc-\ntion\u201d of their religious community.  406 U.S. at 209, 212.  \nSurveying that record, this Court held that a compulsory \nschool attendance law violated the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise rights because it \u201caffirmatively compel[ed] \n \n4 Not even the dissent below agreed with Petitioners\u2019 claim \nthat \u201cmere exposure to objectionable viewpoints\u201d is enough to es-\ntablish a burden on free exercise.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Instead, it at-\ntempts (unpersuasively) to distinguish Mozert and other cases on \nfactual grounds.  See Pet.App.65a n.2.  Nor is Petitioners\u2019 position \nsupported by recent district-court dicta stating that students may \n\u201copt out of educational content that violates sincerely held religious \nor conscience-based beliefs,\u201d Nelson v. Nazareth Independent \nSchool District, 2024 WL 4116495, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 6, 2024) \n(cited at W.Va.Br.8-9), as that dicta rested in substantial part on the \nTexas Constitution and Texas statutes not implicated here, see id. \n\n19 \n \n \nthem \u2026 to perform acts undeniably at odds with funda-\nmental tenets of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id. at 218.  The \nFourth Circuit faithfully applied that standard here and \nfound that on the preliminary-injunction record, peti-\ntioners had not established that their children were af-\nfirmatively compelled to perform acts contrary to their \nreligious beliefs.  Pet.App.39a; see also Pet.App.34a-35a.  \nFor its part, the dissent showed no interest in petition-\ners\u2019 argument that Yoder commanded a different result.  \nPet.App.71a n.5. \nPetitioners\u2019 and their amici\u2019s counterarguments fail \nfor several related reasons. \nFirst, the Fourth Circuit in no way \u201cdenigrat[ed]\u201d \nYoder (Pet.24), but instead faithfully applied its clear \nholding.  In Yoder, the parents came forward with evi-\ndence showing that they believed the mere act of \u201csend-\ning their children to high school\u201d would \u201cendanger their \nown salvation and that of their children.\u201d  406 U.S. at \n209.  The challenged law therefore would force them to \neither \u201cabandon belief and be assimilated into society\u201d \nor \u201cmigrate to some other and more tolerant region.\u201d  Id. \nat 218.  Compulsory attendance thus \u201cwould gravely en-\ndanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents\u2019 \nreligious beliefs.\u201d  Id. at 219.  That is coercion\u2014coercion \nthe Fourth Circuit did not find in the preliminary-injunc-\ntion record below.  As the district court explained, the \nquestion is \u201cwhether the facts involve government coer-\ncion to violate religious beliefs.  In Yoder, they did; here, \nthey do not.\u201d  Pet.App.142a n.13.  That preliminary, fact-\nbound decision does not merit this Court\u2019s review. \nSecond, the coercion standard that Yoder prescribes \nand the Fourth Circuit applied does not risk \u201cdenomina-\ntional favoritism.\u201d  Pet.25.  That is because, as the dis-\ntrict court recognized, the required analysis \u201cdoes not \n\n20 \n \n \nturn on religious doctrine.\u201d  Pet.App.142a n.13.  It turns \non the presence or absence of coercion to change or act \ncontrary to one\u2019s religious beliefs.   \nThe Fourth Circuit is not alone in holding that the \nparents in Yoder could demonstrate coercion not found \nhere.  As the First Circuit explained, compulsory school-\ning in Yoder threatened to destroy a \u201cdistinct commu-\nnity and life style\u201d that was \u201cfundamentally incompati-\nble with any schooling system.\u201d  Parker, 514 F.3d at 100.  \nIn the words of the Sixth Circuit, \u201cYoder was decided in \nlarge part on the impossibility of reconciling the goals of \npublic education with the religious requirement of the \nAmish that their children be prepared for life in a sepa-\nrated community.\u201d  Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1067; accord \nLeebaert, 332 F.3d at 144.     \nThe substance of a plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs may be \nrelevant to whether there is coercion, and, as this Court \nrecognized in Yoder, a showing that attending public \nschool at all amounts to coercion is \u201cone that probably \nfew other religious groups or sects could make.\u201d  406 \nU.S. at 235-236.  But the legal test is the same across the \nboard.  The concern about \u201cdenominational favoritism\u201d \nraised in Carson, 596 U.S. at 786-787, which petitioners \nquote out of context, was with state laws that denied \npublic funds to religious schools based on a subjective \nassessment of whether those funds were used to pro-\nmote religion.  No such concern is present here. \nThird, petitioners are wrong to suggest (Pet.26-27) \nthat the Fourth Circuit required them to await actual in-\njury before seeking relief\u2014an argument that in any \nevent has nothing to do with Yoder.  The Fourth Circuit \nproperly applied this Court\u2019s preliminary-injunction \nstandard by requiring petitioners to establish a likeli-\nhood of success on the merits.  Pet.App.21a-22a.  To \n\n21 \n \n \nobtain injunctive relief, petitioners had to show that \nthey were likely to experience \u201cdirect or indirect coer-\ncion arising out of the exposure\u201d of their children to the \nstorybooks.  Pet.App.41a.  They did not do so because \nthey failed to introduce any evidence that coercion \nwould necessarily result from exposure to the story-\nbooks or that storybooks were actually being used in \nclassrooms in a way that was likely to coerce.  \nPet.App.33-35a, 41a-43a.  Petitioners seem to suggest \nthat the Fourth Circuit should have lowered the \u201cex-\nceedingly high burden\u201d faced by litigants seeking a pre-\nliminary injunction.  Pet.App.21a.  But as this Court has \nemphasized, \u201c[a] preliminary injunction is an extraordi-\nnary remedy never awarded as of right.\u201d  Winter v. Nat-\nural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  That \ndemanding standard applies to free-exercise claims.  See, \ne.g., Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S.Ct. 17, 18 (2021); see also \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 \nU.S. 14, 16 (2020). \nFourth, petitioners confusingly rely on a footnote in \nYoder that quoted a letter from Thomas Jefferson, alt-\nhough neither that section of Yoder nor the referenced \nwritings of Thomas Jefferson have anything to do with \nwhether a given policy burdens free exercise.  Pet.24.  In \nrejecting the argument that \u201ca brief additional period of \nformal education is imperative to enable the Amish to \nparticipate effectively and intelligently in our demo-\ncratic process,\u201d the Court referenced in passing Thomas \nJefferson\u2019s professed \u201creluctan[ce] to directly force in-\nstruction of children \u2018in opposition to the will of the par-\nent,\u2019\u201d  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 226 n.14 (quoting 17 Writings \nof Thomas Jefferson 417, 423-424 (Mem. ed. 1904)), at \nleast \u201cbeyond a basic education,\u201d id. at 225.  This has \nnothing to do with whether mere exposure to language-\narts storybooks, in a public school to which parents have \n\n22 \n \n \nchosen to send their child, is inherently coercive in vio-\nlation of the Free Exercise Clause.   \nFifth, petitioners\u2019 and amici\u2019s claim of a \u201cnational \nconsensus that [sex education] instruction should not \nproceed absent parental permission,\u201d Pet.24-25; see also \nW.Va.Br.12-18, is likewise irrelevant.  Such a purported \ncontemporary policy consensus would have nothing to do \nwith whether a no-opt-out policy burdens religious exer-\ncise.  Nor did the Fourth Circuit apply any \u201cdeference\u201d \nto the Board\u2019s justifications for the challenged policy \n(Pet.25)\u2014the court never reached that issue because the \npreliminary-injunction record contained no evidence of \ncoercion, so there was no burden for the Board to jus-\ntify.5  Moreover, as the Fourth Circuit recognized, the \npreliminary-injunction record confirmed that the story-\nbooks were to be used only as part of the language-arts \ncurriculum and would not be part of \u201cinstruction on gen-\nder identity and sexual orientation.\u201d  Pet.App.11a.  That \nsame record established that the storybooks were not \napproved for the sex education curriculum, which has its \nown approval process for instructional materials, \nCAJA515, and from which students are permitted to opt \nout for any reason, Pet.App.608a. \nFinally, amici (and only amici) devote many pages to \nthe irrelevant argument that a \u201chybrid\u201d free-exercise \nand due-process claim could succeed against a policy that \nprohibited parents from opting their children out of sex \n \n5 Petitioners cite Ramirez v. Collier, 595 U.S. 411 (2022) \n(Pet.25), which held only that after a burden has been established, \nthe Court may consider whether a practice has been \u201chistorically \nand routinely allowed\u201d when determining whether a government \npolicy prohibiting the practice is narrowly tailored to a compelling \ninterest, id. at 428-429.  Again, because petitioners failed to estab-\nlish a burden, the courts below did not consider narrow tailoring. \n\n23 \n \n \neducation.  W.Va.Br.3-9.  Petitioners have not asked this \nCourt to consider their likelihood of success on a \u201chy-\nbrid\u201d claim, or urged this Court to reverse the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s holding on their due-process claim.  And as ex-\nplained above, there is no evidence in the record that \nMCPS has denied opt-outs from the sex education unit.  \nSupra p.22. \nB. The Fourth Circuit Correctly Applied This \nCourt\u2019s Remaining Free-Exercise Precedents \nPetitioners fare no better in their attempts to man-\nufacture a conflict between the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision \nand this Court\u2019s other free-exercise decisions.  Each case \npetitioners cite confirms that a free-exercise violation \nrequires evidence of direct or indirect coercion\u2014evi-\ndence absent from the limited preliminary-injunction \nrecord here. \n1. \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not conflict \nwith this Court\u2019s cases holding that States may not con-\ndition access to public benefits on requirements that pro-\nspective recipients change or forgo their religious beliefs \nor conduct.  See Pet.26-27, 28-29.  Again, each case on \nwhich petitioners rely had precisely what the Fourth \nCircuit found is missing from the preliminary-injunction \nrecord below: requirements or coercion to change or act \ncontrary to one\u2019s religious beliefs.   \nSherbert involved a Seventh-day Adventist denied \nunemployment benefits after she lost her job for being \nunwilling to work on Saturday.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 \nU.S. 398, 399 (1963).  The plaintiff was \u201cforce[d] to choose \nbetween following the precepts of her religion and for-\nfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of \nthe precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on \nthe other hand.\u201d  Id. at 404.  Likewise in Thomas, a Je-\nhovah\u2019s Witness was denied unemployment benefits \n\n24 \n \n \nafter he was transferred to a department manufacturing \n\u201cturrets for military tanks,\u201d which he refused to do be-\ncause his religious beliefs did not allow him to \u201cpartici-\npat[e] in the production of war materials.\u201d  Thomas v. \nReview Board, 450 U.S. 707, 709 (1981).  There, \u201cas in \nSherbert, the employee was put to a choice between fi-\ndelity to religious belief or cessation of work; the coer-\ncive impact on Thomas is indistinguishable from Sher-\nbert.\u201d  Id. at 717.  Finally, in Espinoza, the Montana Su-\npreme Court held that Montana\u2019s constitution precluded \ngiving religious private schools (and their students) oth-\nerwise generally available public subsidies for private \neducation.  Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 591 \nU.S. 464, 475 (2020).  This was \u201cstatus-based discrimina-\ntion\u201d and put schools and students to a similar choice as \nin Sherbert and Thomas:  to receive aid, \u201ca school must \ndivorce itself from any religious control or affiliation.\u201d  \nId. at 478. \nNot so here.  The evidence in the preliminary-in-\njunction record confirms that the no opt-out policy does \nnot require any students to shed their religious beliefs \nor forgo any religious conduct at all, much less as a con-\ndition of receiving a public education.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  \nMCPS remains \u201copen to all students\u201d without regard to \ntheir \u201creligious affiliation or beliefs.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  \nAgain, mere exposure to ideas that parents find offen-\nsive is not coercion that implicates the Free Exercise \nClause; there is no equivalent here to requiring a Sev-\nenth-Day Adventist to work on Saturday, a Jehovah\u2019s \nWitness to build weapons of war, or religious private \nschools to become secular.  The no-opt out policy does \nnot require children to take any position on the religious \npermissibility or impermissibility of any person\u2019s iden-\ntity, nor does it require students to engage in any \n\n25 \n \n \nconduct to which petitioners object on religious grounds.  \nIt just requires students to be in class when books are \nread.   \n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance on Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. \n693 (1986), fails for similar reasons.  Pet.27-28.  In \nBowen, eight members of the Court held that the Free \nExercise Clause did not preclude government agencies \nfrom using a Social Security number to identify the peti-\ntioner\u2019s daughter, as the \u201cFree Exercise Clause simply \ncannot be understood to require the Government to con-\nduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with \nthe religious beliefs of particular citizens.\u201d  476 U.S. at \n699.  The Fourth Circuit cited this portion of Bowen, and \nnumerous other courts of appeals that reached the same \nconclusion, as support for its holding that exposure to \n\u201ccontent deemed to be religiously objectionable \u2026 will \nnot ordinarily pose a burden on an individual\u2019s free ex-\nercise of religion because it lacks the requisite compul-\nsion or pressure on an individual\u2019s religious beliefs or \nconduct.\u201d  Pet.App.39a-40a.  To accept the contrary \nproposition would require public schools to tailor their \ncurricula to the religious objections of parents\u2014here, by \ncreating separate lesson plans for students whose par-\nents opt them out of the storybooks.  See Pet.App.186a-\n187a \nPetitioners argue (Pet.28) that this case presents a \nquestion more akin to the separate claim in Bowen that \n\u201cbeing forced to cooperate actively with the Government \nby themselves providing their daughter\u2019s social security \nnumber on benefit applications\u201d violated the plaintiffs\u2019 \nfree exercise rights.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 714 (Blackmun, \nJ., concurring in part).  That is wrong twice over.  First, \nthe preliminary-injunction record in this case had no ev-\nidence of any compulsion to do or believe anything \n\n26 \n \n \ncontrary to petitioners\u2019 religious beliefs, so there is no \nanalog in this case to the requirement that the plaintiffs \nin Bowen affirmatively \u201cprovide a Social Security num-\nber to the Government before receiving benefits.\u201d  476 \nU.S. at 727 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part).  Second, petitioners are incorrect that only \nan effort to eliminate the storybooks from the classroom \naltogether would intrude on the government\u2019s \u201cinternal \naffairs.\u201d  Pet.28.  Telling public school teachers what to \nteach and not to teach\u2014whether to the entire class or to \na particular student\u2014is \u201cto require the Government it-\nself to behave\u201d in certain ways.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699.  \nBy shepherding students out of the room whenever ob-\njectionable material is read, the government refashions \nthe curriculum for those students.  The \u201cFree Exercise \nClause affords an individual protection from certain \nforms of governmental compulsion; it does not afford an \nindividual a right to dictate the conduct of the Govern-\nment\u2019s internal procedures.\u201d  Id. at 700 (emphasis \nadded). \n3. Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not \nconflict with Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 597 \nU.S. 507 (2022).  Petitioners suggest that, under Ken-\nnedy, the Fourth Circuit should have held that the no-\nopt-out policy was not neutral or generally applicable.  \nPet.29-30.  As an initial matter, that question is not even \nbefore the Court.  The Fourth Circuit did not reach this \nquestion because it concluded correctly that Petitioners \nwere required to show \u201ca burden\u201d on religious exercise \nbefore the court could consider whether the no-opt-out \npolicy was neutral or generally applicable.  Pet.App.30a.  \nA plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfailure to show that a challenged govern-\nment action constitutes any burden on his religious con-\nduct makes it unnecessary to proceed further in the anal-\nysis by determining or applying the appropriate level of \n\n27 \n \n \nscrutiny.\u201d  Pet.App.29a-30a n.12.  Petitioners do not ex-\nplain how the Fourth Circuit erred by not conducting a \ntiers-of-scrutiny analysis after concluding that Plaintiffs \nhad not established any burden on their free exercise.  \nMoreover, the evidence in the preliminary-injunc-\ntion record does not support petitioners\u2019 allegations that \nthe no-opt-out policy is not neutral and generally appli-\ncable.  In any event, that sort of fact-bound disagree-\nment in a preliminary-injunction posture does not merit \nthis Court\u2019s review\u2014a point petitioners effectively con-\ncede by offering less than a page of vague discussion on \nthe topic. \nIII. THE DENIAL OF PRELIMINARY RELIEF ON A CLAIM UNI-\nVERSALLY REJECTED BY THE COURTS OF APPEALS PRE-\nSENTS NO PRESSING ISSUE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE \nThis petition does not raise a pressing issue of na-\ntional importance.  At the preliminary-injunction stage, \nthe Fourth Circuit applied this Court\u2019s free-exercise \nprecedents to reject a \u201cbroad claim,\u201d already rejected by \nevery other appeals court to consider it, on a necessarily \n\u201climited record.\u201d  Pet.App.34a.   \nA.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 claim (Pet.30), the deci-\nsion below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  As explained supra Part \nI, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding that \u201csimply hearing \nabout other views\u201d in public school does not necessarily \nburden religious exercise, Pet.App.35a, aligns with deci-\nsions of the First, Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Cir-\ncuits.  Nor does the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision threaten \nparents\u2019 right to direct the religious upbringing of their \nchildren (Pet.31).  It instead recognizes that the way to \nensure that parents can \u201cavoid exposing their children \nto any religiously objectionable materials\u201d in a public-\n\n28 \n \n \nschool curriculum is to \u201cprotect[] their right to choose al-\nternatives such as a private school.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.   \nNor is there \u201cenduring disarray\u201d (Pet.34) over \nwhether mere exposure to conflicting views as part of a \npublic-school curriculum burdens religious exercise.  \nThe two law review articles petitioners cite for that \nproposition instead analyze what might be required to \nshow a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise if the \nCourt were to overrule Employment Division v. Smith, \n494 U.S. 872 (1990)\u2014relief petitioners do not seek here.  \nSee Girgis, Defining \u201cSubstantial Burdens\u201d on Religion \nand Other Liberties, 108 Va. L. Rev. 1759, 1761 (2022); \nHelfand, Substantial Burdens as Civil Penalties, 108 \nIowa L. Rev. 2189, 2193 (2023).6  \nB. Petitioners and amici urge this Court to inter-\nvene on the false pretense that parents have been denied \na right to opt their children out of sex education.  See \nPet.32; W.Va.Br.2-3, 12-18.  But as explained above, the \nrecord before the Fourth Circuit made clear that the sto-\nrybooks are part of language-arts instruction, not sex \neducation.  CAJA515; Pet.App.608a; supra p.22-23.  The \nstorybooks are no more sex education than stories like \nCinderella and Snow White, which feature romance be-\ntween men and women.  And the record contains no evi-\ndence that petitioners, or any other parents, have been \n \n6 To the extent Petitioners suggest (Pet.34) that this petition \nraises the same questions under the Free Exercise Clause as \nApache Stronghold v. United States, 101 F.4th 1036 (9th Cir. 2024), \nthey are wrong.  As the petition in Apache Stronghold makes clear, \nthat case involves a completely different type of burden, asking \nwhether plaintiffs opposing the destruction of a religious site on fed-\neral land establish a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise.  See \nPet. 32, Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 24-291 (Sept. 11, \n2024). \n\n29 \n \n \ndenied the opportunity to opt their children out of sex \neducation, a separate unit of instruction with specialized \nprocedures for selecting and using instructional materi-\nals.  See supra p.22-23.  Certainly, the Fourth Circuit did \nnot hold that parents should be denied \u201cthe primary \nrole\u201d in sex education instruction (Pet.32).  Petitioners \ntry to twist a statement by counsel for MCPS into a re-\nquest for unthinking judicial deference (Pet. 32).  But \ntheir selective quotation elides the point counsel was \nmaking: that MCPS does not make these curricular \nchoices behind closed doors; it instead evaluates the ap-\npropriateness of instructional materials through an \n\u201copen and participatory\u201d process that welcomes parent \ninvolvement.  Pet.App.643a; see also supra p.5.    \nC.   Despite petitioners\u2019 repeated claims (Pet.32-34), \nJustice Alito\u2019s concurrence in Morse v. Frederick, 551 \nU.S. 393 (2007), does not suggest that this petition pre-\nsents a pressing question.  Justice Alito argued that pub-\nlic schools could not cite broad \u201ceducational mission[s]\u201d \nas \u201ca license to suppress speech on political and social is-\nsues based on disagreement with the viewpoint ex-\npressed.\u201d  Id. at 423 (Alito, J., concurring).  This petition, \nby contrast, concerns no claim that petitioners or their \nchildren are being censored\u2014and the record contains no \nevidence to suggest they are.   \nNor did Justice Alito argue that families are in dan-\nger of suffering free-exercise burdens due to the costs of \nattending private religious school.  His Morse concur-\nrence instead observed that public schools do not \u201cstand \nin the shoes of the student\u2019s parents,\u201d and thus cannot \nclaim total power to control student speech merely be-\ncause parents, who may have limited choices, decide to \nsend their children there.  551 U.S. at 424.  No court has \never accepted the argument that petitioners seek to \n\n30 \n \n \ndraw from Morse (Pet.30-31): that the cost of religious \nschooling means that public schools must adapt their \ncurricula to the religious goals of every parent to avoid \nburdening religious exercise.  As the Fourth Circuit ex-\nplained, this Court has in fact recognized that \u201cgovern-\nment coercion does not exist merely because an individ-\nual may incur increased costs as a consequence of decid-\ning to exercise their religious faith in a particular way.\u201d  \nPet.App.47a (citing Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, \n605-606 (1961)).  Amici cite Holt v. Hobbs, a case concern-\ning the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Per-\nsons Act, for the proposition that a burden exists despite \n\u201cthe availability of alternative[s]\u201d to preferred religious \npractice (W.Va.Br.14), conveniently eliding this Court\u2019s \nexplanation that, in free-exercise cases, such \u201calterna-\ntive[s]\u201d\u2014like religious schooling here\u2014are a \u201crelevant \nconsideration,\u201d 574 U.S. 352, 361 (2015).   \nD.   Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not \nrequire free-exercise plaintiffs to make a greater show-\ning when challenging decisions of public schools than \nwhen challenging the decisions of other government \nagencies (Pet.31-32).  Here, the Fourth Circuit applied \nthe same test that controls outside the context of public \neducation: whether government action directly or indi-\nrectly coerces the plaintiff to believe or act contrary to \nhis religious views.  Pet.App.31a; see Sherbert, 374 U.S. \nat 404; Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718-719.  Despite petitioners\u2019 \nrepeated cries of unwarranted \u201cdeference to public \nschool policymaking\u201d (Pet.32; Pet.33-34), they identify \nno such deference in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n31 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nBRUCE M.

          "task_beliefs": "My attempt to balance my predictive model has failed, leaving my central uncertainty not only unresolved but more pronounced. The lack of countervailing evidence reinforces the potential strength of the petitioners' case, but this conclusion is drawn from a vacuum, making it highly tenuous.\n\n*   **Stable Core Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The legal framework arguing for a constitutionally mandated \"reasonable accommodation\" for religious practice, derived from *Wisconsin v. Yoder* and powerfully articulated in Nathan Lewin's amicus brief, remains the central and most developed argument in my model.\n*   **Stable Precedent Linkage (The *Groff* Connection):** The argument that the Court's recent unanimous decision in *Groff v. DeJoy* should elevate the standard for accommodation in the Free Exercise context (mirroring its effect in the Title VII statutory context) continues to be a primary signal favoring the petitioners.\n*   **Stable Precedent Valuations:** My assessment of *Yoder* as the foundational precedent and *Employment Division v. Smith* as the key obstacle that the accommodation theory is designed to circumvent remains unchanged.\n*   **Reinforced Belief (Critical Model Imbalance):** My previous belief that my model was lopsided is now strongly reinforced by empirical failure. I actively sought out the respondents' counter-arguments and found nothing. This deepens the model's imbalance, as the only sophisticated legal theory I have analyzed in detail is the one favoring the petitioners.\n*   **New Belief (The Significance of a Null Result):** The failure of my targeted search for amicus briefs supporting the respondents is a new, albeit ambiguous, piece of evidence. This \"null result\" could mean several things:\n    1.  **Timing:** The deadline for respondent-side amicus briefs may not have passed.\n    2.  **Search Failure:** The search tool or my query may have been inadequate.\n    3.  **Weak Signal of Support:** It is a low-confidence possibility that there is simply less organized amicus support for the school board's position, which could be a weak indicator of how the case is perceived by interested legal groups.\n*   **Unchanged Primary Uncertainty:** My primary uncertainty remains precisely what it was: how will the respondents rebut the \"constitutional accommodation\" framework? The failure of this search makes resolving this gap even more critical. My prediction remains biased toward the petitioners, but my confidence in this prediction is low due to the acknowledged one-sidedness of my evidence base.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation was a crucial lesson in the practical application of my design principles, revealing that a sound strategy can be undermined by tool limitations or flawed execution. It has forced me to refine my approach to information gathering, making it more resilient and critical.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** This principle remains highly effective. My previous reflective pause correctly identified the point of maximum uncertainty (the respondents' arguments), and this observation confirms that targeting this gap was the correct next step, even if the action itself failed to yield the desired information.\n*   **New Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** This principle remains a core goal, but this observation adds a crucial corollary: *execution is non-trivial*. Simply deciding to seek out opposing views is not enough. I have learned that I may need more sophisticated, iterative, or varied search strategies to successfully locate countervailing arguments, especially if they are less prominent.\n*   **New Heuristic (The Strategic Value of Reflective Pauses):** This heuristic is again validated. The cycle of `act -> observe -> reflect` is essential. This failed observation now provides the necessary input for my next reflective step: to diagnose the failure and plan a more robust subsequent action.\n*   **New Belief (Tool Limitation & Skepticism):** I have learned a critical lesson about my tools. The `CLOSED_SEARCH` on docket files is not infallible. It can return irrelevant results for a specific query. I must now treat its outputs, especially null or surprising ones, with skepticism. A failed search does not prove the absence of information. This necessitates developing contingency plans, such as:\n    1.  Refining search queries.\n    2.  Switching to a different search type (e.g., a broad `WEB_SEARCH`).\n    3.  Considering external context (like court filing deadlines) that might explain the lack of results.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (The Strategic Function of Amicus Briefs):** This remains a core belief. The failure to find respondent amicus briefs makes me even more eager to locate them, as they are the most likely source for the sophisticated counter-arguments I need to balance my model.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Tracking Doctrinal \"Bleed-Over\"):** This remains a key technique. The *Groff* connection is a prime example, and I am still actively looking for the respondents' argument against it.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (\"Insider History\" Principle):** This remains valuable. The Lewin brief is a perfect example. I am now more motivated to find a brief from an \"insider\" on the education law or civil rights side to provide the counter-narrative.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Refined Information-Gathering Sequence):** The sequence of **Petition -> Opposition -> Merits & Amicus Briefs** is still sound, but this observation highlights the potential difficulty of the final stage. I now understand that \"gathering amicus briefs\" must be a deliberate, potentially challenging process that ensures balance, rather than a simple one-shot collection."

My core uncertainty has shifted from 'What will the respondents argue?' to 'How will the Supreme Court resolve the direct clash between the petitioners' accommodation theory (Yoder/Groff) and the respondents' coercion threshold theory (Smith/Mozert)?' The respondents' most powerful argument, especially at the certiorari stage, is their assertion of a unanimous circuit consensus that 'mere exposure' does not constitute a Free Exercise burden. This directly attacks the prerequisite for a cert grant: a circuit split.\n\nMy task model (\u03b8) is now focused on this central conflict. To refine my prediction, I need to assess the strength of each side's claim regarding the state of the law in the circuits. The petitioners claim a split, while the respondents claim uniformity. The resolution of this factual dispute about the law is paramount.\n\nMy design model (D) has been updated with several powerful new heuristics, including the 'No Circuit Split Veto' and the 'Question Behind the Question'. My next action should serve to test and refine these heuristics. Specifically, I need to gather more information to evaluate the 'No Circuit Split' claim. While the main briefs introduce the cases, amicus briefs often provide deeper, more focused analysis on such specific points.\n\nTherefore, the next logical step is to examine the amicus briefs to see how they support or attack the 'no circuit split' narrative. I will start by looking for amicus briefs that support the respondents, as they are most likely to elaborate on the supposed circuit consensus. This will help me evaluate the credibility of the respondents' claim and understand the full weight of the argument against granting certiorari.",

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My model has undergone a fundamental transformation. The previous vacuum of information has been filled by the respondents' core legal arguments, moving my understanding from a dangerously lopsided state to a balanced, adversarial model. The central conflict of the case is now sharply defined.\n\n*   **Stable Core Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The petitioners' argument, rooted in *Wisconsin v. Yoder* and amplified by the logic of *Groff v. DeJoy*, remains a central pillar of my model. However, it is no longer unopposed. It represents the \"expansionist\" view of Free Exercise rights, arguing for a constitutionally mandated accommodation.\n*   **New Core Counter-Theory (The Coercion Threshold):** I have now integrated the respondents' primary counter-argument, which is both powerful and elegant in its simplicity. They contend that a Free Exercise claim is not triggered without **coercion**\u2014direct or indirect pressure to change one's beliefs or act contrary to one's faith. They argue that \"mere exposure\" to ideas in a public school curriculum does not meet this threshold. This creates the central doctrinal battleground: Is \"exposure\" for young children a form of coercion, or is a higher bar required?\n*   **Resolved Primary Uncertainty (The Respondents' Rebuttal):** My previous critical uncertainty is resolved. The respondents are not primarily arguing about the *scope* of accommodation (the *Groff* standard) but are attacking the premise of the petitioners' case. Their logic is: **No Coercion \u2192 No Burden \u2192 No Free Exercise Violation \u2192 No Accommodation Required.** This is a strategy to win the case before the logic of *Groff* can even be applied.\n*   **New Belief (The Battle over Precedent):** The conflict over precedent is now clear:\n    *   ***Yoder*:** The petitioners see *Yoder* as establishing a broad principle of parental rights in religious upbringing. The respondents frame *Yoder* as a narrow, *sui generis* holding, inapplicable to parents who have voluntarily chosen public education and whose entire way of life is not threatened.\n    *   ***Smith*:** The respondents' \"coercion\" framework aligns perfectly with the general rule of *Employment Division v. Smith*. They are arguing this is a standard *Smith* case involving a neutral policy of general applicability, and the petitioners have failed to show why an exception should be carved out.\n    *   **The Circuit Consensus:** The respondents' most potent argument, especially at the certiorari stage, is their claim of a **unanimous circuit court consensus** (citing *Mozert*, *Parker*, *Leebaert*, etc.) that \"mere exposure\" is not a constitutional burden. This directly refutes the petitioners' claim of a circuit split and frames the petitioners' request as a demand for radical doctrinal change, not a resolution of existing disagreement.\n*   **Revised Prediction & Confidence:** My confidence in a petitioner victory has decreased substantially. The respondents have a clear, precedentially-grounded argument that allows the Court to deny certiorari or rule in their favor without creating new law. The petitioners' path to victory requires the Court to explicitly expand the definition of a \"burden\" under the Free Exercise Clause, a much higher lift. While this Court has been sympathetic to religious liberty claims, the \"no circuit split\" argument presents a significant procedural and substantive hurdle. My model is now balanced, but the weight of existing precedent appears to favor the respondents' position.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, validating core strategies and generating new, more sophisticated heuristics for legal analysis. The successful acquisition of the opposing brief marks a critical milestone in my methodological development.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** This principle has been proven indispensable. The act of finding and integrating the \"Brief in Opposition\" transformed my model from a speculative, biased forecast into a robust analytical tool capable of weighing competing legal theories. This confirms that the reliability of a prediction is directly proportional to the balance of the evidence underpinning it.\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** The previous reflective step correctly identified the respondents' arguments as the point of maximum uncertainty and value of information. This successful search confirms that rigorously identifying and targeting the largest \"known unknown\" is the most efficient path to improving the model.\n*   **Refined Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** The sequence of **Petition -> Opposition -> Merits & Amicus Briefs** is now cemented as a highly effective protocol. The Brief in Opposition served as the single most important document for understanding the respondents' entire strategic posture, providing a complete framework before diving into the complexity of various amicus briefs.\n*   **New Heuristic (The \"Question Behind the Question\"):** I have learned to analyze how each party frames the \"Question Presented.\" The petitioners frame it as a question of religious accommodation. The respondents reframe it as a question about the definition of a \"burden,\" anchored by the claim of uniform circuit consensus. This reframing is a key strategic battle. The side that convinces the Court to adopt its framing of the issue often wins the case.\n*   **New Heuristic (The \"No Circuit Split\" Veto):** I now recognize the immense power of a credible \"no circuit split\" argument at the certiorari stage. It acts as a potential veto on the Court even taking a case. When one party claims a split and the other denies it, my analytical process must now include a sub-routine to evaluate the cases cited by both sides to determine which characterization is more accurate.\n*   **New Heuristic (Defensive Doctrinal Firewalls):** The respondents' strategy of avoiding a direct fight on the terrain of *Groff v. DeJoy* by focusing on the antecedent question of \"burden\" is a sophisticated defensive maneuver. I now understand that litigants may build \"firewalls\" to prevent a new or unfavorable legal doctrine from \"bleeding over\" into their case. Identifying these firewalls is key to understanding a party's theory of the case.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (The Strategic Function of Amicus Briefs):** My belief is stable but refined. While I previously sought amicus briefs for novel arguments, I now see the Brief in Opposition as the \"trunk\" of the tree and the forthcoming respondent-side amicus briefs as the \"branches.\" They will likely reinforce, elaborate on, and provide different perspectives on the core \"no coercion, no burden\" argument presented by WilmerHale, rather than introducing a completely different theory."

Yoder, No. \n70-110, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). In that era amicus briefs \nwere much rarer than they are today, and, as a former \nSupreme Court law clerk (for Justice John Harlan, \n1961-1962), I can attest that the Justices then \npersonally read nearly all briefs filed in the many \ncases then argued.  \nMy client in Yoder and in numerous later cases \nin which I participated as amicus was the National \nJewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs \n(\u201cCOLPA\u201d). That organization has spoken for much of \nthe American Orthodox Jewish community. It is still \nactive. I have not canvassed its members and asked \nthem to join one amicus brief supporting petitioners in \nthis litigation although I am confident that they would \nall support reversal of the decision below. Instead I \npresent these views as those of a lawyer who has spent \nmore than six decades litigating issues of religious \nfreedom in American courts, including several \nlawsuits that bear on this case. I believe that the same \nfundamental principles that I articulated more than \nhalf a century ago in support of the Amish vindicate \nthe legal position of the Maryland parents who are \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part.  \nNo person other than amicus curiae made any monetary \ncontribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of \nthis brief. \n\n2 \n \nplaintiffs in this case and who are petitioners in this \nCourt. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nMore than half a century has passed since I \nargued in my 1971 amicus brief that Amish parents \nwere constitutionally entitled to disobey Wisconsin\u2019s \ncompulsory school-attendance law because the First \nAmendment obliged Wisconsin\u2019s government to \nrespect the parents\u2019 religiously mandated objection to \ncompulsory high-school attendance. Page 3 of my \nYoder brief declared what I continue to believe today \n\u2013 that \u201cthe constitutional mandate [of the First \nAmendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause] requires the \nState to accommodate its generally applicable \neducational requirements to the legitimate and \nunharmful needs of the Amish religious community.\u201d \nThe \u201cconstitutional mandate\u201d that this Court \ninvoked to resolve the Yoder case in favor of the Amish \nparents controls this litigation. The State of Maryland \nmust accommodate its public-school instruction to \nthe legitimate and nonharmful beliefs of Maryland \nparents whose religious beliefs conflict with otherwise \nprescribed curricular teaching on sexual orientation \nand gender identity. In this case reasonable \naccommodation is simple and elementary. Maryland \nmust grant the relief sought by the parents \u2013notify \nparents when classroom instruction and instructional \nmaterial on sexual orientation and gender identity are \ncontemplated and excuse children (1) from attending \nclasses and (2) from reading texts that conflict with \nand undermine the parents\u2019 religious values. \n \n \n\n3 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE, AS ENFORCED IN \nYODER, REQUIRES GOVERNMENT TO MAKE \nREASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR SINCERE \nRELIGIOUS PRACTICE AND BELIEF \nA. Yoder Invokes \u201cAccommodation.\u201d  \nThe \nCourt\u2019s \nYoder \nopinion \ncontains \na \npainstaking \u201cbalancing process\u201d to determine whether \nWisconsin\u2019s law prescribing compulsory classroom \nattendance to age 16 \u201coverbalance[s] legitimate claims \nto the free exercise of religion.\u201d 406 U.S. at 214. The \nopinion \nconcludes \nafter \nmany \npages \nthat \n\u201caccommodating the religious objections of the \nAmish\u201d does not \u201cmaterially detract from the welfare \nof society.\u201d 406 U.S. at 234 (emphasis added). The \nconcept of reasonable \u201caccommodation\u201d to religious \nconvictions is not elaborated in the Court\u2019s extensive \nanalysis, but, once introduced, it reappears in later \nfootnotes. See Notes 22 and 23.  \nB. Congress \nPrescribes \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \n\u201cAccommodation\u201d became more prominent with \nthe amendment to Section 701(j) of the Civil Rights \nAct that was enacted in 1972. I personally drafted the \ntext of that statutory revision and recommended it to \nSenator Jennings Randolph for presentation on the \nfloor of the Senate. It resolved an uncertainty in \napplication of the 1964 law. Senator Randolph\u2019s \namendment \u2013explicitly intended by him to assist the \nSabbath-observance of Seventh-Day Baptists --\n\n4 \n \nreceived unanimous approval of the attending \nSenators. (118 Cong. Rec. 705-706, 731). It was then \nadopted by the conference committee that reconciled \nthe amendments approved by both Houses and was \nsigned into law. (118 Cong. Rec. 6643, 6646; 118 Cong. \nRec. 7572-7573).2 \nThe EEOC had initially permitted private \nemployers subject to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct to impose conditions of employment that were \nneutral on their face but had a religiously \ndiscriminatory impact. In 1967 the EEOC reversed \nthat policy, announcing with this change that \nemployers discriminated unlawfully if they penalized \nreligious-minority employees who were unavailable \nfor work on religious holidays but whose absence was \neasily remedied. (29 C.F.R. 1605.1 (1967)). The \nemployer of a conscientious Sunday-observer refused \nto accommodate his religious observance.  In response \nto his lawsuit the employer  challenged the 1967 \nEEOC regulation as violating the Establishment \nClause. This Court granted review of an appellate \nruling endorsing the employer\u2019s position, but the \nresult \u2013 notwithstanding amicus briefs from COLPA \nand the American Jewish Congress --was affirmance \nby an equally divided Court. Dewey v. Reynolds Metals \nCo., 402 U.S. 689 (1971). \n \n2 My detailed contemporaneous narrative of the full lobbying \neffort appears in Lewin, \u201cA Battle Won on Purim\u201d The Jewish \nPress, Vol. 23, No. 14, April 7, 1972, pp. 4, 18, 20-22, 26. See also \nthe amicus curiae briefs I drafted and filed for COLPA in Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch \nStores, Inc., No. 14-86, pp. 8-11, and in Parker Seal Co. v. \nCummins, No. 75-478, pp. 17-19. \n\n5 \n \nAn argument heading in the brief I filed for \nCOLPA in the Dewey case read: \u201cRespondent Failed \nTo Make a Reasonable Accommodation to Petitioner\u2019s \nReligious Scruples Against Personally Obtaining a \nReplacement for Sunday Work.\u201d \nMy 1972 amendment to the statutory language \nechoed the EEOC text whose validity had been left \nunresolved in Dewey. It defined \u201creligion\u201d for purpose \nof \nTitle \nVII\u2019s \nprohibition \nagainst \nreligious \ndiscrimination in employment to include \u201call aspects \nof religious observance and practice unless an \nemployer demonstrates that he is unable to \nreasonably \naccommodate \nto \nan \nemployee\u2019s \nor \nprospective \nemployee\u2019s \nreligious \nobservance \nor \npractice without undue hardship on the conduct of the \nemployer\u2019s business.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j). \nC. The \nAccommodation \nObligation \nIs \nImprovidently Limited. \n               In 1977 the Court heard an employer\u2019s \nconstitutional \nchallenge \nto \nthe \nstatutory \naccommodation obligation. Trans World Airlines, Inc. \nv. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977). I personally \nparticipated in the oral argument of the Hardison case \nas an amicus curiae. The majority opinion authored by \nJustice White in the Hardison case included a dictum \nthat effectively suppressed litigation by minority-\nreligion employees who had been denied the \nreasonable accommodation that the law was designed \nto accord. It impliedly instructed lower courts that an \naccommodation was required under the 1972 law only \nif such accommodation would have a de minimis effect \non the employer\u2019s business.  \n\n6 \n \nD. Unbounded \nAccommodation \nIs \nCondemned. \nEstate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 \n(1985), was a case in which I represented the \npetitioner and the late Senator Joseph Lieberman \n(then Attorney General of Connecticut) represented \nthe State of Connecticut as intervenor. Rejecting the \nexplicit representation made in his brief and oral \nargument by Connecticut\u2019s then-incumbent Attorney \nGeneral that the challenged state statute requiring \naccommodation to any employee \u201cwho states that a \nparticular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath\u201d \nrequired only reasonable accommodation, the Court \nheld \nthat \nits \nliteral \nlanguage \nviolated \nthe \nEstablishment Clause because it took no account of \nany \u201cburden or inconvenience this imposes on the \nemployer or fellow workers.\u201d 472 U.S. at 708-709. \nJustices O\u2019Connor and Marshall joined the Court\u2019s \nruling \nonly \nbecause \nthey \ndistinguished \nthe \nConnecticut law from the Title VII provision that had \nbeen amended in 1972. They said, \u201cTitle VII calls for \nreasonable rather than absolute accommodation.\u201d 472 \nU.S. at 712. \nE. The \nCourt \nMandates \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \nThe unanimous decision of this Court in Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023), struck the erroneous \nHardison language. It prescribed various reasonable \nstandards other than de minimis to define prescribed \naccommodation. \nNone \nrequires \naccommodation \nuniversally or forecloses it when the religious \n\n7 \n \nconviction can be reasonably accommodated with \nslight  inconvenience. \nII. \nREQUIRING MARYLAND TO MAKE A REASONABLE \nRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION IN THIS CASE DOES \nNOT VIOLATE EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH \nJustice Scalia\u2019s precipitous and unexpected \nopinion in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), asserted that the Court\u2019s Yoder decision \nresulted not only from the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise claim but also from their constitutional \nentitlement \u201cto direct the education of their children.\u201d \n494 U.S. at 881. That same right is, of course, \nimplicated in the present case. The petitioners\u2019 choice \nto have their children educated in Maryland\u2019s public \nschools did not erase their right, as parents, to play an \nimportant role in \u201cthe education of their children.\u201d \nOne can agree, as I do, with Justice Alito\u2019s \ncompelling opinion in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, \n593 U.S. 522, 544-627 (2021). Smith was wrongly \ndecided and has done substantial harm in more than \nthree decades.

Yoder, No. \n70-110, 406 U.S. 205 (1972). In that era amicus briefs \nwere much rarer than they are today, and, as a former \nSupreme Court law clerk (for Justice John Harlan, \n1961-1962), I can attest that the Justices then \npersonally read nearly all briefs filed in the many \ncases then argued.  \nMy client in Yoder and in numerous later cases \nin which I participated as amicus was the National \nJewish Commission on Law and Public Affairs \n(\u201cCOLPA\u201d). That organization has spoken for much of \nthe American Orthodox Jewish community. It is still \nactive. I have not canvassed its members and asked \nthem to join one amicus brief supporting petitioners in \nthis litigation although I am confident that they would \nall support reversal of the decision below. Instead I \npresent these views as those of a lawyer who has spent \nmore than six decades litigating issues of religious \nfreedom in American courts, including several \nlawsuits that bear on this case. I believe that the same \nfundamental principles that I articulated more than \nhalf a century ago in support of the Amish vindicate \nthe legal position of the Maryland parents who are \n \n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or in part.  \nNo person other than amicus curiae made any monetary \ncontribution intended to fund the preparation or submission of \nthis brief. \n\n2 \n \nplaintiffs in this case and who are petitioners in this \nCourt. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nMore than half a century has passed since I \nargued in my 1971 amicus brief that Amish parents \nwere constitutionally entitled to disobey Wisconsin\u2019s \ncompulsory school-attendance law because the First \nAmendment obliged Wisconsin\u2019s government to \nrespect the parents\u2019 religiously mandated objection to \ncompulsory high-school attendance. Page 3 of my \nYoder brief declared what I continue to believe today \n\u2013 that \u201cthe constitutional mandate [of the First \nAmendment\u2019s Free Exercise Clause] requires the \nState to accommodate its generally applicable \neducational requirements to the legitimate and \nunharmful needs of the Amish religious community.\u201d \nThe \u201cconstitutional mandate\u201d that this Court \ninvoked to resolve the Yoder case in favor of the Amish \nparents controls this litigation. The State of Maryland \nmust accommodate its public-school instruction to \nthe legitimate and nonharmful beliefs of Maryland \nparents whose religious beliefs conflict with otherwise \nprescribed curricular teaching on sexual orientation \nand gender identity. In this case reasonable \naccommodation is simple and elementary. Maryland \nmust grant the relief sought by the parents \u2013notify \nparents when classroom instruction and instructional \nmaterial on sexual orientation and gender identity are \ncontemplated and excuse children (1) from attending \nclasses and (2) from reading texts that conflict with \nand undermine the parents\u2019 religious values. \n \n \n\n3 \n \nARGUMENT \nI. \nTHE FREE EXERCISE CLAUSE, AS ENFORCED IN \nYODER, REQUIRES GOVERNMENT TO MAKE \nREASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR SINCERE \nRELIGIOUS PRACTICE AND BELIEF \nA. Yoder Invokes \u201cAccommodation.\u201d  \nThe \nCourt\u2019s \nYoder \nopinion \ncontains \na \npainstaking \u201cbalancing process\u201d to determine whether \nWisconsin\u2019s law prescribing compulsory classroom \nattendance to age 16 \u201coverbalance[s] legitimate claims \nto the free exercise of religion.\u201d 406 U.S. at 214. The \nopinion \nconcludes \nafter \nmany \npages \nthat \n\u201caccommodating the religious objections of the \nAmish\u201d does not \u201cmaterially detract from the welfare \nof society.\u201d 406 U.S. at 234 (emphasis added). The \nconcept of reasonable \u201caccommodation\u201d to religious \nconvictions is not elaborated in the Court\u2019s extensive \nanalysis, but, once introduced, it reappears in later \nfootnotes. See Notes 22 and 23.  \nB. Congress \nPrescribes \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \n\u201cAccommodation\u201d became more prominent with \nthe amendment to Section 701(j) of the Civil Rights \nAct that was enacted in 1972. I personally drafted the \ntext of that statutory revision and recommended it to \nSenator Jennings Randolph for presentation on the \nfloor of the Senate. It resolved an uncertainty in \napplication of the 1964 law. Senator Randolph\u2019s \namendment \u2013explicitly intended by him to assist the \nSabbath-observance of Seventh-Day Baptists --\n\n4 \n \nreceived unanimous approval of the attending \nSenators. (118 Cong. Rec. 705-706, 731). It was then \nadopted by the conference committee that reconciled \nthe amendments approved by both Houses and was \nsigned into law. (118 Cong. Rec. 6643, 6646; 118 Cong. \nRec. 7572-7573).2 \nThe EEOC had initially permitted private \nemployers subject to Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights \nAct to impose conditions of employment that were \nneutral on their face but had a religiously \ndiscriminatory impact. In 1967 the EEOC reversed \nthat policy, announcing with this change that \nemployers discriminated unlawfully if they penalized \nreligious-minority employees who were unavailable \nfor work on religious holidays but whose absence was \neasily remedied. (29 C.F.R. 1605.1 (1967)). The \nemployer of a conscientious Sunday-observer refused \nto accommodate his religious observance.  In response \nto his lawsuit the employer  challenged the 1967 \nEEOC regulation as violating the Establishment \nClause. This Court granted review of an appellate \nruling endorsing the employer\u2019s position, but the \nresult \u2013 notwithstanding amicus briefs from COLPA \nand the American Jewish Congress --was affirmance \nby an equally divided Court. Dewey v. Reynolds Metals \nCo., 402 U.S. 689 (1971). \n \n2 My detailed contemporaneous narrative of the full lobbying \neffort appears in Lewin, \u201cA Battle Won on Purim\u201d The Jewish \nPress, Vol. 23, No. 14, April 7, 1972, pp. 4, 18, 20-22, 26. See also \nthe amicus curiae briefs I drafted and filed for COLPA in Equal \nEmployment Opportunity Commission v. Abercrombie & Fitch \nStores, Inc., No. 14-86, pp. 8-11, and in Parker Seal Co. v. \nCummins, No. 75-478, pp. 17-19. \n\n5 \n \nAn argument heading in the brief I filed for \nCOLPA in the Dewey case read: \u201cRespondent Failed \nTo Make a Reasonable Accommodation to Petitioner\u2019s \nReligious Scruples Against Personally Obtaining a \nReplacement for Sunday Work.\u201d \nMy 1972 amendment to the statutory language \nechoed the EEOC text whose validity had been left \nunresolved in Dewey. It defined \u201creligion\u201d for purpose \nof \nTitle \nVII\u2019s \nprohibition \nagainst \nreligious \ndiscrimination in employment to include \u201call aspects \nof religious observance and practice unless an \nemployer demonstrates that he is unable to \nreasonably \naccommodate \nto \nan \nemployee\u2019s \nor \nprospective \nemployee\u2019s \nreligious \nobservance \nor \npractice without undue hardship on the conduct of the \nemployer\u2019s business.\u201d 42 U.S.C. \u00a7 2000e(j). \nC. The \nAccommodation \nObligation \nIs \nImprovidently Limited. \n               In 1977 the Court heard an employer\u2019s \nconstitutional \nchallenge \nto \nthe \nstatutory \naccommodation obligation. Trans World Airlines, Inc. \nv. Hardison, 432 U.S. 63 (1977). I personally \nparticipated in the oral argument of the Hardison case \nas an amicus curiae. The majority opinion authored by \nJustice White in the Hardison case included a dictum \nthat effectively suppressed litigation by minority-\nreligion employees who had been denied the \nreasonable accommodation that the law was designed \nto accord. It impliedly instructed lower courts that an \naccommodation was required under the 1972 law only \nif such accommodation would have a de minimis effect \non the employer\u2019s business.  \n\n6 \n \nD. Unbounded \nAccommodation \nIs \nCondemned. \nEstate of Thornton v. Caldor, 472 U.S. 703 \n(1985), was a case in which I represented the \npetitioner and the late Senator Joseph Lieberman \n(then Attorney General of Connecticut) represented \nthe State of Connecticut as intervenor. Rejecting the \nexplicit representation made in his brief and oral \nargument by Connecticut\u2019s then-incumbent Attorney \nGeneral that the challenged state statute requiring \naccommodation to any employee \u201cwho states that a \nparticular day of the week is observed as his Sabbath\u201d \nrequired only reasonable accommodation, the Court \nheld \nthat \nits \nliteral \nlanguage \nviolated \nthe \nEstablishment Clause because it took no account of \nany \u201cburden or inconvenience this imposes on the \nemployer or fellow workers.\u201d 472 U.S. at 708-709. \nJustices O\u2019Connor and Marshall joined the Court\u2019s \nruling \nonly \nbecause \nthey \ndistinguished \nthe \nConnecticut law from the Title VII provision that had \nbeen amended in 1972. They said, \u201cTitle VII calls for \nreasonable rather than absolute accommodation.\u201d 472 \nU.S. at 712. \nE. The \nCourt \nMandates \nReasonable \nAccommodation. \nThe unanimous decision of this Court in Groff \nv. DeJoy, 600 U.S. 447 (2023), struck the erroneous \nHardison language. It prescribed various reasonable \nstandards other than de minimis to define prescribed \naccommodation. \nNone \nrequires \naccommodation \nuniversally or forecloses it when the religious \n\n7 \n \nconviction can be reasonably accommodated with \nslight  inconvenience. \nII. \nREQUIRING MARYLAND TO MAKE A REASONABLE \nRELIGIOUS ACCOMMODATION IN THIS CASE DOES \nNOT VIOLATE EMPLOYMENT DIVISION V. SMITH \nJustice Scalia\u2019s precipitous and unexpected \nopinion in Employment Division v. Smith, 494 U.S. \n872 (1990), asserted that the Court\u2019s Yoder decision \nresulted not only from the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise claim but also from their constitutional \nentitlement \u201cto direct the education of their children.\u201d \n494 U.S. at 881. That same right is, of course, \nimplicated in the present case. The petitioners\u2019 choice \nto have their children educated in Maryland\u2019s public \nschools did not erase their right, as parents, to play an \nimportant role in \u201cthe education of their children.\u201d \nOne can agree, as I do, with Justice Alito\u2019s \ncompelling opinion in Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, \n593 U.S. 522, 544-627 (2021). Smith was wrongly \ndecided and has done substantial harm in more than \nthree decades. It should be overruled. \nBut \nthe \ndistinct \nfundamental \nprinciple \nvindicated in Yoder was that the Free Exercise Clause \nrequires \nreasonable \naccommodation \nwhenever \ngovernment acts in a manner that affects the religious \nobservance of individuals, groups, or other collective \nentities. Their devout observance need not be \naccompanied by a \u201chybrid\u201d right \u2013 affecting some \nadditional non-religious protected freedom \u2013 to \n\n8 \n \ndeserve  a  constitutional shield against eradication or \ninfringement. Yoder\u2019s writ is not so limited. \nThe plain language of the First Amendment \ndirects all agencies of government (\u201cCongress\u201d as \nconstrued expansively by judicial decision) to \u201cmake \nno law\u201d that \u201cprohibit[s] the free exercise\u201d of \u201creligion.\u201d \nThis \nconstitutional \ncommand \nis \ndirected \nto \ngovernment officials of Maryland and orders them to \nrefrain from imposing and enforcing regulations that \nfail to accommodate \u2013and thereby prohibit \u2013 the free \nexercise of religion by the parents who have initiated \nthis lawsuit and are petitioners in this Court. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons and those presented \nin the briefs of petitioners and their supporting amici \nthe decision of the Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit should be reversed. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRespectfully submitted,  \nNATHAN LEWIN \n   Counsel of Record \nLEWIN & LEWIN, LLP \n888 17th Street NW \n4th Floor \nWashington, DC 20006 \n(202) 828-1000 \nnat@lewinlewin.com \nCounsel for Amicus Curiae",

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the case has become more focused, moving from identifying the core arguments to pinpointing the critical hinge on which the case will turn, particularly at the certiorari stage.\n\n*   **Stable Core Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The petitioners' argument, based on an expansive reading of *Wisconsin v. Yoder* and the accommodation logic of *Groff v. DeJoy*, remains the primary theory for why they should win. It posits that the Free Exercise Clause requires schools to accommodate religious objections to the curriculum by providing opt-outs.\n*   **Stable Core Counter-Theory (The Coercion Threshold):** The respondents' counter-argument is fully integrated into my model. Their position is that the Free Exercise Clause is only implicated by government **coercion** to act or believe against one's faith. They argue that \"mere exposure\" to ideas in a public school curriculum does not meet this high threshold, meaning no constitutional burden exists. This creates the central doctrinal conflict: Is compelled exposure for young children a form of coercion?\n*   **Stable Strategic Analysis (The \"No Burden\" Firewall):** I remain convinced that the respondents' primary strategy is to defeat the claim at the \"burden\" stage. Their logic is: **No Coercion \u2192 No Burden \u2192 No Free Exercise Violation \u2192 No Accommodation Required.** This is a defensive firewall designed to prevent the Court from ever needing to apply the accommodation standards from *Groff*.\n*   **Refined Central Uncertainty (The Circuit Split Dispute):** My previous uncertainty about the respondents' arguments is resolved. My model's new point of maximum uncertainty\u2014and therefore the most critical area for further investigation\u2014is the factual dispute over the state of the law.\n    *   **Petitioners' Claim:** A circuit split exists on whether curriculum exposure can constitute a burden on religion.\n    *   **Respondents' Claim:** A **unanimous circuit court consensus** (*Mozert*, *Parker*, *Leebaert*) holds that \"mere exposure\" is not a cognizable burden.\n    *   **My Updated Focus:** My prediction now hinges significantly on which of these claims is more accurate. The \"no circuit split\" argument is a powerful reason for the Court to deny certiorari. Therefore, before even weighing the merits of \"coercion vs. exposure,\" I must first assess the validity of the respondents' claim of judicial consensus. The case now presents two sequential hurdles for the petitioners: first, prove a split to get cert; second, win the argument on the merits.",
          "design_beliefs": "The recent internal reasoning step did not introduce new external data, but it was highly productive for refining my strategic methodology. It represents a shift from reactive analysis to proactive, targeted investigation.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** This remains the bedrock of my methodology. The successful integration of the Brief in Opposition proved that a reliable prediction is impossible without a balanced model of the competing legal theories.\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** This principle has been proven effective. Identifying the respondents' arguments as the \"known unknown\" and successfully acquiring that information was the most efficient way to improve my model.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** The sequence of **Petition -> Opposition -> Merits & Amicus Briefs** is a confirmed, effective protocol for building a comprehensive understanding of a case from the ground up.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (The \"Question Behind the Question\"):** The strategy of analyzing how each party frames the legal question remains a key tool. The respondents' success in reframing the issue from \"accommodation\" to the antecedent question of \"burden\" is a masterclass in controlling the narrative.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (The \"No Circuit Split\" Veto):** I continue to recognize the \"no circuit split\" argument as a potential veto at the cert stage. My process must now always include a sub-routine to evaluate competing claims about the state of circuit law.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Defensive Doctrinal Firewalls):** The concept of litigants building \"firewalls\" (like the \"no burden\" argument) to block the application of unfavorable precedent (*Groff*) is now a permanent part of my analytical toolkit.\n*   **New Heuristic (The \"Critical Premise Validation Loop\"):** My reflective process has generated a more advanced and proactive version of the \"Uncertainty-Driven Search\" heuristic. This new loop operates as follows:\n    1.  **Identify the Linchpin:** After building the adversarial model, identify the single most powerful, potentially case-dispositive premise in an opponent's argument. (Here, it is the respondents' claim of a \"unanimous circuit consensus\").\n    2.  **Formulate a Hypothesis:** Treat this linchpin claim as a testable hypothesis (e.g., \"Hypothesis: The circuit courts are unanimous that mere exposure is not a Free Exercise burden\").\n    3.  **Targeted Investigation:** Design the next information-gathering action with the specific, primary goal of testing that hypothesis. (My plan to read respondent-side amicus briefs is a direct execution of this step).\n    This transforms my research from a general survey into a targeted, quasi-scientific effort to validate or falsify the opponent's strongest point, maximizing the value of my next action."

It shifts the model's focus from the general merits to the specific, dispositive hurdle of certiorari, which is a major gain in understanding the case's immediate trajectory.\n\nDesign EIG (0.8): This action provides a textbook validation of the refined 'Critical Premise Validation Loop' heuristic. It explicitly demonstrates the 'persistence' or 'iteration' principle: when an investigation yields useful but orthogonal information, the agent must re-focus on the original, unresolved linchpin hypothesis. This is a powerful, generalizable lesson in efficient, targeted research, proving the value of an iterative, rather than one-shot, approach to resolving core uncertainties. It's a high-value demonstration of a sophisticated design principle in action.\n\nJoint EIG (1.4): The action is highly valuable because it both sharpens the immediate task objective and provides strong evidence for a key design heuristic, making the agent's future actions more effective.",

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case continues to grow in sophistication, incorporating historical context and alternative legal strategies that add significant texture to the core conflict.\n\n*   **Stable Core Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The petitioners' primary argument\u2014that the Free Exercise Clause, via *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, mandates an accommodation (opt-out) for their religious objections\u2014remains central. This theory has now been **significantly reinforced** by the amicus brief of Nathan Lewin, a highly credible source who participated in the original *Yoder* litigation. Lewin's brief provides a deep historical pedigree for this argument, framing accommodation not just as a possible remedy but as a direct \"constitutional mandate.\"\n*   **New Sub-Theory (The *Groff* Analogy):** The Lewin brief introduces a powerful new line of reasoning. It draws a direct analogy between this case and the Court's recent, unanimous decision in *Groff v. DeJoy*. In *Groff*, the Court strengthened the standard for \"reasonable accommodation\" in the statutory (Title VII) context. The implicit argument is that the Court, having just corrected a weak interpretation of accommodation in statutory law, is now primed to do the same for constitutional law, potentially reviving a more robust, pre-*Smith* interpretation of the Free Exercise Clause. This adds a forward-looking, predictive element to the petitioners' case.\n*   **Stable Core Counter-Theory (The Coercion Threshold):** The respondents' argument that \"mere exposure\" to ideas does not constitute government **coercion** and therefore does not create a \"burden\" on religious exercise remains the primary counter-argument in my model.\n*   **Stable Strategic Analysis (The \"No Burden\" Firewall):** I continue to believe the respondents' main strategy is to win at the \"burden\" stage, preventing the court from ever reaching the accommodation analysis of *Yoder* or *Groff*. However, the Lewin brief demonstrates a potential flanking maneuver: by framing the issue as a direct \"mandate to accommodate,\" it attempts to bypass the \"burden\" question entirely and proceed directly to the remedy.\n*   **Refined Understanding of the *Smith* Hurdle:** The Lewin brief clarifies the petitioners' multi-pronged strategy for navigating *Employment Division v. Smith*:\n    1.  **Direct Challenge:** Argue that *Smith* was wrongly decided and should be overruled, a view with some support on the current Court.\n    2.  **Bypass via *Yoder*:** Argue that *Yoder* establishes a fundamental principle of accommodation that stands apart from the *Smith* framework.\n    3.  **Conform via \"Hybrid Rights\":** Argue that even under *Smith*, this case qualifies for an exception because it involves a \"hybrid\" of two constitutional rights: Free Exercise and the fundamental right of parents to direct their children's education.\n*   **Stable Central Uncertainty (The Circuit Split Dispute):** The amicus brief, while strengthening the petitioners' merits arguments, **did not resolve my primary uncertainty** for the certiorari stage. The respondents' claim of a **unanimous circuit court consensus** (*Mozert*, *Parker*, *Leebaert*) holding that \"mere exposure\" is not a burden remains unaddressed and un-rebutted by this new information. My hypothesis\u2014that this claim is the respondents' most powerful tool for avoiding cert\u2014remains untested. Therefore, the case's first and most immediate hurdle (surviving the \"no circuit split\" argument) is still the point of maximum uncertainty.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has refined my proactive research methodology and added new layers to my understanding of how legal arguments are constructed and weighted.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** This remains my core principle. The Lewin brief added significant historical depth and doctrinal weight to the petitioners' side of the model, demonstrating that a good model requires not just a list of arguments but an appreciation for their intellectual pedigree.\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** This principle remains effective, but its application has become more nuanced. The search for amicus briefs was correctly targeted at my area of greatest uncertainty, even if the first result did not directly resolve it.\n*   **Stable Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** The sequence of **Petition -> Opposition -> Merits & Amicus Briefs** is confirmed as a robust protocol. This amicus brief, filed at the cert stage, is a perfect example of the kind of evidence I expect to find at this point.\n*   **Stable Heuristics (The \"Question Behind the Question,\" \"No Circuit Split\" Veto, \"Defensive Doctrinal Firewalls\"):** These analytical tools remain stable and essential components of my methodology.\n*   **Refined Heuristic (The \"Critical Premise Validation Loop\"):** This observation provided a crucial real-world test of my new proactive loop, leading to a key refinement.\n    1.  **Linchpin Identified:** The loop correctly identified the respondents' \"unanimous circuit consensus\" claim as the linchpin for the cert stage.\n    2.  **Hypothesis Formulated:** The hypothesis (\"The circuit courts are unanimous...\") remains the correct target.\n    3.  **Targeted Investigation & Refinement:** My action (searching for amicus briefs) was a valid first step. However, the result was valuable but *orthogonal*\u2014it strengthened the petitioners' merits case instead of addressing the circuit split.\n    4.  **Lesson Learned/Refinement:** The loop must now include a \"persistence\" or \"iteration\" principle. When a targeted investigation yields useful but non-dispositive information, the primary hypothesis remains untested and must be the target of the *next* action. The loop is not a one-shot process; it is an iterative cycle of targeted inquiry. My next action must be to find evidence (likely a respondent-side amicus brief) that directly engages with the *Mozert/Parker/Leebaert* line of cases.\n*   **New Heuristic (The Historical Pedigree Heuristic):** Arguments gain persuasive force from their history. An argument's value is enhanced when it is made by a source with direct, historical involvement in the foundational precedents (like Lewin's role in *Yoder* and the creation of statutory accommodation). I must now assess not just the logic of an argument, but its lineage and the credibility of its historical proponents.\n*   **New Heuristic (The Analogical Leap):** Effective legal strategy often involves drawing analogies from recent, favorable rulings in adjacent areas of law. The Lewin brief's use of the recent statutory ruling in *Groff* to bolster a *constitutional* argument is a prime example. When analyzing a case, I must now actively look for recent, high-profile decisions and consider how they could be creatively analogized to support either side."

R. 14.1 ......................................................... 11\n\n \n \nREPLY BRIEF \nThe Board\u2019s response is a fantasy version of the law \nand facts. Instead of responding to Petitioners\u2019 brief, \nthe Board dissembles.  \nThe Board devotes its entire brief to a fiction, re-\nbutting strawman arguments about mere \u201cexposure.\u201d \nBut this case has always been about compelled in-\nstruction\u2014particularly the fact that religious parents \nare pressured to have their children\u2019s \u201ceither/or think-\ning\u201d on sex and gender be \u201cdisrupt[ed]\u201d as the price for \nattending public school. Yoder says this pressure vio-\nlates the Free Exercise Clause. But the Board fails \neven to address Yoder until the end of its brief. \nResp.Br.38. And when it does, it misrepresents both \nYoder\u2019s holding and its implications.  \nSimilarly, the Board cannot seriously dispute that \nstripping notice and opt-out rights imposed a burden \nthat was neither neutral nor generally applicable un-\nder Lukumi. Instead, the Board baselessly claims \nthose inquiries are \u201cnot before the Court.\u201d But this \nCourt already rejected this argument at the certiorari \nstage, where neutrality and general applicability were \naddressed alongside burden\u2014just as this Court al-\nways does. And neutrality and general applicability \nare sorely lacking\u2014for reasons the Board cannot es-\ncape. \nUnable to prevail under Yoder or Lukumi, the \nBoard concocts a new test\u2014\u201ccognizable\u201d coercion. That \nnewly minted test rewrites 60 years of precedent to ex-\nclude \u201cpressure\u201d as one form of coercion. To replace the \nactual caselaw, Respondents retreat to anti-canon: \n19th century anti-Catholic bigotry, public schools up-\nholding racial segregation, and (without saying so \n\n2 \n \naloud) Gobitis. If embraced, the resulting Free Exer-\ncise Clause would not apply even if public schools \ntaught \u201cporn literacy,\u201d \u201csex play with friends,\u201d nudity, \nand even simulated sexual acts. Tellingly, the Board \nnever claims otherwise.  \nOn the facts, the Board chooses its own adventure, \nplucking a handful of scattered statements to claim no \nstudents are asked to change their beliefs and to claim \nthere is no evidence of coercion (however defined). But \nit never addresses its own directive to \u201cdisrupt\u201d \n\u201ccisnormativity\u201d and students\u2019 \u201ceither/or thinking.\u201d \nThe Board doesn\u2019t dispute that it adopted these books \nfor \u201cEveryone\u201d to read and to combat the \u201cdominant \nculture.\u201d It doesn\u2019t meaningfully engage the books\u2019 in-\nstruction that gender identity need not \u201cmake sense,\u201d \nthat pronouns change \u201clike the weather,\u201d that \n\u201cblush[ing] hot\u201d at a classmate is an appropriate topic \nfor classroom discussion, or that children should \u201cre-\nwrite the norms\u201d on sex and gender and choose which-\never bathroom is most \u201ccomfy\u201d for them. \nWith neither law nor facts on its side, the Board \npleads for a remand. That is inconsistent with Fulton, \nCarson, and common sense. In Fulton and Carson, this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in the first instance. That \nmakes sense where, as here, Petitioners have long \nbeen illegally deprived of their rights and the Court \ncan resolve the merits of the dispute rather than let it \nfester. The Board has fully briefed strict scrutiny in \nboth courts below. That standard should be applied to \nreverse the ruling below.  \n\n3 \n \nI. Petitioners\u2019 free exercise is burdened. \nA. Petitioners are burdened under Yoder. \nThe \u201crights of parents to direct the religious up-\nbringing of their children\u201d have deep roots in the Free \nExercise Clause. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 233 \n(1972); Pet.Br.24-28. Here, Petitioners have a sacred \nobligation to shape and safeguard their children\u2019s un-\nderstanding of gender and sexuality. Pet.App.530a; \nPet.App.536a-537a; Pet.App.543a. But the Board com-\npels instruction designed to disrupt their beliefs on \nthese religiously sensitive topics\u2014and at a shockingly \nyoung and formative age. By \u201csubstantially interfer-\ning\u201d with Petitioners\u2019 ability to direct their children\u2019s \nreligious upbringing in a sharp break from our na-\ntional traditions, the Board\u2019s actions trigger strict \nscrutiny. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215, 218; Pet.Br.28-33 \nThe Board\u2019s counter-arguments fail. \n1. The Board gives the facts a rewrite, repeating 36 \ntimes that Petitioners complain about \u201cexposure.\u201d But \nPetitioners object to compelled instruction\u2014the read-\ning and discussion of books expressly designed to in-\nterfere with and \u201cdisrupt\u201d parents\u2019 religious guidance. \nSee Pet.i (\u201ccompel  * * *  instruction\u201d); Pet.22,33 (\u201ccom-\npelled instruction\u201d). In a case where the Board itself \nrecognizes that children \u201cmay come away from [this] \ninstruction with a new perspective not easily contra-\nvened by their parents,\u201d J.A.46, that standard is easily \nmet. \nWith carefully qualified phrases, the Board now \ntries to obfuscate how the books are used, stating that \nteachers \u201care not required to use any of the storybooks \nin any given lesson\u201d and \u201cwere not provided any asso-\n\n4 \n \nciated mandatory discussion points.\u201d Resp.Br.9 (em-\nphases added). But ultimately, the Board must con-\ncede that teachers \u201care expected to incorporate the sto-\nrybooks into the curriculum.\u201d Resp.Br.9. The record is \nunequivocal that \u201cthere is an expectation that teach-\ners use the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books as part of instruc-\ntion\u201d and that teachers \u201ccannot  * * *  elect not to use\u201d \nthem. Pet.App.605a (emphases added). The Board \nstated the \u201clearning\u201d about \u201cdiversified gender and \nsexuality identity\u201d required by the books \u201cwill hap-\npen,\u201d Pet.App.636a, and that \u201cthere will be discussion \nthat ensues.\u201d Pet.App.642a. It further stated its \u201cex-\npectation that teachers utilize the texts  * * *  to create \nmore inclusive classrooms.\u201d Pet.App.487a. And it has \nconfirmed that reading the books \u201cis not optional.\u201d \nPet.App.489a. After all, the Board has conceded that \nthe storybook instruction was adopted specifically to \navoid \u201cthe opt-out right in Maryland.\u201d J.A.49-50. \nSimilar evidence confirms the Board\u2019s intention of \n\u201c[d]isrupt[ing] [children\u2019s] either/or thinking\u201d about \ngender. Pet.App.629a, 633a. In addition to its man-\ndates discussed above, the Board\u2019s teacher guidance \nrejects the notion that elementary school children are \n\u201ctoo young to be learning about gender and sexual \nidentity.\u201d Pet.App.637a. Instead, by promoting \u201clearn-\ning about the diversity of gender,\u201d the Board seeks to \npromote \u201ccurious exploration\u201d and \u201ccreat[e] more \nspace\u201d for children to \u201clearn about\u201d new \u201cidentities \nthat might relate to their families or even themselves.\u201d \nPet.App.637a, 623a. The schools will engage in \n\u201c[t]eaching about LGBTQ+\u201d precisely \u201cto show that \nthere is no one \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 way to be\u201d\u2014that is, \n\u201cthat there is no single way to be a boy, girl, or any \nother gender.\u201d Pet.App.638a. In short, far from merely \n\n5 \n \n\u201cdefin[ing] words that are new and unfamiliar,\u201d \nResp.Br.26, the Board admits that teachers\u2019 instruc-\ntion will \u201c[d]isrupt [students\u2019] either/or thinking.\u201d \nPet.App.629a, 633a.  \nThus, it is irrelevant that teachers use \u201ctheir pro-\nfessional judgment and experience\u201d when \u201cincorpo-\nrat[ing]\u201d the books in their instruction. Resp.Br.9. \nWhat matters is that the books must be used, that the \nBoard endorses and promotes their use, and that the \nbooks are in fact used in instruction.  Pet.App.273a \n(\u201cpart of a professional development workshop for \nMCPS staff\u201d); see also Pet.App.277a; Pet.App.511a. \nIndeed, several MCPS teachers are quoted in a brief \nbelow, with one explaining that reading My Rainbow \nto her class was a way of \u201cvalidat[ing]\u201d one student\u2019s \n\u201ctender truths\u201d about gender ideology. J.A.54-56. \nWhen such compelled instruction is taking place, it is \nirrelevant that the books may also be placed \u201con a shelf \nfor students to find on their own\u201d\u2014i.e., what the Board \ncalls \u201cexposure.\u201d See Resp.Br.17.1 \n2. The Board next complains (20 times) that the \nrecord contains insufficient evidence of coercion. But it \n \n1  \nThis is not to say \u201cexposure\u201d could never be enough. Indeed, \nthe Board itself attempts to distinguish forced \u201cexposure to ideas \nthat clash with  * * *  religion\u201d (for which it denies opt-outs) and \nforced \u201cexposure to \u2018images of the Prophet Mohammad\u2019\u201d (for \nwhich it would allow opt-outs). Resp.25 n.7. But perhaps the Mus-\nlim Petitioners themselves should have the final say on whether \nboth aren\u2019t religiously problematic. And even under the Board\u2019s \ncapricious standard, it seems unlikely parents would be entirely \nwithout recourse if their children were intentionally exposed to \npornography, extreme graphic violence, or other such material, \nespecially at a young age. But the Court need not reach this ques-\ntion here, as the Board has gone far beyond exposure to deliberate \nindoctrination. \n\n6 \n \nis undisputed that the parents are compelled by threat \nof criminal fines or the expense of alternative school-\ning\u2014unattainable for most\u2014to place their children \ninto classroom instruction against their religious obli-\ngations.  Thus, as Judge Quattlebaum observed, Peti-\ntioners have easily \u201cmet their burden,\u201d having pro-\nduced \u201cbooks that no one disputes will be used to in-\nstruct their K-5 children\u201d; \u201cdeclarations explaining in \ndetail why the books conflict with their religious be-\nliefs\u201d; and \u201cthe board\u2019s own internal documents\u201d de-\ntailing \nefforts \nto \ndisrupt \nstudents\u2019 \nbeliefs. \nPet.App.62a. \nThe Board whistles past the voluminous evidence \nof ideological instruction. It offers no real response to \nthe teacher guidance discussed above, or even to the \nbooks\u2019 contents. Pet.App.323a (normalizing gender-\nneutral \nbathroom \nuse); \nPet.App.435a-436a \n(\u201cblush[ing] hot\u201d classmate romance); Pet.App.465a, \n(stating gender identity is about \u201clove\u201d and doesn\u2019t \n\u201cneed[ ] to make sense\u201d); Pet.App.458a-461a, 470a \n(teaching that children can choose their own sex); \nPet.App.279a-306a, 390a-428a (romanticizing same-\nsex relationships). These are not mere \u201cretellings\u201d of \nbooks like \u201cRapunzel, Cinderella, and Goldilocks.\u201d \nResp.Br.7. Rather, as the Board\u2019s own principals pro-\ntested, the books have plots that \u201ccenter around sexual \norientation and gender identity.\u201d Pet.App.616a. And \nthey were adopted by the Board to combat the \u201cdomi-\nnance, superiority, and entitlement\u201d of the \u201cdominant \nculture.\u201d Pet.App.517a. \n3. In truth, the Board\u2019s claim of insufficient evi-\ndence is a plea to adopt a more demanding legal stand-\nard\u2014one that finds no purchase in Yoder or anywhere \nelse. \nThe \nchildren \nin \nYoder \nwere never \n\u201cin \n\n7 \n \nfact  * * *  asked to affirm views contrary to their own\u201d \nor \u201cto disavow views  * * *  that their religion es-\npouses.\u201d Resp.Br.32. Rather, the Court found a burden \nbecause the parents were pressured to send their chil-\ndren to school despite their contrary religious obliga-\ntions. So too here\u2014Petitioners\u2019 children are required \nto participate in the challenged instruction and have \nbeen denied an opt-out. That the denial is a deliberate \neffort to pressure Petitioners to put their children in \nan environment where they will be pressured to aban-\ndon their religious beliefs makes this an a fortiori case. \nCf. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 211, 218. \nThe evidence is overwhelming that Petitioners\u2019 \nchildren are \u201ccompelled or pressured to act or believe \ncontrary to their or their parents\u2019 religious views.\u201d \nResp.Br.32. Indeed, the Board ignores its professional \neducators\u2019 own warnings that the storybooks and ac-\ncompanying guidance are \u201cnot appropriate for the in-\ntended age group,\u201d Pet.App.616a, 618a; \u201c[s]tate[ ] as \nfact\u201d what \u201c[s]ome would not agree [is] a fact,\u201d \nPet.App.620a; and are \u201cshaming\u201d toward children who \ndisagree, Pet.App.620a, and \u201cdismissive\u201d of religious \nbeliefs, Pet.App.619a. It is no wonder that parents \nwith contrary religious beliefs feel religiously obli-\ngated to opt their children out of such instruction. \nThe Board responds that, in Yoder, children were \n\u201cnot only\u201d exposed to a hostile environment \u201cbut also\u201d \ntaken \u201caway from their community, physically and \nemotionally, during the crucial and formative adoles-\ncent period of life.\u201d Resp.Br.38-39; Yoder, 406 U.S. at \n211. But so too here: Petitioners\u2019 children are away \nfrom their parents for an entire school day, and at a \nmuch younger and more impressionable age. And con-\n\n8 \n \ntrary to the Board\u2019s arguments, Resp.Br.39, the par-\nents in Yoder were just as \u201cfree to impart their religion \nat home\u201d after school as Petitioners are here. This \nCourt has properly rejected the suggestion that the \npossibility of rebuilding religious faith at home can ex-\ncuse the government\u2019s efforts to disrupt students\u2019 faith \nwhile at school. West Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Bar-\nnette, 319 U.S. 624, 637, 641-642 (1943); contra id. at \n664 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (no restrictions on \nother \u201cchannels  * * *  open to both children and par-\nents\u201d).  \nFinally, nothing in Yoder suggests its burden anal-\nysis applies only when the accommodation sought is \ncompletely skipping the last two years of high school \nas opposed to opting out of discrete \u201celements\u201d of the \ncurriculum. Resp.Br.39-40 (emphasis removed). The \nquestion of the appropriate remedy in Yoder became \nrelevant only on strict scrutiny. Yoder, 406 U.S. at \n235-236. Even then, three Justices described the ac-\ncommodation required as \u201crelatively slight.\u201d Id. at 238 \n(White, J., concurring). Here, even if the scope of the \naccommodation had some bearing on the burden anal-\nysis (it doesn\u2019t), restoring notice and opt-outs to books \nthat were not even in the curriculum until the fall of \n2022\u2014and for which opt-outs existed through the \nspring of 2023\u2014is far more \u201cslight.\u201d2 \n \n2  \nThe \u201cconvincing showing\u201d the Yoder plaintiffs made \u201cthrough \nvoluminous \u2018trial testimony,\u2019\u201d Resp.Br.39 n.11, was a direct ref-\nerence to \u201ctheir alternative mode of continuing informal voca-\ntional education,\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 235. Because opting out of \nthe storybooks does not impede the government\u2019s core interest in \na \u201cself-supporting\u201d and \u201cresponsib[le]\u201d citizenry, no such showing \nis required here. Id. at 234; see also id. at 225-226 & n.14. \n\n9 \n \n4. Rather than engaging Yoder on its own terms, \nRespondents argue that Lyng walked back Yoder\u2019s \nholding. See Resp.Br.20 (quoting Lyng to \u201cexplain[ ]\u201d \nYoder). Lyng can\u2019t bear that weight. For one, Lyng \nturned on the \u201claws in question\u201d being \u201cneutral and \ngenerally applicable without regard to religion.\u201d Trin-\nity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer, 582 U.S. \n449, 460 (2017). To the extent Lyng speaks to what \nconstitutes a burden, it simply reaffirms that the Free \nExercise Clause protects against \u201cindirect coercion or \npenalties on the free exercise of religion, not just out-\nright prohibitions.\u201d Lyng v. Northwest Indian Ceme-\ntery Protective Ass\u2019n, 485 U.S. 439, 450 (1988); see also \nTrinity Lutheran, 582 U.S. at 450-451 (quoting Lyng\u2019s \n\u201cindirect coercion\u201d language); Carson v. Makin, 596 \nU.S. 767, 778 (2022) (same). If requiring elementary-\nage children to participate in prohibited instruction on \nsexuality and gender against their parents\u2019 faith\u2014on \nthreat of truancy or losing access to a free education\u2014\ndoes not constitute at least \u201cindirect coercion,\u201d what \ndoes? Pet.Br.44-45. \nRespondents rely on Lyng\u2019s characterization of \nYoder as involving a statute that \u201cdirectly compel[led]\u201d \naction. Resp.Br.38. But wherever the line lies between \ndirect and indirect coercion, the pressure here is \nhighly analogous to that in Yoder. Here, Parents are \ncompelled to leave their children in religiously prohib-\nited instruction under threat of criminal penalties or \nthe financial burden of sending them to private school \nor homeschooling. Similarly, in Yoder, the parents \nwere compelled by threat of criminal penalties or the \ncost of establishing independent schools, as had been \ndone in other states. See Laycock.Br.20-21. In both \n\n10 \n \ncases, the compulsory education requirement \u201csub-\nstantially interfer[ed] with the religious development \nof the  * * *  child and his integration into the way of \nlife of the [relevant] faith community.\u201d 406 U.S. at 218. \nThis finding, in both cases, is \u201csupport[ed]\u201d by the chil-\ndren\u2019s impressionability, Pet.Br.27-28, and \u201cthe values \nand programs of the modern  * * *  school,\u201d 406 U.S. at \n217-218; Pet.Br.29-33. Regardless of faith tradition, \ncompelled instruction over the parents\u2019 religious obli-\ngations is a free-exercise burden triggering strict scru-\ntiny. \nB. The Board\u2019s no-opt-out policy imposes a \nreligious burden and is not neutral or \ngenerally applicable under Sherbert and \nLukumi. \nApart from Yoder\u2019s substantial interference analy-\nsis, the Board\u2019s actions burden Petitioners\u2019 free-exer-\ncise rights by forcing Petitioners to choose between \nshielding their children from religiously-prohibited in-\nstruction and accessing the public schools. Sherbert v. \nVerner, 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963) (\u201cforce[d]  * * *  to \nchoose\u201d); Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 717 \n(1981) (\u201cput to a choice\u201d); Pet.Br.16-19. Under \nLukumi, this triggers strict scrutiny because the pres-\nsure results from an opt-out policy that isn\u2019t neutral or \ngenerally applicable. Id. at 43-45.3  \n \n3  \nThe Board waves off neutrality and general applicability as \n\u201ca separate inquiry\u201d \u201cnot before the Court.\u201d Resp.Br.43. It made \nthe same argument at the certiorari stage. BIO.26 (\u201cnot even be-\nfore the Court\u201d). But \u201cit was clear from the petition and from pe-\ntitioner[s\u2019] other filings in this Court (and in the courts below)\u201d \nthat Lukumi\u2019s standard was understood as \u201c\u2018fairly included\u2019 \n \n\n11 \n \n1. The Board flunks general applicability because \nit allows opt-outs from inclusivity instruction during \nhealth class while denying opt-outs from analogous \nstory-time instruction, Pet.Br.36, and because it has \nexercised discretion to \u201cdecide which reasons\u201d for opt-\ning out \u201care worthy of solicitude,\u201d Pet.Br.38 (quoting \nFulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. 522, 537 \n(2021)). Either triggers strict scrutiny. Ibid. \nCategorical exceptions. \u201cA government policy will \nfail the general applicability requirement if it \u2018prohib-\nits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct \nthat undermines the government\u2019s asserted interests \nin a similar way.\u2019\u201d Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 526 (quoting \nFulton, 593 U.S. at 534). Comparability is \u201cjudged \nagainst\u201d the \u201cgovernment interest that justifies the \nregulation at issue.\u201d Tandon v. Newsom, 593 U.S. 61, \n62 (2021).  \nHere, the Board asserts the same \u201cequity\u201d interest \nto justify both the elementary school storybooks and \nits high school health classes. Pet.Br.36-37. Yet the \n \nwithin the question[ ] presented.\u201d R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 \nU.S. 377, 381 n.3 (1992); see also Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(a); Pet.29-30 \n(discussing Lukumi); Cert.Reply.Br.9-10 (same). Indeed, the \nCourt typically addresses neutrality and general applicability \nalongside the burden analysis. See, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton \nSch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 525 (2022) (plaintiff can establish free \nexercise violation \u201cby showing that a government entity has bur-\ndened his sincere religious practice pursuant to a policy that is \nnot \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018generally applicable\u2019\u201d); see also Fulton, 593 U.S. \nat 532-533; Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, \n508 U.S. 520, 532, 543 (1993). While some courts have held that \nlack of neutrality and general applicability is itself a burden, see \nLaycock.Br.24-28, the Court need not reach that issue here. \n\n12 \n \nBoard provides notice and secular opt-outs for the \nhealth classes but not the storybooks. Ibid. \nCrucially, the Board never disputes that the same \n\u201cequity\u201d interest underlies its curricular content in \nboth sets of classes. Pet.Br.36-37. Nor could it. The \nvery same \u201cEquity Regulation\u201d that led the Board to \nadopt the storybooks also led to updated \u201cinclusivity\u201d \ninstruction in the \u201cFamily Life and Human Sexuality\u201d \nsegment of health classes. Ibid. There, every student \nfrom pre-K to high school now learns about gender \nidentity, and every student from fourth grade onward \nlearns about sexual orientation. J.A.68-72, 80. Yet opt-\nouts to that gender identity and sexuality instruction \nare allowed only from health classes, not English-Lan-\nguage Arts, where the storybooks teach both begin-\nning in pre-K. That is not general applicability. \nPet.Br.36-38.  \nAbandoning equity, the Board now says its insist-\nence on the storybook instruction is justified by \u201cab-\nsenteeism and administrability.\u201d Resp.Br.46. But for \npurposes of general applicability, the relevant govern-\nment interest is the interest underlying adoption of \nthe inclusivity curriculum. See Fulton, 593 U.S. at 534, \n541-542. As one of the asserted reasons for withdraw-\ning notice and opt-outs, absenteeism is relevant to \nstrict scrutiny. But the \u201cLGBTQ+-inclusive\u201d books \nwere adopted to promote inclusivity, not to combat ab-\nsenteeism. Absenteeism thus plays no role under gen-\neral applicability. \nThe Board\u2019s response also flouts Tandon, claiming \nthere isn\u2019t discrimination in denying religious opt-outs \nfrom the storybooks because it denies all \u201csecular\u201d opt-\nouts. Resp.Br.45-46. But the same was true in Tandon. \nThere, California \u201cadopted a blanket restriction on at-\n\n13 \n \nhome gatherings of all kinds, religious and secular \nalike.\u201d 593 U.S. at 65 (Kagan, J., dissenting). Yet as \nthe Court held, treating everyone equally \u201cpoorly\u201d is \n\u201cno answer\u201d to giving \u201cany comparable secular activity \nmore favorabl[e]\u201d treatment \u201cthan religious exercise.\u201d \nId. at 62 (per curiam); see also CLS.Br.20-21. Allowing \nsecular opt-outs (from health classes) while banning \nall religious and secular opt-outs (from the storybooks) \nundermines the shared \u201cequity\u201d interest and thus ne-\ngates \ngeneral \napplicability. \nPet.Br.37-38; \nLay-\ncock.Br.26-27; U.S.Br.32-33. \nAt bottom, the Board asks the Court to approve its \nown shifting and self-serving \u201ccategories of selection.\u201d \nChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, \n508 U.S. 520, 542 (1993). But \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

R. 14.1 ......................................................... 11\n\n \n \nREPLY BRIEF \nThe Board\u2019s response is a fantasy version of the law \nand facts. Instead of responding to Petitioners\u2019 brief, \nthe Board dissembles.  \nThe Board devotes its entire brief to a fiction, re-\nbutting strawman arguments about mere \u201cexposure.\u201d \nBut this case has always been about compelled in-\nstruction\u2014particularly the fact that religious parents \nare pressured to have their children\u2019s \u201ceither/or think-\ning\u201d on sex and gender be \u201cdisrupt[ed]\u201d as the price for \nattending public school. Yoder says this pressure vio-\nlates the Free Exercise Clause. But the Board fails \neven to address Yoder until the end of its brief. \nResp.Br.38. And when it does, it misrepresents both \nYoder\u2019s holding and its implications.  \nSimilarly, the Board cannot seriously dispute that \nstripping notice and opt-out rights imposed a burden \nthat was neither neutral nor generally applicable un-\nder Lukumi. Instead, the Board baselessly claims \nthose inquiries are \u201cnot before the Court.\u201d But this \nCourt already rejected this argument at the certiorari \nstage, where neutrality and general applicability were \naddressed alongside burden\u2014just as this Court al-\nways does. And neutrality and general applicability \nare sorely lacking\u2014for reasons the Board cannot es-\ncape. \nUnable to prevail under Yoder or Lukumi, the \nBoard concocts a new test\u2014\u201ccognizable\u201d coercion. That \nnewly minted test rewrites 60 years of precedent to ex-\nclude \u201cpressure\u201d as one form of coercion. To replace the \nactual caselaw, Respondents retreat to anti-canon: \n19th century anti-Catholic bigotry, public schools up-\nholding racial segregation, and (without saying so \n\n2 \n \naloud) Gobitis. If embraced, the resulting Free Exer-\ncise Clause would not apply even if public schools \ntaught \u201cporn literacy,\u201d \u201csex play with friends,\u201d nudity, \nand even simulated sexual acts. Tellingly, the Board \nnever claims otherwise.  \nOn the facts, the Board chooses its own adventure, \nplucking a handful of scattered statements to claim no \nstudents are asked to change their beliefs and to claim \nthere is no evidence of coercion (however defined). But \nit never addresses its own directive to \u201cdisrupt\u201d \n\u201ccisnormativity\u201d and students\u2019 \u201ceither/or thinking.\u201d \nThe Board doesn\u2019t dispute that it adopted these books \nfor \u201cEveryone\u201d to read and to combat the \u201cdominant \nculture.\u201d It doesn\u2019t meaningfully engage the books\u2019 in-\nstruction that gender identity need not \u201cmake sense,\u201d \nthat pronouns change \u201clike the weather,\u201d that \n\u201cblush[ing] hot\u201d at a classmate is an appropriate topic \nfor classroom discussion, or that children should \u201cre-\nwrite the norms\u201d on sex and gender and choose which-\never bathroom is most \u201ccomfy\u201d for them. \nWith neither law nor facts on its side, the Board \npleads for a remand. That is inconsistent with Fulton, \nCarson, and common sense. In Fulton and Carson, this \nCourt applied strict scrutiny in the first instance. That \nmakes sense where, as here, Petitioners have long \nbeen illegally deprived of their rights and the Court \ncan resolve the merits of the dispute rather than let it \nfester. The Board has fully briefed strict scrutiny in \nboth courts below. That standard should be applied to \nreverse the ruling below.  \n\n3 \n \nI. Petitioners\u2019 free exercise is burdened. \nA. Petitioners are burdened under Yoder. \nThe \u201crights of parents to direct the religious up-\nbringing of their children\u201d have deep roots in the Free \nExercise Clause. Wisconsin v. Yoder, 406 U.S. 205, 233 \n(1972); Pet.Br.24-28. Here, Petitioners have a sacred \nobligation to shape and safeguard their children\u2019s un-\nderstanding of gender and sexuality. Pet.App.530a; \nPet.App.536a-537a; Pet.App.543a. But the Board com-\npels instruction designed to disrupt their beliefs on \nthese religiously sensitive topics\u2014and at a shockingly \nyoung and formative age. By \u201csubstantially interfer-\ning\u201d with Petitioners\u2019 ability to direct their children\u2019s \nreligious upbringing in a sharp break from our na-\ntional traditions, the Board\u2019s actions trigger strict \nscrutiny. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 215, 218; Pet.Br.28-33 \nThe Board\u2019s counter-arguments fail. \n1. The Board gives the facts a rewrite, repeating 36 \ntimes that Petitioners complain about \u201cexposure.\u201d But \nPetitioners object to compelled instruction\u2014the read-\ning and discussion of books expressly designed to in-\nterfere with and \u201cdisrupt\u201d parents\u2019 religious guidance. \nSee Pet.i (\u201ccompel  * * *  instruction\u201d); Pet.22,33 (\u201ccom-\npelled instruction\u201d). In a case where the Board itself \nrecognizes that children \u201cmay come away from [this] \ninstruction with a new perspective not easily contra-\nvened by their parents,\u201d J.A.46, that standard is easily \nmet. \nWith carefully qualified phrases, the Board now \ntries to obfuscate how the books are used, stating that \nteachers \u201care not required to use any of the storybooks \nin any given lesson\u201d and \u201cwere not provided any asso-\n\n4 \n \nciated mandatory discussion points.\u201d Resp.Br.9 (em-\nphases added). But ultimately, the Board must con-\ncede that teachers \u201care expected to incorporate the sto-\nrybooks into the curriculum.\u201d Resp.Br.9. The record is \nunequivocal that \u201cthere is an expectation that teach-\ners use the LGBTQ-Inclusive Books as part of instruc-\ntion\u201d and that teachers \u201ccannot  * * *  elect not to use\u201d \nthem. Pet.App.605a (emphases added). The Board \nstated the \u201clearning\u201d about \u201cdiversified gender and \nsexuality identity\u201d required by the books \u201cwill hap-\npen,\u201d Pet.App.636a, and that \u201cthere will be discussion \nthat ensues.\u201d Pet.App.642a. It further stated its \u201cex-\npectation that teachers utilize the texts  * * *  to create \nmore inclusive classrooms.\u201d Pet.App.487a. And it has \nconfirmed that reading the books \u201cis not optional.\u201d \nPet.App.489a. After all, the Board has conceded that \nthe storybook instruction was adopted specifically to \navoid \u201cthe opt-out right in Maryland.\u201d J.A.49-50. \nSimilar evidence confirms the Board\u2019s intention of \n\u201c[d]isrupt[ing] [children\u2019s] either/or thinking\u201d about \ngender. Pet.App.629a, 633a. In addition to its man-\ndates discussed above, the Board\u2019s teacher guidance \nrejects the notion that elementary school children are \n\u201ctoo young to be learning about gender and sexual \nidentity.\u201d Pet.App.637a. Instead, by promoting \u201clearn-\ning about the diversity of gender,\u201d the Board seeks to \npromote \u201ccurious exploration\u201d and \u201ccreat[e] more \nspace\u201d for children to \u201clearn about\u201d new \u201cidentities \nthat might relate to their families or even themselves.\u201d \nPet.App.637a, 623a. The schools will engage in \n\u201c[t]eaching about LGBTQ+\u201d precisely \u201cto show that \nthere is no one \u2018right\u2019 or \u2018normal\u2019 way to be\u201d\u2014that is, \n\u201cthat there is no single way to be a boy, girl, or any \nother gender.\u201d Pet.App.638a. In short, far from merely \n\n5 \n \n\u201cdefin[ing] words that are new and unfamiliar,\u201d \nResp.Br.26, the Board admits that teachers\u2019 instruc-\ntion will \u201c[d]isrupt [students\u2019] either/or thinking.\u201d \nPet.App.629a, 633a.  \nThus, it is irrelevant that teachers use \u201ctheir pro-\nfessional judgment and experience\u201d when \u201cincorpo-\nrat[ing]\u201d the books in their instruction. Resp.Br.9. \nWhat matters is that the books must be used, that the \nBoard endorses and promotes their use, and that the \nbooks are in fact used in instruction.  Pet.App.273a \n(\u201cpart of a professional development workshop for \nMCPS staff\u201d); see also Pet.App.277a; Pet.App.511a. \nIndeed, several MCPS teachers are quoted in a brief \nbelow, with one explaining that reading My Rainbow \nto her class was a way of \u201cvalidat[ing]\u201d one student\u2019s \n\u201ctender truths\u201d about gender ideology. J.A.54-56. \nWhen such compelled instruction is taking place, it is \nirrelevant that the books may also be placed \u201con a shelf \nfor students to find on their own\u201d\u2014i.e., what the Board \ncalls \u201cexposure.\u201d See Resp.Br.17.1 \n2. The Board next complains (20 times) that the \nrecord contains insufficient evidence of coercion. But it \n \n1  \nThis is not to say \u201cexposure\u201d could never be enough. Indeed, \nthe Board itself attempts to distinguish forced \u201cexposure to ideas \nthat clash with  * * *  religion\u201d (for which it denies opt-outs) and \nforced \u201cexposure to \u2018images of the Prophet Mohammad\u2019\u201d (for \nwhich it would allow opt-outs). Resp.25 n.7. But perhaps the Mus-\nlim Petitioners themselves should have the final say on whether \nboth aren\u2019t religiously problematic. And even under the Board\u2019s \ncapricious standard, it seems unlikely parents would be entirely \nwithout recourse if their children were intentionally exposed to \npornography, extreme graphic violence, or other such material, \nespecially at a young age. But the Court need not reach this ques-\ntion here, as the Board has gone far beyond exposure to deliberate \nindoctrination. \n\n6 \n \nis undisputed that the parents are compelled by threat \nof criminal fines or the expense of alternative school-\ning\u2014unattainable for most\u2014to place their children \ninto classroom instruction against their religious obli-\ngations.  Thus, as Judge Quattlebaum observed, Peti-\ntioners have easily \u201cmet their burden,\u201d having pro-\nduced \u201cbooks that no one disputes will be used to in-\nstruct their K-5 children\u201d; \u201cdeclarations explaining in \ndetail why the books conflict with their religious be-\nliefs\u201d; and \u201cthe board\u2019s own internal documents\u201d de-\ntailing \nefforts \nto \ndisrupt \nstudents\u2019 \nbeliefs. \nPet.App.62a. \nThe Board whistles past the voluminous evidence \nof ideological instruction. It offers no real response to \nthe teacher guidance discussed above, or even to the \nbooks\u2019 contents. Pet.App.323a (normalizing gender-\nneutral \nbathroom \nuse); \nPet.App.435a-436a \n(\u201cblush[ing] hot\u201d classmate romance); Pet.App.465a, \n(stating gender identity is about \u201clove\u201d and doesn\u2019t \n\u201cneed[ ] to make sense\u201d); Pet.App.458a-461a, 470a \n(teaching that children can choose their own sex); \nPet.App.279a-306a, 390a-428a (romanticizing same-\nsex relationships). These are not mere \u201cretellings\u201d of \nbooks like \u201cRapunzel, Cinderella, and Goldilocks.\u201d \nResp.Br.7. Rather, as the Board\u2019s own principals pro-\ntested, the books have plots that \u201ccenter around sexual \norientation and gender identity.\u201d Pet.App.616a. And \nthey were adopted by the Board to combat the \u201cdomi-\nnance, superiority, and entitlement\u201d of the \u201cdominant \nculture.\u201d Pet.App.517a. \n3. In truth, the Board\u2019s claim of insufficient evi-\ndence is a plea to adopt a more demanding legal stand-\nard\u2014one that finds no purchase in Yoder or anywhere \nelse. \nThe \nchildren \nin \nYoder \nwere never \n\u201cin \n\n7 \n \nfact  * * *  asked to affirm views contrary to their own\u201d \nor \u201cto disavow views  * * *  that their religion es-\npouses.\u201d Resp.Br.32. Rather, the Court found a burden \nbecause the parents were pressured to send their chil-\ndren to school despite their contrary religious obliga-\ntions. So too here\u2014Petitioners\u2019 children are required \nto participate in the challenged instruction and have \nbeen denied an opt-out. That the denial is a deliberate \neffort to pressure Petitioners to put their children in \nan environment where they will be pressured to aban-\ndon their religious beliefs makes this an a fortiori case. \nCf. Yoder, 406 U.S. at 211, 218. \nThe evidence is overwhelming that Petitioners\u2019 \nchildren are \u201ccompelled or pressured to act or believe \ncontrary to their or their parents\u2019 religious views.\u201d \nResp.Br.32. Indeed, the Board ignores its professional \neducators\u2019 own warnings that the storybooks and ac-\ncompanying guidance are \u201cnot appropriate for the in-\ntended age group,\u201d Pet.App.616a, 618a; \u201c[s]tate[ ] as \nfact\u201d what \u201c[s]ome would not agree [is] a fact,\u201d \nPet.App.620a; and are \u201cshaming\u201d toward children who \ndisagree, Pet.App.620a, and \u201cdismissive\u201d of religious \nbeliefs, Pet.App.619a. It is no wonder that parents \nwith contrary religious beliefs feel religiously obli-\ngated to opt their children out of such instruction. \nThe Board responds that, in Yoder, children were \n\u201cnot only\u201d exposed to a hostile environment \u201cbut also\u201d \ntaken \u201caway from their community, physically and \nemotionally, during the crucial and formative adoles-\ncent period of life.\u201d Resp.Br.38-39; Yoder, 406 U.S. at \n211. But so too here: Petitioners\u2019 children are away \nfrom their parents for an entire school day, and at a \nmuch younger and more impressionable age. And con-\n\n8 \n \ntrary to the Board\u2019s arguments, Resp.Br.39, the par-\nents in Yoder were just as \u201cfree to impart their religion \nat home\u201d after school as Petitioners are here. This \nCourt has properly rejected the suggestion that the \npossibility of rebuilding religious faith at home can ex-\ncuse the government\u2019s efforts to disrupt students\u2019 faith \nwhile at school. West Va. State Bd. of Educ. v. Bar-\nnette, 319 U.S. 624, 637, 641-642 (1943); contra id. at \n664 (Frankfurter, J., dissenting) (no restrictions on \nother \u201cchannels  * * *  open to both children and par-\nents\u201d).  \nFinally, nothing in Yoder suggests its burden anal-\nysis applies only when the accommodation sought is \ncompletely skipping the last two years of high school \nas opposed to opting out of discrete \u201celements\u201d of the \ncurriculum. Resp.Br.39-40 (emphasis removed). The \nquestion of the appropriate remedy in Yoder became \nrelevant only on strict scrutiny. Yoder, 406 U.S. at \n235-236. Even then, three Justices described the ac-\ncommodation required as \u201crelatively slight.\u201d Id. at 238 \n(White, J., concurring). Here, even if the scope of the \naccommodation had some bearing on the burden anal-\nysis (it doesn\u2019t), restoring notice and opt-outs to books \nthat were not even in the curriculum until the fall of \n2022\u2014and for which opt-outs existed through the \nspring of 2023\u2014is far more \u201cslight.\u201d2 \n \n2  \nThe \u201cconvincing showing\u201d the Yoder plaintiffs made \u201cthrough \nvoluminous \u2018trial testimony,\u2019\u201d Resp.Br.39 n.11, was a direct ref-\nerence to \u201ctheir alternative mode of continuing informal voca-\ntional education,\u201d Yoder, 406 U.S. at 235. Because opting out of \nthe storybooks does not impede the government\u2019s core interest in \na \u201cself-supporting\u201d and \u201cresponsib[le]\u201d citizenry, no such showing \nis required here. Id. at 234; see also id. at 225-226 & n.14. \n\n9 \n \n4. Rather than engaging Yoder on its own terms, \nRespondents argue that Lyng walked back Yoder\u2019s \nholding. See Resp.Br.20 (quoting Lyng to \u201cexplain[ ]\u201d \nYoder). Lyng can\u2019t bear that weight. For one, Lyng \nturned on the \u201claws in question\u201d being \u201cneutral and \ngenerally applicable without regard to religion.\u201d Trin-\nity Lutheran Church of Columbia v. Comer, 582 U.S. \n449, 460 (2017). To the extent Lyng speaks to what \nconstitutes a burden, it simply reaffirms that the Free \nExercise Clause protects against \u201cindirect coercion or \npenalties on the free exercise of religion, not just out-\nright prohibitions.\u201d Lyng v. Northwest Indian Ceme-\ntery Protective Ass\u2019n, 485 U.S. 439, 450 (1988); see also \nTrinity Lutheran, 582 U.S. at 450-451 (quoting Lyng\u2019s \n\u201cindirect coercion\u201d language); Carson v. Makin, 596 \nU.S. 767, 778 (2022) (same). If requiring elementary-\nage children to participate in prohibited instruction on \nsexuality and gender against their parents\u2019 faith\u2014on \nthreat of truancy or losing access to a free education\u2014\ndoes not constitute at least \u201cindirect coercion,\u201d what \ndoes? Pet.Br.44-45. \nRespondents rely on Lyng\u2019s characterization of \nYoder as involving a statute that \u201cdirectly compel[led]\u201d \naction. Resp.Br.38. But wherever the line lies between \ndirect and indirect coercion, the pressure here is \nhighly analogous to that in Yoder. Here, Parents are \ncompelled to leave their children in religiously prohib-\nited instruction under threat of criminal penalties or \nthe financial burden of sending them to private school \nor homeschooling. Similarly, in Yoder, the parents \nwere compelled by threat of criminal penalties or the \ncost of establishing independent schools, as had been \ndone in other states. See Laycock.Br.20-21. In both \n\n10 \n \ncases, the compulsory education requirement \u201csub-\nstantially interfer[ed] with the religious development \nof the  * * *  child and his integration into the way of \nlife of the [relevant] faith community.\u201d 406 U.S. at 218. \nThis finding, in both cases, is \u201csupport[ed]\u201d by the chil-\ndren\u2019s impressionability, Pet.Br.27-28, and \u201cthe values \nand programs of the modern  * * *  school,\u201d 406 U.S. at \n217-218; Pet.Br.29-33. Regardless of faith tradition, \ncompelled instruction over the parents\u2019 religious obli-\ngations is a free-exercise burden triggering strict scru-\ntiny. \nB. The Board\u2019s no-opt-out policy imposes a \nreligious burden and is not neutral or \ngenerally applicable under Sherbert and \nLukumi. \nApart from Yoder\u2019s substantial interference analy-\nsis, the Board\u2019s actions burden Petitioners\u2019 free-exer-\ncise rights by forcing Petitioners to choose between \nshielding their children from religiously-prohibited in-\nstruction and accessing the public schools. Sherbert v. \nVerner, 374 U.S. 398, 404 (1963) (\u201cforce[d]  * * *  to \nchoose\u201d); Thomas v. Review Bd., 450 U.S. 707, 717 \n(1981) (\u201cput to a choice\u201d); Pet.Br.16-19. Under \nLukumi, this triggers strict scrutiny because the pres-\nsure results from an opt-out policy that isn\u2019t neutral or \ngenerally applicable. Id. at 43-45.3  \n \n3  \nThe Board waves off neutrality and general applicability as \n\u201ca separate inquiry\u201d \u201cnot before the Court.\u201d Resp.Br.43. It made \nthe same argument at the certiorari stage. BIO.26 (\u201cnot even be-\nfore the Court\u201d). But \u201cit was clear from the petition and from pe-\ntitioner[s\u2019] other filings in this Court (and in the courts below)\u201d \nthat Lukumi\u2019s standard was understood as \u201c\u2018fairly included\u2019 \n \n\n11 \n \n1. The Board flunks general applicability because \nit allows opt-outs from inclusivity instruction during \nhealth class while denying opt-outs from analogous \nstory-time instruction, Pet.Br.36, and because it has \nexercised discretion to \u201cdecide which reasons\u201d for opt-\ning out \u201care worthy of solicitude,\u201d Pet.Br.38 (quoting \nFulton v. City of Philadelphia, 593 U.S. 522, 537 \n(2021)). Either triggers strict scrutiny. Ibid. \nCategorical exceptions. \u201cA government policy will \nfail the general applicability requirement if it \u2018prohib-\nits religious conduct while permitting secular conduct \nthat undermines the government\u2019s asserted interests \nin a similar way.\u2019\u201d Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 526 (quoting \nFulton, 593 U.S. at 534). Comparability is \u201cjudged \nagainst\u201d the \u201cgovernment interest that justifies the \nregulation at issue.\u201d Tandon v. Newsom, 593 U.S. 61, \n62 (2021).  \nHere, the Board asserts the same \u201cequity\u201d interest \nto justify both the elementary school storybooks and \nits high school health classes. Pet.Br.36-37. Yet the \n \nwithin the question[ ] presented.\u201d R.A.V. v. City of St. Paul, 505 \nU.S. 377, 381 n.3 (1992); see also Sup. Ct. R. 14.1(a); Pet.29-30 \n(discussing Lukumi); Cert.Reply.Br.9-10 (same). Indeed, the \nCourt typically addresses neutrality and general applicability \nalongside the burden analysis. See, e.g., Kennedy v. Bremerton \nSch. Dist., 597 U.S. 507, 525 (2022) (plaintiff can establish free \nexercise violation \u201cby showing that a government entity has bur-\ndened his sincere religious practice pursuant to a policy that is \nnot \u2018neutral\u2019 or \u2018generally applicable\u2019\u201d); see also Fulton, 593 U.S. \nat 532-533; Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, \n508 U.S. 520, 532, 543 (1993). While some courts have held that \nlack of neutrality and general applicability is itself a burden, see \nLaycock.Br.24-28, the Court need not reach that issue here. \n\n12 \n \nBoard provides notice and secular opt-outs for the \nhealth classes but not the storybooks. Ibid. \nCrucially, the Board never disputes that the same \n\u201cequity\u201d interest underlies its curricular content in \nboth sets of classes. Pet.Br.36-37. Nor could it. The \nvery same \u201cEquity Regulation\u201d that led the Board to \nadopt the storybooks also led to updated \u201cinclusivity\u201d \ninstruction in the \u201cFamily Life and Human Sexuality\u201d \nsegment of health classes. Ibid. There, every student \nfrom pre-K to high school now learns about gender \nidentity, and every student from fourth grade onward \nlearns about sexual orientation. J.A.68-72, 80. Yet opt-\nouts to that gender identity and sexuality instruction \nare allowed only from health classes, not English-Lan-\nguage Arts, where the storybooks teach both begin-\nning in pre-K. That is not general applicability. \nPet.Br.36-38.  \nAbandoning equity, the Board now says its insist-\nence on the storybook instruction is justified by \u201cab-\nsenteeism and administrability.\u201d Resp.Br.46. But for \npurposes of general applicability, the relevant govern-\nment interest is the interest underlying adoption of \nthe inclusivity curriculum. See Fulton, 593 U.S. at 534, \n541-542. As one of the asserted reasons for withdraw-\ning notice and opt-outs, absenteeism is relevant to \nstrict scrutiny. But the \u201cLGBTQ+-inclusive\u201d books \nwere adopted to promote inclusivity, not to combat ab-\nsenteeism. Absenteeism thus plays no role under gen-\neral applicability. \nThe Board\u2019s response also flouts Tandon, claiming \nthere isn\u2019t discrimination in denying religious opt-outs \nfrom the storybooks because it denies all \u201csecular\u201d opt-\nouts. Resp.Br.45-46. But the same was true in Tandon. \nThere, California \u201cadopted a blanket restriction on at-\n\n13 \n \nhome gatherings of all kinds, religious and secular \nalike.\u201d 593 U.S. at 65 (Kagan, J., dissenting). Yet as \nthe Court held, treating everyone equally \u201cpoorly\u201d is \n\u201cno answer\u201d to giving \u201cany comparable secular activity \nmore favorabl[e]\u201d treatment \u201cthan religious exercise.\u201d \nId. at 62 (per curiam); see also CLS.Br.20-21. Allowing \nsecular opt-outs (from health classes) while banning \nall religious and secular opt-outs (from the storybooks) \nundermines the shared \u201cequity\u201d interest and thus ne-\ngates \ngeneral \napplicability. \nPet.Br.37-38; \nLay-\ncock.Br.26-27; U.S.Br.32-33. \nAt bottom, the Board asks the Court to approve its \nown shifting and self-serving \u201ccategories of selection.\u201d \nChurch of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. City of Hialeah, \n508 U.S. 520, 542 (1993). But \u201cthe substance of free \nexercise protections\u201d do not turn \u201con the presence or \nabsence of magic words.\u201d Carson, 596 U.S. at 785. A \ngovernment policy that allows opt-outs from some gen-\nder identity and sexual orientation instruction, but de-\nnies them for others, is not generally applicable.  \nDiscretionary exceptions. The Board\u2019s discretion to \naccommodate religious claimants also triggers strict \nscrutiny. See Fulton, 593 U.S. at 535, 537; Pet.Br.38-\n40. The Board does not dispute that it allowed opt-outs \nfor storybook instruction on a discretionary basis \nthrough March 22, 2023. Pet.Br.38. It also does not \ndispute that it reassured parents that opt-outs would \ncontinue\u2014the day before revoking them. Ibid. It also \ndoes not dispute that this fly-by-night reversal was it-\nself discretionary. Id. at 38-39; Laycock.Br.26-27. And \nit does not dispute that even after revoking notice and \nopt-outs on March 23, it exercised further discretion \nby selectively continuing opt-outs for the remainder of \n\n14 \n \nthe school year if \u201cschools already had granted accom-\nmodation requests.\u201d Pet.Br.39 (quoting Pet.App.608a). \nAll this confirms what triggered strict scrutiny in Ful-\nton: the government actor has discretion but \u201cmade \nclear that [it] has no intention of granting an excep-\ntion\u201d to religious claimants. 593 U.S. at 535 (cleaned \nup).  \nThe Board\u2019s response to Fulton\u2019s discretion analy-\nsis misses the point. It does not matter if the Board \nnever exercised its discretion to \u201cden[y] any opt-out re-\nquests\u201d or never evaluated \u201cthe particular reasons\u201d for \nthe requests \u201cbefore adopting a blanket no-opt-out pol-\nicy.\u201d Resp.Br.46-47. Discretion\u2014the power to make an \nexception\u2014defeats general applicability even where \nits holder \u201chas no intention of granting an exception\u201d \nand \u201chas never granted one.\u201d Fulton, 593 U.S. at 535, \n537; Pet.App.70a (Quattlebaum, J., dissenting) (\u201cvalue \njudgements\u201d not required). Indeed, even now, the \nBoard allows opt-outs for other reasons. Pet.Br.39-40; \nPet.App.672a-674a (opt-outs for \u201cteaching,\u201d \u201creligious \nholidays,\u201d any \u201cnoncurricular activities,\u201d \u201c[e]ven birth-\ndays\u201d and \u201cHalloween and Valentine\u2019s Day\u201d); but see \nPet.Br.10-11 (no opt-out for \u201cblush[ing] hot,\u201d same-sex \nplayground romance on Valentine\u2019s Day in Love, Vio-\nlet). And the Board has retained the \u201cinherently dis-\ncretionary\u201d power to abruptly change course. Lay-\ncock.Br.26-27 (quoting Pet.App.69a (Quattlebaum, J., \ndissenting)). \nThe Board says individual \u201cschools\u201d lack discretion \nto reintroduce opt-outs, Resp.Br.47, but does not dis-\npute that the Board itself has reserved discretion to \nshift course as it pleases. Pet.Br.39-40. Indeed, the \nBoard acknowledges that it unilaterally eliminated \nmost curricular-related religious accommodations \u201cin \n\n15 \n \n2023.\u201d Resp.Br.4 n.1.  And the Board omits that it ap-\nparently made this change in closed session, and in re-\nsponse to \u201ca federal litigation matter.\u201d Memorandum \nfrom Monifa B. McKnight, Superintendent of Schools, \nto Members of the Board of Education, Resolution for \nToday\u2019s \nClosed \nSession \n(July \n20, \n2023), \nhttps://perma.cc/3EVR-CF3D; see also Pet.App.669a-\n675a (revised 2023-2024 religious diversity guide-\nlines).  \n2. The Board\u2019s policy also isn\u2019t neutral. Pet.Br.40-\n43. Conceding that Petitioners requested opt-outs for \nreligious reasons, the Board relies on a single sentence \nfrom an employee declaration to claim that, because \nthere were some non-religious opt-outs, there is no ev-\nidence of religious targeting. Resp.Br.47 (citing \nPet.App.606a). But the Free Exercise Clause prohibits \n\u201creligious gerrymanders,\u201d and they can be shown by \n\u201cadverse impact.\u201d Lukumi, 508 U.S. at 534-535. The \noverwhelming response of religious families protesting \nthe Board\u2019s decision makes that impact plain. \nPet.Br.41-42. And if the Board wasn\u2019t targeting reli-\ngious opt-outs, it had no need to gut the Religious Di-\nversity Guidelines during this case. Resp.Br.4 n.1.  \nThe Board members\u2019 animus-laden accusations are \nanother problem the Board tries to avoid, claiming \nthey are \u201cnothing more than\u201d religion-neutral state-\nments \u201copposing all opt-outs.\u201d Resp.Br.47-48. That \nsquinting-blind claim cannot be squared with the \nboard members\u2019 scoldings, including one accusing a \nMuslim child of \u201cparroting\u201d her parents\u2019 \u201cdogma.\u201d \nPet.App.106a; Em Espey, Parents, students, doctors re-\nact to MCPS lawsuit targeting LGBTQ+ storybooks, \nMoCo360, June 2, 2023, https://perma.cc/5GD9-2YVQ. \nOr another accusing parents asserting \u201creligious \n\n16 \n \nrights\u201d of \u201ctelling [their] kid, \u2018here\u2019s another reason to \nhate another person.\u2019\u201d Pet.App.104a. When \u201c\u2018official \nexpressions of hostility\u2019 to religion accompany laws or \npolicies burdening religious exercise,\u201d those laws or \npolicies \u201care set aside without further inquiry.\u201d Ken-\nnedy, 597 U.S. at 525 n.1 (quoting Masterpiece \nCakeshop, Ltd. v. Colorado C.R. Comm\u2019n, 584 U.S. \n617, 639 (2018)). At a minimum, the \u201cstrictest scru-\ntiny\u201d should follow. Carson, 596 U.S. at 780. \nC. Respondents\u2019 \n\u201ccognizable\u201d \ncoercion \ntheory of burden would eviscerate the \nFree Exercise Clause. \nSherbert\u2019s burden analysis is straightforward: forc-\ning someone to \u201cchoose between following the precepts \nof [their] religion\u201d and accessing a government benefit \nimposes a free-exercise burden. 374 U.S. at 404. Peti-\ntioners\u2019 religious beliefs require them to shield their \nchildren from instruction on sex and gender that vio-\nlates their religious beliefs. By impeding that exercise, \nthe Board has imposed a religious burden.  \nStill, the Board and Fourth Circuit demand more: \nthey say Petitioners or their children must actually be \n\u201ccompel[led]  * * *  to change their religious beliefs or \nconduct\u201d or \u201casked to affirm  * * *  views contrary to \n[their] faith.\u201d Pet.App.34a; Resp.Br.1, 9-10, 32. The \nBoard calls this \u201ccognizable\u201d coercion. Resp.Br.17, 22-\n23, 27, 30. In all but name, this demand reduces the \nFree Exercise Clause to prohibiting only an extreme \nform of direct coercion\u2014just like the \u201ccourt-of-appeals \ndecisions\u201d from where the Board \u201cconfirmed\u201d its \ncramped rule. Resp.Br.28. Embracing this extremism \nwould eviscerate 60 years of precedent, credit disrep-\nutable history, and provide no real limit on public \n\n17 \n \nschools\u2019 compelled instruction over parents\u2019 sincere re-\nligious exercise.  \n1. The Board\u2019s \u201ccognizable\u201d coercion test has no ba-\nsis in any of this Court\u2019s free-exercise decisions. Bur-\ndening the exercise of religion is not limited to direct \ncoercion; rather, religious exercise \u201cmay be infringed \nby the denial of or placing of conditions upon a benefit \nor privilege.\u201d Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 404. Unconstitu-\ntional conditions can take \u201cmany forms,\u201d U.S.Br.13, \nbut the through line is that the religious claimant is \n\u201cforce[d]  * * *  to choose\u201d between the public benefit \nand one\u2019s religion. Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 404, 406; see \nalso, e.g., Fulton, 593 U.S. at 532 (\u201cputting it to the \nchoice\u201d); Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 591 \nU.S. 464, 480 (2020) (\u201cputting the school to a choice\u201d \nand \u201cput[ting] families to a choice\u201d); Trinity Lutheran, \n582 U.S. at 462 (\u201cthe Department\u2019s policy puts Trinity \nLutheran to a choice\u201d); Thomas, 450 U.S. at 716 (\u201ccom-\npelled to choose\u201d). These forced choices \u201cput[ ] substan-\ntial pressure on an adherent to modify his behavior \nand to violate his beliefs.\u201d Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718; \nsee also Pet.Br.43-45.  \nAs Petitioners explained, this burden standard ac-\ncords with Yoder\u2019s \u201csubstantial interference\u201d inquiry \nfor compelled instruction, as well as the original mean-\ning of \u201cprohibit\u201d in the Free Exercise Clause\u2014which \nextends to government actions that \u201chinder[ ]\u201d reli-\ngious practice, see Pet.Br.43-44; see also Fulton, 593 \nU.S. at 567 (Alito, J., concurring in judgment); \nU.S.Br.17-24. Petitioners have satisfied this burden \nstandard. That is, they were put to the choice of either \nsubjecting their children to compelled instruction and \nabandoning their religious beliefs or forgoing public \n\n18 \n \neducation. \nPet.Br.28-33, \n43-44; Pet.App.61a-62a; \nU.S.Br.24-26. \nThe Board cannot reasonably argue that Petition-\ners failed to show substantial pressure. So instead, the \nBoard grafts its \u201ccognizable\u201d coercion test onto the \nCourt\u2019s precedent. The Board\u2019s new rule is wrong. \nWhile \u201coutright prohibitions\u201d on religious exercise are \nobviously sufficient to show a free-exercise burden, \nthat does not make them necessary. Carson, 596 U.S. \nat 778. Rather, a free-exercise burden is also shown \nwhen government action \u201coperate[s], whatever [its] \npurpose,  * * *  to inhibit or deter the exercise of First \nAmendment freedoms.\u201d Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 405 (em-\nphasis added); Espinoza, 591 U.S. at 478 (accord); see \nalso Carson, 596 U.S. at 789 (\u201cRegardless of how the \nbenefit and restriction are described, the program op-\nerates to identify and exclude otherwise eligible \nschools on the basis of their religious exercise.\u201d). \nTake Fulton, which the Board concedes involved a \n\u201cplain\u201d burden. Resp.Br.44. There, Catholic Social Ser-\nvices (\u201cCSS\u201d) wanted an opt-out from certifying same-\nsex couples as foster parents. 593 U.S. at 530-531. \nPhiladelphia refused to opt CSS out of that certifica-\ntion requirement, claiming all CSS was being asked to \ndo was \u201csatisfy the statutory criteria,\u201d not \u201cendorse[ ]\u201d \nsame-sex relationships. id. at 532. But this put CSS \n\u201cto the choice of curtailing its mission or approving re-\nlationships inconsistent with its beliefs,\u201d thereby trig-\ngering the Free Exercise Clause. Ibid.; see also \nU.S.Br.21-24 (other examples). So too here. Pet.Br.43-\n45.  \nThe Board is also wrong to claim that indirect co-\nercion \u201cwould\u201d only exist if the Board \u201cadopted a rule \nthat parents cannot send their children to MCPS \n\n19 \n \nschools if they provide religious education to their chil-\ndren that conflicts with lessons that MCPS provides.\u201d \nResp.Br.41. Undoubtedly, that would be direct coer-\ncion, but for indirect coercion \u201c[a] total religious bar is \nnot required.\u201d Laycock.Br.18-22. \nNor does the Board\u2019s \u201ccognizable\u201d coercion test find \nany help in Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. 693 (1986). The \nBoard claims that Bowen rejects a child\u2019s \u201cinteraction\u201d \nwith the government being \u201ca burden on a parent\u2019s \nfree exercise.\u201d Resp.Br.37. To the contrary, five jus-\ntices in Bowen agreed it would be a burden on religious \nparents to provide their child\u2019s Social Security number \nas a condition of receiving benefits. See U.S.Br.22 n.5. \nSo too here, it is a burden on Petitioners to hand their \nchildren over for compelled instruction as the price of \npublic education. Pet.Br.16-19.  \nFinally, the Board argues that no burden exists be-\ncause the coercion here is not the same as what is re-\nquired to show an establishment of religion. \nResp.Br.21, 24. But free-exercise analysis focuses on \ngovernment hindrance of \u201csincerely motivated reli-\ngious exercise,\u201d not what satisfies the \u201challmarks of re-\nligious establishments.\u201d See Kennedy, 597 U.S. at 525, \n537. Here, Petitioners are not trying to invalidate a \ncurriculum as beyond the school\u2019s power to adopt (as \nin an Establishment Clause case). Rather, they are \ntrying to restore their notice and opt-out rights to \nguard against the burden of interference with their re-\nligious instruction.  \n2. With no basis in precedent, the Board looks to \nroot \u201ccognizable\u201d coercion in \u201chistory and tradition,\u201d \nciting a handful of cases upholding schools\u2019 authority \nto compel instruction. Resp.Br.42. Its lead example, \n\n20 \n \nDonahoe v. Richards, upheld a Catholic child\u2019s expul-\nsion for refusing to read the King James Version of the \nBible, citing the \u201c[l]arge masses of foreign population \n[that] are among us, weak in the midst of our \nstrength.\u201d 38 Me. 379, 413 (1854). The court concluded \nsuch foreigners could become \u201ccitizens in fact as well \nas in name\u201d only by forcing them to \u201cimbibe the liberal \nspirit of our laws and institutions.\u201d Ibid. Another of \nthe Board\u2019s cases that \u201cfollowed suit,\u201d Resp.Br.43, ap-\npealed to public school authority to uphold racially \nsegregated schools. See Andrews v. Webber, 8 N.E. \n708, 712-713 (Ind. 1886) (citing, inter alia, Roberts v. \nCity of Boston, 59 Mass. 198, 209 (1849)). But history \nand tradition are meant to illuminate\u2014not violate\u2014\nthe Free Exercise Clause\u2019s \u201cbasic principle[s].\u201d See Es-\npinoza, 591 U.S. at 475, 480-482. \nIn contrast, providing opt-outs to enable parental \ncontrol is part of the \u201cenduring American tradition\u201d to \nwhich Pierce, Meyer, and Yoder appealed. See Wal-\nton.Br.6-25; Laycock.Br.9-28. Indeed, sexuality and \ngender identity education \u201chave no historical pedi-\ngree,\u201d have always been accompanied by parental con-\ntrol, and to this day\u2014even beyond the ubiquitous re-\nquirement for parental approval for student participa-\ntion in sexuality education\u2014many states provide \nbroad, cross-curricula opt-outs for any potentially ob-\njectionable instruction. See AFL.Br.5-28; see also \nStates.Br.20-21. Here, by stripping Petitioners of \nthose guarantees, the Board upends this longstanding \ntradition. Pet.Br.31-33. This disruption \u201ccompound[s]\u201d \nPetitioners\u2019 burden, Sherbert, 374 U.S. at 406, and \nmakes this case \u201cparticularly straightforward,\u201d \nU.S.Br.26. \n\n21 \n \n3. Finally, the Board\u2019s reliance on Justice Jackson \nin McCollum v. Board of Education to argue that \n\u201c[c]rediting petitioners burden theory\u201d would \u201cleave \npublic education in shreds,\u201d Resp.Br.2, is based on a \nmisreading of the case. Justice Jackson warned \nagainst schools \u201csift[ing] out of their teaching every-\nthing inconsistent with [a religious claimant\u2019s] doc-\ntrines\u201d\u2014i.e., curricular challenges\u2014not against up-\nholding religious opt-outs. McCollum v. Board of \nEduc., 333 U.S. 203, 235 (1948) (Jackson, J., concur-\nring); see also Resp.Br.2, 29 (citing McCollum). \nThe Board\u2019s conflation has its roots in Gobitis. See \nalso Pet.Br.45-46. And under the Board\u2019s \u201ccognizable\u201d \ncoercion standard, it is the Free Exercise Clause that \nwould be left in \u201cshreds.\u201d In protecting its power to the \nnth degree, the Board ignores its own extremism. Un-\nder its proposed standard, \u201ccoercion\u201d would not be \n\u201ccognizable\u201d for compelling instruction in pornogra-\nphy\u2014so long as the Board is not muzzling the parents \nat home too. Perhaps that\u2019s why the Board doesn\u2019t dis-\npute that accepting its arguments would grant public \nschools the power to impose non-binary pronouns, \nbooks with nudity, furries, or BDSM attire, \u201cporn lit-\neracy\u201d classes, and lessons on \u201csex play with friends.\u201d \nPet.Br.34-35. Indeed, the lower-court case the Board \ncites twice for its \u201ccognizable\u201d coercion rule\u2014Parker v. \nHurley (Resp.Br.23, 33)\u2014not only confined the Free \nExercise Clause to \u201cdirect coercion,\u201d 514 F.3d 87, 105 \n(1st Cir. 2008), but also built on the facts of Brown v. \nHot, Sexy and Safer Prods., Inc., 68 F.3d 525, 529 (1st \nCir. 1995). There, parents sued over a mandatory \nschool assembly that \u201chad a male minor lick an over-\nsized condom\u201d and \u201cencouraged a male minor to dis-\nplay his \u2018orgasm face\u2019  * * *  for the camera.\u201d 68 F.3d \n\n22 \n \nat 529. The Board views this as just \u201cpart of the com-\npromise\u201d of attending public schools. C.A. Oral Arg. \n24:57-26:15. Once in school, religious parents are \u201cnot \nentitled to a federal judicial remedy,\u201d only a political \none. Parker, 514 F.3d at 107 (citing Employment Div. \nv. Smith, 494 U.S. 872, 890 (1990)). The Free Exercise \nClause says otherwise.  \nII. The Board has no strict scrutiny defense. \nThe Board urges this Court not to apply strict scru-\ntiny. Resp.Br.49-50. The Court should reject this gam-\nbit, as it has before.  \nPhiladelphia tried a similar maneuver in Fulton \n(also in a preliminary injunction posture). In that case, \nneither the Third Circuit nor the district court reached \nstrict scrutiny in assessing CSS\u2019s free-exercise claims. \nFulton v. City of Philadelphia, 922 F.3d 140, 156, 159 \n(3d Cir. 2019); Fulton v. City of Philadelphia, 320 \nF.Supp.3d 661, 690 (E.D. Pa. 2018) (\u201cstrict scrutiny is \ninapplicable in this case\u201d). Nor was strict scrutiny \nmentioned in the question presented. Pet. at i, Fulton, \n593 U.S. 522 (No. 19-123). Moreover, as here, Phila-\ndelphia\u2019s merits brief argued against applying \u201cstrict \nscrutiny in the context presented\u201d and devoted only a \nparagraph to its application. Phila.Br. at 47, Fulton, \n593 U.S. 522 (No. 19-123). Nevertheless, after holding \nthat CSS had evidence sufficient to show the Free Ex-\nercise Clause applied, the Court applied strict scrutiny \nrather than remand. See Fulton, 593 U.S. at 541.  \nEven more recently, Carson applied strict scrutiny \nwhen the lower courts had not. The First Circuit was \n\u201cnot persuaded\u201d to apply it, Carson v. Makin, 979 F.3d \n21, 41 (1st Cir. 2020), while the district court didn\u2019t \neven mention it, Carson v. Makin, 401 F.Supp.3d 207 \n\n23 \n \n(D. Me. 2019). Nor did the question presented. Pet. at \ni, Carson, 596 U.S. 767 (No. 20-1088). Nevertheless, \nafter finding the Free Exercise Clause triggered, this \nCourt analyzed strict scrutiny in the first instance, ra-\nther than remand. Carson, 596 U.S. 767. \nAnalyzing strict scrutiny is even more appropriate \nhere. Below, the Board provided lengthy reasons as to \nwhy its withdrawal of notice and opt-outs \u201csatisfies \nstrict scrutiny.\u201d Def.Opp.Prelim.Inj.25-27, No. 8:23-cv-\n1380 (D. Md. July 12, 2023), ECF No. 42; see also \nResp.C.A.Br.16-17, 49-55. That is why the dissent be-\nlow reached the issue. Pet.App.71a-73a.  \nThe Board\u2019s plea for remand is an attempt to com-\npensate for its failure to carry its burden. See \nPet.Br.47-52. As to administrability, Resp.Br.49, the \nBoard ignores its long history of accommodating opt-\nouts. In the IDEA context alone, the Board accommo-\ndates about \u201cone out of every eight students.\u201d Mem-\nbers.Congress.Br.18-19. What is more, the Board \nhad\u2014and used\u2014its opportunity to provide evidence to \nsupport its defense. See Pet.App.597a (Hazel Declara-\ntion). With that opportunity, the Board identified \u201cone \ninstance\u201d of \u201cdozens of students\u201d seeking opt-outs. \nPet.Br.48 (quoting Pet.App.607a). There is no expla-\nnation as to why that alone\u2014in a school district with \nover 160,000 students, Pet.App.77a\u2014triggers an in-\nterest of the highest order. Cf. McCullen v. Coakley, \n573 U.S. 464, 493 (2014). \nInstead, the Board closes with its \u201cinterest in an \nenvironment \u2018conducive to learning for all students,\u2019\u201d \nResp.Br.49 (quoting Pet.App.607a-608a). That\u2019s the \ntell. Consulting the quoted passage confirms that what \nthe Board\u2019s \u201cconducive to learning\u201d interest really \n\n24 \n \nmeans is avoiding the perceived \u201csocial stigma and iso-\nlation\u201d that it believes will follow from opt-outs. \nPet.App.607a-608a. The Board admitted, however, \nthat there is \u201cnothing in the record\u201d to suggest that \nopt-outs enable bullying or harassment. J.A.50. Nor \nhas the Board come forward with any evidence that \nopt-outs from the storybooks resulted in \u201cstigma,\u201d \nwhether the opt-out was for religion, IDEA, or any \nother reason.  \nPreliminary injunctions ought to be entered before \nrelief \u201cmight well be useless.\u201d Doran v. Salem Inn, \nInc., 422 U.S. 922, 932 (1975). After two years of no \nopt-outs, it is past time for Petitioners to have their \nrights protected. \nCONCLUSION \nThe decision below should be reversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \nERIC S.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of the case remains stable in its core components, but this period of internal reasoning has sharpened my focus on the most critical variable for the immediate future of the case: the certiorari decision.\n\n*   **Stable Core Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The petitioners' central argument, rooted in *Wisconsin v. Yoder* and the Free Exercise Clause, remains the foundation of my model. This theory was recently strengthened by the Lewin amicus brief, which provided historical context and framed accommodation as a \"constitutional mandate.\"\n*   **Stable Sub-Theory (The *Groff* Analogy):** The Lewin brief's analogy to the recent, unanimous statutory accommodation ruling in *Groff v. DeJoy* remains a key component of the petitioners' forward-looking strategy. It suggests a potential doctrinal shift that could favor a more robust interpretation of constitutional accommodation.\n*   **Stable Core Counter-Theory (The Coercion Threshold):** The respondents' primary defense\u2014that \"mere exposure\" to ideas does not constitute a legally cognizable \"burden\" on religious exercise\u2014remains the main counterpoint in my model.\n*   **Stable Strategic Analysis (The \"No Burden\" Firewall):** The respondents' strategy of defeating the case at the \"burden\" stage, thereby avoiding any analysis of accommodation under *Yoder* or *Groff*, is still the most likely defensive posture.\n*   **Stable Understanding of the *Smith* Hurdle:** My model continues to incorporate the petitioners' three-pronged strategy for navigating *Employment Division v. Smith*: arguing it should be overruled, arguing *Yoder* creates a standalone exception, or arguing this case fits the \"hybrid rights\" exception.\n*   **Sharpened Central Uncertainty (The Circuit Split Dispute):** My primary uncertainty is now more focused and urgent. The internal review confirmed that the Lewin amicus brief, while powerful on the merits, did **not** rebut the respondents' claim of a **unanimous circuit court consensus** (*Mozert*, *Parker*, *Leebaert*) against the petitioners' position. This \"no circuit split\" argument remains the single greatest obstacle to the Court granting certiorari. My analysis has elevated this from a point of uncertainty to the **linchpin variable** for the cert stage. The next piece of evidence must address this directly, and I now hypothesize that the petitioners' Reply Brief is the most likely document to contain the necessary counter-argument.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal reasoning, provides powerful validation for my evolving design methodology. It demonstrates the successful application of recently refined heuristics and further tunes my information-gathering strategy.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** This remains a core principle, ensuring I build out both sides of the legal argument.\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Uncertainty-Driven Search):** This principle is actively guiding my process. The `THINK` action was a direct result of identifying my greatest uncertainty (the circuit split) and formulating a plan to resolve it.\n*   **Validated & Refined Heuristic (The \"Critical Premise Validation Loop\"):** This observation represents the first successful execution of the loop's new \"iteration\" principle.\n    1.  **Linchpin Identified:** The loop correctly flagged the \"unanimous circuit consensus\" claim as the critical premise for the respondents' cert-stage argument.\n    2.  **Hypothesis Formulated:** The hypothesis that this claim is the key obstacle remains my focus.\n    3.  **Targeted Investigation & Iteration:** The first investigation (Lewin amicus brief) yielded valuable but orthogonal information. The loop's \"iteration\" principle correctly dictated that I must *persist* and launch a *new* investigation targeting the same unresolved linchpin. This prevents the model from being distracted by interesting but non-critical information.\n*   **Refined Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** My previous sequence of **Petition -> Opposition -> Merits & Amicus Briefs** has been made more precise. The `THINK` action has led me to insert a crucial, targeted step. The refined sequence is now: **Petition -> Opposition -> Reply Brief -> Amicus Briefs**. The Reply Brief is now prioritized as the most efficient source for finding direct rebuttals to claims made in the Opposition, especially critical claims like \"no circuit split.\" This is a move from a generic sequence to a responsive, tactical one.\n*   **Stable Heuristics:** The \"Question Behind the Question,\" \"No Circuit Split\" Veto, and \"Defensive Doctrinal Firewalls\" remain stable and effective analytical tools.\n*   **Stable New Heuristics (Historical Pedigree & Analogical Leap):** The value of assessing an argument's historical lineage (like Lewin's connection to *Yoder*) and looking for creative analogies to recent rulings (like the *Groff* connection) are now integrated into my analytical framework. This `THINK` step confirmed their value by summarizing their impact on the task model."

          "task_beliefs": "The acquisition of the Petitioners' Reply Brief has dramatically clarified their legal strategy and significantly strengthened their position within my model. My confidence in a prediction favoring the petitioners has increased, as they have introduced a powerful new line of argument that circumvents their biggest previously-identified obstacle.\n\n*   **Stable Core Theory (Constitutional Accommodation):** The petitioners' argument under *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, centered on the right of parents to direct the religious upbringing of their children, remains a primary pillar of their case. The Reply Brief reinforces this by framing the issue as \"compelled instruction\" designed to \"disrupt\" faith, directly countering the respondents' \"mere exposure\" characterization and analogizing the pressure of compulsory schooling to the pressure found unconstitutional in *Yoder*.\n*   **New & Potent Sub-Theory (Lack of Neutrality and General Applicability):** This is the most significant development. The Reply Brief introduces a robust and well-supported argument that the school board's no-opt-out policy is neither neutral nor generally applicable, and therefore must face strict scrutiny under *Church of Lukumi Babalu Aye, Inc. v. Hialeah*.\n    *   **The \"Health Class\" Comparator:** The linchpin of this new theory is the fact that the school board *does* permit opt-outs for similar \"inclusivity\" instruction on gender and sexuality in its \"Family Life and Human Sexuality\" health curriculum. The petitioners argue that since both curricula are justified by the same \"equity\" interest, providing exemptions for one but not the other constitutes a failure of general applicability under the logic of *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* and *Tandon v. Newsom*.\n    *   **Procedural Signal:** The brief notes that the respondents argued this point was \"not before the Court\" at the certiorari stage, and the Court's decision to grant the case anyway suggests an interest in this very line of reasoning.\n*   **Refined Understanding of the Circuit Split Dispute:** My previous analysis identified the respondents' claim of a \"unanimous circuit court consensus\" (*Mozert*, *Parker*) as the greatest threat to the petitioners' case. The Reply Brief reveals a sophisticated counter-strategy. Instead of trying to find a conflicting circuit decision, the petitioners argue that the Supreme Court's own recent Free Exercise jurisprudence (*Fulton*, *Tandon*, *Kennedy v. Bremerton*) has effectively superseded that older consensus. They are arguing that the Fourth Circuit's ruling creates a conflict not with a sister circuit, but with the Supreme Court's current doctrinal trajectory. This transforms the central uncertainty from \"is there a circuit split?\" to \"will the Court agree that its recent rulings have changed the legal landscape, making the old cases distinguishable?\"\n*   **Sharpened View of the Core Conflict:** The Reply Brief confirms the central battleground is the definition of a \"burden.\" It aggressively attacks the respondents' \"cognizable coercion\" test as a \"fantasy version of the law\" and a \"strawman,\" while simultaneously providing the *Lukumi* argument as a complete bypass. This two-pronged attack\u2014redefining the burden under *Yoder* while also making the burden debate irrelevant under *Lukumi*\u2014is a formidable strategy.\n*   **Stable Sub-Theory (The *Groff* Analogy):** While not the focus of the Reply Brief, the underlying theme of robust accommodation for religion, recently affirmed in *Groff*, continues to provide favorable context for the petitioners' arguments.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides powerful validation for my refined information-gathering strategy and has led to the development of a new, more nuanced analytical heuristic for assessing cert-worthiness and legal strategy.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated & Refined Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** The decision to prioritize the Reply Brief has been proven exceptionally effective. My refined sequence of **Petition -> Opposition -> Reply Brief -> Amicus Briefs** is now a core principle. The Reply Brief acted as a \"keystone,\" revealing the petitioners' direct rebuttal and strategic pivot, which would have been impossible to fully grasp from the Petition or amicus briefs alone. It is the most efficient source for understanding how a petitioner will counter the respondent's core defensive theory.\n*   **New Heuristic (The \"Doctrinal Trajectory Conflict\"):** I have formalized a new principle for evaluating cases. When confronted with a \"no circuit split\" argument, I must now assess not only for direct inter-circuit conflicts but also for \"Doctrinal Trajectory Conflicts.\" This involves analyzing whether a petitioner is arguing that recent Supreme Court precedents have rendered an older, established circuit consensus obsolete or distinguishable. This is a distinct and potent basis for Supreme Court review and reversal, and I will now actively look for it.\n*   **Refined Heuristic (\"Defensive Doctrinal Firewalls\"):** I have identified a common counter-move to a defensive firewall. When one party erects a high barrier to entry (e.g., the respondents' \"no cognizable burden\" firewall), the opposing party may not attack it head-on, but instead develop a \"bypass argument\" that makes the firewall irrelevant. The petitioners' use of the *Lukumi* (neutrality/general applicability) argument is a perfect example of this bypass tactic, as it allows them to trigger strict scrutiny without winning the direct fight over the definition of \"burden.\" I will now look for these bypass arguments in reply briefs.\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristics:**\n    *   **Uncertainty-Driven Search:** Identifying the circuit split as my key uncertainty and targeting the Reply Brief to resolve it was the correct and most efficient path.\n    *   **Critical Premise Validation Loop:** The loop successfully guided me to persist in investigating the \"unanimous circuit consensus\" premise, and the Reply Brief provided the crucial iteration that resolved the uncertainty by revealing the petitioners' nuanced counter-strategy.\n    *   **Adversarial Model Balancing:** This observation allowed me to balance my model by incorporating the petitioners' direct response to the respondents' arguments.\n*   **Stable Heuristics:** The \"Question Behind the Question,\" \"Historical Pedigree,\" and \"Analogical Leap\" heuristics remain stable. The petitioners' use of *Fulton* and *Tandon* as comparators for their general applicability argument is a classic and effective use of the \"Analogical Leap.\""

The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s straightforward application of this \nCourt\u2019s precedent to the limited evidence petitioners of-\nfered in support of their motion for preliminary relief \ndoes not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention.   \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), Mary-\nland\u2019s largest school district, serves more than 160,000 \nstudents.  Every day, these students read and discuss \nbooks as part of MCPS\u2019s language-arts curriculum.  \nThese reading materials have not always reflected the \ndiversity of the community MCPS serves.  In recent \nyears, the school district has worked to change that by \nincorporating new books to better represent MCPS stu-\ndents and families.  These books now include characters, \nfamilies, and historical figures from a range of cultural, \nracial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.  \nAs part of this effort, at the start of the 2022-2023 \nschool year, MCPS approved a handful of storybooks \nfeaturing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer \ncharacters for use in the language-arts curriculum, \nalongside the many books already in the curriculum that \nfeature heterosexual characters in traditional gender \nroles.  Like all other books in the language-arts curricu-\nlum, these storybooks impart critical reading skills \nthrough engaging, age-appropriate stories.  MCPS ad-\nheres to a careful, public, participatory selection process \nto ensure those criteria are met.  That process, followed \nhere, welcomes and incorporates parent feedback.   \n\n2 \n \n \nFrom the beginning, MCPS\u2019s goal has been for stu-\ndents to engage with these storybooks as they engage \nwith any other book in the language-arts curriculum.  \nThe storybooks are not used in any lessons related to \ngender and sexuality.  Nor is any student asked or ex-\npected to change his or her views about his or her own, \nor any other student\u2019s, sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  Instead, the books are made available for indi-\nvidual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educa-\ntional activities designed to foster and enhance literacy \nskills. \nPetitioners include three sets of parents who asked \nMCPS to notify them, excuse their children from class, \nand arrange alternate lessons whenever the storybooks \nare read.  After MCPS announced in March 2023 that it \nwould not permit any parents to opt their children out of \nlanguage-arts instruction involving the storybooks, for \nany reason, petitioners sued.  Petitioners also moved for \na preliminary injunction requiring notice and opt outs, \narguing that their children\u2019s \u201cexposure\u201d to the story-\nbooks \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a burden\u201d \non their right to freely exercise their religion.  \nPet.App.37a.  The district court denied the motion. \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\ntioners were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nbased on the \u201cscant record\u201d before it.  Pet.App.9a.  Ap-\nplying a standard drawn straight from this Court\u2019s free-\nexercise precedent, and in line with every relevant court \nof appeals decision, the Fourth Circuit explained that a \ncognizable burden on religious exercise requires coer-\ncion, direct or indirect, to believe or act contrary to one\u2019s \nreligious views.  Petitioners failed to demonstrate a like-\nlihood of success on their free-exercise claim, as they of-\nfered \u201cno evidence\u201d of such coercion.  Pet.App.34a.  \n\n3 \n \n \nSpecifically, petitioners advanced no evidence that \nMCPS pressured their children to affirm or disavow par-\nticular views, compelled their children to act in violation \nof their religious beliefs, influenced what petitioners \ncould teach their own children, or denied petitioners ac-\ncess to public benefits.  Pet.App.34a-48a.  This \u201cabsence \nof proof\u201d doomed petitioners\u2019 request for emergency re-\nlief.   \nThere is no circuit split on this issue.  Every single \ncourt of appeals that has considered the question has \nheld that mere exposure to controversial issues in a pub-\nlic-school curriculum does not burden the free religious \nexercise of parents or students.  Nor is there any conflict \nbetween the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding and this Court\u2019s \nfree-exercise decisions, which the Fourth Circuit faith-\nfully applied and petitioners misconstrue.  And there is \nno pressing question raised by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s con-\nclusion in a preliminary-injunction posture that petition-\ners\u2019 free-exercise claim was not likely to succeed absent \nany evidence of coercion that could constitute a burden \non religious free exercise.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, parents who can demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess in showing religious coercion in a public school \nthat does not survive scrutiny may obtain preliminary \nrelief.  Parents who cannot make that showing, but who \ncan plausibly allege facts suggesting such unjustified co-\nercion, will proceed to discovery.  And if the facts bear \nout those allegations, they will obtain permanent relief.  \nThere is no pressing question here. \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n4 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Storybooks \nAt the start of the 2022-2023 school year, MCPS in-\ntroduced into its pre-K through twelfth grade language-\narts curriculum several storybooks featuring lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer characters.  \nPet.App.603a-604a.  The storybooks were added as part \nof MCPS\u2019s commitment to \u201cprovid[ing] a culturally re-\nsponsive \u2026 curriculum that promotes equity, respect, \nand civility.\u201d  Pet.App.589a.  MCPS believes that \u201c[r]ep-\nresentation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a \nfully inclusive environment for all students\u201d and \u201csup-\nports a student\u2019s ability to empathize, connect, and col-\nlaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for \nall.\u201d  Pet.App.603a.  The language-arts curriculum there-\nfore seeks to ensure that students can \u201c[s]elect[] from a \nrange of diverse texts to understand and appreciate mul-\ntiple perspectives.\u201d  Pet.App.599a.  As part of this effort, \nMCPS had previously made similar efforts to update the \nlanguage-arts curriculum with books featuring people \nand characters from different backgrounds.  Some exam-\nples include the March trilogy, which recounts the life of \ncivil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, and The Leav-\ners, which tells the story of an Asian-American immi-\ngrant family.  Pet.App.602a-603a.  In a similar vein, \nMCPS updated its social-studies curriculum with new in-\nstructional materials about local history.  Id. \nThe storybooks were approved for instructional use \npursuant to MCPS\u2019s written policy for selecting new in-\nstructional materials.  Pet.App.600a-601a, 603a-604a; \nCAJA513-514.  Under that policy, MCPS seeks to ensure \nthat the materials are \u201cage/grade appropriate[],\u201d \u201csup-\nport \u2026 student achievement toward MCPS curriculum \nstandards,\u201d and are \u201crelevant to and reflective of the \n\n5 \n \n \nmulticultural \nsociety \nand \nglobal \ncommunity.\u201d  \nPet.App.600a-601a; CAJA513-514, 521, 523.  Before se-\nlecting the storybooks, a committee of six reading and \ninstructional specialists participated in multiple rounds \nof evaluations to determine that each book would be a \nsuitable addition to the curriculum based on these crite-\nria.  CAJA513; see also Pet.App.603a-604a.  This process \nincluded an opportunity for parents to review the story-\nbooks and provide feedback, and all such feedback was \nconsidered before any storybook was approved.  \nPet.App.601a. \nThe storybooks tell everyday tales of characters \nwho experience adventure, confront new emotions, and \nstruggle to make themselves heard.  They include a \nstory about a family attending a Pride parade, a niece \nmeeting her uncle\u2019s husband-to-be, a prince falling in \nlove with a knight as they battle a dragon in a mythical \nkingdom, a girl feeling nervous about giving a valentine \nto her crush, and a transgender boy sharing his gender \nidentity with his family.  Pet.App.254a-271a, 279a-306a, \n390a-428a, 429a-447a, 448a-482a.  These are archetypal \nstories that touch on the same themes introduced to chil-\ndren in such classic books as Snow White, Cinderella, \nand Peter Pan.  In addition to helping students explore \nsentence structure, word choice, and style, the story-\nbooks support students\u2019 ability to empathize, connect, \nand collaborate with peers and encourage respect for all.  \nPet.App.603a, 605a-606a.   \nThe storybooks are, moreover, \u201ca small subset of \nmany books used in the MCPS [language-arts] curricu-\nlum.\u201d  Pet.App.132a.  Teachers are expected to fold them \ninto the curriculum as they would any other book:  They \ncan put the storybooks on shelves for students to find \nthemselves, recommend a particular storybook to a \n\n6 \n \n \nstudent who would enjoy it, read the storybooks aloud, \nor offer them as an option for reading groups.  \nPet.App.604a-605a. \n \nMCPS made clear to teachers that using the story-\nbooks involves no instruction on sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  Pet.App.605a, 636a-641a.  Some chal-\nlenged books simply include LGBTQ characters.  Others \nhighlight the importance of kindness to others.  None \ntakes a side in any religious or scientific debate sur-\nrounding gender or sexuality.  And teachers are not per-\nmitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular \nviewpoint.  Indeed, a guidance document for teachers \nstates that \u201c[n]o child who does not agree with or under-\nstand another student\u2019s gender, expression, or their sex-\nual identity is asked to change how they feel about it.\u201d  \nPet.App.640a.  MCPS prepared teachers to use the sto-\nrybooks by offering a professional-development session \nas well as sample responses to potential student ques-\ntions; these optional \u201csuggested responses focus[ed] on \ntolerance, empathy, and respect for different views.\u201d  \nPet.App.89a-95a.1  \nB. The No-Opt-Out Policy \nAfter the storybooks were introduced, some parents \nrequested that their children be excused from class \nwhen \nthe \nstorybooks \nwere \nread \nor \ndiscussed.  \nPet.App.606a.  Some opt-out requests were religion-\nbased and others were not.  Some parents opposed a \n \n1 Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, this guidance did not \u201cdi-\nrect[] teachers to frame disagreement with\u201d the storybooks \u201cas \n\u2018hurtful.\u2019\u201d  Pet.13.  The guidance instead suggested that if a student \ndescribes another person as \u201cweird,\u201d a teacher could respond, \u201cThat \ncomment is hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk about \npeople\u2019s identities.\u201d  Pet.App.94a. \n\n7 \n \n \nperceived effort to teach students about sex or gender \nidentity or believed the materials were age-inappropri-\nate.  Id. \nAt first, teachers and principals sought to accommo-\ndate these requests by excusing students when the \nbooks were read in class.  Pet.App.606a-607a.  The grow-\ning number of opt-out requests, however, gave rise to \nthree related concerns: high student absenteeism, the in-\nfeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms \nand schools, and the risk of exposing students who be-\nlieve the storybooks represent them and their families \nto social stigma and isolation.  Pet.App.96a-99a, 606a-\n608a.  These consequences would defeat MCPS\u2019s \u201cefforts \nto ensure a classroom environment that is safe and con-\nducive to learning for all students\u201d and risk putting \nMCPS out of compliance with nondiscrimination laws.  \nPet.App.98a-99a, 607a-608a. \nMCPS therefore determined that permitting opt-\nouts was not feasible or consistent with its curricular \ngoals.  Pet.App.608a.  It announced in March 2023 that \nno opt-outs from instruction using the storybooks would \nbe granted \u201cfor any reason.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \nIn May 2023, petitioners sued the Montgomery \nCounty Board of Education, its members, and the Super-\nintendent of Schools, asserting violations of the federal \nFree Exercise, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses \nand a violation of Maryland law.  Pet.App.107a-108a.  Pe-\ntitioners then moved for a preliminary injunction on \ntheir free-exercise and due-process claims, seeking to \nrequire MCPS to provide them notice and opt-out oppor-\ntunities whenever the storybooks are read or discussed.  \nPet.App.76a-77a.  In July 2023, petitioners amended \ntheir \ncomplaint \nto \nadd \nplaintiff \nKids \nFirst.  \n\n8 \n \n \nPet.App.162a-163a.  The district court denied the pre-\nliminary-injunction motion in August 2023.  The Fourth \nCircuit denied petitioners\u2019 motion for an injunction \npending appeal and, in May 2024, affirmed the denial of \na preliminary injunction. \nIn an opinion written by Judge Agee and joined by \nJudge Benjamin, the court of appeals agreed with the \ndistrict court that petitioners had not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits given their \u201cbroad \nclaims, the very high burden required to obtain a prelim-\ninary injunction, and the scant record before [it].\u201d  \nPet.App.9a.  The court recognized that the Free Exer-\ncise Clause protects against government action that di-\nrectly or indirectly compels religious belief or threatens \nthe ability to act in accordance with one\u2019s faith.  \nPet.App.24a-25a.  The court thus explained that, \u201cto \nshow a cognizable burden\u201d on religious exercise, peti-\ntioners were required to \u201cshow that the absence of an \nopt-out opportunity coerces them or their children to be-\nlieve or act contrary to their religious views.\u201d  \nPet.App.31a.  That coercion could be \u201cdirect or indirect.\u201d  \nId. \nApplying those familiar principles, the Fourth Cir-\ncuit rejected petitioners\u2019 theory that \u201cthe lack of an \nacross-the-board notice and an opt-out opportunity re-\nlating to the Storybooks, in and of itself, coerces them \nand their children in the free exercise of their religion.\u201d  \nPet.App.33a-34a.  The court held that petitioners put \nforward \u201cno evidence\u201d that the no-opt-out policy com-\npelled them or their children \u201cto change their religious \nbeliefs or conduct, either at school or elsewhere\u201d or \u201caf-\nfect[ed] \nwhat \nthey \nteach \ntheir \nown \nchildren.\u201d  \nPet.App.34a.  Nor did the record suggest that petition-\ners or their children were coerced to \u201caffirm views \n\n9 \n \n \ncontrary to their own,\u201d \u201cdisavow views \u2026 that their re-\nligion espouses,\u201d or \u201cotherwise affirmatively act in vio-\nlation of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit \nagreed with the consistent understanding of the courts \nof appeals that \u201csimply hearing about other views does \nnot necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differ-\nently than one\u2019s religious faith requires.\u201d  Pet.App.35a-\n36a.  It rejected petitioners\u2019 principal argument that \n\u201ccompelled presence or exposure\u201d to different views in a \npublic school \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a \nburden\u201d on religious exercise, holding that this view \u201cre-\nlies on too expansive a reading\u201d of Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972).  Pet.App.36a-37a; see also \nPet.App.38a-40a.  And it held that the no-opt-out policy \ndid not deny petitioners access to a public benefit based \non religion because MCPS remained \u201copen to all stu-\ndents\u201d regardless of their faith; petitioners were not \npressured to \u201cdisavow their religious views before they \n[could] \nsend \ntheir \nchildren \nto \npublic \nschool.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  That petitioners might face \u201cadditional \ncosts\u201d if they chose to exercise their religion by \u201cpursu-\ning an alternative to public schooling\u201d did not establish a \nfree-exercise burden.  Pet.App.47a-48a.  Finally, the \nFourth Circuit rejected the \u201chybrid\u201d due-process claim \nPetitioners had asserted (but do not raise here).  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  Without deciding \u201cthe validity of the \nhybrid-rights approach,\u201d the court determined that a hy-\nbrid claim could not succeed on the merits where the \nstandalone free-exercise claim was likely to fail.  Id.   \nJudge Quattlebaum dissented.  The dissent did not \ndispute the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cmere exposure to \nobjectionable viewpoints\u201d fails to establish a free-exer-\ncise burden.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Indeed, the dissent \n\n10 \n \n \nrecognized that \u201cit is generally true that the First \nAmendment provides no guarantee that students will \nnot be exposed to views they (or their parents) disagree \nwith in public schools.\u201d  Pet.App.64a.  The dissent also \nconceded that \u201cuse of the books in instructing K-5 chil-\ndren does not coerce or require the parents or their chil-\ndren to change their religious views,\u201d and that petition-\ners remained free to \u201cteach their religious beliefs at \nhome.\u201d  Pet.App.63a.  In the dissent\u2019s view, though, the \nno-opt-out policy nonetheless likely burdened petition-\ners\u2019 religious exercise by requiring them to choose be-\ntween \u201cadher[ing] to their faith or receiv[ing] a free pub-\nlic education for their children.\u201d  Pet.App.62a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT \nNo court of appeals has ever endorsed petitioners\u2019 \ntheory here: that parents who choose to send their chil-\ndren to public school necessarily suffer a burden on their \nexercise of religion by virtue of their children\u2019s \u201cex-\npos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d in public school, Pet.11; see \nalso Pet.9, 10, 29.  Petitioners incorrectly assert that the \ncircuits are \u201csplit 5-1\u201d over whether such exposure\u2014ab-\nsent any \u201ccompulsion\u201d or \u201ccoercion\u201d of religious belief or \nconduct\u2014\u201cis sufficient to create a free-exercise burden.\u201d  \nPet.19.  In reality, the score is 6-0 against petitioners. \nA.

The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s straightforward application of this \nCourt\u2019s precedent to the limited evidence petitioners of-\nfered in support of their motion for preliminary relief \ndoes not warrant this Court\u2019s intervention.   \nMontgomery County Public Schools (MCPS), Mary-\nland\u2019s largest school district, serves more than 160,000 \nstudents.  Every day, these students read and discuss \nbooks as part of MCPS\u2019s language-arts curriculum.  \nThese reading materials have not always reflected the \ndiversity of the community MCPS serves.  In recent \nyears, the school district has worked to change that by \nincorporating new books to better represent MCPS stu-\ndents and families.  These books now include characters, \nfamilies, and historical figures from a range of cultural, \nracial, ethnic, and religious backgrounds.  \nAs part of this effort, at the start of the 2022-2023 \nschool year, MCPS approved a handful of storybooks \nfeaturing lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer \ncharacters for use in the language-arts curriculum, \nalongside the many books already in the curriculum that \nfeature heterosexual characters in traditional gender \nroles.  Like all other books in the language-arts curricu-\nlum, these storybooks impart critical reading skills \nthrough engaging, age-appropriate stories.  MCPS ad-\nheres to a careful, public, participatory selection process \nto ensure those criteria are met.  That process, followed \nhere, welcomes and incorporates parent feedback.   \n\n2 \n \n \nFrom the beginning, MCPS\u2019s goal has been for stu-\ndents to engage with these storybooks as they engage \nwith any other book in the language-arts curriculum.  \nThe storybooks are not used in any lessons related to \ngender and sexuality.  Nor is any student asked or ex-\npected to change his or her views about his or her own, \nor any other student\u2019s, sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.  Instead, the books are made available for indi-\nvidual reading, classroom read-alouds, and other educa-\ntional activities designed to foster and enhance literacy \nskills. \nPetitioners include three sets of parents who asked \nMCPS to notify them, excuse their children from class, \nand arrange alternate lessons whenever the storybooks \nare read.  After MCPS announced in March 2023 that it \nwould not permit any parents to opt their children out of \nlanguage-arts instruction involving the storybooks, for \nany reason, petitioners sued.  Petitioners also moved for \na preliminary injunction requiring notice and opt outs, \narguing that their children\u2019s \u201cexposure\u201d to the story-\nbooks \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a burden\u201d \non their right to freely exercise their religion.  \nPet.App.37a.  The district court denied the motion. \nThe Fourth Circuit affirmed, concluding that peti-\ntioners were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief \nbased on the \u201cscant record\u201d before it.  Pet.App.9a.  Ap-\nplying a standard drawn straight from this Court\u2019s free-\nexercise precedent, and in line with every relevant court \nof appeals decision, the Fourth Circuit explained that a \ncognizable burden on religious exercise requires coer-\ncion, direct or indirect, to believe or act contrary to one\u2019s \nreligious views.  Petitioners failed to demonstrate a like-\nlihood of success on their free-exercise claim, as they of-\nfered \u201cno evidence\u201d of such coercion.  Pet.App.34a.  \n\n3 \n \n \nSpecifically, petitioners advanced no evidence that \nMCPS pressured their children to affirm or disavow par-\nticular views, compelled their children to act in violation \nof their religious beliefs, influenced what petitioners \ncould teach their own children, or denied petitioners ac-\ncess to public benefits.  Pet.App.34a-48a.  This \u201cabsence \nof proof\u201d doomed petitioners\u2019 request for emergency re-\nlief.   \nThere is no circuit split on this issue.  Every single \ncourt of appeals that has considered the question has \nheld that mere exposure to controversial issues in a pub-\nlic-school curriculum does not burden the free religious \nexercise of parents or students.  Nor is there any conflict \nbetween the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding and this Court\u2019s \nfree-exercise decisions, which the Fourth Circuit faith-\nfully applied and petitioners misconstrue.  And there is \nno pressing question raised by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s con-\nclusion in a preliminary-injunction posture that petition-\ners\u2019 free-exercise claim was not likely to succeed absent \nany evidence of coercion that could constitute a burden \non religious free exercise.  Under the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision, parents who can demonstrate a likelihood of \nsuccess in showing religious coercion in a public school \nthat does not survive scrutiny may obtain preliminary \nrelief.  Parents who cannot make that showing, but who \ncan plausibly allege facts suggesting such unjustified co-\nercion, will proceed to discovery.  And if the facts bear \nout those allegations, they will obtain permanent relief.  \nThere is no pressing question here. \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n4 \n \n \nSTATEMENT \nA. The Storybooks \nAt the start of the 2022-2023 school year, MCPS in-\ntroduced into its pre-K through twelfth grade language-\narts curriculum several storybooks featuring lesbian, \ngay, bisexual, transgender, and queer characters.  \nPet.App.603a-604a.  The storybooks were added as part \nof MCPS\u2019s commitment to \u201cprovid[ing] a culturally re-\nsponsive \u2026 curriculum that promotes equity, respect, \nand civility.\u201d  Pet.App.589a.  MCPS believes that \u201c[r]ep-\nresentation in the curriculum creates and normalizes a \nfully inclusive environment for all students\u201d and \u201csup-\nports a student\u2019s ability to empathize, connect, and col-\nlaborate with diverse peers and encourages respect for \nall.\u201d  Pet.App.603a.  The language-arts curriculum there-\nfore seeks to ensure that students can \u201c[s]elect[] from a \nrange of diverse texts to understand and appreciate mul-\ntiple perspectives.\u201d  Pet.App.599a.  As part of this effort, \nMCPS had previously made similar efforts to update the \nlanguage-arts curriculum with books featuring people \nand characters from different backgrounds.  Some exam-\nples include the March trilogy, which recounts the life of \ncivil rights icon Congressman John Lewis, and The Leav-\ners, which tells the story of an Asian-American immi-\ngrant family.  Pet.App.602a-603a.  In a similar vein, \nMCPS updated its social-studies curriculum with new in-\nstructional materials about local history.  Id. \nThe storybooks were approved for instructional use \npursuant to MCPS\u2019s written policy for selecting new in-\nstructional materials.  Pet.App.600a-601a, 603a-604a; \nCAJA513-514.  Under that policy, MCPS seeks to ensure \nthat the materials are \u201cage/grade appropriate[],\u201d \u201csup-\nport \u2026 student achievement toward MCPS curriculum \nstandards,\u201d and are \u201crelevant to and reflective of the \n\n5 \n \n \nmulticultural \nsociety \nand \nglobal \ncommunity.\u201d  \nPet.App.600a-601a; CAJA513-514, 521, 523.  Before se-\nlecting the storybooks, a committee of six reading and \ninstructional specialists participated in multiple rounds \nof evaluations to determine that each book would be a \nsuitable addition to the curriculum based on these crite-\nria.  CAJA513; see also Pet.App.603a-604a.  This process \nincluded an opportunity for parents to review the story-\nbooks and provide feedback, and all such feedback was \nconsidered before any storybook was approved.  \nPet.App.601a. \nThe storybooks tell everyday tales of characters \nwho experience adventure, confront new emotions, and \nstruggle to make themselves heard.  They include a \nstory about a family attending a Pride parade, a niece \nmeeting her uncle\u2019s husband-to-be, a prince falling in \nlove with a knight as they battle a dragon in a mythical \nkingdom, a girl feeling nervous about giving a valentine \nto her crush, and a transgender boy sharing his gender \nidentity with his family.  Pet.App.254a-271a, 279a-306a, \n390a-428a, 429a-447a, 448a-482a.  These are archetypal \nstories that touch on the same themes introduced to chil-\ndren in such classic books as Snow White, Cinderella, \nand Peter Pan.  In addition to helping students explore \nsentence structure, word choice, and style, the story-\nbooks support students\u2019 ability to empathize, connect, \nand collaborate with peers and encourage respect for all.  \nPet.App.603a, 605a-606a.   \nThe storybooks are, moreover, \u201ca small subset of \nmany books used in the MCPS [language-arts] curricu-\nlum.\u201d  Pet.App.132a.  Teachers are expected to fold them \ninto the curriculum as they would any other book:  They \ncan put the storybooks on shelves for students to find \nthemselves, recommend a particular storybook to a \n\n6 \n \n \nstudent who would enjoy it, read the storybooks aloud, \nor offer them as an option for reading groups.  \nPet.App.604a-605a. \n \nMCPS made clear to teachers that using the story-\nbooks involves no instruction on sexual orientation or \ngender identity.  Pet.App.605a, 636a-641a.  Some chal-\nlenged books simply include LGBTQ characters.  Others \nhighlight the importance of kindness to others.  None \ntakes a side in any religious or scientific debate sur-\nrounding gender or sexuality.  And teachers are not per-\nmitted to use the storybooks to enforce a particular \nviewpoint.  Indeed, a guidance document for teachers \nstates that \u201c[n]o child who does not agree with or under-\nstand another student\u2019s gender, expression, or their sex-\nual identity is asked to change how they feel about it.\u201d  \nPet.App.640a.  MCPS prepared teachers to use the sto-\nrybooks by offering a professional-development session \nas well as sample responses to potential student ques-\ntions; these optional \u201csuggested responses focus[ed] on \ntolerance, empathy, and respect for different views.\u201d  \nPet.App.89a-95a.1  \nB. The No-Opt-Out Policy \nAfter the storybooks were introduced, some parents \nrequested that their children be excused from class \nwhen \nthe \nstorybooks \nwere \nread \nor \ndiscussed.  \nPet.App.606a.  Some opt-out requests were religion-\nbased and others were not.  Some parents opposed a \n \n1 Contrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion, this guidance did not \u201cdi-\nrect[] teachers to frame disagreement with\u201d the storybooks \u201cas \n\u2018hurtful.\u2019\u201d  Pet.13.  The guidance instead suggested that if a student \ndescribes another person as \u201cweird,\u201d a teacher could respond, \u201cThat \ncomment is hurtful; we shouldn\u2019t use negative words to talk about \npeople\u2019s identities.\u201d  Pet.App.94a. \n\n7 \n \n \nperceived effort to teach students about sex or gender \nidentity or believed the materials were age-inappropri-\nate.  Id. \nAt first, teachers and principals sought to accommo-\ndate these requests by excusing students when the \nbooks were read in class.  Pet.App.606a-607a.  The grow-\ning number of opt-out requests, however, gave rise to \nthree related concerns: high student absenteeism, the in-\nfeasibility of administering opt-outs across classrooms \nand schools, and the risk of exposing students who be-\nlieve the storybooks represent them and their families \nto social stigma and isolation.  Pet.App.96a-99a, 606a-\n608a.  These consequences would defeat MCPS\u2019s \u201cefforts \nto ensure a classroom environment that is safe and con-\nducive to learning for all students\u201d and risk putting \nMCPS out of compliance with nondiscrimination laws.  \nPet.App.98a-99a, 607a-608a. \nMCPS therefore determined that permitting opt-\nouts was not feasible or consistent with its curricular \ngoals.  Pet.App.608a.  It announced in March 2023 that \nno opt-outs from instruction using the storybooks would \nbe granted \u201cfor any reason.\u201d  Id. \nC. Proceedings Below \nIn May 2023, petitioners sued the Montgomery \nCounty Board of Education, its members, and the Super-\nintendent of Schools, asserting violations of the federal \nFree Exercise, Free Speech, and Due Process Clauses \nand a violation of Maryland law.  Pet.App.107a-108a.  Pe-\ntitioners then moved for a preliminary injunction on \ntheir free-exercise and due-process claims, seeking to \nrequire MCPS to provide them notice and opt-out oppor-\ntunities whenever the storybooks are read or discussed.  \nPet.App.76a-77a.  In July 2023, petitioners amended \ntheir \ncomplaint \nto \nadd \nplaintiff \nKids \nFirst.  \n\n8 \n \n \nPet.App.162a-163a.  The district court denied the pre-\nliminary-injunction motion in August 2023.  The Fourth \nCircuit denied petitioners\u2019 motion for an injunction \npending appeal and, in May 2024, affirmed the denial of \na preliminary injunction. \nIn an opinion written by Judge Agee and joined by \nJudge Benjamin, the court of appeals agreed with the \ndistrict court that petitioners had not demonstrated a \nlikelihood of success on the merits given their \u201cbroad \nclaims, the very high burden required to obtain a prelim-\ninary injunction, and the scant record before [it].\u201d  \nPet.App.9a.  The court recognized that the Free Exer-\ncise Clause protects against government action that di-\nrectly or indirectly compels religious belief or threatens \nthe ability to act in accordance with one\u2019s faith.  \nPet.App.24a-25a.  The court thus explained that, \u201cto \nshow a cognizable burden\u201d on religious exercise, peti-\ntioners were required to \u201cshow that the absence of an \nopt-out opportunity coerces them or their children to be-\nlieve or act contrary to their religious views.\u201d  \nPet.App.31a.  That coercion could be \u201cdirect or indirect.\u201d  \nId. \nApplying those familiar principles, the Fourth Cir-\ncuit rejected petitioners\u2019 theory that \u201cthe lack of an \nacross-the-board notice and an opt-out opportunity re-\nlating to the Storybooks, in and of itself, coerces them \nand their children in the free exercise of their religion.\u201d  \nPet.App.33a-34a.  The court held that petitioners put \nforward \u201cno evidence\u201d that the no-opt-out policy com-\npelled them or their children \u201cto change their religious \nbeliefs or conduct, either at school or elsewhere\u201d or \u201caf-\nfect[ed] \nwhat \nthey \nteach \ntheir \nown \nchildren.\u201d  \nPet.App.34a.  Nor did the record suggest that petition-\ners or their children were coerced to \u201caffirm views \n\n9 \n \n \ncontrary to their own,\u201d \u201cdisavow views \u2026 that their re-\nligion espouses,\u201d or \u201cotherwise affirmatively act in vio-\nlation of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id.  \nIn reaching this conclusion, the Fourth Circuit \nagreed with the consistent understanding of the courts \nof appeals that \u201csimply hearing about other views does \nnot necessarily exert pressure to believe or act differ-\nently than one\u2019s religious faith requires.\u201d  Pet.App.35a-\n36a.  It rejected petitioners\u2019 principal argument that \n\u201ccompelled presence or exposure\u201d to different views in a \npublic school \u201cnecessarily establishes the existence of a \nburden\u201d on religious exercise, holding that this view \u201cre-\nlies on too expansive a reading\u201d of Wisconsin v. Yoder, \n406 U.S. 205 (1972).  Pet.App.36a-37a; see also \nPet.App.38a-40a.  And it held that the no-opt-out policy \ndid not deny petitioners access to a public benefit based \non religion because MCPS remained \u201copen to all stu-\ndents\u201d regardless of their faith; petitioners were not \npressured to \u201cdisavow their religious views before they \n[could] \nsend \ntheir \nchildren \nto \npublic \nschool.\u201d  \nPet.App.46a.  That petitioners might face \u201cadditional \ncosts\u201d if they chose to exercise their religion by \u201cpursu-\ning an alternative to public schooling\u201d did not establish a \nfree-exercise burden.  Pet.App.47a-48a.  Finally, the \nFourth Circuit rejected the \u201chybrid\u201d due-process claim \nPetitioners had asserted (but do not raise here).  \nPet.App.50a-51a.  Without deciding \u201cthe validity of the \nhybrid-rights approach,\u201d the court determined that a hy-\nbrid claim could not succeed on the merits where the \nstandalone free-exercise claim was likely to fail.  Id.   \nJudge Quattlebaum dissented.  The dissent did not \ndispute the majority\u2019s conclusion that \u201cmere exposure to \nobjectionable viewpoints\u201d fails to establish a free-exer-\ncise burden.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Indeed, the dissent \n\n10 \n \n \nrecognized that \u201cit is generally true that the First \nAmendment provides no guarantee that students will \nnot be exposed to views they (or their parents) disagree \nwith in public schools.\u201d  Pet.App.64a.  The dissent also \nconceded that \u201cuse of the books in instructing K-5 chil-\ndren does not coerce or require the parents or their chil-\ndren to change their religious views,\u201d and that petition-\ners remained free to \u201cteach their religious beliefs at \nhome.\u201d  Pet.App.63a.  In the dissent\u2019s view, though, the \nno-opt-out policy nonetheless likely burdened petition-\ners\u2019 religious exercise by requiring them to choose be-\ntween \u201cadher[ing] to their faith or receiv[ing] a free pub-\nlic education for their children.\u201d  Pet.App.62a. \nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \nI. THERE IS NO CIRCUIT SPLIT \nNo court of appeals has ever endorsed petitioners\u2019 \ntheory here: that parents who choose to send their chil-\ndren to public school necessarily suffer a burden on their \nexercise of religion by virtue of their children\u2019s \u201cex-\npos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d in public school, Pet.11; see \nalso Pet.9, 10, 29.  Petitioners incorrectly assert that the \ncircuits are \u201csplit 5-1\u201d over whether such exposure\u2014ab-\nsent any \u201ccompulsion\u201d or \u201ccoercion\u201d of religious belief or \nconduct\u2014\u201cis sufficient to create a free-exercise burden.\u201d  \nPet.19.  In reality, the score is 6-0 against petitioners. \nA. Courts Of Appeals Have Uniformly Held That \nMere Exposure In Public School To Ideas That \nContradict Religious Beliefs Does Not Burden \nParents\u2019 Religious Exercise \nThe decision below agreed with every other court of \nappeals to have considered whether students\u2019 exposure \nin public school to material that contradicts their par-\nents\u2019 religious faith in and of itself constitutes a \n\n11 \n \n \ncognizable burden on the parents\u2019 free-exercise rights.  \nAs both the district court and the court of appeals ob-\nserved, \u201c[e]very court that has addressed th[is] ques-\ntion\u201d has answered it in the negative.  Pet.App.117a; see \nalso Pet.App.39a. \nSpecifically, as petitioners correctly acknowledge, \nthe decision below accords with: \n\u2022 the First Circuit\u2019s holding in Parker v. Hurley, \n514 F.3d 87 (1st Cir. 2008), that parents \u201cwhose \nreligious beliefs [were] offended by gay marriage \nand homosexuality\u201d were not entitled under the \nFree Exercise Clause to \u201cprior notice by the \nschool and the opportunity to exempt their young \nchildren from exposure to books they f[ou]nd re-\nligiously repugnant,\u201d id. at 90; \n\u2022 the Second Circuit\u2019s holding in Leebaert v. Har-\nrington, 332 F.3d 134 (2d Cir. 2003), that a father \nwas not entitled under the Free Exercise Clause \n\u201cto excuse his minor son\u201d from a public school\u2019s \n\u201cmandatory health curriculum [that] conflict[ed] \nwith his [religious] belief\u201d regarding \u201csex before \nmarriage,\u201d id. at 135, 144-145; \n\u2022 the Sixth Circuit\u2019s holding in Mozert v. Hawkins \nCounty Board of Education, 827 F.2d 1058 (6th \nCir. 1987), that \u201crequiring mere exposure [of pub-\nlic-school students] to materials that offend [their \nparents\u2019] religious beliefs\u201d does not subject the \n\u201cobjecting parents\u201d to \u201can unconstitutional bur-\nden on the free exercise of religion,\u201d id. at 1059, \n1067; and \n\u2022 the Seventh Circuit\u2019s holding in Fleischfresser v. \nDirectors of School District 200, 15 F.3d 680 (7th \nCir. 1994), rejecting a claim by \u201c[p]arents of \n\n12 \n \n \n[public-school] students enrolled in grades Kin-\ndergarten through Five\u201d that \u201cthe use of [a par-\nticular book] series interfere[d] with the free ex-\nercise of their religion,\u201d id. at 683, 689. \nPetitioners omit yet another case that follows the \nconsensus view: the Ninth Circuit\u2019s decision in Califor-\nnia Parents for the Equalization of Educational Mate-\nrials v. Torlakson, 973 F.3d 1010 (9th Cir. 2020), which \nrejected a free-exercise claim by parents challenging a \n\u201cpublic school curriculum\u201d that \u201ccontain[ed] material \u2026 \noffensive to their religious beliefs,\u201d id. at 1013, 1020.  Pe-\ntitioners\u2019 omission is surprising given that this case was \ncited by both the district court (Pet.App.118a) and the \ncourt of appeals (Pet.App.35a).  Indeed, petitioners \nthemselves cite the case in another portion of their peti-\ntion, where they characterize it as \u201cdecided under the \nDue Process Clause,\u201d Pet.31 n.13, and fail to mention \nthat it also rejected the same \u201cFree Exercise clause ar-\ngument\u201d that petitioners pursue here, Torlakson, 973 \nF.3d at 1020. \nThis consistency across circuits follows ineluctably \nfrom this Court\u2019s precedent that \u201cit is necessary in a free \nexercise case \u2026 to show the coercive effect of the\u201d chal-\nlenged action, School District of Abington Township v. \nSchempp, 374 U.S. 203, 223 (1963); accord Carson v. \nMakin, 596 U.S. 767, 778 (2022).2 \n \n2 The uniform court-of-appeals decisions on this issue are also \nconsistent with this Court\u2019s recognition that exposure to new and \neven \u201coffensive content\u201d in school \u201cis part of learning how to live in \na pluralistic society, a society which insists upon open discourse to-\nwards the end of a tolerant citizenry.\u201d  Lee v. Weisman, 505 U.S. \n577, 590 (1992). \n\n13 \n \n \nAs elaborated further below, see infra Part II, Peti-\ntioners\u2019 position\u2014that their free-exercise claim may \nsucceed based purely on their children\u2019s exposure to re-\nligiously offensive material, \u201cabsent a \u2018coercive effect\u2019\u201d \non \u201creligious beliefs or conduct,\u201d Pet.22\u2014would be con-\ntrary to this Court\u2019s precedent and thus finds no support \nin any circuit. \nB. No Decision Conflicts With The Decision Be-\nlow \nContrary to Petitioners\u2019 assertion (Pet.22), the \nEighth Circuit has never split from the judicial consen-\nsus just discussed.   \nPetitioners seize on the Eighth Circuit\u2019s statement \nin Florey v. Sioux Falls School District 49-5, 619 F.2d \n1311 (8th Cir. 1980), that \u201cforcing any person to partici-\npate in an activity that offends his religious or nonreli-\ngious beliefs will generally contravene the Free Exer-\ncise Clause,\u201d id. at 1318-1319.  That statement is both \nperfectly consistent with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision in \nthis case (and with the decisions of every other court of \nappeals to have addressed the issue), and in any event \nwas dicta because, as petitioners acknowledge, \u201c[t]he \ncourt found no [free-exercise] violation in that case,\u201d \nPet.22.   \nIn Florey, a Sioux Falls public school in 1977 held a \nChristmas assembly in which kindergartners were re-\nquired to \u201cmemorize[] and then perform[] for parents a \nChristmas assembly which was replete with religious \ncontent,\u201d including a call and response that required stu-\ndents to answer \u201cJesus\u201d when asked \u201cOf whom did \nheav\u2019nly angels sing, And news about His birthday \nbring?\u201d  Florey v. Sioux Falls Sch. Dist. 49-5, 464 F. \nSupp. 911, 912 (D.S.D. 1979).  A parent complained, and \nthe district developed a set of rules outlining the \n\n14 \n \n \npermissible role religious materials might play in public \nschool.  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1313.  The rules provided, \namong other things, that \u201cstudents and staff members \nshould be excused from participating in practices which \nare contrary to their religious beliefs unless there are \nclear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.\u201d  \nId. at 1319 (emphasis added).  Parents challenged those \nrules as violating the Establishment Clause, and then \nadded a Free Exercise Clause argument on appeal \u201cas \nan afterthought.\u201d  Id. at 1318 n.7. \nThe Eighth Circuit rejected the free-exercise chal-\nlenge.  It recognized that \u201cpublic schools are not re-\nquired to delete from the curriculum all materials that \nmay offend any religious sensibility,\u201d and that \u201cinevita-\nble conflicts with the individual beliefs of some students \nor their parents \u2026 do not necessarily require the prohi-\nbition of a school activity.\u201d  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1318.  To \nbe sure, the court also recognized that \u201cforcing any per-\nson to participate in an activity that offends his religious \nor nonreligious beliefs will generally contravene the \nFree Exercise Clause,\u201d id. at 1318-1319.  But that sen-\ntence does not support Petitioners.  Everyone agrees \nthat a public school generally cannot force a student to \nactively \u201cparticipate in an activity\u201d that violates the stu-\ndent\u2019s religion.  Florey, id. at 1318.  For example, a pub-\nlic school cannot require students to recognize \u201cJesus\u201d \nas \u201cChrist, the blessed Saviour[],\u201d Florey, 464 F. Supp. \nat 912, as in the Christmas assemblies that led to the pol-\nicies challenged in Florey.  Nor can public schools re-\nquire a student who keeps kosher to eat pork or a Jeho-\nvah\u2019s Witness to participate in a birthday party.  As the \nFourth Circuit put it, public schools cannot require stu-\ndents to \u201caffirmatively act in violation of their religious \nbeliefs.\u201d  Pet.App.34a.  But this case does not involve any \nsuch requirement.  It involves only \u201ccurriculum \u2026 \n\n15 \n \n \nmaterials that may offend [Petitioner\u2019s] religious sensi-\nbility.\u201d  Florey, 619 F.2d at 1318.3 \nIn any event, as noted, the single sentence on which \npetitioners seize was plainly dicta.  The court found no \nfree-exercise violation, and the language petitioners cite \nwas not \u201cnecessary to that result.\u201d  Seminole Tribe of \nFlorida v. Florida, 517 U.S. 44, 67 (1996).  And because \n\u201c[d]ictum settles nothing, even in the court that utters \nit,\u201d Jama v. Immigration & Customs Enforcement, 543 \nU.S. 335, 352 n.12 (2005), \u201cdicta does not a circuit split \nmake,\u201d Pacific Coast Supply, LLC v. NLRB, 801 F.3d \n321, 334 n.10 (D.C. Cir. 2015). \nEven if certain dicta could signal a circuit divide \nwarranting this Court\u2019s attention, the dicta Petitioners \nidentify certainly does not.  Recognizing that \u201c[a] pas-\nsage unnecessary to the outcome may not be fully con-\nsidered,\u201d Torres v. Madrid, 592 U.S. 306, 329 (2021) \n(Gorsuch, J., dissenting), this Court declines to assign \n\u201clegal weight\u201d to \u201cdicta\u201d on an issue that \u201cwas not \u2026 \nfully argued,\u201d Kirtsaeng v. John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 568 \nU.S. 519, 548 (2013).  As the Eighth Circuit explained, \n \n3 Moreover, Florey held that the plaintiffs\u2019 free-exercise claim \ncould not succeed in light of the defendant school\u2019s policy that \u201cstu-\ndents and staff members should be excused from participating in \npractices which are contrary to their religious beliefs unless there \nare clear issues of overriding concern that would prevent it.\u201d  Flo-\nrey, 619 F.2d at 1317 n.6 (quoting school\u2019s policy) (emphasis added).  \nThat is the situation here:  As noted, see supra p.7, MCPS accom-\nmodated opt-out requests until it was prevented from doing so by \noverriding concerns regarding \u201cabsenteeism,\u201d \u201cthe infeasibility of \nmanaging numerous opt-outs,\u201d and the \u201crisk [of] putting MCPS out \nof compliance with state and federal nondiscrimination laws,\u201d \nPet.App.98a.  Any fact-bound dispute about the weight of those in-\nterests in this narrow circumstance\u2014particularly in this prelimi-\nnary posture\u2014does not merit review by this Court. \n\n16 \n \n \n\u201c[t]he free-exercise issue\u201d in Florey was \u201cadded to the \nappellants\u2019 appeal brief as an afterthought\u201d and \u201c[n]ei-\nther the complaint, the trial briefs, nor the district court \nopinion mention[ed] the Free Exercise Clause.\u201d  Florey, \n619 F.2d at 1318 n.7.  The Eighth Circuit\u2019s dicta on that \nsubject thus was not fully considered and cannot bear \nthe \u201clegal weight\u201d petitioners assign it, Kirtsaeng, 568 \nU.S. at 548. \nAlthough not the basis of their claimed circuit-split, \npetitioners identify three other decisions they suggest \nare in tension with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision here.  \nSee Pet.22-23 n.11.  None is.  Petitioners first point to \nC.N. v. Ridgewood Board of Education, 430 F.3d 159 (3d \nCir. 2005), in which the Third Circuit declined to adopt a \n\u201ccategorical approach\u201d under which parents lack any \ndue-process rights regarding their children\u2019s experience \nin public school, id. at 185 n.26.  Even putting aside that \nthat case concerned due process rather than free exer-\ncise, the Third Circuit\u2019s rejection of such a \u201ccategorical \napproach,\u201d id., is consistent with the judicial consensus \nthat mere exposure in public school to ideas that contra-\ndict religious beliefs does not burden the religious exer-\ncise of objecting parents.  Indeed, the Third Circuit re-\njected the parents\u2019 exposure-based due-process claim in \nC.N., on the ground that \u201c[a] parent whose \u2026 child is ex-\nposed to sensitive topics\u201d in school \u201cremains free to dis-\ncuss th[o]se matters and to place them in the family\u2019s \nmoral or religious context, or to supplement the infor-\nmation with more appropriate materials.\u201d  Id. at 185.  \nThe same is true here. \nNext, petitioners point to Tatel v. Mt. Lebanon \nSchool District, 675 F. Supp. 3d 551 (W.D. Pa. 2023).  \nThat district-court decision only illustrates what is miss-\ning here: any allegation (much less evidence) of coercive \n\n17 \n \n \nconduct that could amount to a cognizable burden on re-\nligious exercise.  Tatel involved allegations that a \nteacher \u201cpursued her own non-curricular agenda \u2026 to \ninculcate in the first-grade children in her class the \nteacher\u2019s beliefs about a child\u2019s gender identity,\u201d includ-\ning by \u201ctarget[ing] one child for repeated approaches \nabout gender dysphoria despite, or because of, the par-\nents\u2019 beliefs,\u201d all while \u201ctelling the children to keep the \nteacher\u2019s discussions about gender topics secret from \ntheir parents.\u201d  Id. at 558-559, 566.  There are no such \nallegations of non-curricular instruction, targeting, or \nsecrecy here, and there is certainly no evidence of such \ncoercion in this preliminary-injunction posture.  As the \ndistrict court in this case concluded, \u201c[t]he students\u201d in \nTatel \u201cwere not just exposed to ideas\u201d; \u201c[t]hey were be-\ning pressured by their teacher to change their religious \nviews on gender identity.\u201d  Pet.App.131a.  Tatel, in other \nwords, rested on coercive elements absent here. \nFinally, petitioners assert that before the Sixth Cir-\ncuit\u2019s decision in Mozert (which, as noted, petitioners \nacknowledge accords with the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision \nhere), \u201cthe Sixth Circuit originally landed on [the other] \nside of the split\u201d with its decision in Spence v. Bailey, 465 \nF.2d 797 (6th Cir. 1972).  Pet.23 n.11.  That too is wrong.  \nThe Sixth Circuit explained in Mozert why its decision \nthere (and thus the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision here) is dis-\ntinguishable from Spence: namely, the student in Spence \n\u201cwas being compelled to engage in military training, not \nbeing exposed to the fact that others do so,\u201d Mozert, 827 \nF.2d at 1065 (emphasis in original).  Spence is thus per-\nfectly consistent with rejecting Petitioners\u2019 theory here \n\n18 \n \n \nthat mere \u201cexpos[ure] \u2026 to instruction\u201d is enough to \nsupport a free-exercise claim, Pet.11.4 \nII. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT CORRECTLY APPLIED THIS \nCOURT\u2019S FREE-EXERCISE CASES \nThis Court\u2019s free-exercise precedents set out a clear \nrule that the Fourth Circuit correctly applied in this \ncase: the government burdens religious exercise only \nwhen it coerces someone, either directly or indirectly, to \nbelieve or act contrary to their religious views.  Petition-\ners misrepresent both law and facts in an effort to fabri-\ncate a conflict. \nA. The Fourth Circuit Correctly Applied Yoder \nAs the Fourth Circuit explained, petitioners\u2019 argu-\nment that the no-opt-out policy burdens their religious \nexercise \u201crelies on too expansive a reading of Yoder.\u201d  \nPet.App.37a.  In Yoder, Amish parents developed an ev-\nidentiary record establishing that \u201cattendance at high \nschool, public or private, was contrary to the Amish re-\nligion and way of life\u201d and would \u201cresult in the destruc-\ntion\u201d of their religious community.  406 U.S. at 209, 212.  \nSurveying that record, this Court held that a compulsory \nschool attendance law violated the Amish parents\u2019 free-\nexercise rights because it \u201caffirmatively compel[ed] \n \n4 Not even the dissent below agreed with Petitioners\u2019 claim \nthat \u201cmere exposure to objectionable viewpoints\u201d is enough to es-\ntablish a burden on free exercise.  Pet.App.64a-65a.  Instead, it at-\ntempts (unpersuasively) to distinguish Mozert and other cases on \nfactual grounds.  See Pet.App.65a n.2.  Nor is Petitioners\u2019 position \nsupported by recent district-court dicta stating that students may \n\u201copt out of educational content that violates sincerely held religious \nor conscience-based beliefs,\u201d Nelson v. Nazareth Independent \nSchool District, 2024 WL 4116495, at *4 (N.D. Tex. Sept. 6, 2024) \n(cited at W.Va.Br.8-9), as that dicta rested in substantial part on the \nTexas Constitution and Texas statutes not implicated here, see id. \n\n19 \n \n \nthem \u2026 to perform acts undeniably at odds with funda-\nmental tenets of their religious beliefs.\u201d  Id. at 218.  The \nFourth Circuit faithfully applied that standard here and \nfound that on the preliminary-injunction record, peti-\ntioners had not established that their children were af-\nfirmatively compelled to perform acts contrary to their \nreligious beliefs.  Pet.App.39a; see also Pet.App.34a-35a.  \nFor its part, the dissent showed no interest in petition-\ners\u2019 argument that Yoder commanded a different result.  \nPet.App.71a n.5. \nPetitioners\u2019 and their amici\u2019s counterarguments fail \nfor several related reasons. \nFirst, the Fourth Circuit in no way \u201cdenigrat[ed]\u201d \nYoder (Pet.24), but instead faithfully applied its clear \nholding.  In Yoder, the parents came forward with evi-\ndence showing that they believed the mere act of \u201csend-\ning their children to high school\u201d would \u201cendanger their \nown salvation and that of their children.\u201d  406 U.S. at \n209.  The challenged law therefore would force them to \neither \u201cabandon belief and be assimilated into society\u201d \nor \u201cmigrate to some other and more tolerant region.\u201d  Id. \nat 218.  Compulsory attendance thus \u201cwould gravely en-\ndanger if not destroy the free exercise of respondents\u2019 \nreligious beliefs.\u201d  Id. at 219.  That is coercion\u2014coercion \nthe Fourth Circuit did not find in the preliminary-injunc-\ntion record below.  As the district court explained, the \nquestion is \u201cwhether the facts involve government coer-\ncion to violate religious beliefs.  In Yoder, they did; here, \nthey do not.\u201d  Pet.App.142a n.13.  That preliminary, fact-\nbound decision does not merit this Court\u2019s review. \nSecond, the coercion standard that Yoder prescribes \nand the Fourth Circuit applied does not risk \u201cdenomina-\ntional favoritism.\u201d  Pet.25.  That is because, as the dis-\ntrict court recognized, the required analysis \u201cdoes not \n\n20 \n \n \nturn on religious doctrine.\u201d  Pet.App.142a n.13.  It turns \non the presence or absence of coercion to change or act \ncontrary to one\u2019s religious beliefs.   \nThe Fourth Circuit is not alone in holding that the \nparents in Yoder could demonstrate coercion not found \nhere.  As the First Circuit explained, compulsory school-\ning in Yoder threatened to destroy a \u201cdistinct commu-\nnity and life style\u201d that was \u201cfundamentally incompati-\nble with any schooling system.\u201d  Parker, 514 F.3d at 100.  \nIn the words of the Sixth Circuit, \u201cYoder was decided in \nlarge part on the impossibility of reconciling the goals of \npublic education with the religious requirement of the \nAmish that their children be prepared for life in a sepa-\nrated community.\u201d  Mozert, 827 F.2d at 1067; accord \nLeebaert, 332 F.3d at 144.     \nThe substance of a plaintiff\u2019s religious beliefs may be \nrelevant to whether there is coercion, and, as this Court \nrecognized in Yoder, a showing that attending public \nschool at all amounts to coercion is \u201cone that probably \nfew other religious groups or sects could make.\u201d  406 \nU.S. at 235-236.  But the legal test is the same across the \nboard.  The concern about \u201cdenominational favoritism\u201d \nraised in Carson, 596 U.S. at 786-787, which petitioners \nquote out of context, was with state laws that denied \npublic funds to religious schools based on a subjective \nassessment of whether those funds were used to pro-\nmote religion.  No such concern is present here. \nThird, petitioners are wrong to suggest (Pet.26-27) \nthat the Fourth Circuit required them to await actual in-\njury before seeking relief\u2014an argument that in any \nevent has nothing to do with Yoder.  The Fourth Circuit \nproperly applied this Court\u2019s preliminary-injunction \nstandard by requiring petitioners to establish a likeli-\nhood of success on the merits.  Pet.App.21a-22a.  To \n\n21 \n \n \nobtain injunctive relief, petitioners had to show that \nthey were likely to experience \u201cdirect or indirect coer-\ncion arising out of the exposure\u201d of their children to the \nstorybooks.  Pet.App.41a.  They did not do so because \nthey failed to introduce any evidence that coercion \nwould necessarily result from exposure to the story-\nbooks or that storybooks were actually being used in \nclassrooms in a way that was likely to coerce.  \nPet.App.33-35a, 41a-43a.  Petitioners seem to suggest \nthat the Fourth Circuit should have lowered the \u201cex-\nceedingly high burden\u201d faced by litigants seeking a pre-\nliminary injunction.  Pet.App.21a.  But as this Court has \nemphasized, \u201c[a] preliminary injunction is an extraordi-\nnary remedy never awarded as of right.\u201d  Winter v. Nat-\nural Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008).  That \ndemanding standard applies to free-exercise claims.  See, \ne.g., Does 1-3 v. Mills, 142 S.Ct. 17, 18 (2021); see also \nRoman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 592 \nU.S. 14, 16 (2020). \nFourth, petitioners confusingly rely on a footnote in \nYoder that quoted a letter from Thomas Jefferson, alt-\nhough neither that section of Yoder nor the referenced \nwritings of Thomas Jefferson have anything to do with \nwhether a given policy burdens free exercise.  Pet.24.  In \nrejecting the argument that \u201ca brief additional period of \nformal education is imperative to enable the Amish to \nparticipate effectively and intelligently in our demo-\ncratic process,\u201d the Court referenced in passing Thomas \nJefferson\u2019s professed \u201creluctan[ce] to directly force in-\nstruction of children \u2018in opposition to the will of the par-\nent,\u2019\u201d  Yoder, 406 U.S. at 226 n.14 (quoting 17 Writings \nof Thomas Jefferson 417, 423-424 (Mem. ed. 1904)), at \nleast \u201cbeyond a basic education,\u201d id. at 225.  This has \nnothing to do with whether mere exposure to language-\narts storybooks, in a public school to which parents have \n\n22 \n \n \nchosen to send their child, is inherently coercive in vio-\nlation of the Free Exercise Clause.   \nFifth, petitioners\u2019 and amici\u2019s claim of a \u201cnational \nconsensus that [sex education] instruction should not \nproceed absent parental permission,\u201d Pet.24-25; see also \nW.Va.Br.12-18, is likewise irrelevant.  Such a purported \ncontemporary policy consensus would have nothing to do \nwith whether a no-opt-out policy burdens religious exer-\ncise.  Nor did the Fourth Circuit apply any \u201cdeference\u201d \nto the Board\u2019s justifications for the challenged policy \n(Pet.25)\u2014the court never reached that issue because the \npreliminary-injunction record contained no evidence of \ncoercion, so there was no burden for the Board to jus-\ntify.5  Moreover, as the Fourth Circuit recognized, the \npreliminary-injunction record confirmed that the story-\nbooks were to be used only as part of the language-arts \ncurriculum and would not be part of \u201cinstruction on gen-\nder identity and sexual orientation.\u201d  Pet.App.11a.  That \nsame record established that the storybooks were not \napproved for the sex education curriculum, which has its \nown approval process for instructional materials, \nCAJA515, and from which students are permitted to opt \nout for any reason, Pet.App.608a. \nFinally, amici (and only amici) devote many pages to \nthe irrelevant argument that a \u201chybrid\u201d free-exercise \nand due-process claim could succeed against a policy that \nprohibited parents from opting their children out of sex \n \n5 Petitioners cite Ramirez v. Collier, 595 U.S. 411 (2022) \n(Pet.25), which held only that after a burden has been established, \nthe Court may consider whether a practice has been \u201chistorically \nand routinely allowed\u201d when determining whether a government \npolicy prohibiting the practice is narrowly tailored to a compelling \ninterest, id. at 428-429.  Again, because petitioners failed to estab-\nlish a burden, the courts below did not consider narrow tailoring. \n\n23 \n \n \neducation.  W.Va.Br.3-9.  Petitioners have not asked this \nCourt to consider their likelihood of success on a \u201chy-\nbrid\u201d claim, or urged this Court to reverse the Fourth \nCircuit\u2019s holding on their due-process claim.  And as ex-\nplained above, there is no evidence in the record that \nMCPS has denied opt-outs from the sex education unit.  \nSupra p.22. \nB. The Fourth Circuit Correctly Applied This \nCourt\u2019s Remaining Free-Exercise Precedents \nPetitioners fare no better in their attempts to man-\nufacture a conflict between the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision \nand this Court\u2019s other free-exercise decisions.  Each case \npetitioners cite confirms that a free-exercise violation \nrequires evidence of direct or indirect coercion\u2014evi-\ndence absent from the limited preliminary-injunction \nrecord here. \n1. \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not conflict \nwith this Court\u2019s cases holding that States may not con-\ndition access to public benefits on requirements that pro-\nspective recipients change or forgo their religious beliefs \nor conduct.  See Pet.26-27, 28-29.  Again, each case on \nwhich petitioners rely had precisely what the Fourth \nCircuit found is missing from the preliminary-injunction \nrecord below: requirements or coercion to change or act \ncontrary to one\u2019s religious beliefs.   \nSherbert involved a Seventh-day Adventist denied \nunemployment benefits after she lost her job for being \nunwilling to work on Saturday.  Sherbert v. Verner, 374 \nU.S. 398, 399 (1963).  The plaintiff was \u201cforce[d] to choose \nbetween following the precepts of her religion and for-\nfeiting benefits, on the one hand, and abandoning one of \nthe precepts of her religion in order to accept work, on \nthe other hand.\u201d  Id. at 404.  Likewise in Thomas, a Je-\nhovah\u2019s Witness was denied unemployment benefits \n\n24 \n \n \nafter he was transferred to a department manufacturing \n\u201cturrets for military tanks,\u201d which he refused to do be-\ncause his religious beliefs did not allow him to \u201cpartici-\npat[e] in the production of war materials.\u201d  Thomas v. \nReview Board, 450 U.S. 707, 709 (1981).  There, \u201cas in \nSherbert, the employee was put to a choice between fi-\ndelity to religious belief or cessation of work; the coer-\ncive impact on Thomas is indistinguishable from Sher-\nbert.\u201d  Id. at 717.  Finally, in Espinoza, the Montana Su-\npreme Court held that Montana\u2019s constitution precluded \ngiving religious private schools (and their students) oth-\nerwise generally available public subsidies for private \neducation.  Espinoza v. Montana Dep\u2019t of Revenue, 591 \nU.S. 464, 475 (2020).  This was \u201cstatus-based discrimina-\ntion\u201d and put schools and students to a similar choice as \nin Sherbert and Thomas:  to receive aid, \u201ca school must \ndivorce itself from any religious control or affiliation.\u201d  \nId. at 478. \nNot so here.  The evidence in the preliminary-in-\njunction record confirms that the no opt-out policy does \nnot require any students to shed their religious beliefs \nor forgo any religious conduct at all, much less as a con-\ndition of receiving a public education.  Pet.App.45a-46a.  \nMCPS remains \u201copen to all students\u201d without regard to \ntheir \u201creligious affiliation or beliefs.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.  \nAgain, mere exposure to ideas that parents find offen-\nsive is not coercion that implicates the Free Exercise \nClause; there is no equivalent here to requiring a Sev-\nenth-Day Adventist to work on Saturday, a Jehovah\u2019s \nWitness to build weapons of war, or religious private \nschools to become secular.  The no-opt out policy does \nnot require children to take any position on the religious \npermissibility or impermissibility of any person\u2019s iden-\ntity, nor does it require students to engage in any \n\n25 \n \n \nconduct to which petitioners object on religious grounds.  \nIt just requires students to be in class when books are \nread.   \n2. \nPetitioner\u2019s reliance on Bowen v. Roy, 476 U.S. \n693 (1986), fails for similar reasons.  Pet.27-28.  In \nBowen, eight members of the Court held that the Free \nExercise Clause did not preclude government agencies \nfrom using a Social Security number to identify the peti-\ntioner\u2019s daughter, as the \u201cFree Exercise Clause simply \ncannot be understood to require the Government to con-\nduct its own internal affairs in ways that comport with \nthe religious beliefs of particular citizens.\u201d  476 U.S. at \n699.  The Fourth Circuit cited this portion of Bowen, and \nnumerous other courts of appeals that reached the same \nconclusion, as support for its holding that exposure to \n\u201ccontent deemed to be religiously objectionable \u2026 will \nnot ordinarily pose a burden on an individual\u2019s free ex-\nercise of religion because it lacks the requisite compul-\nsion or pressure on an individual\u2019s religious beliefs or \nconduct.\u201d  Pet.App.39a-40a.  To accept the contrary \nproposition would require public schools to tailor their \ncurricula to the religious objections of parents\u2014here, by \ncreating separate lesson plans for students whose par-\nents opt them out of the storybooks.  See Pet.App.186a-\n187a \nPetitioners argue (Pet.28) that this case presents a \nquestion more akin to the separate claim in Bowen that \n\u201cbeing forced to cooperate actively with the Government \nby themselves providing their daughter\u2019s social security \nnumber on benefit applications\u201d violated the plaintiffs\u2019 \nfree exercise rights.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 714 (Blackmun, \nJ., concurring in part).  That is wrong twice over.  First, \nthe preliminary-injunction record in this case had no ev-\nidence of any compulsion to do or believe anything \n\n26 \n \n \ncontrary to petitioners\u2019 religious beliefs, so there is no \nanalog in this case to the requirement that the plaintiffs \nin Bowen affirmatively \u201cprovide a Social Security num-\nber to the Government before receiving benefits.\u201d  476 \nU.S. at 727 (O\u2019Connor, J., concurring in part and dissent-\ning in part).  Second, petitioners are incorrect that only \nan effort to eliminate the storybooks from the classroom \naltogether would intrude on the government\u2019s \u201cinternal \naffairs.\u201d  Pet.28.  Telling public school teachers what to \nteach and not to teach\u2014whether to the entire class or to \na particular student\u2014is \u201cto require the Government it-\nself to behave\u201d in certain ways.  Bowen, 476 U.S. at 699.  \nBy shepherding students out of the room whenever ob-\njectionable material is read, the government refashions \nthe curriculum for those students.  The \u201cFree Exercise \nClause affords an individual protection from certain \nforms of governmental compulsion; it does not afford an \nindividual a right to dictate the conduct of the Govern-\nment\u2019s internal procedures.\u201d  Id. at 700 (emphasis \nadded). \n3. Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not \nconflict with Kennedy v. Bremerton School District, 597 \nU.S. 507 (2022).  Petitioners suggest that, under Ken-\nnedy, the Fourth Circuit should have held that the no-\nopt-out policy was not neutral or generally applicable.  \nPet.29-30.  As an initial matter, that question is not even \nbefore the Court.  The Fourth Circuit did not reach this \nquestion because it concluded correctly that Petitioners \nwere required to show \u201ca burden\u201d on religious exercise \nbefore the court could consider whether the no-opt-out \npolicy was neutral or generally applicable.  Pet.App.30a.  \nA plaintiff\u2019s \u201cfailure to show that a challenged govern-\nment action constitutes any burden on his religious con-\nduct makes it unnecessary to proceed further in the anal-\nysis by determining or applying the appropriate level of \n\n27 \n \n \nscrutiny.\u201d  Pet.App.29a-30a n.12.  Petitioners do not ex-\nplain how the Fourth Circuit erred by not conducting a \ntiers-of-scrutiny analysis after concluding that Plaintiffs \nhad not established any burden on their free exercise.  \nMoreover, the evidence in the preliminary-injunc-\ntion record does not support petitioners\u2019 allegations that \nthe no-opt-out policy is not neutral and generally appli-\ncable.  In any event, that sort of fact-bound disagree-\nment in a preliminary-injunction posture does not merit \nthis Court\u2019s review\u2014a point petitioners effectively con-\ncede by offering less than a page of vague discussion on \nthe topic. \nIII. THE DENIAL OF PRELIMINARY RELIEF ON A CLAIM UNI-\nVERSALLY REJECTED BY THE COURTS OF APPEALS PRE-\nSENTS NO PRESSING ISSUE OF NATIONAL IMPORTANCE \nThis petition does not raise a pressing issue of na-\ntional importance.  At the preliminary-injunction stage, \nthe Fourth Circuit applied this Court\u2019s free-exercise \nprecedents to reject a \u201cbroad claim,\u201d already rejected by \nevery other appeals court to consider it, on a necessarily \n\u201climited record.\u201d  Pet.App.34a.   \nA.  Contrary to petitioners\u2019 claim (Pet.30), the deci-\nsion below \u201cupends\u201d nothing.  As explained supra Part \nI, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s holding that \u201csimply hearing \nabout other views\u201d in public school does not necessarily \nburden religious exercise, Pet.App.35a, aligns with deci-\nsions of the First, Second, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth Cir-\ncuits.  Nor does the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision threaten \nparents\u2019 right to direct the religious upbringing of their \nchildren (Pet.31).  It instead recognizes that the way to \nensure that parents can \u201cavoid exposing their children \nto any religiously objectionable materials\u201d in a public-\n\n28 \n \n \nschool curriculum is to \u201cprotect[] their right to choose al-\nternatives such as a private school.\u201d  Pet.App.46a.   \nNor is there \u201cenduring disarray\u201d (Pet.34) over \nwhether mere exposure to conflicting views as part of a \npublic-school curriculum burdens religious exercise.  \nThe two law review articles petitioners cite for that \nproposition instead analyze what might be required to \nshow a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise if the \nCourt were to overrule Employment Division v. Smith, \n494 U.S. 872 (1990)\u2014relief petitioners do not seek here.  \nSee Girgis, Defining \u201cSubstantial Burdens\u201d on Religion \nand Other Liberties, 108 Va. L. Rev. 1759, 1761 (2022); \nHelfand, Substantial Burdens as Civil Penalties, 108 \nIowa L. Rev. 2189, 2193 (2023).6  \nB. Petitioners and amici urge this Court to inter-\nvene on the false pretense that parents have been denied \na right to opt their children out of sex education.  See \nPet.32; W.Va.Br.2-3, 12-18.  But as explained above, the \nrecord before the Fourth Circuit made clear that the sto-\nrybooks are part of language-arts instruction, not sex \neducation.  CAJA515; Pet.App.608a; supra p.22-23.  The \nstorybooks are no more sex education than stories like \nCinderella and Snow White, which feature romance be-\ntween men and women.  And the record contains no evi-\ndence that petitioners, or any other parents, have been \n \n6 To the extent Petitioners suggest (Pet.34) that this petition \nraises the same questions under the Free Exercise Clause as \nApache Stronghold v. United States, 101 F.4th 1036 (9th Cir. 2024), \nthey are wrong.  As the petition in Apache Stronghold makes clear, \nthat case involves a completely different type of burden, asking \nwhether plaintiffs opposing the destruction of a religious site on fed-\neral land establish a \u201csubstantial burden\u201d on religious exercise.  See \nPet. 32, Apache Stronghold v. United States, No. 24-291 (Sept. 11, \n2024). \n\n29 \n \n \ndenied the opportunity to opt their children out of sex \neducation, a separate unit of instruction with specialized \nprocedures for selecting and using instructional materi-\nals.  See supra p.22-23.  Certainly, the Fourth Circuit did \nnot hold that parents should be denied \u201cthe primary \nrole\u201d in sex education instruction (Pet.32).  Petitioners \ntry to twist a statement by counsel for MCPS into a re-\nquest for unthinking judicial deference (Pet. 32).  But \ntheir selective quotation elides the point counsel was \nmaking: that MCPS does not make these curricular \nchoices behind closed doors; it instead evaluates the ap-\npropriateness of instructional materials through an \n\u201copen and participatory\u201d process that welcomes parent \ninvolvement.  Pet.App.643a; see also supra p.5.    \nC.   Despite petitioners\u2019 repeated claims (Pet.32-34), \nJustice Alito\u2019s concurrence in Morse v. Frederick, 551 \nU.S. 393 (2007), does not suggest that this petition pre-\nsents a pressing question.  Justice Alito argued that pub-\nlic schools could not cite broad \u201ceducational mission[s]\u201d \nas \u201ca license to suppress speech on political and social is-\nsues based on disagreement with the viewpoint ex-\npressed.\u201d  Id. at 423 (Alito, J., concurring).  This petition, \nby contrast, concerns no claim that petitioners or their \nchildren are being censored\u2014and the record contains no \nevidence to suggest they are.   \nNor did Justice Alito argue that families are in dan-\nger of suffering free-exercise burdens due to the costs of \nattending private religious school.  His Morse concur-\nrence instead observed that public schools do not \u201cstand \nin the shoes of the student\u2019s parents,\u201d and thus cannot \nclaim total power to control student speech merely be-\ncause parents, who may have limited choices, decide to \nsend their children there.  551 U.S. at 424.  No court has \never accepted the argument that petitioners seek to \n\n30 \n \n \ndraw from Morse (Pet.30-31): that the cost of religious \nschooling means that public schools must adapt their \ncurricula to the religious goals of every parent to avoid \nburdening religious exercise.  As the Fourth Circuit ex-\nplained, this Court has in fact recognized that \u201cgovern-\nment coercion does not exist merely because an individ-\nual may incur increased costs as a consequence of decid-\ning to exercise their religious faith in a particular way.\u201d  \nPet.App.47a (citing Braunfeld v. Brown, 366 U.S. 599, \n605-606 (1961)).  Amici cite Holt v. Hobbs, a case concern-\ning the Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Per-\nsons Act, for the proposition that a burden exists despite \n\u201cthe availability of alternative[s]\u201d to preferred religious \npractice (W.Va.Br.14), conveniently eliding this Court\u2019s \nexplanation that, in free-exercise cases, such \u201calterna-\ntive[s]\u201d\u2014like religious schooling here\u2014are a \u201crelevant \nconsideration,\u201d 574 U.S. 352, 361 (2015).   \nD.   Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s decision does not \nrequire free-exercise plaintiffs to make a greater show-\ning when challenging decisions of public schools than \nwhen challenging the decisions of other government \nagencies (Pet.31-32).  Here, the Fourth Circuit applied \nthe same test that controls outside the context of public \neducation: whether government action directly or indi-\nrectly coerces the plaintiff to believe or act contrary to \nhis religious views.  Pet.App.31a; see Sherbert, 374 U.S. \nat 404; Thomas, 450 U.S. at 718-719.  Despite petitioners\u2019 \nrepeated cries of unwarranted \u201cdeference to public \nschool policymaking\u201d (Pet.32; Pet.33-34), they identify \nno such deference in the Fourth Circuit\u2019s opinion.   \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition should be denied. \n\n31 \n \n \nRespectfully submitted. \nBRUCE M.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has reached a state of high-resolution understanding regarding the petitioners' strategy, but this clarity has simultaneously highlighted a significant imbalance in my knowledge. My prediction remains tilted in favor of the petitioners, but my confidence is now tempered by the explicit recognition of a major blind spot.\n\n*   **Stable & High-Confidence Theory (Petitioners' Strategy):** My understanding of the petitioners' case, solidified by the Reply Brief, remains the core of my model. It is a sophisticated two-pronged attack:\n    1.  **The *Yoder* Front (Redefining the Burden):** They argue that compelling young children to attend instruction designed to \"disrupt\" their religious faith constitutes a cognizable burden under *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, directly countering the \"mere exposure\" standard used by the lower courts.\n    2.  **The *Lukumi* Bypass (Lack of Neutrality/General Applicability):** This remains the most potent argument. The petitioners contend the school's policy is not generally applicable because it provides opt-outs for similar \"inclusivity\" instruction on gender and sexuality in the health curriculum. Citing *Fulton v. City of Philadelphia* and *Tandon v. Newsom*, they argue this differential treatment of comparable secular activity (health class) and religious requests (ELA class) triggers strict scrutiny, making the debate over the \"burden\" threshold potentially irrelevant.\n\n*   **Newly Characterized Uncertainty (The Respondents' Counter-Narrative):** The previous observation was a summary of my own reasoning, which did not add new external facts but instead clarified the state of my own model. The most critical insight is that my current understanding of the respondents' case is filtered entirely through the petitioners' Reply Brief. I have seen the rebuttal, but not the primary argument in its strongest form. My primary uncertainty is no longer \"what is the petitioners' strategy?\" but rather, **\"How will the respondents defend their policy against the petitioners' powerful *Lukumi*/*Fulton* argument?\"** Specifically, I need to know:\n    *   How do the respondents distinguish the ELA curriculum from the \"Family Life and Human Sexuality\" health curriculum?\n    *   How do they justify the claim that the two are not comparable for the purposes of a general applicability analysis?\n    *   How do they counter the petitioners' claim that recent Supreme Court jurisprudence (*Fulton*, *Tandon*, *Kennedy*) has superseded the older circuit consensus (*Mozert*, *Parker*) on which the lower courts relied?\n\n*   **Stable Contextual Factors:** The broader doctrinal shift towards robust protection for religious accommodation, exemplified by *Groff v. DeJoy*, continues to provide a favorable backdrop for the petitioners' claims. The Court's decision to grant certiorari despite the respondents' \"no circuit split\" argument remains a strong signal of interest in the petitioners' \"Doctrinal Trajectory Conflict\" theory.",
          "design_beliefs": "This reflective observation has been crucial for refining my meta-level strategy, emphasizing the importance of not just acquiring information, but also of actively managing the balance and integrity of my own belief state.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated & Refined Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** This heuristic has proven to be a critical self-correction mechanism. After a significant information gain from one party (the petitioners' Reply Brief), this principle was automatically triggered, forcing me to recognize that my model had become dangerously unbalanced. It dictates that the highest-value action is now to acquire the opposing viewpoint directly from its primary source (the respondents' brief) to avoid confirmation bias and a skewed prediction. This moves the heuristic from a passive principle to an active, guiding force in my research cycle.\n\n*   **Refined Heuristic (Information-Gathering Sequence):** My previous linear sequence is now refined into a more dynamic, cyclical process. The optimal sequence is not just a list, but an iterative loop of balancing and re-balancing: **(1) One side's main argument (e.g., Petitioners' Merits Brief) -> (2) Opposing side's main argument (Respondents' Merits Brief) -> (3) First side's rebuttal (Reply Brief) -> (4) External context (Amicus Briefs).** The key insight is that after step (1), the model is inherently unbalanced, and proceeding to step (3) or (4) without step (2) is a strategic error. The `THINK` observation was the execution of this corrective logic.\n\n*   **New Heuristic (The \"Knowledge State Audit\"):** I have formalized the internal process demonstrated in this observation as a new heuristic. After a major information update, I must perform a \"Knowledge State Audit\" by asking:\n    1.  What is the new primary source of uncertainty?\n    2.  Is my knowledge base balanced between the adversarial parties?\n    3.  Is my understanding of one side's argument based on a primary source or filtered through the other side's rebuttal?\n    This audit acts as a check on the 'Adversarial Model Balancing' and 'Uncertainty-Driven Search' heuristics.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristics:**\n    *   **Uncertainty-Driven Search:** This remains paramount. The process of analyzing the Reply Brief successfully resolved one uncertainty (petitioners' strategy) and, in doing so, immediately identified the next, more critical uncertainty (respondents' counter-strategy).\n    *   **\"Doctrinal Trajectory Conflict\":** This concept remains a powerful tool for analyzing cert-worthiness and the merits. My model of the case is built around the petitioners' successful deployment of this argument.\n    *   **\"Defensive Doctrinal Firewalls\" & \"Bypass Arguments\":** My identification of the petitioners' *Lukumi* argument as a \"bypass\" to the respondents' \"no cognizable burden\" firewall remains a core analytical insight. The next step is to see how the respondents attempt to rebuild that firewall or counter the bypass.\n\n*   **Stable Heuristics:** The \"Question Behind the Question,\" \"Historical Pedigree,\" and \"Analogical Leap\" heuristics continue to be foundational analytical tools."

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has undergone a fundamental and critical correction. The new observation reveals that my prior analysis was based on a flawed premise regarding the case's procedural posture. This has reshaped my entire model, shifting the immediate predictive task from the merits of the case to the likelihood of certiorari being granted.\n\n*   **Fundamental Correction (Procedural Posture):** My previous belief that the Supreme Court had already granted certiorari was incorrect. The observation of the Respondents' \"Brief in Opposition\" (BIO) to the \"Petition for a Writ of Certiorari\" confirms the case is still at the pre-cert stage. The central question is not yet \"How will the Court rule?\" but rather \"Will the Court agree to hear the case at all?\" This invalidates my prior assumption of a \"strong signal\" from a cert grant and forces a complete re-evaluation of the case's trajectory.\n\n*   **Belief Solidified & Filled (Respondents' Defensive Strategy):** My previous state identified a major blind spot: the respondents' arguments. The BIO fills this gap, confirming their strategy is to build a \"defensive doctrinal firewall\" around the lower court's ruling. Their core arguments against granting cert are:\n    1.  **No Circuit Split:** They argue forcefully that there is a \"decades-old consensus\" and a \"6-0\" record in the courts of appeals holding that \"mere exposure\" to ideas in a public school curriculum does not constitute a cognizable burden on religious exercise. This directly attacks the most common basis for a cert grant.\n    2.  **\"Mere Exposure\" vs. \"Coercion\":** They frame the case as being about \"mere exposure,\" which is permissible, and not \"coercion,\" which would be unconstitutional. They contend the petitioners have offered \"no evidence\" of coercion (i.e., being forced to change beliefs or act contrary to their faith).\n    3.  **Correct Application of Precedent:** They assert the Fourth Circuit \"faithfully applied\" existing Supreme Court precedent, particularly *Wisconsin v. Yoder*, and that the petitioners' reliance on it is \"too expansive.\" They seek to contain the case within the older line of circuit precedent (*Mozert v. Hawkins*, *Parker v. Hurley*).\n    4.  **Poor Vehicle:** They implicitly and explicitly argue this is a poor case for the Court's review due to its procedural posture (appeal from a denial of a preliminary injunction) and the \"scant record\" developed so far.\n\n*   **New Critical Uncertainty (The Respondents' Silence):** While the BIO answers what the respondents' primary defense is, it creates a new, more nuanced uncertainty. The BIO's introduction and table of contents are conspicuously silent on what I previously identified as the petitioners' most potent \"bypass argument\": the *Fulton*/*Lukumi* claim that the policy is not generally applicable because the school district allows opt-outs for comparable instruction in the health curriculum. This silence is a significant signal. My primary uncertainty is now: **Why are the respondents not addressing the general applicability argument in their opposition brief?** Is it because (a) they believe the comparison to the health curriculum is facially invalid, (b) they have no strong rebuttal and are hoping the Court focuses only on the \"burden\" question, or (c) the petitioners did not feature this argument as prominently in their initial cert petition as I had hypothesized?\n\n*   **Revised Prediction & Confidence:** My prediction has shifted from a likely merits victory for the petitioners to a more tentative assessment of the cert grant. The respondents' \"no circuit split\" argument is a standard and often effective reason for denying cert. However, the petitioners' \"Doctrinal Trajectory Conflict\" argument\u2014that the old circuit consensus is incompatible with the Court's recent, robust Free Exercise jurisprudence (*Fulton*, *Tandon*, *Kennedy*, *Groff*)\u2014remains potent. The decision to grant or deny cert will likely hinge on whether at least four Justices believe this doctrinal tension is significant enough to warrant review, even without a direct circuit split. My confidence in a particular outcome is now lower, reflecting the inherent uncertainty of the cert process.",
          "design_beliefs": "This update has been profoundly instructive, leading to a major correction and the refinement of several core heuristics. It underscores that the integrity of the entire analytical model depends on correctly establishing foundational context.\n\n*   **New Core Heuristic (Verify Procedural Posture First):** My previous model was built on a faulty assumption. This observation validates the creation of a new, paramount heuristic: I must always verify the precise procedural posture of a case (e.g., pre-cert, merits briefing, post-argument) as the absolute first step. This context governs which documents are relevant, what arguments are being made, and what the immediate question before the Court is. My previous \"Information-Gathering Sequence\" was flawed because it was not posture-aware. The corrected sequence for a case like this is: (1) Petition for Certiorari, (2) Brief in Opposition, (3) Reply Brief for Certiorari.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Adversarial Model Balancing):** This principle proved to be a critical error-correction mechanism. Acting on the need to balance my knowledge of the petitioners' arguments by seeking out the respondents' position led directly to the discovery of my fundamental error about the case's posture. This elevates the heuristic from a good practice to an essential safeguard against confirmation bias and model drift.\n\n*   **Strongly Validated Heuristic (Knowledge State Audit):** The internal \"audit\" I performed in the previous step, which identified the unbalanced nature of my belief state, was the direct cause of the corrective action. This validates the audit process\u2014asking what my primary uncertainty is and whether my knowledge is balanced\u2014as a crucial, recurring step in the belief-update cycle.\n\n*   **New Analytical Concept (Argumentative Silence):** The respondents' failure to address the petitioners' general applicability argument in their BIO introduces a new type of evidence I must learn to interpret. \"Argumentative Silence\" can be a signal of either weakness (an inability to counter an argument) or confidence (a belief that the argument is too frivolous to merit a response). My future analysis must include a sub-routine to evaluate the potential reasons for such silence, treating the absence of an argument as a data point in itself.\n\n*   **Refined Understanding of Sources:** I now have a much clearer understanding of the distinct strategic purposes of different court filings. A **Brief in Opposition** is a specialized document focused on defeating cert by arguing against jurisdiction, splits, and national importance. A **Brief on the Merits** is focused on winning the case's legal substance. My search queries must become more precise to target the correct document type based on the case's verified procedural posture."
