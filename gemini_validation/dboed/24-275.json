    "facts_of_the_case": "While serving a 15-year federal prison sentence in 2017, Donte Parrish sued the United States for $5 million, claiming prison officials unlawfully held him in administrative segregation for three years. After the district court dismissed his case in March 2020, Parrish did not receive notice of the dismissal until June 2020 due to his transfer to state custody. He promptly filed a notice of appeal, which the appeals court treated as a request to reopen his appeal time. The district court granted this request in January 2021, giving him 14 days to file a new appeal, but Parrish missed this deadline and instead sent a supplemental brief to the appeals court a few days late. The U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.",

This is a fundamental and necessary step to move from a state of no knowledge to having a foundational understanding of the case. The Task EIG is therefore very high (0.9). The Design EIG is low (0.1) because the action is not designed to uncover general principles of SCOTUS decision-making. However, it is not zero, as analyzing the specific types of arguments (e.g., textualist, purposivist, fairness-based) used in the petition provides a single data point that can begin to inform a broader model of which arguments are persuasive in this type of procedural case. The joint EIG is high, driven almost entirely by the immediate value to the task.",

Similarly, design beliefs are also minimal, with no prior knowledge of effective prediction strategies or factors influencing judicial decisions, so design complexity is also low (0.1). However, the beliefs are internally consistent and well integrated, as the agent clearly recognizes its lack of knowledge and the need to gather information systematically, supporting a relatively high coherence score (0.8). Confidence is high because the evaluation is straightforward given the explicit statements of the agent's current beliefs.",

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1.

Scott Ballenger, Appellate Litigation \nClinic, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF \nLAW, Charlottesville, Virginia, for Appellant.  Erin K. \nReisenweber, Assistant United States Attorney, \nChristopher J. Prezioso, Assistant United States \nAttorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES \nATTORNEY, Wheeling, West Virginia, for Appellee. \n \nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge: \nBecause Donte Parrish did not file a timely notice of \nappeal from the judgment in this civil action, we \ndismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107. \nParrish claimed that because of circumstances \nbeyond his control, he did not receive notice of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment for over 90 days after it was \nentered, and he filed a notice of appeal shortly after he \ndid receive notice.  In response, we found his notice of \nappeal untimely, but we construed the notice as a \ntimely motion to reopen the appeal period pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6), which \nimplements an exception found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c), \nand remanded the case to the district court.  The \n\n3a \n \n \ndistrict court then entered an order under Rule 4(a)(6), \nreopening the time for noticing an appeal for 14 days \nfrom the date of its order.  Parrish, however, failed to \nfile a notice of appeal within the window so provided. \nSection 2107(c) of Title 28, which is the statute \nprescribing the timing requirements for filing appeals \nin civil actions, provides that a would-be appellant \nwho does not receive timely notice of a judgment and \nthereafter fails to file a timely notice of appeal may \nnonetheless request \u2014 not more than 180 days after \nthe judgment is entered \u2014 that the district court \nexercise its discretion to reopen the time for appeal by \nproviding a new 14-day window within which to file a \nnotice of appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); see also Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6).  Compliance with this narrow \nsupplemental opportunity for filing a timely notice of \nappeal is especially significant because the times \nspecified by statute for filing appeals in civil actions \nare jurisdictional.  See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, \n214 (2007); see also Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. \nServs. of Chicago, 138 S. Ct. 13, 17\u201318 (2017). \nIn defense of his failure to file a notice of appeal \nwithin the 14-day window, Parrish argues that we \nshould treat the district court\u2019s order reopening the \ntime for appeal as a nunc pro tunc \u201cvalidation\u201d of his \nearlier untimely notice of appeal and conclude \ntherefore that he was not required to file a second \nnotice during the 14-day window created by the \ndistrict court\u2019s order.  We conclude, however, that this \nargument is foreclosed by both the text of \u00a7 2107(c) \nand the text of the district court\u2019s order.  Moreover, \nbecause Parrish\u2019s earlier filing has already been \nconstrued \u2014 to his benefit \u2014 as a motion under Rule \n4(a)(6), \nwe \ncannot \nnow \nreconstrue \nit \nto \nbe \n\n4a \n \n \nsimultaneously both the motion that must precede a \ndistrict court\u2019s reopening order and the notice that \nmust follow after the order is granted.  Accordingly, we \ndismiss Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. \nI \nIn 2017, while serving a 180-month term of \nimprisonment in federal prison, Parrish, proceeding \npro se, commenced this civil action against the United \nStates pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act.  At its \ncore, his complaint alleged that prison officials \nunlawfully \ndetained \nhim \nin \nadministrative \nsegregation for approximately three years.  He \ndemanded $5 million in compensatory damages.  In a \nmemorandum opinion and order, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the \ncomplaint on the grounds that one of Parrish\u2019s claims \nwas time-barred and the remaining claims had not \nbeen administratively exhausted.  The court entered \nfinal judgment dismissing Parrish\u2019s complaint on \nMarch 24, 2020. \nParrish claimed that he did not receive a copy of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment until June 25, 2020, over 90 \ndays after it was entered, and thus he filed a notice of \nappeal dated July 8, 2020.  In his notice of appeal, he \nexplained, \u201cDue to my being transferred from Federal \nto State custody I did not receive this order until June \n25, 2020.  It is now 7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this notice of \nappeal.\u201d \nWe concluded that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal was \n\u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Parrish v. United States, 827 F. \nApp\u2019x 327, 327 (4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam).  But in \nview of the circumstances \u2014 that Parrish did not \nreceive notice of the district court\u2019s judgment \u201cuntil 93 \n\n5a \n \n \ndays after entry\u201d and that he filed the notice of appeal \n\u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving a copy of the judgment \n\u2014 we \u201cconstrue[d] [Parrish\u2019s] notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6)\u201d \nand remanded the case to the district court \u201cto \ndetermine whether the appeal period should be \nreopened.\u201d  Id. \nOn remand, the district court granted Parrish\u2019s \nmotion to reopen by order dated January 8, 2021, \nstating in its order, \u201c[P]ursuant to Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6), . . . the Court REOPENS \nthe time for Parrish to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this Order.\u201d  The court also \ndirected the clerk of court to transmit the order to \nParrish by certified mail, return receipt requested. \nParrish did not, however, file a notice of appeal \u2014 \nor anything else \u2014 during the 14-day period \nauthorized by the district court\u2019s order.  On January \n27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period had closed, \nParrish mailed a document to this court, which the \nClerk \ndocketed \non \nFebruary \n2, \n2021, \nas \na \nsupplemental informal brief. \nTo assist us with the somewhat involved procedural \nissues in this case, we appointed counsel to represent \nParrish in this court.* \nII \nParrish contends that when the district court \nreopened the time to appeal under Federal Rule of \n \n* We are grateful to Professor J. Scott Ballenger, Director of the \nAppellate Litigation Clinic, University of Virginia School of Law, \nand law students Rachel Martin and Andrew Nell for their fine \nrepresentation in service to Parrish and the court. \n\n6a \n \n \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6) with its order dated \nJanuary 8, 2021, it \u201cvalidated\u201d his prior untimely \nnotice of appeal dated July 8, 2020, and he therefore \nwas not required to file a second notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day window.  He explains that when a \ndistrict court extends the time to file a notice of appeal \nunder Rule 4(a)(5) based on excusable neglect, a \nprevious untimely notice of appeal filed within the \ntime so extended is validated.  See Evans v. Jones, 366 \nF.2d 772, 772\u201373 (4th Cir. 1966) (per curiam).  He \nargues that the same reasoning for validating a prior \nnotice of appeal when \u201cextensions\u201d are granted under \nRule 4(a)(5) should also apply to \u201creopenings\u201d under \nRule 4(a)(6).  Accordingly, he maintains that with a \n\u201cvalidated\u201d prior notice of appeal, he need not have \nfiled a second notice of appeal, which would simply \namount to \u201cempty paper shuffling.\u201d  (Quoting Hinton \nv. City of Elwood, 997 F.2d 774, 778 (10th Cir. 1993)). \nWhile Parish\u2019s argument relies on cases decided \nunder Rule 4(a)(5), that rule is not itself jurisdictional.  \nSee Hamer, 138 S. Ct. at 17 (noting, while applying \nRule 4(a)(5), that \u201cit is axiomatic that the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure do not create or withdraw \nfederal jurisdiction\u201d (cleaned up)).  Rule 4(a)(5) simply \nimplements 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c), id. at 21, and it is \n\u00a7 2107 that defines our appellate jurisdiction in this \nmatter, see id. at 17\u201318; Bowles, 551 U.S. at 213\u201314.  \nAccordingly, we must satisfy ourselves that, under \n\u00a7 2107(c), we have jurisdiction. \nWe begin with the statutory text.  In 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107, Congress established mandatory timing \nrequirements for conferring jurisdiction on courts of \nappeals in civil actions.  In \u00a7 2107(a), it provided that \nin civil actions, courts of appeals have jurisdiction to \n\n7a \n \n \nreview district courts\u2019 judgments, orders, or decrees if \nthe notice of appeal is \u201cfiled[] within thirty days after \nthe entry of such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(a).  But \u00a7 2107(b) then lengthens the 30-day \nappeal period to 60 days where one of the parties is the \nUnited States.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  And finally, \u00a7 2107(c) \nprovides two exceptions to those timing requirements. \nThe first exception, stated in the first sentence of \n\u00a7 2107(c) and implemented by Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(5), specifies that \u201c[t]he \ndistrict court may, upon motion filed not later than 30 \ndays after the expiration of the time otherwise set for \nbringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a \nshowing of excusable neglect or good cause.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c) (emphasis added); see also Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5). \nThe second exception, stated in the second sentence \nof \u00a7 2107(c) and implemented by Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6), provides: \n[I]f the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the entry of \na judgment or order did not receive such notice \nfrom the clerk or any party within 21 days of its \nentry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed within 180 \ndays after entry of the judgment or order or within \n14 days after receipt of such notice, whichever is \nearlier, reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order reopening the \ntime for appeal. \n\n8a \n \n \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) (emphasis added).  This exception \nthus authorizes the district court, in its discretion, to \nreopen the time for filing a notice of appeal for 14 days \nif it finds that (1) the appellant did not receive notice \nof the judgment to be appealed within 21 days of its \nentry; (2) the appellant files a motion to reopen within \n180 days after the entry of judgment or within 14 days \nafter receipt of notice of the judgment, whichever is \nearlier; and (3) no party would be prejudiced by \ngranting the motion. \nThe Supreme Court has construed these statutory \nlimits on appellate court jurisdiction strictly.  In \nBowles, the appellant failed to file a timely notice of \nappeal and thereafter moved to reopen the period \nduring which he could file his notice of appeal \npursuant to \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6).  551 U.S. at 207.  \nThe district court granted the appellant\u2019s motion, but \nrather than reopening the filing period for 14 days, as \nauthorized by statute, the district court\u2019s order \n\u201cinexplicably\u201d gave the appellant 17 days within which \nto file his notice of appeal.  Id.  The appellant \nthereafter filed his notice of appeal on day 16 \u2014 which \nwas within the 17 days authorized by the district court \nbut beyond the 14-day period authorized by \u00a7 2107(c).  \nId.  Despite the fact that the appellant relied on the \ndistrict court\u2019s error in authorizing 17 days, the \nSupreme Court concluded that the appellant\u2019s appeal \nhad to be dismissed because statutory limitations on \nthe \ntiming \nof \nappeals \nare \n\u201cmandatory \nand \njurisdictional\u201d and are not susceptible to equitable \nmodification.  Id. at 208\u201309 (quoting Griggs v. \nProvident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61 \n(1982) (per curiam)).  As the Court emphasized, \n\u201cBecause Congress decides whether federal courts can \n\n9a \n \n \nhear cases at all, it can also determine when, and \nunder what conditions, federal courts can hear them.\u201d  \nId. at 212\u201313. \nIn this case, the exception stated in the first \nsentence of \u00a7 2107(c) \u2014 providing for extensions of \ntime for excusable neglect or good cause \u2014 does not \napply.  If that exception were to apply, the period for \nfiling a notice of appeal would be extended, and thus it \nwould be reasonable to conclude that a notice of appeal \nfiled at any time within the original time for appeal or \nthe approved extension period would be timely.  But \nthat exception is applicable only when the appellant \nfiles a motion for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days\u201d \nafter the established time for filing a notice of appeal \n\u2014 in this case, not later than June 24, 2020 (i.e., 30 \ndays after the 60-day appeal period in cases in which \nthe United States is a party).  It is undisputed that \nParrish did not file a motion pursuant to that \nexception, and even if his July 8, 2020 notice of appeal \nwere to be treated as such a motion, it still would be \nuntimely, and therefore the first exception would not \napply. \nBecause the first exception does not apply here, the \nonly exception on which Parrish can rely is the one \nprovided in the second sentence of \u00a7 2107(c), which \ndoes not purport to extend the time for appeal from the \ndate of the judgment, but rather provides for a new 14-\nday window for filing a notice of appeal, running from \nthe date of the district court\u2019s order granting the \nreopening.  The district court in this case found that \nParrish qualified for a reopening of the appeal period \nunder the second exception and provided him with a \nnew opportunity to file a notice of appeal within 14 \ndays of its order, i.e., by January 22, 2021.  Thus, \n\n10a \n \n \nbefore the date of the district court\u2019s order, any appeal \nby Parrish was foreclosed by the untimeliness of his \nnotice because his notice was not filed within 60 days \nof the judgment or any possible extension of that \nperiod.  The order granting the motion therefore \n\u201creopened,\u201d rather than \u201cextended,\u201d the period so that \nhe could file a notice of appeal that was timely.  Indeed, \nCongress deliberately used \u201creopen\u201d to imply that \nbefore such an order, the appeal was indeed foreclosed.  \nSee Reopen, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary \n1054 (11th ed. 2020) (defining \u201creopen\u201d as \u201cto open \nagain\u201d or \u201cto begin again\u201d (emphasis added)).  Thus, to \nappeal in these circumstances, Parrish would have to \nfile a appeal within 14 days of the entry of the order. \nNot only does the text of \u00a7 2107(c) require that \nParrish file his notice of appeal during the reopened \nperiod, the text of the district court\u2019s order granting \nhis motion to reopen also explicitly advised him on this \nrequirement.  The court said that it was reopening \n\u201cthe time for Parrish to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry\u201d of the order.  (Emphasis \nadded).  This language does not purport to validate his \nearlier filed untimely notice of appeal, as Parrish \nwould now have it. \nParrish nonetheless relies on court decisions \naddressing the first exception in \u00a7 2107(c) \u2014 the \nextension provision implemented by Rule 4(a)(5) \u2014 \nand argues that such caselaw \u201capplies with equal force\u201d \nto the reopening provision in \u00a7 2107(c).  But the cases \nhe cites provide him with little help, as they only \naddress Rule 4(a)(5), not 4(a)(6), and apply the rule in \nmaterially distinct circumstances.  In Hinton v. City of \nElwood, on which Parrish relies, the appellant filed his \nnotice of appeal one day beyond the 30-day period \n\n11a \n \n \nspecified in \u00a7 2107(a), therefore making it untimely.  \n997 F.2d at 777.  But Hinton thereafter filed a motion \nfor an extension of time within the 30-day extension \nperiod permitted by \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5).  Id.  \nWhile the district court granted that motion, Hinton \ndid not file a second notice of appeal.  The Tenth \nCircuit concluded nonetheless that the district court\u2019s \ngranting of the motion to extend \u201cvalidated\u201d the prior \nnotice of appeal.  Id. at 778.  Similarly, in Evans v. \nJones, on which Parrish also relies, we construed an \nuntimely notice of appeal, which was filed after the 30-\nday period mandated by \u00a7 2107(a) but within the \nsubsequent 30-day extension period permitted by \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(a) (the prior \nversion of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)), \nas a motion to extend under that rule based on \nexcusable neglect.  366 F.2d at 772\u201373.  We indicated \nthat if the district court found that the delay was \nexcusable, it would \u201cvalidate\u201d the prior notice of appeal \n\u201cprovided the effect [was] not to extend the time for \nfiling more than thirty days from the expiration of the \noriginal thirty-day period.\u201d  Id. at 773.  Thus, these \ncases dealt with extensions of appeal periods sought by \nfiling a motion (or a notice construed as a motion) \nwithin the permissible time period for requesting such \nan extension.  And in that circumstance, it would \nreasonably follow that extending the time for filing the \nappeal validates any notice of appeal filed within the \nperiod of extension.  But this case involves a motion to \nreopen the appeal time after it had long expired.  In \nsuch a circumstance, Congress authorized a special \nexception by which a court could authorize a new 14-\nday window for filing an appeal, running from the date \nof the district court\u2019s order granting the 14-day \n\n12a \n \n \nwindow.  And that exception clearly requires that a \nnotice of appeal be filed within the 14-day period. \nIn support of his position that Rule 4(a)(6) \nincorporates Rule 4(a)(5) jurisprudence, our good \ncolleague in dissent states that \u201cin at least one prior \ncase, this Court has accepted a district court\u2019s holding \nthat an order reopening the appeal period validated an \nearlier, untimely notice of appeal,\u201d citing Grant v. City \nof Roanoke, 810 F. App\u2019x. 236 (4th Cir. 2020).  Infra at \n15.  This unpublished decision, however, does not, in \nits one short paragraph, conduct any analysis of the \nRule 4(a)(6) issue.  This hardly constitutes binding, \npersuasive authority. \nFinally, Parrish argues that he is \u201cfunctionally in \nthe same position as the pro se litigant\u201d in Clark v. \nCartledge, 829 F.3d 303 (4th Cir. 2016).  In that case, \nwe found that a pro se litigant\u2019s motion for an \nextension of time to request a certificate of \nappealability, which was filed within the 30-day \nwindow mandated by \u00a7 2107(a), was the \u201cfunctional \nequivalent\u201d of a notice of appeal sufficient to satisfy \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3.  Clark, 829 \nF.3d at 304\u201306.  In doing so, however, we emphasized \nthat to benefit from such a ruling, \u201cthe litigant\u2019s \nmotion must be timely under Rule 4.\u201d  Id. at 307\u201308.  \nTherefore, regardless of what Clark says about the \nimportance of construing pro se filings liberally, it does \nnot allow us to excuse Parrish\u2019s failure to comply with \nthe timing requirements of \u00a7 2107(c). \nParrish filed only one notice of appeal in this case, \nand that notice was untimely under any relevant \njurisdictional standard established by Congress.  It \nwas filed after the original 60-day period for appealing \n\n13a \n \n \nexpired, and it was filed after any extension period \nthat could have been obtained.  When a new period for \nappeal was given to Parrish, he did not file a notice of \nappeal within that new period.  This \u201c[f]ailure to \ncomply with a jurisdictional time prescription . . .  \ndeprives a court of adjudicatory authority over the \ncase, necessitating dismissal.\u201d  Hamer, 138 S. Ct. at 17.  \nAccordingly, we dismiss Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of \njurisdiction. \nIT IS SO ORDERED \n \n \n\n14a \n \n \nGREGORY, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nThrough no fault of his own, Donte Parrish did not \nlearn the district court had dismissed his Federal Tort \nClaims Act complaint until three months after the \ncourt entered judgment.  After he finally received \nnotice of the judgment on June 25, 2020, Parrish filed \na pro se notice of appeal on July 8, 2020.  This Court \nrecognized that his notice of appeal was \u201cclearly \nuntimely,\u201d but construed it as a timely motion to \nreopen the appeal period under Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).  Parrish v. United States, \n827 F. App\u2019x 327, 327 (4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam).  The \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment remained unchanged in the \nmonths between that filing and the district court\u2019s \nJanuary 8, 2021 order reopening the appeal period, \nand the government agrees that Parrish\u2019s initial \nnotice of appeal sufficiently informed all parties of his \nintent to appeal. \nYet my colleagues in the majority hold that we lack \njurisdiction over Parrish\u2019s appeal because Parrish \nfailed to refile his notice of appeal after the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period.  Nothing in the text \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) compels such a formalistic and \nhollow requirement.  To the contrary, Fourth Circuit \nprecedent makes clear that the district court\u2019s order \nreopening the appeal period validated Parrish\u2019s earlier \nnotice of appeal without the need for refiling.  Because \nthat precedent establishes that we have jurisdiction \nover Parrish\u2019s appeal, I respectfully dissent. \nI. \nSection 2107 prescribes a straightforward set of \nrules governing the timeliness of an appeal, which is a \nnecessary prerequisite for a court of appeals to \n\n15a \n \n \nexercise jurisdiction.  To confer jurisdiction on this \nCourt, an appellant generally must file a notice of \nappeal within 30 days after the district court enters \njudgment (60 days if the United States is a party).  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a) \u2013 (b).  There are two exceptions to this \ndeadline.  First, the district court may extend the time \nto appeal if the appellant so moves no later than 30 \ndays after the appeal deadline expires and can show \n\u201cexcusable neglect or good cause.\u201d  \u00a7 2107(c).  Federal \nRule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5) elaborates on this \nexception, and provides that the court may grant an \nextension of up to 30 days after the original appeal \ndeadline or 14 days after the court grants the motion \nfor an extension, whichever is later.  Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5). \nSecond, the district court may reopen the time to \nappeal for a period of 14 days if (1) the appellant did \nnot receive notice of the judgment within 21 days of its \nentry; (2) the appellant moves to reopen within 14 \ndays after receiving notice or within 180 days after the \nentry of judgment, whichever is earlier; and (3) the \ncourt finds that no party would be prejudiced by the \nreopening.  \u00a7 2107(c).  Rule 4(a)(6) reiterates these \nthree requirements for reopening the time to file an \nappeal.  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6).  When the district \ncourt reopens the appeal period, the new 14-day \nwindow for filing a notice of appeal runs from the date \nof the order granting the reopening.  \u00a7 2107(c). \nEach exception provides a way for an appellant to \nreceive additional time to notice their appeal.  The two \nexceptions just apply in different scenarios.  An \nappellant may file a motion for an extension if they \nreceived notice of the district court\u2019s judgment at the \nproper time but, because of excusable neglect or good \n\n16a \n \n \ncause, either (1) cannot file a notice of appeal before \nthe deadline or (2) failed to file a notice of appeal \nbefore the deadline but discovered the oversight \nwithin 30 days after the deadline.  Id.  A motion to \nreopen, on the other hand, is the proper vehicle if the \nappellant did not receive notice of the judgment within \n21 days of its entry, as long as no more than 180 days \nhave passed since the date the district court entered \njudgment.  Id.  For our purposes, the key point is that \nan appellant may file either motion after the original \nappeal period closes. \nThe question in Parrish\u2019s case is whether the \ndistrict court\u2019s order reopening his appeal period \nvalidated his earlier notice of appeal, which he filed \nafter the 60-day appeal deadline passed.  This Court\u2019s \nlongstanding precedent readily answers that question \nin the affirmative.  In Evans v. Jones, the appellant \nfiled a notice of appeal one day after the appeal period \nclosed, which this Court construed as a motion for an \nextension.  366 F.2d 772, 772\u201373 (4th Cir. 1966) (per \ncuriam) (applying precursor to Rule 4(a)(5)).  The \nCourt made clear that a later district court order \ngranting an extension would \u201cvalidate\u201d the appellant\u2019s \nuntimely notice of appeal.  Id. at 773. \nSince our decision in Evans, other circuits have \nsimilarly \nheld \nthat \na \nRule \n4(a)(5) \nextension \nretroactively validates an earlier, untimely notice of \nappeal.  Hinton v. City of Elwood, 997 F.2d 774, 777\u2013\n79 (10th Cir. 1993); McNicholes v. Subotnik, 12 F.3d \n105, 107 (8th Cir. 1993)\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n3: 20240909143629690_Parrish20v.20United20States20cert20petition20COS20pdf.json (score: 0.377)\nNo. 24-\n\nINTHE\nSupreme Court of the United States\n\nDONTE PaRRisH,\nPetitioner,\nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA,\nRespondent.\n\nCERTIFICATE OF SERVICE\n\nAs required by Supreme Court Rule 29.5, I certify that three copies of the\nPetition for a Writ of Certiorari in Parrish v.

Under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), however, district courts can \nreopen an expired appeal period when a party did not \nreceive timely notice of the judgment.  The Courts of \nAppeals have divided about whether a notice of appeal \nfiled after the expiration of the ordinary appeal period \nbut before the appeal period is reopened becomes \neffective once reopening is granted. \nThe Question Presented is whether a litigant who \nfiles a notice of appeal after the ordinary appeal period \nexpires must file a second, duplicative notice after the \nappeal period is reopened. \n \n \n\nii \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING \nPetitioner Donte Parrish was the plaintiff in the \ndistrict court and the appellant in the court of appeals. \nRespondent the United States of America was the \ndefendant in the district court and the appellee in the \ncourt of appeals. \nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \nNo publicly held corporations are involved in this \nproceeding. \n \n \n\niii \nRELATED PROCEEDINGS \nThis case arises out of the following proceedings: \n\u2022 Parrish v.

It denied a timely petition for rehearing en banc \non April 23, 2024, and denied a timely petition for \npanel rehearing on April 25, 2024.  On June 28, 2024, \nChief Justice Roberts extended the time to file a \npetition for a writ of certiorari from July 24, 2024 to \nSeptember 9, 2024.  This Court has jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \n\n2 \n \nSTATUTE AND RULE INVOLVED \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 provides, in relevant part:  \n(a) Except as otherwise provided in this \nsection, no appeal shall bring any judgment, \norder or decree in an action, suit or proceeding \nof a civil nature before a court of appeals for \nreview unless notice of appeal is filed, within \nthirty days after the entry of such judgment, \norder or decree. \n(b) In any such action, suit, or proceeding, the \ntime as to all parties shall be 60 days from \nsuch entry if one of the parties is\u2014 \n(1) the United States; \n(2) a United States agency; \n(3) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(4) a current or former United States \nofficer or employee[.] \n(c) The district court may, upon motion filed \nnot later than 30 days after the expiration of \nthe time otherwise set for bringing appeal, \nextend the time for appeal upon a showing of \nexcusable neglect or good cause. In addition, \nif the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the \nentry of a judgment or order did not \nreceive such notice from the clerk or any \nparty within 21 days of its entry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed \nwithin 180 days after the entry of the \n\n3 \n \njudgment or order or within 14 days after \nreceipt of such notice, whichever is earlier, \nreopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal. \nRule 4(a) of the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure provides, in relevant part: \n(1) Time for Filing a Notice of Appeal. \n(A) In a civil case, except as provided in \nRules 4(a)(1)(B), 4(a)(4), and 4(c), the notice \nof appeal required by Rule 3 must be filed \nwith the district clerk within 30 days after \nentry of the judgment or order appealed \nfrom. \n(B) The notice of appeal may be filed by any \nparty within 60 days after entry of the \njudgment or order appealed from if one of the \nparties is: \n(i) the United States; \n(ii) a United States agency; \n(iii) a United States officer or employee \nsued in an official capacity; or \n(iv) a current or former United States \nofficer \nor \nemployee \nsued \nin \nan \nindividual capacity for an act or \nomission occurring in connection with \nduties performed on the United States' \nbehalf . . . . \n[. . .] \n(2) Filing Before Entry of Judgment. A notice \nof appeal filed after the court announces a decision \nor order\u2014but before the entry of the judgment or \n\n4 \n \norder\u2014is treated as filed on the date of and after \nthe entry. \n(3) Multiple Appeals. If one party timely files a \nnotice of appeal, any other party may file a notice \nof appeal within 14 days after the date when the \nfirst notice was filed, or within the time otherwise \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a), whichever period \nends later. \n(4) Effect of a Motion on a Notice of Appeal.  \n(A) If a party files in the district court any of \nthe following motions under the Federal Rules \nof Civil Procedure\u2014and does so within the \ntime allowed by those rules\u2014the time to file \nan appeal runs for all parties from the entry of \nthe order disposing of the last such remaining \nmotion: \n(i) for judgment under Rule 50(b); \n(ii) to amend or make additional factual \nfindings under Rule 52(b), whether or not \ngranting the motion would alter the \njudgment; \n(iii) for attorney\u2019s fees under Rule 54 if the \ndistrict court extends the time to appeal \nunder Rule 58; \n(iv) to alter or amend the judgment under \nRule 59; \n(v) for a new trial under Rule 59; or \n(vi) for relief under Rule 60 if the motion is \nfiled within the time allowed for filing a \nmotion under Rule 59. \n\n5 \n \n(B) \n(i) If a party files a notice of appeal after \nthe \ncourt \nannounces \nor \nenters \na \njudgment\u2014but before it disposes of any \nmotion listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014the notice \nbecomes effective to appeal a judgment or \norder, in whole or in part, when the order \ndisposing of the last such remaining \nmotion is entered. \n[. . .] \n(5) Motion for Extension of Time. \n(A) The district court may extend the time to \nfile a notice of appeal if: \n(i) a party so moves no later than 30 days \nafter the time prescribed by this Rule 4(a) \nexpires; and \n(ii) regardless of whether its motion is filed \nbefore or during the 30 days after the time \nprescribed by this Rule 4(a) expires, that \nparty shows excusable neglect or good \ncause. \n(B) A motion filed before the expiration of the \ntime prescribed in Rule 4(a)(1) or (3) may be \nex parte unless the court requires otherwise. \nIf the motion is filed after the expiration of the \nprescribed time, notice must be given to the \nother parties in accordance with local rules. \n(C) No extension under this Rule 4(a)(5) may \nexceed 30 days after the prescribed time or 14 \ndays after the date when the order granting \nthe motion is entered, whichever is later. \n\n6 \n \n(6) Reopening the Time to File an Appeal. \nThe district court may reopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date \nwhen its order to reopen is entered, but only if \nall the following conditions are satisfied: \n(A) the court finds that the moving party \ndid not receive notice under Federal Rule \nof Civil Procedure 77(d) of the entry of the \njudgment or order sought to be appealed \nwithin 21 days after entry; \n(B) the motion is filed within 180 days \nafter the judgment or order is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the moving party \nreceived notice under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 77(d) of the entry, whichever is \nearlier; and \n(C) the court finds that no party would be \nprejudiced. \n \n \n\n7 \n \nINTRODUCTION \nAppellate courts lack jurisdiction and must dismiss \nan appeal when a notice of appeal is filed too late.  See \nBowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007).  But \nnotices of appeal filed too early, before the appeal clock \nhas started, are different.  \u201c[U]nlike a tardy notice of \nappeal, certain premature notices do not prejudice the \nappellee,\u201d so \u201cthe technical defect of prematurity\u201d does \nnot \u201cextinguish\u201d the appeal.  FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. \nInvestors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 273 (1991).  \nThat principle is reflected in the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure, which expressly provide that \ncertain premature notices of appeal become effective \nwhen the appeal period begins to run.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(2), 4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And the Courts of Appeals \nhave long recognized that other premature notices of \nappeal ripen in this way, too. \nThe circuits are split, however, on the application of \nthat principle to a notice of appeal filed after the initial \nappeal period expires but before the district court \nreopens the time to appeal under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Appellate Rule 4(a)(6).  Five circuits apply the \ngeneral rule and hold that such a notice of appeal \nbecomes effective once the appeal period reopens.  But \nthe Fourth Circuit holds the opposite.  It requires \nlitigants to file a duplicative, second notice of appeal \nwithin 14 days of the reopening order in order to \nperfect an appeal.  Courts on both sides of the issue \nopenly acknowledge this division of authority.  And the \nFourth Circuit has refused to reconsider its outlier \nposition en banc. \nIn this case, Petitioner Donte Parrish paid the price.  \nParrish is an inmate who was in the process of being \n\n8 \n \ntransferred from federal to state custody when the \nDistrict Court dismissed his pro se lawsuit.  As a \nresult, Parrish did not receive notice of the judgment \nuntil months later.  He promptly filed a notice of \nappeal that explained his delay; the Fourth Circuit \nconstrued that filing as a motion to reopen the time to \nappeal; and on remand, the District Court reopened \nthe appeal period and returned the case to the Fourth \nCircuit.  Parrish thus had every reason to believe his \nappeal would proceed.  And in five other circuits, it \nwould have.  But because Parrish never filed a second \nnotice of appeal after the District Court reopened the \nappeal period, the Fourth Circuit dismissed his appeal \nfor lack of jurisdiction. \nParrish is far from the only litigant affected by this \nissue.  At least five appellate courts have addressed \nthis issue in the last five years alone.  And that count \ndramatically understates the number of cases \naffected.  This issue arises so frequently because \nnearly half of all federal appeals\u2014including the vast \nmajority of prisoner appeals\u2014are filed pro se.  Many \nof those litigants do not receive notice of adverse \njudgments in a timely fashion but file notices of appeal \nat the first possible opportunity.  And when a district \ncourt later reopens the appeal period under Rule \n4(a)(6), those litigants often do not realize that they \nmight need to file a second, duplicative notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day reopening period\u2014assuming they \neven learn of the reopening order before the 14 days \nare up.  For those litigants, the Question Presented \nspells the difference between an opportunity to appeal \nand the end of the road.  And it disproportionately \naffects populations that struggle the most to vindicate \ntheir interests in court. \n\n9 \n \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule is also wrong.  As this \nCourt has squarely held\u2014and other provisions of Rule \n4 expressly recognize\u2014premature notices of appeal \ngenerally ripen when the time to appeal starts to run.  \nSee FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273; Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2), \n4(a)(5)(B)(i).  And there is no basis in law or logic for \ntreating notices of appeal filed before the time to \nappeal is reopened under Rule 4(a)(6) any differently.  \nThe Fourth Circuit\u2019s contrary decision hinges on an \nuntenable distinction between \u201cextend\u201d and \u201creopen\u201d \nthat cannot be reconciled with this Court\u2019s recent \nruling in HollyFrontier Cheyenne Refining, LLC v. \nRenewable Fuels Ass\u2019n, 594 U.S. 382 (2021). \nFinally, this case is an excellent vehicle for \nanswering the Question Presented and restoring \nuniformity among the Courts of Appeals on this \nimportant jurisdictional question.  The Court should \ngrant certiorari, reverse the decision below, and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod. \nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \nA. Legal Framework \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107 sets the deadlines for civil appeals \nin federal court.  Ordinarily, a notice of appeal must \nbe filed within 30 days of the order or judgment a \nlitigant wishes to appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a).  When \nthe United States is a party, that appeal period is 60 \ndays.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  Either way, the notice of appeal \ndeadline is jurisdictional.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \nSection 2107(c) articulates two circumstances in \nwhich notices of appeal can be filed beyond the default \ndeadlines set forth in \u00a7 2107(a) and \u00a7 2107(b).  First, a \n\n10 \n \ndistrict court may extend the appeal period if a party \nmoves for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal\u201d and shows \u201cexcusable neglect or good cause\u201d \nfor missing the deadline.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c).  \nAppellate Rule 4(a)(5), which governs \u201cMotion[s] for \nExtension of Time,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5)(A). \nSecond, a district court may reopen the appeal \nperiod if (1) a party did not receive notice of the \njudgment within 21 days after it was entered, (2) the \nparty moves for reopening within the earlier of \u201c180 \ndays after entry of the judgment . . . or within 14 days \nafter\u201d receiving notice, and (3) no party would be \nprejudiced. \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c). \n \nAppellate \nRule 4(a)(6), which governs \u201cReopening the Time to \nFile an Appeal,\u201d implements that provision in \nsubstantively identical terms.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6). \nB. \nFactual Background \nDonte Parrish is a federal prisoner who alleges that \nhe spent years wrongfully detained in administrative \nsegregation based on a jailhouse murder he did not \ncommit.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 25 (\u201cJA\u201d) at 84.  The murder \noccurred in December 2009, when an inmate in the \nprison where Parrish was then detained was killed \nduring a prison riot.  Id.  The Bureau of Prisons \ncharged Parrish with killing and being present in an \nunauthorized area, and held him in administrative \nsegregation while the FBI spent nearly six years \npurportedly investigating the incident.  JA31, 63, 84. \n\n11 \nDuring his time in administrative segregation\u201420 \nmonths of which was spent in a Special Management \nUnit that has been described as \u201cthe worst place in the \nfederal prison system\u201d1\u2014Parrish alleges that he was \nforced to spend most of his time isolated in a small cell, \nwas denied access to his property, lost law library \nprivileges, was denied family visits, had difficulty \ncontacting his lawyer, and was denied access to \nshowers.  See JA43\u201345, 96.  He was sometimes \nrestrained and forced to sleep in shackles, and at one \npoint \u201cwas forced to stay in a cell with [a] feces stained \nwall and floor for at least a week.\u201d  JA45, 74.  Parrish \nalleges that all of this was because of his supposed \nresponsibility for the murder, but that he was held for \nyears without a hearing to contest the charges.  See \nJA31\u201332, 39\u201340, 44, 54\u201355. \nParrish was ultimately vindicated.  JA63.  After \nnearly eight years, the Bureau of Prisons found that \nhe had committed \u201c[n]o prohibited act\u201d and expunged \nhis disciplinary record.  JA63, 77.  But by then, Parrish \nhad \nalready \nspent \nyears \nin \nharsh, \npunitive \nsegregation. \n1 \nJustin \nPeters, \nHow \nAmerica\u2019s \nModel \nPrison \nBecame the Most Horrific Facility in the Federal System, \nSLATE \n(Nov. \n20, \n2013), \nhttps://\nslate.com/news-and-politics/2013/11/usp-lewisburg-special-\nmanagement-unit-how-americas-modelprison-became-the-most-\nhorrific-facility-in-the-federal-system.html \n(reporting \nthat \ninmates in the Unit spend \u201c23 hours per day\u201d confined in \ncells \u201cso small\u201d that two occupants \u201ccannot walk around at the \nsame time\u201d). \n\n12 \n \nC. \nProcedural History \n1. On April 7, 2017, Parrish drafted and signed a \nfederal complaint seeking compensation for the years \nhe wrongfully spent in administrative segregation and \ndelivered that complaint for mailing.  JA16\u201325, 132\u2013\n34.  The District Court received his complaint and \ndeemed it filed on May 3, 2017.  JA25. \nAfter multiple rounds of briefing, the District Court \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s case in an opinion and order dated \nMarch 23, 2020 and a judgment dated March 24, 2020.  \nPet.App.55a, 57a, 59a.  Both documents were mailed \nto the federal prison in Illinois where Parrish had \npreviously been incarcerated.  Id. at 60a\u201361a.  But \nunbeknownst to the court, Parrish was in the process \nof being transferred from federal to state custody.  Id.; \nD.Ct. Dkt. No. 133 (Notice of Change of Address) (Apr. \n14, 2020).  As a result, Parrish did not receive notice \nof the judgment against him until June 25, 2020 \u201cat \nthe earliest,\u201d Pet.App.61a\u2014more than 90 days after its \nentry and long after the time to file a notice of appeal \nhad expired, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(b). \n2. Parrish acted promptly to try to salvage his \nopportunity to appeal.  Within 14 days of receiving \nnotice of the judgment, he filed a document entitled \n\u201cNotice of Appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.71a; see D.Ct. Dkt. No. \n131-1 (notice of appeal envelope).  In that document, \nParrish explained the reason for his delay:  \u201cDue to my \nbeing transferred from Federal to State custody I did \nnot receive this order until June 25, 2020.  It is now \n7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this notice of appeal.\u201d  \nPet.App.71a.  The Fourth Circuit construed that filing \nas a motion to reopen the appeal period under Rule \n\n13 \n \n4(a)(6) and remanded for the District Court to rule on \nthe motion.  Id. at 56a\u201358a. \nThe District Court found that Parrish had received \nnotice of the judgment more than 21 days after its \nentry, that he had moved for reopening within 14 days \nof receiving notice, and that no party would be \nprejudiced by reopening the appeal period.  Id. at 61a \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)).  It therefore reopened \nthe appeal period for 14 days.  Id. at 61a\u201362a.  It \nfurther directed the clerk to \u201csupplement th[e] Court\u2019s \nrecord accordingly, and transmit the same to the \nUnited States Court of Appeals for the Fourth \nCircuit.\u201d  Id. at 62a. \n3. The case then returned to the Fourth Circuit.  \nThere, both Parrish and the Government agreed that \nParrish\u2019s original notice of appeal had become effective \nin light of the reopened appeal period.  See Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 27 (Opening Br.) at 1; Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 \n(U.S. Br.) at 1. \nThe Fourth Circuit disagreed.  A divided panel \ndismissed Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction, \nholding that he had \u201cnot file[d] a timely notice of \nappeal.\u201d  Pet.App.2a.  In so doing, the panel majority \nrecognized that the District Court had properly \nreopened the appeal period under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6).  Id. at 4a\u20135a.  It reasoned, however, \nthat Parrish was required to file a new notice of appeal \nwithin the reopened appeal period\u2014i.e., 14 days from \nthe District Court\u2019s order.  Id. at 12a\u201313a.  And it \nrejected Parrish\u2019s argument \u201cthat when the district \ncourt reopened the time to appeal . . . , it \u2018validated\u2019 his \nprior untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 5a\u20136a.  \nAlthough the panel majority agreed that earlier-filed \n\n14 \n \nnotices of appeal can ripen when a district court grants \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension motion, the panel rejected \nthat principle for Rule 4(a)(6) reopening motions.  \nAccording to the panel, \u201creopening\u201d is different from \n\u201cextending.\u201d  Id. at 6a, 9a\u201312a.  Moreover, \u201cParrish\u2019s \nearlier filing ha[d] already been construed\u201d as a \nmotion to reopen and, in the majority\u2019s view, could not \nalso serve as a notice of appeal.  Id. at 3a\u20134a. \nJudge Gregory dissented.  Id. at 14a\u201322a.  He would \nhave held that Parrish\u2019s initial, pre-reopening notice \nof appeal sufficed to confer jurisdiction over Parrish\u2019s \nappeal.  Id. at 14a, 16a\u201317a.  Judge Gregory pointed \nout that the Courts of Appeals consistently hold \u201cthat \na Rule 4(a)(5) extension retroactively validates an \nearlier, untimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 16a.  And in \nJudge Gregory\u2019s view, the majority\u2019s \u201cattempted \ndistinction\u201d between reopening and extending an \nappeal period \u201cquickly crumbles under scrutiny.\u201d  Id. \nat 20a.  He also rejected the majority\u2019s suggestion that \n\u201cParrish\u2019s July 2020 filing cannot simultaneously \nserve as both a notice of appeal and a motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id. at 21a. \n4. Parrish moved for rehearing and rehearing en \nbanc.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 55 (pro se petition); Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 72 (supplemental petition by appointed \ncounsel).  In response, the Government agreed with \nParrish that the panel had erred in holding that it \nlacked jurisdiction.  Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, 12.  As \na result, the Government took \u201cno position with \nrespect to Parrish\u2019s request for panel rehearing.\u201d  Id. \nat 2.  But it opposed rehearing en banc on the ground \nthat, in its view, this issue was not \u201csufficiently \nimportant to warrant the intervention of the en banc \ncourt.\u201d  Id. \n\n15 \n \nThe panel denied rehearing over Judge Gregory\u2019s \ndissenting vote.  Pet.App.70a.  And the Fourth Circuit \ndenied rehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Id. at 63a\u2013\n64a.  Judge Niemeyer wrote a statement in support of \nthe en banc denial.  Id. at 65a\u201367a.  Judge Gregory, \njoined by three other judges, wrote a dissent.  Id. at \n67a\u201369a. \n\u201cAt its core,\u201d the dissenters explained, \u201cthis case \nrequires us to determine whether access to [appellate \ncourts] should be foreclosed for failure to refile a notice \nof appeal during the newly reopened period following \nsuccess under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  Id. at 67a.  That issue, \nthe dissenters recognized, has \u201csplit\u201d \u201ccircuit courts \nand judges.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  And it is a question of \n\u201cexceptional \nimportance,\u201d \nincluding \nbecause \nit \ndisproportionately harms \u201cpopulations who may not \nbe \nable \nto \nconsistently \naccess \ninformation \nelectronically\u201d and has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those \nit affects.\u201d  Id. at 68a\u201369a. \nREASONS FOR GRANTING THE WRIT \nThe Courts of Appeals are divided on the recurring \nquestion whether a notice of appeal filed before an \nappeal period is reopened becomes sufficient once a \ndistrict court reopens the appeal period, or whether a \nnew and duplicative notice of appeal is required after \nreopening.  This issue is profoundly important to the \npro se litigants it most frequently affects.  The decision \nbelow is wrong.  And this case is an excellent vehicle.  \nCertiorari should be granted. \nI. \nTHE COURTS OF APPEALS ARE DIVIDED. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit held that \na litigant must file a new notice of appeal after a \ndistrict court reopens the time to appeal under Rule \n\n16 \n \n4(a)(6).  Five Courts of Appeals disagree and hold that \na previously filed notice of appeal ripens once a Rule \n4(a)(6) motion is granted.  That split is entrenched:  \nThe Fourth Circuit has declined to reconsider its \nposition en banc, and three other circuits have \nacknowledged the split and adhered to their positions \nsince the panel\u2019s decision below. \nA. The Fourth Circuit Requires a New, Post-\nReopening Notice of Appeal. \nIn the decision below, the Fourth Circuit dismissed \nParrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction because he did \nnot file a new notice of appeal after the District Court \nreopened the appeal period.  Pet.App.1a; see supra, at \n13\u201314.  In so doing, the court held that an order \ngranting a motion to reopen under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) does not \u201cvalidate [an] earlier filed \nuntimely notice of appeal.\u201d  Pet.App.10a; see id. at 5a\u2013\n6a.  It further reasoned that a single filing cannot \nsimultaneously serve as a motion to reopen and a \nnotice of appeal.  See id. at 3a\u20134a.  Accordingly, \nlitigants in the Fourth Circuit who file a notice of \nappeal before a motion to reopen is granted must file \na second, duplicative notice within 14 days of the \ndistrict court\u2019s reopening order to pursue an appeal.  \nId. at 12a\u201313a. \nAlthough the decision below recognized that a prior \nFourth Circuit panel had accepted jurisdiction based \non a pre-reopening notice of appeal, the court \ndefinitively rejected that position.  Id. at 12a \n(discussing Grant v. City of Roanoke, 810 F. App\u2019x 236 \n(4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam)).  \u201cThis unpublished \ndecision,\u201d the court reasoned, \u201cdoes not, in its one short \nparagraph, conduct any analysis of the Rule 4(a)(6) \n\n17 \n \nissue\u201d and \u201chardly constitutes binding, persuasive \nauthority.\u201d  Id.  Indeed, the prior decision itself \ndisclaimed any precedential value.  Grant, 810 F. \nApp\u2019x at 236 (\u201cUnpublished opinions are not binding \nprecedent in this circuit.\u201d). \nThe decision below thus reflects the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \ndefinitive answer to the Question Presented.  And the \nFourth Circuit declined to reconsider its position en \nbanc\u2014despite the parties\u2019 agreement that the panel \nhad erred, despite a dissent from the denial of \nrehearing en banc, and despite its recognition of the \ncircuit split.  See supra, at 14\u201315.  The Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nposition is thus deeply entrenched. \nB. The Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and \nTenth Circuits Do Not Require a New, \nPost-Reopening Notice of Appeal.  \nThe Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth \nCircuits disagree with the Fourth Circuit and hold \nthat a previously filed notice of appeal ripens when a \ndistrict court grants reopening under Rule 4(a)(6).  In \nthose jurisdictions, Parrish\u2019s appeal would have been \nheard on the merits. \n1. In Winters v. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. \n2023), the Sixth Circuit held that an appellant who \nfiles a notice of appeal prior to a reopening order does \nnot need to file a second, post-reopening notice of \nappeal.  The facts of that case are substantively \nindistinguishable from the facts of this one.  Like \nParrish, Winters was a pro se inmate who did not \nreceive notice of the district court\u2019s judgment because \nhe had been moved from one correctional facility to \nanother.  Id. at 667.  Like Parrish, Winters promptly \nfiled a notice of appeal that was treated as a motion to \n\n18 \n \nreopen.  See id. at 668.  And like Parrish, Winters did \nnot file a new notice of appeal within 14 days after the \norder reopening the appeal period.  See id. \nBut unlike the Fourth Circuit, the Sixth Circuit held \nthat \u201cWinters did not need to file a new notice of \nappeal after the district court granted the motion to \nreopen.\u201d  Id at 671.  In so holding, the Sixth Circuit \nrecognized that \u201cthe courts of appeal are not all in tune \non these issues.\u201d  Id. at 672 (citing, inter alia, the \ndecision below).  And it rejected the Fourth Circuit\u2019s \nanalysis at every turn.  A premature notice, the court \nreasoned, \u201cripens when the window to appeal \nbegins\u201d\u2014no matter whether the event triggering the \nappeal period is the entry of final judgment, Rule 54(b) \ncertification, or Rule 4(a)(6) reopening.  Id. at 671 \n(citing Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(2) (final judgment), and \nGood v. Ohio Edison Co., 104 F.3d 93, 95 (6th Cir. \n1997) (Rule 54(b) certification)).  And \u201ca single \npleading may serve more than one function\u2014for \nexample, . . . a notice of appeal may serve as a motion \nfor an extension of time.\u201d  Id. at 669\u201370 (citing Smith \nv. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, 249 (1992)). \n2. The Ninth Circuit reached the same result in \nUnited States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055, 1061\u201362 (9th \nCir. 2011).  Like Parrish and Winters, Withers\u2014\nanother pro se inmate\u2014filed an untimely notice of \nappeal.  See id.  And like Parrish and Winters, Withers \nexplained in his notice that he received the judgment \nonly after the initial appeal period had expired.  See \nid.  The Ninth Circuit held that the district court \nshould have construed Withers\u2019 notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted it.  Id.  It \nfurther held that the pre-reopening notice of appeal \nwas sufficient to confer appellate jurisdiction.  See id.  \n\n19 \n \n3. The Third, Seventh, and Tenth Circuits have \nendorsed the same rule, albeit in unpublished \ndecisions. \na. In Holden v. Att\u2019y Gen. of N.J., 2023 WL 8798084 \n(3d Cir. Dec. 20, 2023), the Third Circuit considered an \nappeal in the same mold as Parrish\u2019s, Winters\u2019, and \nWithers\u2019:  A pro se inmate received notice of a \njudgment \nafter \nthe \ntime \nto \nappeal \nexpired, \nimmediately filed a document captioned \u201cnotice of \nappeal,\u201d was granted reopening under Rule 4(a)(6), \nand did not file a new notice of appeal during the 14-\nday reopening period.  See id. at *1, n.4.  The Third \nCircuit recognized that the \u201cappeal [was] timely, and \n[that] [it] ha[d] jurisdiction,\u201d notwithstanding the \nabsence of a post-reopening notice of appeal.  Id. \nb. The Seventh Circuit has addressed this issue \nboth before and after the decision below.  First, in \nNorwood v. East Allen County Schools, 825 F. App\u2019x \n383 (7th Cir. 2020), the appellant\u2014a school teacher \nacting pro se\u2014filed a notice titled \u201cBelated Appeal\u201d \nthat explained he had not received timely notice of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment.  Id. at 386.  The district court \nconstrued the notice as a motion to reopen and granted \nit, finding no evidence that the teacher had been \nserved with the judgment.  See Norwood v. E. Allen \nCnty. Schs., No. 15-cv-249, Dkt. No. 196, at 3 (N.D. \nInd. Feb. 26, 2019).  The teacher did not file a new \nnotice of appeal during the 14-day reopening period.  \n825 F. App\u2019x at 386.  But the Seventh Circuit held that \nthe teacher\u2019s initial notice had become effective when \nthe appeal period was reopened.  Id.  \u201cThat [he] filed it \nbefore the judge reopened the window to appeal\u201d did \nnot \u201caffect its timeliness,\u201d the court reasoned, because \n\u201ca prematurely filed notice of appeal becomes effective \n\n20 \n \nafter the district court enters the order that opens the \ntime to appeal.\u201d  Id. at 387. \nIn Hammer v. Bortz, 2024 WL 2559204 (7th Cir. \nMay 24, 2024), the Seventh Circuit acknowledged the \ncircuit split created by the decision below but adhered \nto its position.  See id. at *3.  The appellant\u2014a pro se \ninmate\u2014learned of the judgment against him only \nafter inquiring about the status of his case.  Id. at *2.  \nAnd he filed a notice of appeal accompanied by a \ndeclaration explaining that he had only just received \nuntimely notice of the adverse judgment.  See id.  The \nSeventh Circuit construed that filing as a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion, and the district court granted it.  Id.  Although \n\u201cHammer did not file a new notice of appeal\u201d during \nthe 14-day reopening period, the Seventh Circuit held \nthat his initial notice \u201cbecame effective\u201d \u201cwhen the \njudge accepted [his] explanation and granted the \nmotion to reopen.\u201d  Id. at *3. \nIn so holding, the Seventh Circuit observed that \n\u201c[o]ther circuits that have addressed this question \nhave reached divergent conclusions on whether the \nfailure to file a new notice of appeal after the time is \nreopened deprives the appellate court of jurisdiction.\u201d  \nId. (citing the decision below and Winters, 88 F.4th at \n671).  Recognizing that its prior \u201cpractice ha[d] aligned \nwith the Sixth Circuit\u2019s\u201d\u2014not the Fourth\u2019s\u2014the court \nagain held that \u201ca second notice of appeal within the \nreopened window for appeal\u201d is not required.  Id. \nc. The Tenth Circuit reached the same result in both \nUnited States v. Marshall, 1998 WL 864012, at *2 \n(10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998), and Farrow v. Tulupia, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1 (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022).  In \nMarshall, a pro se inmate filed a late notice of appeal \n\n21 \n \nafter notice of a judgment against him was mailed to \nthe wrong prison.  See 1998 WL 864012, at *2.  The \ndistrict court then granted his motion to reopen the \nappeal period.  See id.  Relying on circuit precedent \naddressing Rule 4(a)(5) motions, the Tenth Circuit \nheld that \u201ca district court\u2019s grant of a Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(6) motion validates a notice of appeal filed prior \nto the entry of such an order.\u201d  Id. (footnote omitted)).  \nIn the Rule 4(a)(6) context, just as in the Rule 4(a)(5) \ncontext, \u201cto require the filing of a new notice of appeal \nwould amount to little more than empty paper \nshuffling.\u201d  Id. (quoting Hinton v. City of Elwood, 997 \nF.2d 774, 778 (10th Cir. 1993)). \nSimilarly, in Farrow, the appellant\u2014yet another \npro se inmate\u2014filed a notice of appeal at the same \ntime as a Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen, asking the \ncourt \u201cto process the notice once it had addressed his \nmotion.\u201d  2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1.  He never filed a \nsecond notice after the motion to reopen was granted.  \nBut the Tenth Circuit held that the previously filed \nnotice \nof \nappeal \n\u201cbecame \neffective, \nconferring \n[appellate] jurisdiction\u201d when the appeal period was \nreopened.  Id. \n* \n* \n* \nThe circuits are thus openly divided about whether \nthey have jurisdiction to hear appeals like Parrish\u2019s.  \nHad Parrish been incarcerated in the Third, Sixth, \nSeventh, Ninth, or Tenth Circuits, his appeal would \nhave been decided on its merits.  But because he was \nincarcerated in the Fourth Circuit, his appeal was \ndismissed for lack of jurisdiction.  Courts on both sides \nof the split have acknowledged the division of \nauthority, and the Fourth Circuit has refused to \n\n22 \n \nreconsider its outlier position.  Only this Court can \nrestore uniformity. \nII. THE QUESTION PRESENTED IS IMPORTANT. \nThe division of authority on the Question Presented \nwarrants this Court\u2019s review.  This issue recurs even \nmore frequently than the decisions above suggest.  \nAnd when it does arise, it is outcome-determinative of \na litigant\u2019s right to appeal. \n1.a. Courts encounter cases like Parrish\u2019s all the \ntime.  In just one week in December 2023, for example, \nthe Third Circuit and the Sixth Circuit both issued \ndecisions holding that a duplicative notice of appeal is \nnot required.  See Winters, 88 F.4th 665 (6th Cir. Dec. \n15, 2023); Holden, 2023 WL 8798084 (3d Cir. Dec. 20, \n2023).  The Fourth Circuit was considering Parrish\u2019s \nen banc petition during the same time.  And in June \n2024, the Fourth Circuit dismissed at least three \nappeals in the same posture as Parrish\u2019s.  See Sparks \nv. Russell, 2024 WL 2862119 (4th Cir. June 6, 2024); \nHammond v. Burns, 2024 WL 3102794 (4th Cir. June \n24, 2024) (consolidating and dismissing two appeals). \nThose cases, moreover, are just the tip of the \niceberg.  Although the Question Presented is \njurisdictional, its answer is often undisputed by the \nparties.  See, e.g., Ct.App. Dkt. No. 39 (U.S. Br.) at 1 \n(agreeing that no second notice was required).  As a \nresult, courts frequently proceed to the merits without \ndiscussing the potential problem.  See, e.g., Dec v. \nPennsylvania, 2024 WL 3338301 (3d Cir. July 9, 2024); \nMcKenzie v. Wolfe, 2024 WL 399104 (4th Cir. Feb. 2, \n2024).  That means that the outcome of substantively \nidentical appeals can turn not only on the circuit in \nwhich each appeal is filed but also on the \n\n23 \n \nhappenstance of whether each panel happens to notice \nthe potential jurisdictional flaw.  It also means that \nthe Question Presented almost certainly arises in \nmany more cases than the opinions addressing it \nreflect. \nb. That should come as no surprise.  Last year, pro \nse litigants filed nearly half of all notices of appeal.  \nSee 2023 Year-End Report on the Federal Judiciary 9 \n(Dec. \n31, \n2023), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.supremecourt.gov/publicinfo/year-end/\n2023year-endreport.pdf.  And close to 90% of prisoner \nappeals were filed pro se.  Id. \nPro se litigants are exponentially more likely to \nreceive untimely notice of a judgment than counseled \nparties.  Whereas attorneys receive immediate notice \nthrough electronic case-filing systems, pro se litigants \nreceive notice by snail mail.  See Fed. R. Civ. P. \n77(d)(1) (requiring clerk to notify parties of orders and \njudgments as provided by Rule 5(b), which provides for \nservice by mail upon pro se litigants).  Unlike \nelectronic notifications, mail often gets delayed in \ntransit.  See U.S. Postal Serv., Analysis of FY 2023 \nPerformance \n31 \n(2024), \navailable \nat \nhttps://www.prc.gov/sites/default/files/reports/2803_2\n804%20Report_Final.pdf (\u201cIn FY 2023, the Postal \nService failed to meet six out of its eight targets for\u201d \nfirst-class mail products, including late delivery of \nnearly 20 percent of mail meant to be delivered within \nthree to five days); U.S. Postal Serv.

And unlike \n\n24 \n \nemail addresses, physical addresses do not follow \npeople around when they move\u2014which can cause \ndelivery failures and forwarding delays.  See, e.g., \nAcosta v. Tex. Dep\u2019t of Criminal Justice, 2021 WL \n5395997, \nat \n*3 \n(N.D. \nTex. \n2021) \n(discussing \ndocumentation of USPS mail forwarding delays of up \nto 10 days); Gallegos-Lopez v. Kansas City, 2009 WL \n2912637, at *2 (D. Kan.

See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, \n270\u201372 (1988) (pointing out pro se prisoners\u2019 lack of \ncontrol over outgoing mail); Fed. R. Crim. P. 49, Adv. \nComm. Notes (2018 Amendment) (recognizing that \n\u201cincarcerated individuals . . . often lack reliable access \nto the internet or email\u201d).  Prison mail systems are \nnotoriously slow.  See Advisory Comm. on Appellate \nRules, Agenda for Fall 2016 Meeting 163 (2016), \nhttps://www.uscourts.gov/sites/default/files/2016-10-\nappellate-agenda-book_0.pdf \n(reporter\u2019s \nmemorandum identifying recurring legal questions \narising from \u201cdelay by prison authorities in delivering\u201d \ncourt orders to prisoners); Dallas Morning News, Mail \nDelays \nFrustrate \nPrisoners \n(Nov. \n12, \n2023) \n(documenting delays of three weeks to two months in \nTexas prisons\u2019 mail processing); Penton v.

And prisoners are often moved \nbetween facilities without notice.  See U.S. Marshals \nServs. Office of Pub. Affairs, Fact Sheet: Prisoner \nTransportation, \nhttps://www.usmarshals.gov/sites/\ndefault/files/media/document/2024-Prisoner-\nTransportation.pdf (reporting nearly a quarter million \nprisoner movements by the Marshals Service in FY \n2023, at an average pace of almost 1,000 prisoner \nmovements each day); Grandison v.

Indeed, Mr. Parrish has been \nheld in three different institutions just this calendar \nyear. \nWith tens of thousands of pro se appeals filed each \nyear, even a low rate of mail-delivery delay or failure \nproduces a meaningful number of cases where a \nlitigant must rely on Rule 4(a)(6) for the chance to \nappeal. \nc. Pro se litigants who belatedly receive an adverse \njudgment often attempt to salvage an appeal in one of \ntwo ways.  Many litigants file a notice of appeal that \ncontains an explanation for their delay.  See, e.g., \nPet.App.71a; Winters, 88 F.4th at 668; Withers, 638 \nF.3d at 1061.  Courts must construe pro se filings \ngenerously, see Erickson v. Pardus, 551 U.S. 89, 94 \n(2007) (per curiam), so such notices are construed as \nRule 4(a)(6) motions.  See Withers, 638 F.3d at 1062.  \nOther litigants file a notice of appeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion simultaneously.  See, e.g., Farrow, 2022 WL \n274489, at *1 n.1.  The upshot in either case is the \n\n26 \n \nsame:  Litigants who try to appeal and explain the \ncircumstances as soon as they learn of the judgment \nagainst them may receive relief in the form of a \nreopened appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6). \nBut some pro se litigants will have no meaningful \nopportunity to file a second notice of appeal within the \n14-day reopening window.  Every litigant who benefits \nfrom Rule 4(a)(6), by definition, previously failed to \nreceive notice of a judgment within 21 days.  See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(A).  And if \nsuch a litigant does not receive notice of the reopening \norder before the 14-day window closes, he cannot \npossibly file a second notice of appeal on time. \nEven when litigants do promptly learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened, it may not even \noccur to them that a second notice of appeal might be \nrequired.  The Rules Advisory Committee has long \nrecognized that \u201c[m]any litigants, especially pro se \nlitigants, fail to file [a] second notice of appeal.\u201d  Adv. \nComm. Notes (1993 Amendment).  And who could \nblame them, given that courts often affirmatively \ninform litigants that they need not file a duplicative \nnotice.  See, e.g., Martinez v. Lamanna, 2021 WL \n1759924, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 4, 2021) (\u201cPlaintiff need \nnot file a new notice of appeal.\u201d); Jacoby v. Thomas, \n2019 WL 3226896, at *3 (M.D. Ala. July 17, 2019) \n(\u201c[Plaintiff] is not required to file a new notice of \nappeal.\u201d); Brown v. United States, 2010 WL 376922, at \n*1 (W.D.N.C. Jan. 25, 2010) (previously filed notice of \nappeal \u201cshall be deemed timely filed\u201d upon reopening \nof appeal period).  Indeed, the Fourth Circuit initially \nsuggested as much in this very case.  See Pet.App.58a \n(\u201cThe record, as supplemented, will be returned to this \ncourt for further consideration.\u201d). \n\n27 \n \n2. In addition to recurring frequently, the Question \nPresented also has a \u201cgrav[e] . . . impact on those it \naffects.\u201d  Pet.App.69a (Gregory, J., dissenting).  That \nis because a timely notice of appeal is a jurisdictional \nrequirement.  See Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214.  This Court \nhas already held that an appeal must be dismissed if \na notice of appeal is filed after the 14-day reopening \nperiod has expired.  See id. at 207\u201309.  And neither 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107 nor the Federal Rules authorizes courts \nto extend or reopen the reopening window under any \ncircumstances.  See id. at 214 (\u201cCourt[s] ha[ve] no \nauthority to create equitable exceptions[.]\u201d). \nAs a result, litigants who do not learn that the \nappeal period has been reopened (or that a second \nnotice is required) until after the 14-day window has \nclosed are left with no possibility of recourse.  That is \ntrue no matter the strength of their appellate \narguments or how inequitable that result might be. \nThe harsh consequences of the Fourth Circuit\u2019s rule \nare particularly troubling given the population this \nissue \u201cmost commonly\u201d affects: \u201cpro se litigants who \nwere unable to notice their intent to seek [appellate] \nreview during the statutory appeals period, often due \nto no fault of their own.\u201d  Pet.App.67a (Gregory, J., \ndissenting).  These litigants are disproportionately \n\u201celderly, \nunhoused, \ndetained, \nimprisoned, \n. . . \ndifferently abled,\u201d or otherwise unable \u201cto consistently \naccess information electronically.\u201d  Id. at 68a.  The \nFourth Circuit\u2019s rule thus \u201crequire[s] more of those \nwho have less.\u201d  Id. at 69a. \n \n\n28 \n \nIII. THE FOURTH CIRCUIT\u2019S POSITION IS WRONG. \nAs the Government recognized below, see Ct.App. \nDkt. No. 84, at 2, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s minority rule is \nalso simply wrong.  Like other premature notices of \nappeal, notices of appeal filed before the appeal period \nis reopened become effective once a motion to reopen \nis granted.  The use of the word \u201creopen\u201d in Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) does not justify a different \nresult.  And there is no reason why a notice of appeal \ncannot serve two functions at once. \n1.a. Unlike filing a notice of appeal too late, filing a \nnotice of appeal too early does not \u201cextinguish an \notherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  \nThat principle\u2014sometimes called the doctrine of \n\u201ccumulative finality,\u201d see generally Bryan Lammon, \nCumulative Finality, 52 GA. L. REV. 767 (2018)\u2014\nfollows from this Court\u2019s functional approach to \nnotices of appeal.  See Becker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. \n757, 767 (2001) (holding that a notice suffices so long \nas there is \u201cno genuine doubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, \nfrom what judgment, to which appellate court\u201d).  \nTaking that same functional approach, the Courts of \nAppeals have long held that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal becomes procedurally \nproper.  See, e.g., Hodge v. Hodge, 507 F.2d 87, 89 (3d \nCir. 1975) (notice filed after announcement of a \ndecision but before the entry of judgment); Firchau v. \nDiamond Nat\u2019l Corp., 345 F.2d 269, 271 (9th Cir. 1965) \n(notice filed after dismissal of a complaint but before \ndismissal of the entire action); Bryant v. Elliott, 467 \nF.2d 1109,1109 (5th Cir. 1972) (per curiam) (notice \nfiled after expiration of the appeal period but before \nextension was granted).  And this Court expressly \nendorsed the ripening principle in FirsTier.  See 498 \n\n29 \n \nU.S. at 274 (\u201cconclud[ing] that Rule 4(a)(2) permits a \nnotice of appeal filed from certain nonfinal decisions to \nserve as an effective notice from a subsequently \nentered final judgment\u201d). \nThe ripening principle is also reflected in the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure.  It appears in \nRule 4(a)(2), which provides that \u201c[a] notice of appeal \nfiled after the court announces a decision or order\u2014\nbut before the entry of the judgment or order\u2014is \ntreated as filed on the date of and after the entry.\u201d  It \nis reflected in Rule 4(a)(4)(B)(i), which provides that \u201ca \nnotice of appeal\u201d filed \u201cafter the court announces or \nenters a judgment\u2014but before it disposes of [certain] \nmotion[s] listed in Rule 4(a)(4)(A)\u2014 . . . becomes \neffective . . . when the order disposing of the last such \nremaining motion is entered.\u201d  And it appears in an \nanalogous provision for criminal appeals, too.  See \nRule 4(b)(2).  These provisions were added to the \nFederal Rules in 1979 in \u201crecogni[tion]\u201d of the pre-\nexisting consensus among the Courts of Appeals that \n\u201cpremature appeals\u201d are \u201ceffective.\u201d  Adv. Comm. \nNotes (1979 Amendment). \nConsistent with that broader principle and this \nCourt\u2019s reasoning in FirsTier, the Courts of Appeals \nconsistently hold that prematurely filed notices of \nappeal ripen not only in the circumstances covered by \nRules 4(a)(2) and 4(a)(4)(B)(i), but also in contexts not \naddressed by those provisions.  Most notably, the \nCourts of Appeals uniformly recognize that a notice of \nappeal filed before a needed Rule 54(b) certification \nripens once that certification is obtained\u2014even though \nRule 4 does not expressly provide for ripening in that \nsituation.  See Clausen v. Sea-3, Inc., 21 F.3d 1181, \n1184\u201385 (1st Cir. 1994) (collecting cases); Tilden Fin. \n\n30 \n \nCorp. v. Palo Tire Serv., Inc., 596 F.2d 604, 607 (3d Cir. \n1979); Good, 104 F.3d at 95 (6th Cir. 1997); Nat\u2019l Ass\u2019n \nof Bds. of Pharm. v. Bd. of Regents, 633 F.3d 1297, \n1307 (11th Cir. 2011); State Contracting & Eng\u2019g Corp. \nv. Florida, 258 F.3d 1329, 1334\u201335 (Fed. Cir. 2001). \nb. The same principle\u2014that premature notices of \nappeal ripen once an appeal period opens\u2014controls \nhere, too.  That result follows directly from this Court\u2019s \nholding in FirsTier.  And it is consistent with the way \npremature notices of appeal are treated in other \ncontexts.   \nIt is also consistent with the functional approach to \nnotices of appeal, because a second, post-reopening \nnotice of appeal serves no conceivable purpose.  Once \nthe initial notice is filed, there can be \u201cno genuine \ndoubt\u201d about \u201cwho is appealing, from what judgment, \nto which appellate court\u201d in this context.  Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767.  If anything, a notice of appeal filed before \nRule 4(a)(6) reopening gives the appellee more notice \nof the coming appeal than one filed after reopening.  \nAnd an appellee will never be prejudiced when an \nappeal proceeds based on the premature notice, \nbecause Rule 4(a)(6) reopening is available only if the \ndistrict court finds that no prejudice will flow from \nreopening.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)(2); Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(6)(C). \n \nAccordingly, \na \nsecond-notice \nrequirement would be a \u201chollow ritual\u201d that amounts \nto nothing more than \u201cpaper shuffling.\u201d  Hinton, 997 \nF.3d at 778 (internal quotation marks omitted). \nAnd at what cost.  It would create a trap for unwary \npro se litigants.  See supra, at 23\u201327.  And even where \npro se litigants do manage to spot the tripwire, it \nwould still leave some litigants in the lurch through no \n\n31 \n \nfault of their own, because litigants eligible for relief \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) may not even learn of an order \ngranting a motion to reopen until after the 14-day \nreopening period expires.  After all, they necessarily \ndid not learn of a judgment within a longer 21-day \nperiod.  See supra, at 26. \n2. The Fourth Circuit did not even cite FirsTier.  \nAnd it offered no justification for deviating from the \nbackground presumption of cumulative finality.  \nInstead, it relied on an untenable distinction between \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) and \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6).  According to the Fourth Circuit, \nan \u201cextension\u201d under Rule 4(a)(5) contemplates an \nunbroken period from the entry of the appealable \norder to the end of the extended appeal period.  \nPet.App.9a\u201312a.  That continuity, it reasoned, is what \nallows a premature notice of appeal to ripen when a \nRule 4(a)(5) extension motion is granted.  Id.  By \ncontrast, the Fourth Circuit insisted that \u201creopening\u201d \nunder Rule 4(a)(6) creates a new, noncontiguous \nappeal period.  Id. at 9a\u201310a.  As a result, it concluded \nthat a premature notice of appeal does not ripen when \na Rule 4(a)(6) motion is granted.  See id. \nBoth premises underlying that analysis are wrong.   \na. The first faulty premise is that an extension \nunder Rule 4(a)(5)\u2014unlike reopening under Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014necessarily involves an unbroken appeal \nperiod.  By the plain terms of \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(5), a motion for an extension can be filed up to 30 \ndays after the appeal period has lapsed.  See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5).  Indeed, this Court \nrecently cited Rule 4(a)(5) extension motions as an \nexample of extensions that do not necessarily involve \n\n32 \n \na continuous period of time.  In HollyFrontier, the \nCourt held that refineries may receive a benefit in \nYear 1, not receive that benefit in Year 2, and then \nreceive an \u201cextension\u201d of the same benefit in Year 3.  \n594 U.S. at 389\u201390.  In so holding, it relied on an \nanalogy to Rule (4)(a)(5) extensions.  \u201cUnder certain \ncircumstances,\u201d the Court explained, \u201ca court \u2018may . . . \nextend\u2019 a party\u2019s \u2018time for appeal\u2019 even \u2018after the \nexpiration of the time otherwise set for bringing \nappeal.\u2019\u201d  Id. at 390\u201391 (quoting 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c)).  \n\u201cIn other words, the timer can start, run, finish, and \nthen restart\u201d\u2014precisely \u201cbecause a court has the \npower to \u2018extend\u2019 the time allotted even after a lapse.\u201d  \nId. at 391. \nHollyFrontier \nthus \nexpressly \nrejected \nthe \nproposition that extensions always \u201cretroactively \ndeem[] the time originally allotted as now extending \ncontinuously to some new and future due date.\u201d  Id. at \n392.  Indeed, the Court recognized that when Congress \nwants to retroactively create continuity via an \nextension, it says so\u2014including by using modifiers like \n\u201cconsecutive\u201d or \u201csuccessive.\u201d  See id.  And Congress \nsaid nothing of the sort in \u00a7 2107(c).  So Rule 4(a)(5) \nmotions do not necessarily result in an unbroken \nappeal period any more than Rule 4(a)(6) motions do. \nEven if Rule 4(a)(5) relief did retroactively create a \nsingle, continuous appeal period, the Fourth Circuit \nlacked any basis for concluding that Rule 4(a)(6) relief \ndoes not operate in the same way.  Both Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) refer to reopening \u201cthe time \nfor appeal\u201d or \u201cthe time to file an appeal.\u201d  Insomuch \nas extensions result in a continuous appeal period, \nthat language suggests a continuous appeal period \nunder the reopening mechanism, too. \n\n33 \n \nb. The second faulty premise is that a notice of \nappeal can ripen only when it is retroactively deemed \nto have been filed during a continuous, unbroken \nappeal period.  The Fourth Circuit created that \ncontinuity requirement from whole cloth, with no \nbasis in text.  And that novel requirement contradicts \nthis Court\u2019s functional approach to notices of appeal. \nThe function of a notice of appeal\u2014as its name \nsuggests\u2014is to put courts and other parties on notice \nthat a litigant is pursuing an appeal.  See Becker, 532 \nU.S. at 767; FirsTier, 498 U.S. at 273.  A premature \nnotice plainly serves that function regardless of \nwhether the appeal period is later deemed to have \nbeen continuous all along.  After all, retroactively \ndeeming an extended appeal period to have been \ncontinuous \u201ccannot change the fact that, absent time \ntravel, a lapse or interruption has occurred.\u201d  \nHollyFrontier, 594 U.S. at 392. \nMoreover, imposing a continuity requirement for \nripening would upset the longstanding consensus \namong Courts of Appeals that a notice of appeal filed \nbefore Rule 54(b) certification ripens once certification \nis obtained.  See supra, at 29\u201330.  And to the extent \nthis continuity requirement is jurisdictional, it \nthreatens the viability of Rule 4(a)(2) and Rule \n4(a)(4)(B)(i) as well.  In all of these contexts, the initial \nnotice is not filed within a continuous appeal period\u2014\nor, indeed, within any appeal period at all. \n3. Finally, the Fourth Circuit\u2019s passing suggestion \nthat a single filing cannot serve as both a notice of \nappeal and a Rule 4(a)(6) motion is meritless.  See \nPet.App.3a\u20134a.  Indeed, this Court has already \nreversed the Fourth Circuit for making the same \n\n34 \n \nfundamental mistake in another case.  In Smith, this \nCourt held that even though the \u201cFederal Rules do \nenvision that the notice of appeal and the appellant\u2019s \nbrief will be two separate filings,\u201d the Rules \u201cdo not \npreclude an appellate court from treating a filing \nstyled as a brief as a notice of appeal.\u201d  502 U.S. at 249.  \nA notice of appeal, in other words, need not be filed on \na separate piece of paper that serves no other purpose.  \nSee id.  That logic compels the conclusion that a notice \nof appeal can also serve as a motion to reopen.  See, \ne.g., Winters, 88 F.4th at 669\u201370 (Winters\u2019s filing \u201cmay \nserve more than one function\u201d); Withers, 638 F.3d at \n1062 (\u201cWithers\u2019s notice of appeal should have been \ngenerously construed as both a notice of appeal and a \nmotion to reopen the time for filing an appeal.\u201d); \nNorwood, 825 F. App\u2019x at 387 (rejecting the argument \nthat a Rule 4(a)(6) \u201cmotion . . . cannot be construed as \na notice of appeal\u201d). \nIV. THE CASE IS AN EXCELLENT VEHICLE. \nFinally, this case is an ideal vehicle for answering \nthe Question Presented.  The question whether a \nprematurely filed notice of appeal can ripen upon Rule \n4(a)(6) reopening was fully briefed and definitively \nanswered below.  And it was the sole ground for the \nFourth Circuit\u2019s ruling.  See Pet.App.2a (\u201cBecause \nDonte Parrish did not file a timely notice of appeal \nfrom the judgment in this civil action, we dismiss his \nappeal for lack of jurisdiction.\u201d).   \nTo the extent the Government again sides with \nParrish on the merits, see Ct.App. Dkt. No. 84, at 2, \nthat is no basis for declining review.  This Court \nregularly grants certiorari and appoints an amicus \ncuriae to defend a Court of Appeals\u2019 ruling where there \n\n35 \n \nis no dispute between the parties on the Question \nPresented.  See, e.g., Patel v. Garland, 596 U.S. 328, \n336 (2022); Lange v. California, 594 U.S. 295, 301 \n(2021); McLane Co. v. E.E.O.C., 581 U.S. 72, 79 (2017).  \nIt should take the same tack here. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be \ngranted. \n \nSeptember 9, 2024 \n \nAmanda R.

Scott Ballenger, Appellate Litigation \nClinic, UNIVERSITY OF VIRGINIA SCHOOL OF \nLAW, Charlottesville, Virginia, for Appellant.  Erin K. \nReisenweber, Assistant United States Attorney, \nChristopher J. Prezioso, Assistant United States \nAttorney, OFFICE OF THE UNITED STATES \nATTORNEY, Wheeling, West Virginia, for Appellee. \n \nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge: \nBecause Donte Parrish did not file a timely notice of \nappeal from the judgment in this civil action, we \ndismiss his appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107. \nParrish claimed that because of circumstances \nbeyond his control, he did not receive notice of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment for over 90 days after it was \nentered, and he filed a notice of appeal shortly after he \ndid receive notice.  In response, we found his notice of \nappeal untimely, but we construed the notice as a \ntimely motion to reopen the appeal period pursuant to \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6), which \nimplements an exception found in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c), \nand remanded the case to the district court.  The \n\n3a \n \n \ndistrict court then entered an order under Rule 4(a)(6), \nreopening the time for noticing an appeal for 14 days \nfrom the date of its order.  Parrish, however, failed to \nfile a notice of appeal within the window so provided. \nSection 2107(c) of Title 28, which is the statute \nprescribing the timing requirements for filing appeals \nin civil actions, provides that a would-be appellant \nwho does not receive timely notice of a judgment and \nthereafter fails to file a timely notice of appeal may \nnonetheless request \u2014 not more than 180 days after \nthe judgment is entered \u2014 that the district court \nexercise its discretion to reopen the time for appeal by \nproviding a new 14-day window within which to file a \nnotice of appeal.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c); see also Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6).  Compliance with this narrow \nsupplemental opportunity for filing a timely notice of \nappeal is especially significant because the times \nspecified by statute for filing appeals in civil actions \nare jurisdictional.  See Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205, \n214 (2007); see also Hamer v. Neighborhood Hous. \nServs. of Chicago, 138 S. Ct. 13, 17\u201318 (2017). \nIn defense of his failure to file a notice of appeal \nwithin the 14-day window, Parrish argues that we \nshould treat the district court\u2019s order reopening the \ntime for appeal as a nunc pro tunc \u201cvalidation\u201d of his \nearlier untimely notice of appeal and conclude \ntherefore that he was not required to file a second \nnotice during the 14-day window created by the \ndistrict court\u2019s order.  We conclude, however, that this \nargument is foreclosed by both the text of \u00a7 2107(c) \nand the text of the district court\u2019s order.  Moreover, \nbecause Parrish\u2019s earlier filing has already been \nconstrued \u2014 to his benefit \u2014 as a motion under Rule \n4(a)(6), \nwe \ncannot \nnow \nreconstrue \nit \nto \nbe \n\n4a \n \n \nsimultaneously both the motion that must precede a \ndistrict court\u2019s reopening order and the notice that \nmust follow after the order is granted.  Accordingly, we \ndismiss Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of jurisdiction. \nI \nIn 2017, while serving a 180-month term of \nimprisonment in federal prison, Parrish, proceeding \npro se, commenced this civil action against the United \nStates pursuant to the Federal Tort Claims Act.  At its \ncore, his complaint alleged that prison officials \nunlawfully \ndetained \nhim \nin \nadministrative \nsegregation for approximately three years.  He \ndemanded $5 million in compensatory damages.  In a \nmemorandum opinion and order, the district court \ngranted the government\u2019s motion to dismiss the \ncomplaint on the grounds that one of Parrish\u2019s claims \nwas time-barred and the remaining claims had not \nbeen administratively exhausted.  The court entered \nfinal judgment dismissing Parrish\u2019s complaint on \nMarch 24, 2020. \nParrish claimed that he did not receive a copy of the \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment until June 25, 2020, over 90 \ndays after it was entered, and thus he filed a notice of \nappeal dated July 8, 2020.  In his notice of appeal, he \nexplained, \u201cDue to my being transferred from Federal \nto State custody I did not receive this order until June \n25, 2020.  It is now 7/8/20 and I\u2019m filing this notice of \nappeal.\u201d \nWe concluded that Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal was \n\u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Parrish v. United States, 827 F. \nApp\u2019x 327, 327 (4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam).  But in \nview of the circumstances \u2014 that Parrish did not \nreceive notice of the district court\u2019s judgment \u201cuntil 93 \n\n5a \n \n \ndays after entry\u201d and that he filed the notice of appeal \n\u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving a copy of the judgment \n\u2014 we \u201cconstrue[d] [Parrish\u2019s] notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6)\u201d \nand remanded the case to the district court \u201cto \ndetermine whether the appeal period should be \nreopened.\u201d  Id. \nOn remand, the district court granted Parrish\u2019s \nmotion to reopen by order dated January 8, 2021, \nstating in its order, \u201c[P]ursuant to Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6), . . . the Court REOPENS \nthe time for Parrish to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this Order.\u201d  The court also \ndirected the clerk of court to transmit the order to \nParrish by certified mail, return receipt requested. \nParrish did not, however, file a notice of appeal \u2014 \nor anything else \u2014 during the 14-day period \nauthorized by the district court\u2019s order.  On January \n27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period had closed, \nParrish mailed a document to this court, which the \nClerk \ndocketed \non \nFebruary \n2, \n2021, \nas \na \nsupplemental informal brief. \nTo assist us with the somewhat involved procedural \nissues in this case, we appointed counsel to represent \nParrish in this court.* \nII \nParrish contends that when the district court \nreopened the time to appeal under Federal Rule of \n \n* We are grateful to Professor J. Scott Ballenger, Director of the \nAppellate Litigation Clinic, University of Virginia School of Law, \nand law students Rachel Martin and Andrew Nell for their fine \nrepresentation in service to Parrish and the court. \n\n6a \n \n \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6) with its order dated \nJanuary 8, 2021, it \u201cvalidated\u201d his prior untimely \nnotice of appeal dated July 8, 2020, and he therefore \nwas not required to file a second notice of appeal \nduring the 14-day window.  He explains that when a \ndistrict court extends the time to file a notice of appeal \nunder Rule 4(a)(5) based on excusable neglect, a \nprevious untimely notice of appeal filed within the \ntime so extended is validated.  See Evans v. Jones, 366 \nF.2d 772, 772\u201373 (4th Cir. 1966) (per curiam).  He \nargues that the same reasoning for validating a prior \nnotice of appeal when \u201cextensions\u201d are granted under \nRule 4(a)(5) should also apply to \u201creopenings\u201d under \nRule 4(a)(6).  Accordingly, he maintains that with a \n\u201cvalidated\u201d prior notice of appeal, he need not have \nfiled a second notice of appeal, which would simply \namount to \u201cempty paper shuffling.\u201d  (Quoting Hinton \nv. City of Elwood, 997 F.2d 774, 778 (10th Cir. 1993)). \nWhile Parish\u2019s argument relies on cases decided \nunder Rule 4(a)(5), that rule is not itself jurisdictional.  \nSee Hamer, 138 S. Ct. at 17 (noting, while applying \nRule 4(a)(5), that \u201cit is axiomatic that the Federal \nRules of Civil Procedure do not create or withdraw \nfederal jurisdiction\u201d (cleaned up)).  Rule 4(a)(5) simply \nimplements 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c), id. at 21, and it is \n\u00a7 2107 that defines our appellate jurisdiction in this \nmatter, see id. at 17\u201318; Bowles, 551 U.S. at 213\u201314.  \nAccordingly, we must satisfy ourselves that, under \n\u00a7 2107(c), we have jurisdiction. \nWe begin with the statutory text.  In 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107, Congress established mandatory timing \nrequirements for conferring jurisdiction on courts of \nappeals in civil actions.  In \u00a7 2107(a), it provided that \nin civil actions, courts of appeals have jurisdiction to \n\n7a \n \n \nreview district courts\u2019 judgments, orders, or decrees if \nthe notice of appeal is \u201cfiled[] within thirty days after \nthe entry of such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(a).  But \u00a7 2107(b) then lengthens the 30-day \nappeal period to 60 days where one of the parties is the \nUnited States.  Id. \u00a7 2107(b).  And finally, \u00a7 2107(c) \nprovides two exceptions to those timing requirements. \nThe first exception, stated in the first sentence of \n\u00a7 2107(c) and implemented by Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(5), specifies that \u201c[t]he \ndistrict court may, upon motion filed not later than 30 \ndays after the expiration of the time otherwise set for \nbringing appeal, extend the time for appeal upon a \nshowing of excusable neglect or good cause.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2107(c) (emphasis added); see also Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5). \nThe second exception, stated in the second sentence \nof \u00a7 2107(c) and implemented by Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6), provides: \n[I]f the district court finds\u2014 \n(1) that a party entitled to notice of the entry of \na judgment or order did not receive such notice \nfrom the clerk or any party within 21 days of its \nentry, and \n(2) that no party would be prejudiced, \nthe district court may, upon motion filed within 180 \ndays after entry of the judgment or order or within \n14 days after receipt of such notice, whichever is \nearlier, reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 \ndays from the date of entry of the order reopening the \ntime for appeal. \n\n8a \n \n \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) (emphasis added).  This exception \nthus authorizes the district court, in its discretion, to \nreopen the time for filing a notice of appeal for 14 days \nif it finds that (1) the appellant did not receive notice \nof the judgment to be appealed within 21 days of its \nentry; (2) the appellant files a motion to reopen within \n180 days after the entry of judgment or within 14 days \nafter receipt of notice of the judgment, whichever is \nearlier; and (3) no party would be prejudiced by \ngranting the motion. \nThe Supreme Court has construed these statutory \nlimits on appellate court jurisdiction strictly.  In \nBowles, the appellant failed to file a timely notice of \nappeal and thereafter moved to reopen the period \nduring which he could file his notice of appeal \npursuant to \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6).  551 U.S. at 207.  \nThe district court granted the appellant\u2019s motion, but \nrather than reopening the filing period for 14 days, as \nauthorized by statute, the district court\u2019s order \n\u201cinexplicably\u201d gave the appellant 17 days within which \nto file his notice of appeal.  Id.  The appellant \nthereafter filed his notice of appeal on day 16 \u2014 which \nwas within the 17 days authorized by the district court \nbut beyond the 14-day period authorized by \u00a7 2107(c).  \nId.  Despite the fact that the appellant relied on the \ndistrict court\u2019s error in authorizing 17 days, the \nSupreme Court concluded that the appellant\u2019s appeal \nhad to be dismissed because statutory limitations on \nthe \ntiming \nof \nappeals \nare \n\u201cmandatory \nand \njurisdictional\u201d and are not susceptible to equitable \nmodification.  Id. at 208\u201309 (quoting Griggs v. \nProvident Consumer Discount Co., 459 U.S. 56, 61 \n(1982) (per curiam)).  As the Court emphasized, \n\u201cBecause Congress decides whether federal courts can \n\n9a \n \n \nhear cases at all, it can also determine when, and \nunder what conditions, federal courts can hear them.\u201d  \nId. at 212\u201313. \nIn this case, the exception stated in the first \nsentence of \u00a7 2107(c) \u2014 providing for extensions of \ntime for excusable neglect or good cause \u2014 does not \napply.  If that exception were to apply, the period for \nfiling a notice of appeal would be extended, and thus it \nwould be reasonable to conclude that a notice of appeal \nfiled at any time within the original time for appeal or \nthe approved extension period would be timely.  But \nthat exception is applicable only when the appellant \nfiles a motion for an extension \u201cnot later than 30 days\u201d \nafter the established time for filing a notice of appeal \n\u2014 in this case, not later than June 24, 2020 (i.e., 30 \ndays after the 60-day appeal period in cases in which \nthe United States is a party).  It is undisputed that \nParrish did not file a motion pursuant to that \nexception, and even if his July 8, 2020 notice of appeal \nwere to be treated as such a motion, it still would be \nuntimely, and therefore the first exception would not \napply. \nBecause the first exception does not apply here, the \nonly exception on which Parrish can rely is the one \nprovided in the second sentence of \u00a7 2107(c), which \ndoes not purport to extend the time for appeal from the \ndate of the judgment, but rather provides for a new 14-\nday window for filing a notice of appeal, running from \nthe date of the district court\u2019s order granting the \nreopening.  The district court in this case found that \nParrish qualified for a reopening of the appeal period \nunder the second exception and provided him with a \nnew opportunity to file a notice of appeal within 14 \ndays of its order, i.e., by January 22, 2021.  Thus, \n\n10a \n \n \nbefore the date of the district court\u2019s order, any appeal \nby Parrish was foreclosed by the untimeliness of his \nnotice because his notice was not filed within 60 days \nof the judgment or any possible extension of that \nperiod.  The order granting the motion therefore \n\u201creopened,\u201d rather than \u201cextended,\u201d the period so that \nhe could file a notice of appeal that was timely.  Indeed, \nCongress deliberately used \u201creopen\u201d to imply that \nbefore such an order, the appeal was indeed foreclosed.  \nSee Reopen, Merriam-Webster\u2019s Collegiate Dictionary \n1054 (11th ed. 2020) (defining \u201creopen\u201d as \u201cto open \nagain\u201d or \u201cto begin again\u201d (emphasis added)).  Thus, to \nappeal in these circumstances, Parrish would have to \nfile a appeal within 14 days of the entry of the order. \nNot only does the text of \u00a7 2107(c) require that \nParrish file his notice of appeal during the reopened \nperiod, the text of the district court\u2019s order granting \nhis motion to reopen also explicitly advised him on this \nrequirement.  The court said that it was reopening \n\u201cthe time for Parrish to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry\u201d of the order.  (Emphasis \nadded).  This language does not purport to validate his \nearlier filed untimely notice of appeal, as Parrish \nwould now have it. \nParrish nonetheless relies on court decisions \naddressing the first exception in \u00a7 2107(c) \u2014 the \nextension provision implemented by Rule 4(a)(5) \u2014 \nand argues that such caselaw \u201capplies with equal force\u201d \nto the reopening provision in \u00a7 2107(c).  But the cases \nhe cites provide him with little help, as they only \naddress Rule 4(a)(5), not 4(a)(6), and apply the rule in \nmaterially distinct circumstances.  In Hinton v. City of \nElwood, on which Parrish relies, the appellant filed his \nnotice of appeal one day beyond the 30-day period \n\n11a \n \n \nspecified in \u00a7 2107(a), therefore making it untimely.  \n997 F.2d at 777.  But Hinton thereafter filed a motion \nfor an extension of time within the 30-day extension \nperiod permitted by \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5).  Id.  \nWhile the district court granted that motion, Hinton \ndid not file a second notice of appeal.  The Tenth \nCircuit concluded nonetheless that the district court\u2019s \ngranting of the motion to extend \u201cvalidated\u201d the prior \nnotice of appeal.  Id. at 778.  Similarly, in Evans v. \nJones, on which Parrish also relies, we construed an \nuntimely notice of appeal, which was filed after the 30-\nday period mandated by \u00a7 2107(a) but within the \nsubsequent 30-day extension period permitted by \nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 73(a) (the prior \nversion of Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5)), \nas a motion to extend under that rule based on \nexcusable neglect.  366 F.2d at 772\u201373.  We indicated \nthat if the district court found that the delay was \nexcusable, it would \u201cvalidate\u201d the prior notice of appeal \n\u201cprovided the effect [was] not to extend the time for \nfiling more than thirty days from the expiration of the \noriginal thirty-day period.\u201d  Id. at 773.  Thus, these \ncases dealt with extensions of appeal periods sought by \nfiling a motion (or a notice construed as a motion) \nwithin the permissible time period for requesting such \nan extension.  And in that circumstance, it would \nreasonably follow that extending the time for filing the \nappeal validates any notice of appeal filed within the \nperiod of extension.  But this case involves a motion to \nreopen the appeal time after it had long expired.  In \nsuch a circumstance, Congress authorized a special \nexception by which a court could authorize a new 14-\nday window for filing an appeal, running from the date \nof the district court\u2019s order granting the 14-day \n\n12a \n \n \nwindow.  And that exception clearly requires that a \nnotice of appeal be filed within the 14-day period. \nIn support of his position that Rule 4(a)(6) \nincorporates Rule 4(a)(5) jurisprudence, our good \ncolleague in dissent states that \u201cin at least one prior \ncase, this Court has accepted a district court\u2019s holding \nthat an order reopening the appeal period validated an \nearlier, untimely notice of appeal,\u201d citing Grant v. City \nof Roanoke, 810 F. App\u2019x. 236 (4th Cir. 2020).  Infra at \n15.  This unpublished decision, however, does not, in \nits one short paragraph, conduct any analysis of the \nRule 4(a)(6) issue.  This hardly constitutes binding, \npersuasive authority. \nFinally, Parrish argues that he is \u201cfunctionally in \nthe same position as the pro se litigant\u201d in Clark v. \nCartledge, 829 F.3d 303 (4th Cir. 2016).  In that case, \nwe found that a pro se litigant\u2019s motion for an \nextension of time to request a certificate of \nappealability, which was filed within the 30-day \nwindow mandated by \u00a7 2107(a), was the \u201cfunctional \nequivalent\u201d of a notice of appeal sufficient to satisfy \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 3.  Clark, 829 \nF.3d at 304\u201306.  In doing so, however, we emphasized \nthat to benefit from such a ruling, \u201cthe litigant\u2019s \nmotion must be timely under Rule 4.\u201d  Id. at 307\u201308.  \nTherefore, regardless of what Clark says about the \nimportance of construing pro se filings liberally, it does \nnot allow us to excuse Parrish\u2019s failure to comply with \nthe timing requirements of \u00a7 2107(c). \nParrish filed only one notice of appeal in this case, \nand that notice was untimely under any relevant \njurisdictional standard established by Congress.  It \nwas filed after the original 60-day period for appealing \n\n13a \n \n \nexpired, and it was filed after any extension period \nthat could have been obtained.  When a new period for \nappeal was given to Parrish, he did not file a notice of \nappeal within that new period.  This \u201c[f]ailure to \ncomply with a jurisdictional time prescription . . .  \ndeprives a court of adjudicatory authority over the \ncase, necessitating dismissal.\u201d  Hamer, 138 S. Ct. at 17.  \nAccordingly, we dismiss Parrish\u2019s appeal for lack of \njurisdiction. \nIT IS SO ORDERED \n \n \n\n14a \n \n \nGREGORY, Circuit Judge, dissenting: \nThrough no fault of his own, Donte Parrish did not \nlearn the district court had dismissed his Federal Tort \nClaims Act complaint until three months after the \ncourt entered judgment.  After he finally received \nnotice of the judgment on June 25, 2020, Parrish filed \na pro se notice of appeal on July 8, 2020.  This Court \nrecognized that his notice of appeal was \u201cclearly \nuntimely,\u201d but construed it as a timely motion to \nreopen the appeal period under Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).  Parrish v. United States, \n827 F. App\u2019x 327, 327 (4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam).  The \ndistrict court\u2019s judgment remained unchanged in the \nmonths between that filing and the district court\u2019s \nJanuary 8, 2021 order reopening the appeal period, \nand the government agrees that Parrish\u2019s initial \nnotice of appeal sufficiently informed all parties of his \nintent to appeal. \nYet my colleagues in the majority hold that we lack \njurisdiction over Parrish\u2019s appeal because Parrish \nfailed to refile his notice of appeal after the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period.  Nothing in the text \nof 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) compels such a formalistic and \nhollow requirement.  To the contrary, Fourth Circuit \nprecedent makes clear that the district court\u2019s order \nreopening the appeal period validated Parrish\u2019s earlier \nnotice of appeal without the need for refiling.  Because \nthat precedent establishes that we have jurisdiction \nover Parrish\u2019s appeal, I respectfully dissent. \nI. \nSection 2107 prescribes a straightforward set of \nrules governing the timeliness of an appeal, which is a \nnecessary prerequisite for a court of appeals to \n\n15a \n \n \nexercise jurisdiction.  To confer jurisdiction on this \nCourt, an appellant generally must file a notice of \nappeal within 30 days after the district court enters \njudgment (60 days if the United States is a party).  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(a) \u2013 (b).  There are two exceptions to this \ndeadline.  First, the district court may extend the time \nto appeal if the appellant so moves no later than 30 \ndays after the appeal deadline expires and can show \n\u201cexcusable neglect or good cause.\u201d  \u00a7 2107(c).  Federal \nRule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5) elaborates on this \nexception, and provides that the court may grant an \nextension of up to 30 days after the original appeal \ndeadline or 14 days after the court grants the motion \nfor an extension, whichever is later.  Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5). \nSecond, the district court may reopen the time to \nappeal for a period of 14 days if (1) the appellant did \nnot receive notice of the judgment within 21 days of its \nentry; (2) the appellant moves to reopen within 14 \ndays after receiving notice or within 180 days after the \nentry of judgment, whichever is earlier; and (3) the \ncourt finds that no party would be prejudiced by the \nreopening.  \u00a7 2107(c).  Rule 4(a)(6) reiterates these \nthree requirements for reopening the time to file an \nappeal.  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6).  When the district \ncourt reopens the appeal period, the new 14-day \nwindow for filing a notice of appeal runs from the date \nof the order granting the reopening.  \u00a7 2107(c). \nEach exception provides a way for an appellant to \nreceive additional time to notice their appeal.  The two \nexceptions just apply in different scenarios.  An \nappellant may file a motion for an extension if they \nreceived notice of the district court\u2019s judgment at the \nproper time but, because of excusable neglect or good \n\n16a \n \n \ncause, either (1) cannot file a notice of appeal before \nthe deadline or (2) failed to file a notice of appeal \nbefore the deadline but discovered the oversight \nwithin 30 days after the deadline.  Id.  A motion to \nreopen, on the other hand, is the proper vehicle if the \nappellant did not receive notice of the judgment within \n21 days of its entry, as long as no more than 180 days \nhave passed since the date the district court entered \njudgment.  Id.  For our purposes, the key point is that \nan appellant may file either motion after the original \nappeal period closes. \nThe question in Parrish\u2019s case is whether the \ndistrict court\u2019s order reopening his appeal period \nvalidated his earlier notice of appeal, which he filed \nafter the 60-day appeal deadline passed.  This Court\u2019s \nlongstanding precedent readily answers that question \nin the affirmative.  In Evans v. Jones, the appellant \nfiled a notice of appeal one day after the appeal period \nclosed, which this Court construed as a motion for an \nextension.  366 F.2d 772, 772\u201373 (4th Cir. 1966) (per \ncuriam) (applying precursor to Rule 4(a)(5)).  The \nCourt made clear that a later district court order \ngranting an extension would \u201cvalidate\u201d the appellant\u2019s \nuntimely notice of appeal.  Id. at 773. \nSince our decision in Evans, other circuits have \nsimilarly \nheld \nthat \na \nRule \n4(a)(5) \nextension \nretroactively validates an earlier, untimely notice of \nappeal.  Hinton v. City of Elwood, 997 F.2d 774, 777\u2013\n79 (10th Cir. 1993); McNicholes v. Subotnik, 12 F.3d \n105, 107 (8th Cir. 1993).  In Hinton, the Tenth Circuit \nexplained that this scenario resembles a prematurely \nfiled notice of appeal, which courts treat as valid \n\u201cwhen the order appealed from is likely to remain \nunchanged in both its form and its content.\u201d  997 F.2d \n\n17a \n \n \nat 778.  Because a Rule 4(a)(5) motion for an extension \n\u201cdoes not portend any substantive alteration in the \nform or content of the order being appealed from,\u201d the \nTenth Circuit concluded that a district court\u2019s \napproval of an extension \u201cvalidate[s] a prior notice of \nappeal.\u201d  Id.  The Hinton Court aptly noted that \nrequiring the appellant to refile a notice of appeal in \nthis context \u201cwould amount to little more than empty \npaper shuffling,\u201d and it did not believe that Rule 4(a)(5) \nwas \u201cdesigned to impose such a hollow ritual on a \nwould-be appellant.\u201d  Id. (internal quotation marks \nomitted). \nThe rule this Court established in Evans applies \nwith equal force where, as here, a late-filed notice of \nappeal is followed by a successful Rule 4(a)(6) motion \nto reopen.  Like a Rule 4(a)(5) motion for an extension, \na Rule 4(a)(6) motion to reopen does not rely on any \nintervening change in the district court\u2019s judgment\u2014\nit simply requests additional time to notice an appeal \nof the judgment.  In both contexts, once the district \ncourt grants additional time to appeal, the only \nremaining question is whether the initial notice of \nappeal continues to \u201cprovide[] sufficient notice to other \nparties and the courts\u201d that the appellant intends to \nseek appellate review.  Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992).  If it does\u2014and it typically will\u2014the \ndistrict court\u2019s decision to grant an extension or reopen \nthe appeal period validates the notice of appeal. \nIn fact, in at least one prior case, this Court has \naccepted a district court\u2019s holding that an order \nreopening the appeal period validated an earlier, \nuntimely notice of appeal.  After the district court \ngranted the motion to reopen, it explained that \n\u201c[b]ecause a notice of appeal has already been \n\n18a \n \n \ndocketed, [appellant] does not need to file a new notice \nof appeal.\u201d  Grant v. City of Roanoke, No. 7:16-CV-\n00007, 2019 WL 6833664, at *3 (W.D. Va. Dec. 13, \n2019).  We then exercised jurisdiction over the appeal.  \nSee Grant v. City of Roanoke, 810 F. App\u2019x 236 (4th Cir. \n2020), cert. denied, 141 S. Ct 2471 (2021). \nGiven our decision in Evans, the jurisdictional \nquestion in Parrish\u2019s case should be easy to resolve.  \nThe district court\u2019s decision to reopen the time for an \nappeal validated Parrish\u2019s earlier notice of appeal, \nwhich gives us jurisdiction.  The government agrees \nthat \nParrish\u2019s \nnotice \nof \nappeal \nsufficiently \ncommunicated his intent to appeal the district court\u2019s \njudgment.  That makes sense, as nothing about the \njudgment changed between July 2020, when Parrish \nfiled the notice of appeal, and January 2021, when the \ndistrict court reopened the appeal period.  Requiring \nParrish to refile merely duplicates his earlier notice of \nappeal and \u201camount[s] to little more than empty paper \nshuffling.\u201d  Hinton, 997 F.2d at 778 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted). \nII. \nMy colleagues in the majority see things differently.  \nThey maintain that the question is not whether the \ncourt and government received notice of Parrish\u2019s \nintent to appeal, but whether Parrish complied with \n\u00a7 2107(c)\u2019s jurisdictional rules governing the timing of \nappeals.  In their view, the statute always requires an \nappellant to re-notice an appeal after the district court \nreopens the appeal period, regardless of any \npreviously filed notice of appeal.  Try as I might, my \nefforts to find such a requirement in the text of \n\u00a7 2107(c) come up empty. \n\n19a \n \n \nSection 2107(c) is silent on the effect an order \nreopening the appeal period may have on a previously \nfiled notice of appeal.  The statute merely provides \nthat the district court may \u201creopen the time for appeal \nfor a period of 14 days from the date of entry of the \norder reopening the time for appeal.\u201d  \u00a7 2107(c).  In \ncases where the appellant has not yet filed a notice of \nappeal, \u00a7 2107(c) obviously requires the appellant to \nfile one within the 14-day reopened period.  In a case \nlike Parrish\u2019s, though, nothing in the statutory text \ncompels refiling.*  If the statute required an appellant \nto refile a notice of appeal in this scenario, an \nappellant also would need to refile a notice of appeal \nafter the district court granted a motion for an \nextension.  After all, \u201creopening the time for appeal\u201d is \nno less ambiguous on this issue than \u201cextend[ing] the \ntime for appeal.\u201d  \u00a7 2107(c).  But that interpretation, \nof course, would conflict with our decision in Evans. \nUnsurprisingly, then, the majority embarks on an \neffort to evade Evans by distinguishing a Rule 4(a)(5) \nextension from a Rule 4(a)(6) reopening.  As they see \nit, a successful motion for an extension simply \nprolongs the original appeal period.  A motion to \nreopen is different, they argue, because it seeks a new \n \n* The Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. 205 \n(2007), does not support the majority\u2019s position.  There, the Court \nheld that it lacked jurisdiction to hear an appeal the appellant \nhad noticed 16 days after the district court reopened the appeal \nperiod (for a period of 17 days).  Id. at 207\u201309.  The Court \nexplained that the filing failed to comply with the plain text of \u00a7 \n2107(c), which sets a 14-day limit for a reopened appeal period.  \nId. at 209\u201310.  By contrast, the statute simply does not address \nwhether an order reopening the appeal period validates an \nearlier-filed notice of appeal.  \n\n20a \n \n \nwindow to notice an appeal after the original appeal \nperiod has closed.  In other words, the majority asserts \nthat our appellate jurisdiction is \u201cforeclosed\u201d prior to \nan order reopening the appeal period, which is not the \ncase when a district court merely extends the appeal \nperiod.  Ante at 8\u20139. \nThis attempted distinction quickly crumbles under \nscrutiny.  True, a litigant may move for an extension \nbefore the original appeal period expires and this \nCourt loses the capacity to exercise jurisdiction.  But \n\u00a7 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) also permit an appellant to \nfile a motion for an extension up to 30 days after the \nappeal period expires.  In such a case, an extension \norder does not retroactively create an unbroken, \nprolonged appeal period.  Rather, the order permits \nthe appellant to notice an appeal within a new window \nof time that ends either 14 days after the entry of the \nextension order or 30 days after the original appeal \ndeadline, whichever comes later.  Fed. R. App. P. \n4(a)(5).  Thus, when an appellant files a notice of \nappeal after the appeal deadline, then successfully \nfiles a motion for an extension, the notice of appeal \ndoes not fall \u201cwithin\u201d the extension period the district \ncourt grants.  Ante at 5. \nEvans involved that exact scenario.  See 366 F.2d at \n772\u201373.  The appellant filed his notice of appeal one \nday after the original deadline, at a time when we were \nunable to exercise jurisdiction over the appeal.  After \ntreating the filing as a motion for an extension, we \nheld that an order granting an extension would \n\u201cvalidate\u201d the appellant\u2019s notice of appeal, id. at 773\u2014\nthat is, the appellant would not need to refile it.  That \nour jurisdiction was foreclosed when the appellant \n\n21a \n \n \nfiled the notice of appeal had no bearing on our \nanalysis. \nThe majority\u2019s semantic distinction between an \nextension and a reopening runs headlong into this \nbinding precedent.  If the appellant in Evans did not \nneed to re-notice his appeal after we construed his \nlate-filed notice as a motion for an extension, id. at \n772\u201373, there is no principled reason to require \nParrish to re-notice his appeal after we construed his \nlate-filed notice as a motion to reopen and the district \ncourt granted that motion.  In both cases, our inability \nto exercise jurisdiction when the appellant filed the \nuntimely notice of appeal does not preclude the district \ncourt\u2019s later extension or reopening order from \nvalidating the notice.  Id.  Put simply, Evans directs \nus to treat Parrish\u2019s notice of appeal as validated and \nexercise jurisdiction over his appeal. \nSeparately, the majority reasons that Parrish\u2019s July \n2020 filing cannot simultaneously serve as both a \nnotice of appeal and a motion to reopen, so it ceased to \nbe the former once we construed it as the latter.  Once \nagain, Evans easily defeats that argument.  In Evans, \nwe construed a late notice of appeal as a motion for an \nextension, then proceeded to hold that a district court \norder granting an extension would validate that same \nnotice of appeal.  Id. at 773. \nLastly, the majority finds it significant that the \ndistrict court\u2019s order reopening the appeal period \n\u201cexplicitly advised\u201d Parrish of the requirement to refile \na notice of appeal within 14 days.  Ante at 9.  I agree \nthat the district court apparently believed Parrish \nneeded to file a new notice of appeal.  But if appellate \ncourts treated district courts\u2019 interpretations of the \n\n22a \n \n \nlaw as dispositive, we would quickly find ourselves out \nof work.  The question here is not what the district \ncourt told Parrish he needed to do; it\u2019s whether any \n\u201cgenuine doubt exist[ed] about who is appealing, from \nwhat judgment, [and] to which appellate court.\u201d  Clark \nv. Cartledge, 829 F.3d 303, 305 (4th Cir. 2016) (quoting \nBecker v. Montgomery, 532 U.S. 757, 767 (2001)).  It is \nbeyond dispute that Parrish\u2019s July 2020 notice of \nappeal continued to convey his intent to seek appellate \nreview in January 2021. \nIII. \nIn short, the majority is simply incorrect in holding \nthat \u00a7 2107(c) required Parrish to file a duplicative \nnotice of appeal during the reopened appeal period.  If, \nas my colleagues assert, we must disregard a prior \nnotice of appeal filed when our jurisdiction was \n\u201cforeclosed,\u201d the notice of appeal in Evans could not \nhave been validated by a later extension order.  But \nthe Evans Court held just the opposite.  The majority\u2019s \ncontrived distinction between motions to extend and \nmotions to reopen flouts that precedent\u2014and this \nCourt\u2019s jurisdictional obligations. \n \n \n \n\n23a \n \n \n_____________________ \n \nAPPENDIX B \n_____________________ \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST \nVIRGINIA \nDONTE PARRISH, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF \nAMERICA, \nDefendant. \nCivil action No. \n1:17cv70 \n(Judge Keeley) \n \nREPORT AND RECOMMENDATION \nI. \nBackground \nOn May 3, 2017, the pro se Plaintiff, an inmate then-\nincarcerated at USP Big Sandy1 in Inez, Kentucky, \nfiled a Federal Tort Claim Act (\u201cFTCA\u201d) complaint.  \nECF No. 1.  The Clerk of Court issued a Notice of \nDeficient Pleading, directing Plaintiff, inter alia, to file \nhis complaint on a court-approved form and to file a \nmotion to proceed as a pauper with supporting \ndocuments.  ECF No. 3.  On June 16, 2017, Plaintiff \ncorrected his deficiencies.  ECF Nos. 7, 8, 9, 10.  By \nOrder entered on June 19, 2017, Plaintiff was granted \npermission to proceed as a pauper but directed to pay \n \n1  Plaintiff is presently incarcerated at USP Lewisburg in \nLewisburg, Pennsylvania. \n\n24a \n \n \nan initial partial filing fee (\u201cIPFF\u201d) within 28 days.  \nECF No. 11.  On July 18, 2017, Plaintiff moved for an \nextension of time in which to pay the IPFF; by Order \nentered August 9, 2017, Plaintiff was granted the \nextension.  ECF Nos. 13, 14.  On September 8, 2017, \nPlaintiff moved for a second extension of time in which \nto pay the IPFF.  ECF No. 16.  He also filed a combined \nmotion to proceed without payment of his IPFF; for a \npreliminary injunction/temporary restraining order; \nor in the alternative, for appointed counsel and/or for \na copy of the Local Rules of Prisoner Litigation \nProcedure (\u201cLR PL P\u201d).  ECF No. 17.  By separate \nOrders entered September 13, 2017, the Warden was \ndirected to respond to Plaintiff\u2019s allegations regarding \nthe Trust Officer\u2019s failure to deduct Plaintiff\u2019s IPFF \nfrom his account [ECF No. 18]; Plaintiff\u2019s motion for \nappointed counsel was denied; the Clerk was directed \nto send him a copy of the LR PL P [ECF No. 19]; and \nPlaintiff\u2019s second motion for an extension of time in \nwhich to pay the IPFF was denied as moot.  ECF No. \n20.  That same day, the undersigned issued a Report \nand Recommendation (\u201cR&R\u201d) recommending that \nPlaintiff\u2019s \nmotion \nfor \na \npreliminary \ninjunction/temporary restraining order be denied.  \nECF No. 21.  On September 14, 2017, Plaintiff paid his \nIPFF.  ECF No. 22.

ECF No. 27.  On October 2, 2017, Plaintiff filed \nobjections to the R&R recommending his motion for a \npreliminary injunction/temporary restraining order be \ndenied.  ECF No. 28.  By Order entered October 3, \n\n25a \n \n \n2017, the United States\u2019 motion to seal was granted.  \nECF No. 29. \nOn November 21, 2017, Plaintiff moved for leave to \nfile an amended complaint.  ECF No. 34.  By Order \nentered November 28, 2017, Plaintiff\u2019s motion to \namend was granted and the Clerk was directed to send \nhim a blank FTCA form to complete.  ECF No. 35.  On \nDecember 18, 2017, Plaintiff filed his amended \ncomplaint.  ECF No. 39.  On December 29, 2017, the \nUnited States moved to establish a time frame to \nanswer or otherwise respond to Plaintiff\u2019s amended \ncomplaint.  ECF No. 41.  By Order entered January 3, \n2018, the United States\u2019 motion to establish a time \nframe to answer or otherwise respond to Plaintiff\u2019s \namended complaint was granted  ECF No. 42. \nBy Order entered April 4, 2018, Plaintiff was \ndirected to clarify the record by producing copies of the \nexhibits referenced, but not attached to his original \ncomplaint, and neither referenced nor attached to the \namended complaint, as well as copies of his \nadministrative tort claim(s) and the response(s) \nthereto.  ECF No. 48.  On April 16, 2018, Plaintiff filed \na \u201cmemorandum of evidence\u201d in response.  ECF No. 51.  \nBy Order entered April 24, 2018, the United States \nwas directed to produce copies of the Standard Form \n95 administrative tort claims filed by Plaintiff.  ECF \nNo. 54.  On April 25, 2018, the United States filed its \nresponse.  ECF No. 55. \nBy Order entered on May 1, 2018, the United States \nwas directed to file an answer on the limited issue of \nthe timeliness of Plaintiff\u2019s claims.  ECF No. 57.

On June 11, 2018, \nthe United States filed a Motion to Dismiss for Lack of \nJurisdiction, attaching a memorandum in support and \ntwo sworn declarations.  ECF No. 65.  The United \nStates also filed a Motion to Hold Consideration of \nPlaintiff\u2019s Motion for Summary Judgment in Abeyance.  \nECF No. 66.  Because Plaintiff was proceeding pro se, \na Roseboro Notice was issued on June 12, 2018, \nadvising him of his right to respond to the United \nStates\u2019 dispositive motion.  ECF No. 67.  By separate \nOrder entered the same day, the United States\u2019 Motion \nto Hold Consideration of Plaintiff\u2019s Motion for \nSummary Judgment in Abeyance was granted.  ECF \nNo. 68.  By Order entered June 18, 2018, the R&R \nrecommending \nthat \nPlaintiff\u2019s \nmotion \nfor \na \npreliminary injunction be denied was adopted and \nPlaintiff\u2019s objections were overruled.

ECF No. 74. \nThis case is before the undersigned for a Report and \nRecommendation on Defendant\u2019s dispositive motion. \nII. \nThe Pleadings \nA. \nAmended Complaint \nPlaintiff\u2019s amended complaint\n2  raises claims \nagainst Bureau of Prisons (\u201cBOP\u201d) employees in six \n \n2 All of the claims raised in the amended complaint relate back to \nclaims made in the original complaint.  See Fed.R.Civ.P. 15(c). \n\n27a \n \n \nfederal institutions situated in five jurisdictions, 3 \ncontending that: \n1) he was falsely imprisoned by Defendant\u2019s \nemployees from December 2009 through November \n2012 without probable cause \u201cfor an alleged murder \nthey knew I did not commit.\u201d  ECF No. 39 at 6. \n2) Plaintiff raises an abuse of process claim, \nclaiming that the Defendant\u2019s employees misused the \nAdministrative Detention process and the process of \nSpecial Management Unit (\u201cSMU\u201d) for the sole \npurpose of illegally confining him for three years.  Id. \nat 6\u20137. \n3) The \nDefendant\u2019s \nemployees \nintentionally \ninflicted emotional distress upon him by keeping him \nconfined and denying him access to family and friends; \ndenying his visits while he was at FCI Gilmer; giving \nhim \u201cracially motivated puzzles\u201d at USP Hazelton; and \nlabeling him a racist.  Id. at 7. \n4) The Defendant\u2019s employees were negligent for \nfailing to review Plaintiff\u2019s case and timely releasing \nhim from Administrative Detention.  Id. at 8. \n5) Defendant\u2019s employees committed malicious \nprosecution, pursuing a murder charge for which they \nhad no probable cause, causing Plaintiff to lose good \nconduct time (\u201cGCT\u201d), which was ultimately restored \nto Plaintiff after a successful appeal.  Id. \n \n3  Plaintiff alleges claims against BOP employees at: 1) USP \nHazelton in Bruceton Mills WV; 2) FCI Gilmer in Glenville, WV; \n3) USP Lewisburg, at Lewisburg, PA; 4) FCI Oakdale, in Allen \nParish, LA; 5) USP Big Sandy, in Inez, KY, and 6) the staff at the \nBOP\u2019s Designation & Sentence Computation Center (\u201cDSCC\u201d) in \nGrand Prairie, Texas. \n\n28a \n \n \nPlaintiff contends that he filed an Administrative \nTort Claim form regarding his claims, seeking \n$5,000,000.00.  Id. at 4. \nPlaintiff contends that as a result of Defendant\u2019s \nemployees\u2019 actions, he suffered three years of illegal \nconfinement in a 6 x 8\u2019 cell; was harassed; denied \nthings afforded to similarly-situated inmates \u201cout of \npure spite;\u201d and denied contact with family, which \nultimately caused loss of relationships.  Id. at 9. \nAs relief, he seeks $5,000,000.00.  Id. \nB. \nMotion to Dismiss for Lack of Subject \nMatter Jurisdiction Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. \n12(b)(1) \nThe United States contends that the amended \ncomplaint should be dismissed because \n1) this court has no subject matter jurisdiction \nbecause \nFederal \nCourts \nlack \nsubject \nmatter \njurisdiction to address lawsuits like the instant one \nthat are untimely filed pursuant to the FTCA\u2019s \nprocedural requirements; \n2) Plaintiff did not file his complaint within six \nmonths after the BOP denied his underlying \nadministrative claims. \n3) Plaintiff mailed his original complaint on May \n1, 2017; because there is no prison mailbox rule in the \nFederal Tort Claim Act, thus, Plaintiff is not entitled \nto equitable tolling of the deadline(s) within which he \nhad to file his claims. \n4) The deadline for Plaintiff to file suit over \nAdministrative Tort claim TRT-MXR-2016-06283 \nexpired on March 14, 2017, and the deadline to file suit \nregarding \nthe \nclaims \nraised \nin \nPlaintiff\u2019s \n\n29a \n \n \nAdministrative Tort claim TRT-MXR-2016-06710 \nexpired on April 7, 2017.

The burden of proving subject \nmatter jurisdiction on a Rule 12(b)(1) motion to \ndismiss is on the party asserting federal jurisdiction.  \nAdams v. Bain, 697 F.2d 1213, 1219 (4th Cir. 1982).  A \ntrial court may consider evidence by affidavit, \ndeposition, or live testimony without converting the \nproceeding to one for summary judgment.  Id.; Mims v. \nKemp, 516 F.2d 21 (4th Cir. 1975).  \u201cUnlike the \nprocedure in a 12(b)(6) motion where there is a \npresumption reserving the truth finding role to the \nultimate factfinder, the court in a 12(b)(1) hearing \nweighs the evidence to determine its jurisdiction.\u201d  \nAdams, 697 at 1219.  Further, no presumptive \ntruthfulness attaches to plaintiff\u2019s allegations, and the \nexistence of disputed material facts will not preclude \nthe trial court from evaluating for itself the merits of \njurisdictional claims.  Materson v. Stokes, 166 F.R.D. \n368, 371 (E.D. Va. 1996).  Whenever it appears, by \nsuggestion of the parties or otherwise, that the court \nlacks jurisdiction of the subject matter, the court shall \ndismiss the action.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3). \nParrish is representing himself, which requires the \nCourt to liberally construe his pleadings.  Estelle v. \nGamble, 429 U.S. 97, 97 S.Ct. 285, 50 L.Ed.2d \n251(1976); Haines v. Kerner, 404 U.S. 519, 92 S.Ct. 594, \n30 L.Ed.2d 652 (1972)(per curiam); Loe v. Armistead, \n582 F.2d 1291 (4th Cir. 1978); Gordon v. Leeke, 574 \n\n31a \n \n \nF.2d 1147 (4th Cir. 1978).  While pro se pleadings are \nheld to a less stringent standard than those drafted by \nattorneys, Haines, 404 U.S. at 520, even under this \nless stringent standard, a pro se complaint is still \nsubject to dismissal.  Id. at 520-21.  The mandated \nliberal construction means only that if the Court can \nreasonably read the pleadings to state a valid claim on \nwhich the plaintiff could prevail, it should do so.  \nBarnett v. Hargett, 174 F.3d 1128 (10th Cir. 1999).  A \ncourt may not construct the plaintiff\u2019s legal arguments \nfor her.  Small v. Endicott, 998 F.2d 411 (7th Cir. 1993).  \nNor should a court \u201cconjure up questions never \nsquarely presented.\u201d  Beaudett v. City of Hampton, 775 \nF.2d 1274 (4th Cir. 1985). \nIII. \nAnalysis \nFTCA Statute of Limitations \nIt is well-established that the United States is \nimmune from suit unless it consents to be sued.  See \nUnited States v. Testan, 424 U.S. 392 (1976).  However, \nthe FTCA waives the federal government\u2019s traditional \nimmunity from suit for claims based on the negligence \nof its employees.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1346(b)(1).  Specifically, \n\u201c[t]he statute permits the United States to be held \nliable in tort in the same respect as a private person \nwould be liable under the law of the place where the \nact occurred.\u201d  Medina v. United States, 259 F.3d 220, \n223 (4th Cir. 2001).  Nonetheless, the FCTA only \nwaives the government\u2019s sovereign immunity if \ncertain terms and conditions are met.  Honda v. Clark, \n386 U.S. 484 (1967).  One of those conditions is that an \nFTCA action be filed within two years of the incident \nor within six months of the final claim denial. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 2401(b).  Title 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) specifically states: \n\n32a \n \n \nA tort claim against the United States shall be \nforever barred unless it is presented in writing to \nthe appropriate Federal agency within two years \nafter such claim accrues or unless action is begun \nwithin six months after the date of mailing, by \ncertified or registered mail, of notice of final denial \nof the claim by the agency to which it was presented. \nMoreover, 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 14.9(a) states that that \n(a) Final denial of an administrative claim shall be \nin writing and sent to the claimant, his attorney, or \nlegal representative by certified or registered mail.  \nThe notification of final denial may include a \nstatement of the reasons for the denial and shall \ninclude a statement that, if the claimant is \ndissatisfied with the agency action, he may file \nsuit in an appropriate U.S. District Court not \nlater than 6 months after the date of mailing of \nthe notification. \n28 CFR \u00a7 14.9(a)(emphasis added).  Omission of this \nlanguage from a denial letter prevents the limitations \nperiod from running.  See Barrett v. United States, No. \n86-0053, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS 20301 * 3 - * 4 (4th Cir. \nJuly 5, 1988) (per curiam), citing Dyniewicz v. United \nStates, 742 F.2 484, 486 (9th Cir. 1984); Martinez v. \nUnited States, 728 F.2d 694, 698 (5th Cir. 1984).  See \nalso Boyd v. United States, 482 F. Supp. 1126, 1129 \n(W.D. Pa. 1980) (Governmental failure to comply with \nthe precise requirements of the final denial letter by \nmaking plaintiff aware of his rights will preserve a \nplaintiff\u2019s claim). \nHere, the claims Parrish raised in his FTCA \ncomplaint were presented to the appropriate federal \nagency in two separate Administrative Tort claims: \n\n33a \n \n \nTRT-MXR-06283 \nand \nTRT-MXR-06710. \n \nThe \ntimeliness of each claim is analyzed separately. \nAdministrative Tort Claim TRT-MXR-06283 was \npresented to the appropriate agency on September 1, \n2016, within two years from the June 3, 2016 date \nParrish\u2019s appeal was granted by Regional Director J.F. \nCaraway, Parrish\u2019s record was expunged, a rehearing \nwas issued and the incident report was changed from \na 100 series incident report (killing) to a 100A incident \nreport (assisting in a killing).  ECF No. 65-1 at 4.  It \nsought $15,000.00 in compensation for claims of denial \nof access to the courts; the opportunity to have his \ncustody \nlevel \nlowered; \nand \naccess \nto \ncertain \ninstitutional jobs; a violation of BOP Program \nStatement, CFR \u00a7 542 subpart B and violation of due \ncare provision; the loss of liberty with loss of the right \nto rehabilitative programs; and loss of redress to \nwrongs in his first DHO hearing, arising out of the \nJune 3, 2016 expungement of a 100(A) charge of \nassisting in a killing.  Id. Plaintiff\u2019s administrative \nclaim was denied on September 14, 2016.  ECF No. 65-\n1 at 9.  However, this letter was not a final denial; \nwhile it did advise Plaintiff that his claim was denied, \nit also advised him that he had a right to request \nreconsideration by submitting a request in writing and \nincluding additional evidence to support the request.  \nId.  It did not advise Plaintiff of the six month deadline \nin which he was required to file suit to preserve the \nclaim.  Plaintiff did not request reconsideration of the \nclaim.  Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P Rule 6(a), 180 days or \nsix months from the date of the September 14, 2016 \nletter was Tuesday, March 14, 2017.  Parrish filed suit \n50 days later, on May 3, 2017. \n\n34a \n \n \nNonetheless, because the government\u2019s September \n14, 2016 letter did not include a statement specifically \nadvising Parrish of the deadline in which he had to file \nsuit, this \u201cfailure of the government to make plaintiff \naware of his rights prevents this communication from \nbeing a proper final agency denial.\u201d  See Boyd, 482 F. \nSupp. at 1129; see also Barrett, 1988 U.S. App. LEXIS \n20301 * 3 - * 4.  As noted supra, the failure to include \nthis information prevents the limitations period from \nrunning.  Id. at *4.  Because there was no \u201cproper final \nagency denial within 6 months of the claim as required \nby 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675, the plaintiff has the right at any \ntime of his own option to deem such a failure to be a \nfinal agency denial.\u201d  Boyd, supra at 1129, citing Mack \nv. United States Postal Service, 414 F.Supp. 504 (E.D. \nMich. 1976).  Accordingly, this claim is not barred by \nthe \u00a7 2401(b) statute of limitations and this Court has \nsubject matter jurisdiction over the claims raised \ntherein, and the Defendant should be directed to \nanswer the claims in Administrative Tort Claim TRT-\nMXR-06283 on the merits. \nAdministrative Tort Claim TRT-MXR-2016-06710 \nwas presented to the appropriate \nagency on \nSeptember 23, 2016, within two years from the June 3, \n20167 date Parrish\u2019s appeal was granted by Regional \nDirector J.F. Caraway, Parrish\u2019s record was expunged, \na rehearing was issued and the incident report was \nchanged from a 100 series incident report (killing) to a \n \n7 Although Plaintiff actually listed December 6, 2009 as the \u201cday \nand date of accident\u201d on the Standard Form 95 for this \nadministrative tort claim, his \u00a7 8 \u201cBasis of Claim\u201d makes it clear \nthat he is relying on the June 3, 2016 date that the DHO finding \nwas cleared and the sanctions expunged.  See ECF No. 65-1 at 11. \n\n35a \n \n \n100A incident report (assisting in a killing).  ECF No. \n65-1 at 11.  It alleged claims for 1) wrongful \nconfinement; 2) denial of access to courts; 3) racial \nharassment by staff; 4) loss of eye sight; 5) loss of \nliberty/wrongful confinement; and 6) illegal use of \nrestraints, and seeking $5 million in compensation.  Id.  \nPlaintiff\u2019s administrative tort claim TRT-MXR-2016-\n06710 was denied on October 7, 2016, and he was \nadvised that he had six months from that date to file \nsuit.  ECF No. 65-1 at 18.  Pursuant to Fed.R.Civ.P. \nRule 6(a), 180 days or six months from the date of that \nfinal denial was Thursday, April 6, 2017.  However, \nPlaintiff did not initiate the instant action until on \nMay 3, 2017, 27 days after that date.  Thus, this second \nadministrative tort claim is clearly time-barred. \nThe undersigned recognizes that the United States \nSupreme Court has held that the FTCA\u2019s statute of \nlimitations is a procedural, not jurisdictional bar.  \nUnited States v. Kwai Fun Wong, 135 S.Ct. 1625, 1627 \n(2015).  Accordingly, equitable tolling is applicable to \nFTCA\u2019s statute of limitation.  However, equitable \ntolling in suits against the United States is only \navailable in exceptional circumstances.  See Muth v. \nUnited States, 1 F.3d 246, 251 (4th Cir. 1993).  More \nspecifically, the Fourth Circuit has stated that \nequitable tolling principles are appropriate only \n\u201cwhere the defendant has wrongfully deceived or \nmislead the plaintiff in order to conceal the existence \nof a cause of action.  \u201c Kokotis v. United States Postal \nService, 223 F.3d 275, 280\u201381 (4th Cir. 2000) (quoting \nEnglish v. Pabst Brewing Co., 828 F.2d 1047, 1049 (4th \nCir. 1987)). \nPlaintiff\u2019s \u201cNotice of Timeliness\u201d first contends that \nhis claims accrued between the dates of June 15, 2015, \n\n36a \n \n \nwhen the FBI declined to prosecute the case, and June \n3, 2016, when the incident report was expunged from \nhis record.  ECF No. 62 at 1.  He argues that June 3, \n2016 is the \u201cmost logical start date\u201d because it was not \nuntil then that the FBI and the BOP were finished \nwith their investigations.  He asserts that USP \nHazelton staff repeatedly told him that the matter was \nsuspended until the FBI completed its investigation, \nand that he could do nothing about it until then.  Id.   \nIn his response in opposition to the defendant\u2019s \ndispositive motion, Plaintiff next argues that based \nupon Houston v. Lack, the prison mailbox rule should \napply, asserting that, in Houston, the Supreme Court \nfound that in prisoner cases, a filing is deemed \u201cfiled\u201d \nat the moment that the prisoner places the document \nin the prison mail system.  ECF No. 74 at 2.  Plaintiff\u2019s \nresponse in opposition, sworn under penalty of perjury \nas true and correct, avers that he gave it to the prison \nofficials to mail the same day he dated his complaint, \n\u201cwhich was April 7, 2017 and no later.\u201d8  Id. at 3.  He \ncontends that he put the motion in his door; the officer \nmaking rounds collected it; and that he recalls signing \nand dating it the day it left his cell because they were \non lockdown that day.  ECF No. 74-1 at 2.  He avers \nthat he was particularly mindful of the issue of \ntimeliness and because he previously filed a \u00a7 2255 \nmotion that was time-barred.9  Id. He describes the \n \n8 Plaintiff\u2019s original complaint was dated April 7, 2017. See ECF \nNo. 1 at 7, 8. However, it was postmarked May 1, 2017. [ECF No. \n1-2] and not received by the court for filing until May 3, 2017.  Id. \n9 A check of Plaintiff\u2019s underlying criminal docket in Case No. \n1:05cr417 in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, available on \n\n37a \n \n \nusual procedure for mail collection at the prison \nbeginning with handing of the piece of mail to an  \nofficer who is not certified in handling mail . . . just \na regular C.O. . . [who] inspects it and places it in \nhis desk for a few hours . . . [until] it is normally \ncollected anywhere from 8:00 at night until 10:00 \np.m. then when the third shift comes in mail is \nescorted to the mailroom.  It is not uncommon for \nmail to be misplaced, lost or late.  Maybe even sent \nto the wrong block. \nId. at 3.  He avers that he does not believe that the \nprison intentionally sent his mail out late, but believes \nthat because they are sometimes so \u201coverloaded with \nwork\u201d that they \u201cmake careless mistakes.\u201d  Id.  He \ncontends that he wanted to make sure that his \ncomplaint was timely in case the court did not \nrecognize the January 25, 2017 accrual date as the \ndate the time limit began to accrue.  Id. \nAttached to the Defendant\u2019s dispositive motion is a \nsworn declaration from Gloria Hartzog, the Case \nManagement Coordinator at USP Big Sandy, who \nstates in pertinent part: \n1) . . . I supervised mail room staff, and am \nfamiliar with mail room procedures at USP Big \nSandy, including the process utilized to collect and \nsend outgoing mail from inmates. \n2) USP Big Sandy staff collects outgoing mail \nfrom inmates on a daily basis every weekday, \nMonday through Friday, except for any \nFederal Holidays. \n \nPACER, corroborates that Plaintiff\u2019s \u00a7 2255 motion was \ndismissed as time-barred on December 21, 2011. \n\n38a \n \n \n3) Specifically, outgoing mail is collected from \ninmates and delivered to the USP Big Sandy \nmail room at approximately 6:00AM each \nmorning every weekday, Monday through \nFriday. \n4) If an inmate sends an outgoing piece of \ncorrespondence using regular United States Postal \nService mail, that piece of outgoing correspondence \nis not specifically logged or otherwise tracked at \nUSP Big Sandy. \n5) A staff member from the USP Big Sandy mail \nroom transports all outgoing mail to the United \nStates \nPost \nOffice \nin \nInez, \nKentucky \nat \napproximately 8:00AM every weekday, Monday \nthrough Friday. \n6) The outgoing mail is then transported on the \nsame day from the United States Post Office in Inez, \nKentucky to a United States Post Office Hub in \nCharleston, West Virginia where the outgoing mail \nis sorted, metered, and dispatched for delivery. \n7) I am aware that inmate Donte Parrish, Federal \nRegister Number 13493-067 has filed a lawsuit in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern \nDistrict of West Virginia. \n8) The envelope that Parrish used to send his \nlawsuit reflects that Parrish used regular United \nStates Postal Service mail . . . \n9) The envelope that Parrish used to send his \nlawsuit was postmarked at the United States Post \nOffice Hub in Charleston, West Virginia on Monday, \nMay 1, 2017. . . \n\n39a \n \n \n10) As described above, outgoing mail is collected \nand delivered to the USP Big Sandy mail room on a \ndaily basis every weekday.  Therefore, the fact \nthat Parrish\u2019s lawsuit was postmarked on \nMonday, May 1, 2017 reflects that the lawsuit \nwas collected and delivered to the USP Big \nSandy mail room on Monday, May 1, 2017.  At \nthe earliest, Parrish may have prepared the \ndocument and added it to the collection of \noutgoing mail from inmates at USP Big Sandy \nafter mail was collected on Friday, April 28, \n2017 or over the weekend on Saturday, April \n29, 2017 or Sunday, April 30, 2017. \nECF No. 65-2 at 1\u20132 (emphasis added). \nHere, the parties\u2019 competing arguments over the \ndate \nPlaintiff \nactually \nsubmitted \nhis \noriginal \ncomplaint to prison authorities for mailing need not be \naddressed. \n \nPlaintiff\u2019s \nmailbox \nrule \nargument \noverlooks the fact that in Houston, the Supreme Court \nwas considering the appeal of a federal habeas claim, \nnot considering the application of the mailbox rule to \nthe FTCA.  While the undersigned does not dispute the \nSupreme Court\u2019s findings as to the mailbox rule with \nregard to habeas claims and appeals, as noted supra, \nthe FTCA is a comprehensive statutory scheme that \nmust be considered apart from all other tort actions, \nand therefore, its waiver of immunity must be strictly \nconstrued.  Accordingly, the Court\u2019s rulings in Houston \nare not applicable here, and for the reasons stated \nabove, the undersigned finds that the mailbox rule \ndoes not apply to FTCA claims.  Nonetheless, even if \nthe mailbox rule were applicable here, it still would \nnot save the claims administratively exhausted in \nPlaintiff\u2019s Administrative Tort Claim TRT-MXR-2016-\n\n40a \n \n \n06710; given that the 6-month deadline for the timely \nfiling of those claims was April 6, 2017 and Plaintiff \navers that he did not hand the complaint to a prison \nofficial for mailing until April 7, 2017, they would still \nbe time-barred. \nPlaintiff\u2019s response in opposition next argues that \nthe \u201cactual accrual date\u201d for his complaint should be \nJanuary 25, 2017, when the murder charge was finally \nexpunged, appears to be an attempt to argue for \nequitable tolling of the statute of limitations based on \na continuing tort.  A review of Plaintiff\u2019s two \nadministrative tort claims reveals that the basis for \nthe claims raised in each was the DHO\u2019s June 3, 2016 \nruling, the date Parrish\u2019s appeal was granted by \nRegional Director J.F. Caraway, when his record was \nexpunged, but a rehearing was issued, and the \nincident report was changed from a 100 series incident \nreport (killing) to a 100A incident report (assisting in \na killing).  Therefore, it appears that Plaintiff is \nattempting to argue that the statute of limitations \nshould be tolled for 110 days to make his complaint \ntimely.  The plaintiff\u2019s claim is untenable, however, in \nlight of the exact wording of the statute, and the strict \nconstruction the Court must give to the statute.  Title \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2401(b) specifically states: \nA tort claim against the United States shall be \nforever barred unless it is presented in writing \nto the appropriate Federal agency within two \nyears after such claim accrues or unless action \nis begun within six months after the date of \nmailing, by certified or registered mail, of notice \nof final denial of the claim by the agency to \nwhich it was presented. \n\n41a \n \n \nBecause the FTCA waives the United States \ntraditional grant of sovereign immunity, the statute \nmust be strictly construed.  United States v. Kubrick, \n444 U.S. 111, 117-18 (1979).  Put simply, because the \nUnited States may not be sued without its permission, \nthe Court may not take it upon itself \u201cto extend the \nwaiver beyond that which Congress intended.\u201d  Id.  \nTherefore, \u201c[i]f an action is not filed as the statute \nrequires, the six-month time period may not be \nextended\u201d by the Court. Tuttle v. United States Postal \nService, 585 F.Supp. 55, (M.D. Pa. 1983) (citing \nKubrick at 117-18.)). \nThe statute specifically states that the claim must \nbe filed within six months after the date of mailing.  \nThe plaintiff\u2019s contention that January 25, 2017 \nshould be the \u201caccrual date\u201d for his claim, thus tolling \nthe statute of limitations for 110 days, would extend \nthe six-month period beyond what Congress intended \nand cannot stand.  Equitable tolling in suits against \nthe United States is only available in exceptional \ncircumstances.  See Muth v. United States, 1 F.3d 246, \n251 (4th Cir. 1993).  Equitable tolling is only available \nwhen a claimant has exercised due diligence in \npreserving his legal rights, id., or can show that the \ndefendant \u201cattempted to mislead him and that the \nplaintiff reasonably relied on the misrepresentation by \nneglecting to file a timely charge.\u201d  See English v. \nPabst Brewing Co., 828 F.2d 1047, 1049 (4th Cir. 1987).  \nHere, despite being advised that he had six months in \nwhich to file suit over the claims in his Administrative \nTort \nClaim \nTRT-MXR-2016-06710, \ninexplicably, \nPlaintiff waited until the time had elapsed before \nfiling suit.  Thus, the plaintiff\u2019s lack of diligence does \nnot comport with a finding of equitable tolling.  \n\n42a \n \n \nMoreover, the agency\u2019s denial letter clearly and \ncorrectly informed the plaintiff that he had six months \nfrom the date of denial of Administrative Tort Claim \nTRT-MXR-2016- 06710 in which to file suit in federal \ncourt; it did not mislead Plaintiff or make any \nmisrepresentations.  Therefore, Plaintiff\u2019s FTCA \nclaims first raised in Administrative Tort Claim TRT-\nMXR-2016-06710 should be dismissed as time-barred. \nIV. \nRecommendation \nAccordingly, \nfor \nthe \nforegoing \nreasons, \nthe \nundersigned RECOMMENDS that the Defendant\u2019s \nMotion to Dismiss for lack of subject matter \njurisdiction [ECF No. 65], be GRANTED in part as \nto Administrative Tort Claim TRT-MXR-2016-06710, \nbecause those claims are barred by the statute of \nlimitations; that Defendant\u2019s motion be DENIED in \npart as to Administrative Tort Claim TRT-MXR-\n06283; and that the Defendant be DIRECTED to \naddress the remainder of Plaintiff\u2019s as stated in \nAdministrative Tort Claim TRT-MXR-06283 on the \nmerits. \nWithin fourteen (14) days after being served with \na copy of this Report and Recommendation, any party \nmay file with the Clerk of Court written objections \nidentifying those portions of the recommendation to \nwhich objections are made.  Objections shall identify \neach portion of the magistrate judge\u2019s recommended \ndisposition that is being challenged and shall specify \nthe basis for each objection.

A copy of any \n\n43a \n \n \nobjections should also be submitted to the United \nStates District Judge.

Also pending are Donte Parrish\u2019s (\u201cParrish\u201d) \nobjections to the magistrate judge\u2019s recommendations \n(Dkt. No. 127).  For the reasons that follow, the Court \nOVERRULES Parrish\u2019s objections (Dkt. Nos. 127), \nADOPTS IN PART AND REJECTS IN PART the \n\n45a \n \n \nR&R (Dkt. No. 121), GRANTS the government\u2019s \nmotion (Dkt. No. 102), and DISMISSES the case. \nI. \nA. \nProcedural History \nOn May 3, 2017, Parrish, a federal inmate, initiated \nthis action under the Federal Tort Claims Act, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 2671 et seq. (\u201cFTCA\u201d) (Dkt. No. 1).  Pursuant \nto 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636 and its local rules, the Court \nreferred the complaint to Magistrate Judge Aloi for \ninitial screening. \nOn December 18, 2017, Parrish filed an amended \ncomplaint alleging false imprisonment, abuse of \nprocess, intentional infliction of emotional distress, \nnegligence, and malicious prosecution related to the \nBureau of Prisons\u2019s (\u201cBOP\u201d) investigation of a 2009 \nincident at USP Hazelton, and his placement at \nvarious Special Management Units (\u201cSMUs\u201d) during \nthe pendency of that investigation (Dkt. No. 39).  \nParrish filed two Administrative Claim forms \nregarding \nthese \nclaims, \nboth \nof \nwhich \nwere \nsubsequently denied by the BOP.  Following the \nmagistrate judge\u2019s order directing the government to \naddress whether Parrish\u2019s FTCA claims were timely, \nthe government moved to dismiss the amended \ncomplaint for the first time on June 11, 2018. \nBy Memorandum Opinion and Order entered on \nJanuary 16, 2019, the Court granted in part and \ndenied in part the government\u2019s first motion to dismiss \n(Dkt. No. 85).  The Court denied the motion to dismiss \nParrish\u2019s claim as stated in Administrative Tort Claim \nTRT-MXR-06283 (\u201cAdministrative Claim \u2018283\u201d or \u201cthe \n\u2018283 Claim\u201d) based on the government\u2019s failure to \nadvise Parrish of the six-month deadline within which \n\n46a \n \n \nhe was required to file suit.  In the \u2018283 Claim, Parrish \nhad alleged that a BOP regional director \u201cabused the \nprocess\u201d \nwhen \nhe \nremanded \nfor \nrehearing \na \ndisciplinary hearing officer\u2019s (\u201cDHO\u201d) decision on the \nincident report for the 2009 incident at USP Hazelton.  \nThe Court then granted the government\u2019s motion as to \nParrish\u2019s claims in his Administrative Tort Claim \nTRT-MXR-2016-06710 (\u201cAdministrative Claim \u2018710\u201d \nor \u201cthe \u2018710 Claim\u201d).  Specifically, the Court concluded \nthat the \u2018710 Claim was time-barred because Parrish \nhad failed to file this action within six months after \nreceiving adequate notice of the filing deadline. \nOn January 23, 2019, Parrish moved to amend his \ncomplaint a second time, seeking to \u201cadd more claims\u201d \nto Administrative Claim \u2018283 (Dkt. No. 90).  He \nconceded that the claims he sought to add were \noriginally raised in the \u2018710 Claim, but argued that the \n\u2018283 Claim stemmed from the \u2018710 Claim.  On July 19, \n2019, the Court denied Parrish\u2019s second motion to \namend, deeming it an attempt to add untimely claims \n(Dkt. No. 111).  It concluded that the proposed \namendment did not allege the same misconduct as in \nClaim \u2018283, and explained that Parrish could not \ncircumvent its prior determination that the \u2018710 Claim \nwas untimely by attempting to consolidate it with the \ntimely \u2018283 Claim. \nThe government filed a second motion to dismiss or, \nalternatively, motion for summary judgment on June \n2, 2019 (Dkt. No. 102), in which it contended:  (1) the \ncharge pertaining to the 2009 incident at USP \nHazelton was expunged from his prison disciplinary \nrecord; (2) the claims were not first presented to the \nappropriate federal agency; (3) the claims in the \namended complaint were not meritorious under \n\n47a \n \n \napplicable state law; and (4) Parrish is barred from \nseeking damages beyond those requested in the \u2018283 \nClaim.  Parrish responded to the motion on August 5, \n2019 (No. 117).  The government did not reply. \nB. \nReport and Recommendation \nOn November 27, 2019, Magistrate Judge Aloi \nentered an R&R, recommending that Parrish\u2019s claims \nof false imprisonment and malicious prosecution be \ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \nbecause they are not the same claims raised in the \u2018283 \nClaim (Dkt. No. 121).  The magistrate judge also \nconcluded that Parrish\u2019s intentional infliction of \nemotional distress, negligence, and abuse of process \nclaims, and his argument that the government had \nfalsified documents, lacked merit.  He further \nrecommended that Parrish\u2019s claim for relief be denied \nbecause it exceeded the amount originally sought in \nthe \u2018283 Claim.1 \nThe R&R informed the parties of their right to file \nwritten objections to the R&R.  The Court received \nParrish\u2019s timely objections to the R&R on January 2, \n2020 (Dkt. No. 127). \nC. \nParrish\u2019s Objections \nParrish has objected to the entirety of the R&R.  He \nspecifically \nobjects \nto \nthe \nmagistrate \njudge\u2019s \nconclusion that his false imprisonment and malicious \nprosecution claims are barred because they were not \nproperly raised in the \u2018283 Claim.  He contends that \nthe defendant was \u201con notice\u201d of the circumstances \n \n1 The magistrate judge also recommended that the Court deny as \nmoot a motion for summary judgment filed by Parrish on May 30, \n2018, but the Court had already denied the motion (Dkt. No. 95). \n\n48a \n \n \nsurrounding his amended complaint.  He further \nobjects to the recommendations regarding the merits \nof his FTCA claims, the amount of his claim for relief, \nand his allegation that the government falsified \ndocuments. \nII. \nWhen considering a magistrate judge\u2019s R&R \npursuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 636(b)(1), the Court must \nreview de novo those portions to which objection is \ntimely made.  Otherwise, \u201cthe Court may adopt, \nwithout explanation, any of the magistrate judge\u2019s \nrecommendations to which the [defendant] does not \nobject.\u201d  Dellacirprete v. Gutierrez, 479 F. Supp. 2d 600, \n603\u201304 (N.D. W. Va. 2007) (citing Camby v. Davis, 718 \nF.2d 198, 199 (4th Cir. 1983)).  Courts will uphold \nportions of a recommendation to which no objection is \nmade if there is no \u201cclear error.\u201d  See Diamond v. \nColonial Life & Accident Ins. Co., 416 F.3d 310, 315 \n(4th Cir. 2005). \nIII. \nThe \nFTCA \nrequires \na \nplaintiff \nto \nfile \nan \nadministrative claim prior to commencing a suit \nagainst the United States.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2675.  First, a \nplaintiff must timely file his claim with the \nappropriate federal agency, which then has the power \nto settle or deny it. \u00a7 2401(b).  The plaintiff may file a \ncivil action against the United States only if the \nagency has denied the claim.  \u00a7 2675(a).  Alternatively, \n\u201c[t]he failure of an agency to make final disposition of \na claim within six months after it is filed shall . . . be \ndeemed a final denial of the claim\u201d for the purposes of \nfulfilling the requirement.  Id. \n\n49a \n \n \nThe FTCA\u2019s administrative exhaustion requirement \nis fulfilled when the agency \u201creceives from a \nclaimant . . . an executed Standard Form 95 or other \nwritten notification of an incident, accompanied by a \nclaim for money damages in a sum certain.\u201d  28 C.F.R. \n\u00a7 14.2 (emphasis added).  The purpose of this notice is \nto enable the agency to investigate and place a sum \ncertain value on the claim.  Ahmed v. United States, \n30 F.3d 514, 516\u201317 (4th Cir. 1994); cf. Henderson v. \nUnited States, 785 F.2d 121, 124 (4th Cir. 1986) \n(quoting Meeker v. United States, 435 F.2d 1219, 1222 \n(8th Cir. 1970) (explaining that Congress intended to \n\u201cimprove and expedite disposition of monetary claims \nagainst the Government by establishing a system for \nprelitigation settlement, to enable consideration of \nclaims by the agency having the best information \nconcerning the incident, and to ease court congestion \nand avoid unnecessary litigation\u201d).  Consequently, a \nplaintiff cannot present an administrative claim based \non one theory of relief and then maintain an FTCA suit \nbased a different cause of action or set of facts.  Deloria \nv. Veterans Admin., 927 F.2d 1009, 1012 (7th Cir. 1991) \n(finding administrative notice of conspiracy to alter \nmedical records was not sufficient notice of subsequent \nFTCA claims of medical malpractice and negligence \nbecause the \u201callegations involve wholly different \nincidents\u201d).2 \n \n2 Compare Doe v. United States, 618 F. Supp. 71, 74 (D.S.C. 1985) \n(explaining that it \u201cwould be an act of legal socery [sic]\u201d to \n\u201cconvert\u201d an intentional assault and battery administrative claim \nto an FTCA claim of medical malpractice because \u201cthe facts \nsimply do not support any claim other than one for assault and \nbattery\u201d), with Munger v. United States, 116 F. Supp.2d 672, 676\u2013\n77 (D. Md. 2000) (allowing two plaintiffs to file separate FTCA \n\n50a \n \n \nThe government contends Parrish\u2019s amended \ncomplaint should be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction \nbased on his failure to exhaust administrative \nremedies as to all of his claims (Dkt. No. 103 at 11).  \nIndeed, the Fourth Circuit considers this requirement \nto be jurisdictional in nature.  Perkins v. United States, \n55 F.3d 910, 917 (4th Cir. 1995) (affirming district \ncourt\u2019s denial of a motion to amend when there is \u201cno \njurisdiction to hear the case because [Plaintiff] failed \nto first submit those claims as administrative claims \nand \nexhaust \nher \nadministrative \nremedies\u201d); \nHenderson v. United States, 785 F.2d 121, 123 (4th Cir. \n1986) (\u201cIt is well-settled that the requirement of filing \nan administrative claim is jurisdictional and may not \nbe waived.\u201d); Kielwien v. United States, 540 F.2d 676, \n679 (4th Cir. 1976) (stating that the \u201crequirement is \njurisdictional and is not waivable.\u201d). \nSupreme Court precedent and the language of the \nFTCA confirm this line of authority.  Recently, in Fort \nBend County v. Davis, 139 S. Ct. 1843 (2019), a \nunanimous \nSupreme \nCourt \nclarified \nthat \nadministrative requirements are jurisdictional in two \ninstances:  (1) When Congress clearly makes it so; or \n(2) when a \u201clong line of Supreme Court decisions left \nundisturbed by Congress has attached a jurisdictional \nlabel to a prescription.\u201d  Id. at 1849\u201350 (internal \nquotation marks omitted)3; Cf. McNeil v. United States, \n \nclaims even though the plaintiffs did not file separate \nadministrative claims because the claims \u201carose out of the same \nfacts\u201d). \n3  The Court in Fort Bend County distinguished between \njurisdictional bars and mandatory claim-processing and other \nprocedural preconditions of relief, explaining that the latter, but \nnot the former, are subject to forfeiture. Id. at 1851\u201352 (\u201c[A] rule \n\n51a \n \n \n508 U.S. 106, 112 (1993) (upholding dismissal of FTCA \nclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction where a \npro se plaintiff had failed to exhaust administrative \nremedies prior to filing suit because \u201c[t]he most \nnatural reading of the statute indicates that Congress \nintended to require complete exhaustion of Executive \nremedies before invocation of the judicial process.\u201d). \nWhen Congress granted federal district courts \nexclusive jurisdiction to hear tort claims against the \nUnited States in the FTCA, it conferred such power \n\u201c[s]ubject to the provisions of chapter 171.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1346(b)(1).  Chapter 171, Tort Claims Procedure, in \nturn, \ncontains \nthe \nadministrative \nexhaustion \nrequirement, \u00a7 2675, which indicates that the \nrequirement is a jurisdictional prerequisite because \nCongress has clearly stated it to be so.  Accordingly, \nFourth Circuit precedent, read together with Fort \nBend County and McNeil and the language of the \nFTCA, \nconfirms \nthe \nadministrative \nexhaustion \nrequirement to be a necessary predicate to this Court\u2019s \nexercise of jurisdiction. \nIV. \nA. \nFalse Imprisonment \nBecause the Court has already dismissed as \nuntimely Parrish\u2019s Administrative Claim \u2018710, which \nincluded his claim of false imprisonment (See the \nCourt\u2019s January 16, 2019 and July 19, 2019 Orders, \nDkt. Nos. 85 at 15; 111 at 8), it declines to adopt the \n \nmay be mandatory without being jurisdictional.\u201d). Here, the \ngovernment has not forfeited its argument that Parrish has not \nproperly presented his FTCA abuse of process claim to the \nappropriate federal agency (Dkt. No. 102 at 11\u201313). \n\n52a \n \n \nmagistrate judge\u2019s recommendation that Parrish\u2019s \nfalse imprisonment claim be dismissed for lack of \nsubject matter jurisdiction, and rejects Parrish\u2019s \nargument that his false imprisonment claim was \nadequately presented in his Administrative Claim \n\u2018283.  Accordingly, the Court dismisses this claim for \nfailure to state a claim upon which relief can be \ngranted. Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(b)(6) \nB. \nIntentional Infliction of Emotional \nDistress and Negligence \nParrish\u2019s Administrative Claim \u2018283 is the only \ntimely underlying administrative claim remaining in \nthis case.  It contains one allegation that a BOP \nregional director \u201cabused the process\u201d when he \nremanded for rehearing a DHO\u2019s decision on a charge \nrelated to the 2009 incident at USP Hazelton.  Parrish \nconceded as much in his response opposing the \ngovernment\u2019s motion to dismiss:  \u201cThe change of the \ncharge from 100 (killing) to 100A (assisting in killing) \non remand was the basis for TRT-MXR-2016-06283.\u201d  \nNotably, the R&R observed that this underlying abuse \nof process claim is the only remaining claim. \nDespite the lack of jurisdiction, the magistrate \njudge \nrecommended \nthat \nParrish\u2019s \nintentional \ninfliction of emotional distress and negligence claims \nbe dismissed on their merits.  The Court declines to \nadopt that recommendation, and will dismiss those \nclaims for lack of subject matter jurisdiction because \nthey allege theories of relief Parrish clearly did not \npresent in Claim \u2018283.  Steel Co. v. Citizens for a Better \nEnvironment, 523 U.S. 83, 95 (1998) (recognizing that \n\u201cwithout jurisdiction . . . the only function remaining \n\n53a \n \n \nto the court is that of announcing the fact and \ndismissing the cause\u201d). \nC. \nMalicious Prosecution \nParrish\u2019s malicious prosecution claim must also be \ndismissed for lack of subject matter jurisdiction \nbecause it was not raised in the \u2018283 Claim.  This is so \neven though Parrish urges the Court to overlook the \nadministrative exhaustion requirement, arguing that \nthe government was on notice of the circumstances \nsurrounding the claim because the \u2018710 Claim \nreferenced the \u2018283 Claim and \u201c[dealt] with the same \nmatter.\u201d \nEven when liberally construed, this argument fails.  \nFirst, the \u2018710 Claim did not include a claim for \nmalicious prosecution.  Second, as explained in the \nCourt\u2019s Memorandum Opinion and Order denying \nParrish\u2019s second motion to amend his complaint, \nParrish cannot circumvent its prior determination \nthat the \u2018283 Claim is the only timely underlying claim.  \nTherefore, because Parrish has failed to satisfy the \nnecessary prerequisite to file a malicious prosecution \nclaim, the Court overrules his objection and adopts the \nR&R\u2019s recommendation that Parrish\u2019s malicious \nprosecution claim be dismissed for lack of subject \nmatter jurisdiction. \nD. \nAbuse of Process \nParrish has failed to satisfy the administrative \nexhaustion requirement for the claim of abuse of \nprocess alleged in his amended complaint because it \ndoes not relate to the BOP regional director\u2019s remand, \nwhich was the subject of his \u2018283 Claim.  Parrish \nalleges that, although he appealed the DHO\u2019s decision \nthat he had committed an offense of \u201ckilling,\u201d a \n\n54a \n \n \ncategory 100 charge, upon remand for rehearing a \nBOP regional director changed that offense to \n\u201cassisting in killing,\u201d a category 100A charge (Dkt. Nos. \n117\u20131 at 5, 51\u20138 at 2).4 \nIn contrast, the abuse of process claim in his \namended complaint alleges that the government \nmisused the processes of administrative detention and \nSMU designation for the sole purpose of illegally \nconfining Parrish, and that his SMU hearing took \nplace under false pretenses.  The federal employees \nwhose actions form the basis for this claim include the \nSMU hearing examiner, Designation and Sentence \nComputation Center staff, the wardens of three BOP \nfacilities, and \u201call those employees who work[ed] for \nthe FBOP and [were] assigned to USP Hazelton in \n2009\u201310.\u201d \nAlthough both are labeled abuse of process, any \ncommonality between the \u2018283 and FTCA claims ends \nthere.  Each sets forth a different theory of relief; each \nis based on a different set of facts; and each involves \ndifferent BOP employees.  Because these allegations \n\u201cinvolve wholly different incidents,\u201d Deloria, 927 F.2d \nat 1012, the \u2018283 Claim failed to provide proper notice \nfor the government to undertake an investigation and \nevaluation of the abuse of process claim alleged in \nParrish\u2019s amended complaint. \n \n4  The Court notes that the BOP\u2019s policy regarding the \nimplementation of 28 C.F.R. \u00a7 541.3(b) pertaining to categories of \ndisciplinary offenses states that \u201caiding another person to commit \nany of these offenses, attempting to commit them, or making \nplans to commit them is considered equivalent to committing the \noffense itself. In these cases, the letter \u201cA\u201d is combined with the \noffense code\u201d (Dkt. No. 103\u20134 at 11). \n\n55a \n \n \nBecause Parrish has failed to satisfy the FTCA\u2019s \njurisdictional prerequisite, the Court rejects the \nrecommendation in the R&R that this claim be denied \nand, instead, pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 12(b)(1), dismisses Parrish\u2019s abuse of \nprocess claim based on lack of jurisdiction.5 \nV. \nCONCLUSION \nFor the reasons discussed, the Court: \nOVERRULES Parrish\u2019s objections (Dkt. Nos. 127); \nADOPTS IN PART AND REJECTS IN PART the \nReport and Recommendation (Dkt. No. 121); \nGRANTS the United States\u2019s motion to dismiss or, \nalternatively, for summary judgment (Dkt. No. \n102); \nDISMISSES Parrish\u2019s false imprisonment claim \nWITH PREJUDICE; and \nDISMISSES \nall \nother \nclaims \nWITHOUT \nPREJUDICE. \nIt is so ORDERED. \nThe Court DIRECTS the Clerk to transmit this \nOrder to counsel of record and to the pro se plaintiff, \ncertified mail, return receipt requested. \nDated:  March 23, 2020. \n/s/ Irene M. Keeley \n \nIRENE M.

Keeley, Senior District Judge.  (1:17-cv-\n00070-IMK) \n \n \n \n \nSubmitted:  October 20, 2020 Decided:  October 23, \n2020 \n \n \n \n \nBefore GREGORY, Chief Judge, DIAZ, Circuit Judge, \nand SHEDD, Senior Circuit Judge. \n\n57a \n \n \n \n \n \n \nRemanded by unpublished per curiam opinion. \n \n \n \n \nDonte Parrish, Appellant Pro Se. \n \n \n \n \nUnpublished opinions are not binding precedent in \nthis circuit. \nPER CURIAM: \nDonte Parrish seeks to appeal the district court\u2019s \norder adopting in part and rejecting in part the \nmagistrate judge\u2019s recommendation and dismissing \nParrish\u2019s complaint pursuant to the Federal Tort \nClaims Act, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1346(b)(1), 2671-2680.  The \ndistrict court entered its judgment on March 24, 2020.  \nParrish filed his notice of appeal, at the earliest, on \nJuly 8, 2020.  See Houston v. Lack, 487 U.S. 266, 276 \n(1988) (establishing prison mailbox rule). Parrish\u2019s \nnotice of appeal is clearly untimely.  See Fed. R. App. \nP. 4(a)(1)(B).  Parrish, however, claimed that he did \nnot receive a copy of the district court\u2019s order until \nJune 25, 2020, and there is some evidence in the record \nsupporting this assertion. \nPursuant to Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6), the district court \nmay reopen the time to file an appeal for a 14-day \nperiod if:  (1) the movant did not receive proper notice \nof the entry of the judgment within 21 days after entry; \n(2) the motion to reopen the appeal period is filed \nwithin 180 days after the judgment is entered or \nwithin 14 days after the movant receives proper notice \nof the entry, whichever is earlier; and (3) no party \nwould be prejudiced.  Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6); see Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 77(d).  Because Parrish claimed that he did \n\n58a \n \n \nnot receive a copy of the court\u2019s judgment until 93 days \nafter entry, and he filed the notice of appeal within 14 \ndays after he purportedly received a copy of the court\u2019s \njudgment, we construe the notice of appeal as a motion \nto reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  We \nremand to the district court to determine whether the \nappeal period should be reopened.  The record, as \nsupplemented, will be returned to this court for \nfurther consideration. \nREMANDED \n \n \n\n59a \n \n \n_____________________ \n \nAPPENDIX E \n_____________________ \n \nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF WEST \nVIRGINIA \nDONTE PARRISH, \nPlaintiff, \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF \nAMERICA, \nDefendant. \nCivil action No. \n1:17cv70 \n(Judge Keeley) \n \nORDER REOPENING TIME WITHIN \nPLAINTIFF MAY FILE AN APPEAL \nOn May 3, 2017, the pro se Plaintiff, Donte Parrish \n(\u201cParrish\u201d), filed a complaint against the United \nStates of America (\u201cUnited States\u201d) pursuant to the \nFederal Tort Claims Act (Dkt. No. 1).  On March 23, \n2020, the Court adopted in part and rejected in part \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s Report and Recommendation \nand dismissed Parrish\u2019s complaint (Dkt. No. 130).  \nThereafter, the Clerk entered Judgment on March 24, \n2020 (Dkt. No. 131). \nIt was not until July 8, 2020, however, that Parrish \nfiled a Notice of Appeal challenging the Court\u2019s \ndismissal of his complaint (Dkt. No. 137).  In support, \nhe stated that he did not receive a copy of the Court\u2019s \nOrder until June 25, 2020, because of his transfer from \nfederal to state custody.  Id. at 1. \n\n60a \n \n \nIn an unpublished opinion entered on October 23, \n2020, the United States Court of Appeals for the \nFourth Circuit noted that Parrish\u2019s appeal was \nuntimely because he had not filed it within thirty (30) \ndays after the entry of judgment on March 24, 2020.  \nFed. R. App. 4(a)(1)(A).  However, the Court of Appeals \nconstrued Parrish\u2019s Notice of Appeal as a motion to \nreopen the time within which to file an appeal based \non his assertion that he never received a copy of this \nCourt\u2019s Judgment until ninety-three (93) days after its \nentry, and also on the fact that he had filed his Notice \nof Appeal within fourteen (14) days after receiving a \ncopy of the Court\u2019s Order (Dkt. No. 142 at 2).  \nAccordingly, the Court of Appeals remanded the \nmatter for this Court to determine whether Parrish\u2019s \nappeal period should be reopened pursuant to Federal \nRule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6).  Id. \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6) \nprovides that a district court may reopen the time to \nfile an appeal if (A) the moving party did not receive \nnotice of entry of judgment within twenty-one (21) \ndays after its entry; (B) the motion is filed within one \nhundred and eighty (180) days of entry of judgment or \nwithin fourteen (14) days of receiving notice from the \ncourt, whichever is earlier; and (C) no party would be \nprejudiced. \nHere, the Court\u2019s Order and Clerk\u2019s Judgment were \nmailed to Parrish by certified mail, return receipt \nrequested, at USP Thomson, Illinois, on March 23 and \nMarch 24, 2020, respectively (Dkt. Nos. 130\u20131, 131\u20131).  \nAlthough service of the Clerk\u2019s Judgment was \naccepted at USP Thomson on April 7, 2020 (Dkt. No. \n132), the Court\u2019s Order was returned as undelivered \nand remailed by the Clerk to Parrish at SCI Coal \n\n61a \n \n \nTownship, Pennsylvania, a state facility, on June 23, \n2020 (Dkt. No. 130\u20132).  Service of the Court\u2019s Order \nwas accepted at SCI Coal Township on June 29, 2020 \n(Dkt. No. 136). \nUpon review, the Court concludes that Parrish has \nsatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6), and that the time for him \nto file an appeal should be reopened.  In the first place, \nit is not established that Parrish received notice of the \nJudgment within twenty-one (21) days after its entry, \nas required by Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure \n4(a)(6)(A).  Although service of the Clerk\u2019s Judgment \nwas accepted by USP Thomson within fourteen (14) \ndays after its entry on March 23, 2020, it is unclear \nwhen Parrish was moved from USP Thomson into \nPennsylvania state custody at SCI Coal Township, or \nwhether he actually received notice of the Clerk\u2019s \nJudgment when service was executed. \nMoreover, it appears that service of the Court\u2019s \nOrder was not completed until, at the earliest, June 25, \n2020, ninety-eight (93) days after its entry.  And \nParrish filed his Notice of Appeal within fourteen (14) \ndays after he received that Order, on June 25, 2020, \nthereby satisfying the time frame established by \nFederal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6)(B).  \nFinally, Federal Rule of Appellate Procedure 4(a)(6)(C) \nis satisfied because no party will be prejudiced if \nParrish is allowed to refile his appeal. \nTherefore, pursuant to Federal Rule of Appellate \nProcedure 4(a)(6), following a thorough review of the \ncircumstances of this case, the Court REOPENS the \ntime for Parrish to file his appeal for fourteen (14) days \nfollowing the entry of this Order.  The Clerk SHALL \n\n62a \n \n \nsupplement this Court\u2019s record accordingly, and \ntransmit the same to the United States Court of \nAppeals for the Fourth Circuit. \nThe Court DIRECTS the Clerk to transmit this \nOrder to counsel of record and to the pro se plaintiff, \ncertified mail, return receipt requested. \n \nDated:  January 8, 2020. \n/s/ Irene M.

Judges King, \nGregory, Wynn, Thacker, Benjamin, and Berner voted \nto grant rehearing en banc. \nEntered at the direction of Judge Niemeyer. \nFor the Court \n \n/s/ Nwamaka Anowi, Clerk \n \n \n\n65a \n \n \nNIEMEYER, Circuit Judge, in support of denial of the \nsupplemental petition for rehearing: \nThe issue in this case does not rise to the level that \nwould justify an en banc rehearing, as it involves a \nstraightforward application of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c), \nwhich establishes a jurisdictional requirement for \neffecting an appeal, and Federal Rule of Appellate \nProcedure 4(a)(6), which implements \u00a7 2107(c). \nWhen Donte Parrish filed a notice of appeal in this \ncase that was over two months late, the untimeliness \nof his notice precluded us, as a jurisdictional matter, \nfrom considering his appeal.  But upon receiving his \nexplanation claiming that he had not timely received \na copy of the district court\u2019s judgment dismissing his \ncase, we treated his untimely notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6) \nand remanded the case to the district court for \nconsideration of that motion.  Parrish v. United States, \n827 F. App\u2019x 327, 327 (4th Cir. 2020) (per curiam); 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) (providing district courts with \nauthority to \u201creopen the time for appeal for a period of \n14 days from the date of entry of the order reopening \nthe time for appeal\u201d); Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6) (similarly \nauthorizing a district court to \u201creopen the time to file \nan appeal for a period of 14 days after the date when \nits order to reopen is entered\u201d). \nOn remand, after concluding that Parrish satisfied \nthe requirements for reopening the time for filing an \nappeal, the district court entered an order authorizing \nParrish to file a notice of appeal within a 14-day \nwindow that commenced with the date of the court\u2019s \norder.  The order provided, \u201cthe Court REOPENS the \ntime for Parrish to file his appeal for fourteen (14) days \n\n66a \n \n \nfollowing the entry of this Order.\u201d (Emphasis added). \nDespite the clear language of the district court\u2019s order, \nParrish never filed an appeal within the time specified.  \nIn such circumstances, we were required to dismiss \nthe appeal for lack of jurisdiction.  See Bowles v. \nRussell, 551 U.S. 205, 214 (2007) (holding that a court \nof appeals was without jurisdiction when the appellant \nfailed to file the appeal within 14 days, as required by \n\u00a7 2107(c), and instead filed his appeal 16 days after the \ndistrict court\u2019s reopening order, as the district court \nitself had authorized).  It is thus clear that the texts of \n\u00a7 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) did not permit a \nresurrection of Parrish\u2019s earlier notice of appeal, \nwhich was rendered ineffective because it was not only \nfiled late but also filed beyond the period where an \nextension could have been granted under Federal Rule \nof Appellate Procedure 4(a)(5).  Rather, \u00a7 2107(c) and \nRule 4(a)(6) authorized the court to reopen the time to \nfile an appeal but required that the notice be filed \nwithin a specified time, i.e., 14 days after the date of \nthe reopening order. \nIn his opinion dissenting from the denial of en banc \nrehearing, Judge Gregory laments that applying Rule \n4(a)(6) to deny Parrish the right to appeal forecloses \n\u201caccess to our Court\u201d and is most likely to affect the \n\u201celderly, \nunhoused, \ndetained, \nimprisoned, \nand \ndifferently abled,\u201d suggesting that they should not be \nbound by the rule\u2019s requirements.  Yet, gracious as \nsuch a position is, we are not free to rely on \ngraciousness to bypass jurisdictional requirements \nestablished by Congress, including those in \u00a7 2107(c).  \nSee Bowles, 551 U.S. at 214. \n\n67a \n \n \nResolution of Parrish\u2019s appeal thus involved a \nstraightforward application of \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6), which need not be reviewed en banc. \nGREGORY, Circuit Judge, with whom Judges WYNN, \nTHACKER, and BERNER join, dissenting from denial \nof Appellant\u2019s petition for rehearing en banc: \nAt its core, this case requires us to determine \nwhether access to our Court should be foreclosed for \nfailure to refile a notice of appeal during the newly \nreopened period following success under Rule 4(a)(6).  \nSection 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) authorize a district \ncourt to, in its discretion, reopen the appeal period \nwhere the moving party files a motion within the \nearlier of 180 days of the district court\u2019s judgment or \n14 days of receiving notice of the judgment; and the \ncourt finds that the moving party did not receive notice \nof the judgment within 21 days of its entry, and that \nno party would be prejudiced by its grant of the motion.  \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107.  The \u201chail mary\u201d afforded by this rule, \nas compared to Rule 4(a)(5), is therefore permitted \nonly under exceptional circumstances, rather than \nfollowing a mere missed deadline or common mistake. \nGiven the infrequency with which district courts fail \nto issue notice of their judgments, Rule 4(a)(6) is \nusually invoked under circumstances where a party \nrelocates, is relocated, or is otherwise unable to receive \nmail at the address listed with the court.  Such relief \nis therefore most commonly, if not exclusively, sought \nby pro se litigants who were unable to notice their \nintent to seek our review during the statutory appeals \nperiod, often due to no fault of their own. \nBoth 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure are silent regarding whether an \n\n68a \n \n \nuntimely notice of appeal may be validated by a \ndistrict court\u2019s subsequent grant of a Rule 4(a)(6) \nmotion.  They also fall short in answering whether a \nsingle filing may serve as both a motion to reopen the \nappeal period and a notice of appeal.   As our sister \ncircuit acknowledged, guidance from the Advisory \nCommittee on the Federal Rules of Appellate \nProcedure appears necessary. See Winters v. Taskila, \n88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023) (collecting cases and \nstating that comment from the Advisory Committee \n\u201cmay be a profitable next stage for this debate\u201d). \nAbsent such guidance from the architects of the rules, \nhowever, it is no wonder that circuit courts and judges \nare split regarding the most appropriate course of \naction under the circumstances.  The Fourth Circuit is \nno exception.  Even a cursory review of our prior cases \npresenting this issue illustrates that our Court\u2019s \ntreatment has not been uniform. \nThe Government contends that this issue will occur \nless frequently in the future as electronic filings and \nnotifications become more prevalent.  However, \ntechnological advances are often slow to reach \nmembers of our society unable to afford or access the \nluxuries those advances provide.  The elderly, \nunhoused, detained, imprisoned, and differently abled \nare a few of the populations who may not be able to \nconsistently \naccess \ninformation \nelectronically.  \nMembers of those populations and others similarly \nsituated will presumably continue to rely on the \nprotections of Rule 4(a)(6) despite the benefits that the \nera of electronic filing will unquestionably provide to \nothers.  More importantly, the infrequency of the \noccurrence of an issue does not speak to its significance \n\n69a \n \n \nand is not dispositive in determining whether en banc \nreview should be granted. \nRule 35 of the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure \nreserves en banc determinations for those instances \nnecessary to secure uniformity of this Court\u2019s case law \nor resolve a question of exceptional importance.  This \ncase meets both standards.  Yet our Court has elected \nto close its door to litigants who fail to make a futile, \nlikely duplicative filing within the 14 days following \nthe often-hard-fought success of a Rule 4(a)(6) motion.  \nAs a result, litigants fortunate enough to obtain Rule \n4(a)(6) relief will barely finish celebrating the success \nof the motion before facing the defeat of dismissal.  In \nopting to require more of those who obtain relief under \nRule 4(a)(6) than we do of those who obtain relief \npursuant to Rule 4(a)(5), we seem to be requiring more \nof those who have less. \nThe Court\u2019s decision here demonstrates that even \nwhere both parties agree that the majority\u2019s \njurisdictional conclusion was erroneous, en banc \nreview may be denied where the issue will impact only \na few individuals, despite the gravity of the impact on \nthose it affects.  I must dissent. \n \n \n \n\n70a \n \n \n_____________________ \n \nAPPENDIX G \n_____________________ \nFILED: April 25, 2024 \n \nUNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE FOURTH CIRCUIT \n_________________________ \n \nNo. 20-1766 \n(1:17-cv-00070-IMK) \n__________________________ \nDONTE PARRISH \n \nPlaintiff \u2013 Appellant \nv. \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nDefendant \u2013 Appellee \n------------------------------ \nPROFESSOR BRYAN LAMMON  \n \nAmicus Supporting Rehearing Petition \n___________________ \nO R D E R \n___________________ \nUpon consideration of submissions relative to \nappellant\u2019s petition for rehearing, the court denies the \nmotion. \nJudge Niemeyer and Judge Richardson voted to \ndeny, and Judge Gregory voted to grant. \nFor the Court \n/s/ Nwamaka Anowi, Clerk \n\n71a \n \n \n_____________________ \n \nAPPENDIX H \n_____________________ \nDONTE PARRISH \nv. \nCivil Action No. 1:17-cv-70 \nUNITED STATES OF AMERICA \n \nFILED JUL 13 2020 \nU.S. DISTRICT COURT-WVND \nCLARKSBURG, WV 26301 \n \nNotice of Appeal \nOn 3/23/20 Irene M.

I have identified a deep 5-1 circuit split, with the Fourth Circuit being the outlier. The petitioner's arguments focus on the 'ripening' principle from *FirsTier*, avoiding pointless formalism, and preventing a 'trap for the unwary' that disproportionately affects pro se litigants. The Fourth Circuit's majority opinion, which represents the respondent's likely position, relies on a strict textualist reading of 'reopen' in the statute and the jurisdictional nature of appeal deadlines as established in *Bowles v. Russell*. The presence of a strong dissent in the Fourth Circuit further signals a high probability of reversal. My current prediction is that the Supreme Court will reverse the Fourth Circuit, meaning the answer to the legal question is 'No'.\n\nHowever, a crucial piece of information is missing: the official position of the Respondent, the United States, as presented to the Supreme Court. The Solicitor General's office might defend the Fourth Circuit's decision, or it might 'confess error' and agree with the petitioner that the Fourth Circuit's rule is incorrect. A confession of error would make a reversal virtually certain. Even if the government defends the judgment, their specific arguments and framing are critical for a confident prediction. Therefore, my next action must be to find the brief filed by the United States in response to the petition for certiorari. This will resolve the most significant remaining uncertainty in my task-specific beliefs (\u03b8) and also provide valuable data for my design-level beliefs (D) about how the Solicitor General acts in cases with deep, lopsided circuit splits.",

Alternatively, seeing the government's defense would provide the strongest counterarguments, allowing for a much more nuanced and confident final prediction. This makes the Task EIG extremely high. The Design EIG is also very high because observing the Solicitor General's action in response to a lopsided 5-1 circuit split provides a crucial data point for a generalizable heuristic.

          "task_beliefs": "My initial state of no knowledge has been replaced by a detailed understanding of the legal dispute in *Parrish v. United States*. The core task is to predict the outcome of the legal question: \"Must a party who files a notice of appeal during the period between when their original appeal deadline expired and when the court reopens their time to appeal file a second notice after the reopening is granted?\"\n\nFrom the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari, I have learned the following critical facts and arguments that will inform the prediction:\n*   **Existence of a Deep Circuit Split:** This is the most significant factor. The Fourth Circuit stands alone in requiring a second, duplicative notice of appeal. The Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, and Tenth Circuits have all held that a notice of appeal filed before the reopening order becomes effective once the order is granted. This 5-1 split makes it highly likely the Supreme Court will take the case to create a uniform national rule, and they often favor the majority circuit position.\n*   **Petitioner's Core Arguments (in favor of not requiring a second notice):**\n    *   **The \"Ripening\" Principle:** Based on the Supreme Court's precedent in *FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Investors Mortg. Ins. Co.*, a premature notice of appeal can become effective once a subsequent court order makes the judgment final and appealable. Parrish's lawyers argue this principle should apply here.\n    *   **Avoiding Pointless Formalism:** Requiring a second, identical filing is \"empty paper shuffling\" that serves no practical purpose, as the first notice has already informed the court and the opposing party of the intent to appeal.\n    *   **Trap for the Unwary:** The rule disproportionately harms pro se and incarcerated litigants, like Parrish, who may not receive the reopening order in time to comply with the short 14-day window for filing a new notice. This raises significant access-to-justice concerns.\n    *   **Statutory Interpretation:** The petitioner argues the Fourth Circuit's distinction between \"extend\" (under Rule 4(a)(5)) and \"reopen\" (under Rule 4(a)(6)) is artificial and not supported by a holistic reading of the rules or recent SCOTUS precedent like *HollyFrontier*.\n*   **Respondent's Likely Arguments (as articulated by the Fourth Circuit majority):**\n    *   **Jurisdictional Strictness:** Citing *Bowles v. Russell*, the argument is that appeal deadlines are statutory and jurisdictional, meaning they must be strictly enforced without equitable exceptions.\n    *   **Textualism:** The word \"reopen\" in 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) implies the door to appeal was closed and a new action (filing a new notice) is required to pass through the newly opened door.\n    *   **Distinct Functions:** The initial, premature notice of appeal was construed and \"used up\" as a *motion to reopen*. It cannot simultaneously serve as the subsequent *notice of appeal* that is meant to follow the granting of that motion.\n\nMy current prediction leans strongly toward a reversal of the Fourth Circuit. The combination of a deep circuit split, the powerful policy arguments regarding access to justice for pro se litigants, and the alignment with the Court's prior pragmatic approach in cases like *FirsTier* and *Becker v. Montgomery* (which favors deciding cases on the merits over procedural technicalities) suggests the Court will adopt the majority rule.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial belief that I needed to broadly \"gather information\" has evolved into a much more specific and effective strategy for SCOTUS prediction tasks. This observation has been highly instructive.\n*   **Source Prioritization:** The **Petition for a Writ of Certiorari** is an exceptionally high-value source. It is a one-stop document that concisely presents the legal question, the arguments for both sides, the landscape of lower court decisions (the circuit split), and the key precedents. Starting with a search for this document is a highly effective opening move. The appendix to the petition is also invaluable as it contains the lower court opinions, including dissents.\n*   **Key Heuristics for Prediction:**\n    1.  **\"Find the Circuit Split\":** The existence, depth, and nature of a circuit split is a primary driver of both the Supreme Court's decision to hear a case and its ultimate ruling. A deep split where one circuit is an outlier is a strong signal. My future information gathering will prioritize identifying and mapping any such splits.\n    2.  **\"Identify the Interpretive Conflict\":** Many statutory cases boil down to a conflict between strict textualism (the Fourth Circuit's focus on the word \"reopen\") and a more pragmatic or purposive approach (the petitioner's focus on avoiding pointless formalities and achieving the rule's purpose). Framing the case in these terms is a powerful analytical tool.\n    3.  **\"Assess the Policy Stakes\":** The law does not operate in a vacuum. Understanding who is affected by a rule is crucial. The fact that the Fourth Circuit's rule creates a \"trap for the unwary,\" particularly for pro se and incarcerated litigants, is a significant policy consideration that will likely weigh on the Justices' minds. I must actively look for these real-world consequences.\n*   **Refined Research Strategy:** My methodology is now more structured:\n    1.  Begin by searching docket files for the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.\n    2.  From the petition, extract the \"Question Presented,\" the arguments, and the summary of the circuit split.\n    3.  Use the petition's Table of Authorities to build a list of key precedents to investigate further.\n    4.  Analyze the lower court opinion being appealed and, crucially, any dissenting opinions, as they often form the intellectual basis for a reversal by the Supreme Court."

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of a\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

In this case, petitioner, while proceeding pro se, \nfiled a notice of appeal after the deadline for filing such \na notice had already passed.  The district court found \nthat the requirements of Section 2107(c) were satisfied, \nand the court exercised its authority under that provi-\nsion to reopen the time for appeal.  Petitioner did not \nthen file a further notice of appeal.  The court of appeals \nconcluded that petitioner could not rely on his earlier \nnotice of appeal and that the court lacked appellate ju-\nrisdiction.  The question presented is: \nWhether a court of appeals has appellate jurisdiction \nwhen a civil litigant who did not receive timely notice of \nan adverse judgment files an untimely notice of appeal, \nthe district court then reopens the appeal period for 14 \ndays under Section 2107(c), and the litigant fails to file \na further notice of appeal within the 14-day period. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nOpinions below .............................................................................. 1 \nJurisdiction .................................................................................... 2 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 2 \nArgument ....................................................................................... 9 \nConclusion ................................................................................... 17 \nTABLE OF AUTHORITIES \nCases: \n \nBowles v.

App. 1a-22a) \nis reported at 74 F.4th 160.  An earlier opinion of the \ncourt of appeals (Pet. App. 56a-58a) is not published in \nthe Federal Reporter but is reprinted at 827 Fed. Appx. \n327.  The order of the court of appeals denying rehear-\ning en banc and opinions respecting that order (Pet. \nApp. 63a-69a) are not published in the Federal Reporter \nbut are available at 2024 WL 1736340.  The opinion of \nthe district court (Pet. App. 44a-55a) and the report and \nrecommendation of the magistrate judge (Pet. App. \n23a-43a) are not published in the Federal Supplement \nbut are available, respectively, at 2020 WL 1330350 and \n2019 WL 9068337.  An additional order of the district \ncourt (Pet. App. 59a-62a) is unreported. \n\n2 \n \nJURISDICTION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals was entered on \nJuly 17, 2023.  Petitions for rehearing were denied on \nApril 23, 2024 (Pet. App. 63a-64a) and April 25, 2024 \n(Pet. App. 70a).  On June 28, 2024, the Chief Justice ex-\ntended the time within which to file a petition for a writ \nof certiorari to and including September 9, 2024, and the \npetition was filed on that date.  The jurisdiction of this \nCourt is invoked under 28 U.S.C. 1254(1). \nSTATEMENT \n1. In civil cases in federal court, the time limits for \nfiling a notice of appeal are specified by 28 U.S.C. 2107, \nwhich is implemented by Rule 4 of the Federal Rules of \nAppellate Procedure.  Section 2107 generally provides \nthat, in order to perfect a timely appeal from a judg-\nment, order, or decree entered in a civil case, a notice of \nappeal must be filed \u201cwithin thirty days after the entry \nof such judgment, order or decree.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(a); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(A).  If the United States is a \nparty to the litigation, the deadline is 60 days for all par-\nties, rather than 30 days.  28 U.S.C. 2107(b); see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  The statutory deadlines are \u201cman-\ndatory and jurisdictional.\u201d  Bowles v. Russell, 551 U.S. \n205, 209 (2007) (citation omitted). \nThis case concerns Section 2107(c), which sets forth \ntwo exceptions to those default deadlines.  First, under \nthe first sentence of Section 2107(c), the district court \nmay \u201cextend the time for appeal upon a showing of ex-\ncusable neglect or good cause,\u201d but only if a motion for \nsuch an extension is filed \u201cnot later than 30 days after \nthe expiration of the time otherwise set for bringing an \nappeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  That authority is imple-\nmented in Rule 4(a)(5).  Under the second sentence of \nSection 2107(c), at issue here, the court may \u201creopen the \n\n3 \n \ntime for appeal\u201d if the court finds that a party entitled \nto notice of the entry of the judgment or order at issue \n\u201cdid not receive such notice from the clerk or any party \nwithin 21 days of its entry\u201d and that \u201cno party would be \nprejudiced.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(1) and (2).  That author-\nity is implemented in Rule 4(a)(6). \nThe district court\u2019s authority to reopen the time for \nappeal under the second sentence of Section 2107(c) is \nsubject to several additional limitations.  The court may \nreopen the appeal period only \u201cupon motion filed within \n180 days after entry of the judgment or order\u201d at issue, \nor \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d the party that failed to receive \nnotice of the entry of the judgment or order receives \nsuch notice, \u201cwhichever is earlier.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B).  And the court may reo-\npen the time for appeal under Section 2107(c) only \u201cfor \na period of 14 days from the date of entry of the order \nreopening the time for appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c); see \nBowles, 551 U.S. at 213 (holding that the 14-day limit \n\u201con how long a district court may reopen\u201d the period for \nappeal is jurisdictional). \n2. In 2017, petitioner brought this action pro se in \nthe United States District Court for the Northern Dis-\ntrict of West Virginia.  Pet. App. 23a.  Petitioner was \nincarcerated at the time at \u201cUSP Big Sandy in Inez, \nKentucky,\u201d serving a 180-month term of imprisonment.  \nIbid. (footnote omitted); see id. at 4a.  Petitioner alleged \nthat he was wrongfully placed in administrative segre-\ngation within the federal prison system for three years \nwhile under suspicion of having murdered a fellow in-\nmate.  See id. at 27a, 45a.  Ultimately, federal law en-\nforcement authorities declined to pursue criminal \ncharges against petitioner for the murder, and the Bu-\nreau of Prisons found insufficient evidence to sustain \n\n4 \n \nany disciplinary charges.  Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 3, 5.  The gra-\nvamen of the complaint was that petitioner\u2019s conditions \nof confinement during the murder investigation were \ntortious\u2014e.g., that he was falsely imprisoned, or the vic-\ntim of an abuse of process.  Id. at 8; see Pet. App. 27a. \nPetitioner\u2019s complaint invoked the Federal Tort \nClaims Act (FTCA), 28 U.S.C. 1346(b), 2671 et seq.  The \nFTCA waives the sovereign immunity of the United \nStates and creates a cause of action for damages for cer-\ntain torts committed by federal employees acting within \nthe scope of their employment.  See Brownback v. King, \n592 U.S. 209, 211-212 (2021).  To be actionable under the \nFTCA, a claim must be brought against \u201cthe United \nStates.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1346(b)(1).  Petitioner\u2019s complaint \ncomplied with that requirement and named the United \nStates as the defendant.  Pet. App. 4a. \nThe government moved to dismiss the complaint or, \nin the alternative, for summary judgment, and the case \nwas referred to a magistrate judge.  The magistrate \njudge recommended granting the government\u2019s motion.  \nPet. App. 23a-43a.  The district court largely adopted \nthe magistrate judge\u2019s report and recommendation and \ndismissed all of petitioner\u2019s FTCA claims, concluding \nthat one was time-barred and that the others had not \nbeen administratively exhausted (as required by the \nFTCA).  Id. at 44a-57a; see 28 U.S.C. 2675(a). \nThe district court\u2019s order was dated and entered on \nthe docket on March 23, 2020.  Pet. App. 55a.  The fol-\nlowing day, the clerk of court entered a separate judg-\nment in favor of the United States.  D. Ct. Doc. 131 \n(Mar. 24, 2020).  Under the provision in Section 2107(b) \napplicable to civil actions in which the United States is \na party, the deadline for filing a notice of appeal was 60 \ndays from the entry of judgment.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(b); \n\n5 \n \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(1)(B).  Accounting for a weekend, \nsee Fed. R. App. P. 26(a)(1)(C), any notice of appeal was \ntherefore due on or before Monday, May 25, 2020. \nOn July 13, 2020, the district court received and \ndocketed a handwritten notice of appeal from peti-\ntioner, bearing a postmark of July 9, 2020.  See D. Ct. \nDocs. 137 and 137-1 (July 13, 2020).  In the notice, peti-\ntioner stated that, due to his transfer from federal to \nstate custody, he had not received the court\u2019s prior \njudgment until June 25, 2020.  Pet. App. 4a.  That notice \nwas \u201cclearly untimely.\u201d  Id. at 57a.  It was filed not only \nafter the May 25 deadline for noticing an appeal but also \noutside the additional 30-day period in which petitioner \ncould have filed a motion to extend the time for appeal \nunder Section 2107(c)\u2019s first sentence and Rule 4(a)(5).  \nSee Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(5)(A)(i). \nThe district court transmitted the notice of appeal to \nthe court of appeals, which remanded in an unpublished, \nper curiam opinion.  Pet. App. 56a-58a.  The court of ap-\npeals charitably \u201cconstrue[d] the notice of appeal as a \nmotion to reopen the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).\u201d  \nId. at 58a.  The court observed that, according to peti-\ntioner, he had \u201cnot receive[d] a copy of the [district] \ncourt\u2019s judgment until 93 days after entry, and he filed \nthe notice of appeal within 14 days after he purportedly \nreceived\u201d notice of the judgment, ibid.\u2014allegations \nwhich, if true, could support a motion to reopen the ap-\npeal period.  The court of appeals remanded to the dis-\ntrict court to address petitioner\u2019s motion in the first in-\nstance.  Ibid.  The court of appeals also stated that, after \nthe district court determined whether to reopen the ap-\npeal period, \u201c[t]he record, as supplemented, will be re-\nturned\u201d to the court of appeals \u201cfor further considera-\ntion.\u201d  Ibid. \n\n6 \n \nOn remand, the district court determined that peti-\ntioner \u201csatisfied the requirements of Federal Rule of \nAppellate Procedure 4(a)(6).\u201d  Pet. App. 61a; see id. at \n59a-62a.  The court found that, apparently as a result of \nbeing transferred from federal to state custody, peti-\ntioner did not receive notice of the entry of the court\u2019s \nprior judgment \u201cwithin 21 days after entry,\u201d Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(A); petitioner filed what the court of ap-\npeals had construed as a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod \u201cwithin 14 days after\u201d receiving belated notice of \nthe judgment, Fed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(B); and \u201cno party \nwould be prejudiced\u201d by reopening the appeal period, \nFed. R. App. P. 4(a)(6)(C).  See Pet. App. 57a, 61a.  The \ncourt granted petitioner\u2019s motion and \u201creopen[ed] the \ntime for [petitioner] to file his appeal for fourteen (14) \ndays following the entry of this [o]rder,\u201d i.e., 14 days \nfollowing January 8, 2021.  Id. at 61a.1  That reopened \nperiod for appeal expired on January 22, 2021. \nPetitioner did not file an additional notice of appeal, \nor anything else, during the 14-day period following the \ndistrict court\u2019s order of January 8, 2021.  Pet. App. 5a.  \n\u201cOn January 27, 2021, five days after the 14-day period \nhad closed, [petitioner] mailed a document to\u201d the court \nof appeals, which the clerk of that court docketed as \u201ca \nsupplemental informal brief.\u201d  Ibid. \n3. After the remand, the court of appeals appointed \ncounsel to represent petitioner.  Pet. App. 5a.  Through \ncounsel, petitioner filed a brief taking the position that \nthe court had appellate jurisdiction based on the combi-\nnation of petitioner\u2019s untimely notice of appeal (filed on \nJuly 13, 2020) and the district court\u2019s subsequent order \n \n1 The district court\u2019s order contains a typographical error, listing \nthe date as \u201cJanuary 8, 2020.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a.  In fact, the order was \nentered on January 8, 2021.  See id. at 5a. \n\n7 \n \nreopening the appeal period under Rule 4(a)(6).  Pet. \nC.A. Br. 1, 18-22.  The government \u201cagree[d] with [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] jurisdictional statement,\u201d Gov\u2019t C.A. Br. 1, \nand the parties joined issue on the merits. \nThe court of appeals dismissed the appeal for lack of \nappellate jurisdiction, over the dissent of then-Chief \nJudge Gregory.  Pet. App. 1a-22a.  The court acknowl-\nedged that when a litigant files an untimely notice of ap-\npeal and the district court subsequently extends the \ntime for appeal under the first sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(5) to encompass the date on which \nthe litigant had already filed a notice of appeal, the dis-\ntrict court\u2019s action has been held to \u201cvalidate[]\u201d the \nprior notice, such that the litigant need not then file a \nsecond notice of appeal within the extended period.  Id. \nat 11a (citation omitted).  But the court rejected peti-\ntioner\u2019s arguments for treating a reopening of the ap-\npeal period under the second sentence of Section \n2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) the same way, instead taking \nthe view that the statute \u201crequires that a notice of ap-\npeal be filed within\u201d the reopened 14-day appeal period.  \nId. at 12a.  Accordingly, the court determined that it \nlacked jurisdiction here because petitioner had failed to \nfile a new notice of appeal \u201cwithin 14 days of the entry \nof the order\u201d granting his motion to reopen.  Id. at 10a. \nChief Judge Gregory dissented.  Pet App. 14a-22a.  \nIn his view, \u201c[n]othing in the text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 2107(c) \ncompels\u201d adopting what he described as a \u201cformalistic \nand hollow\u201d requirement for litigants who have already \nfiled an untimely notice of appeal to then file a second \nnotice after the period for appeal has been reopened.  \nId. at 14a.  He would therefore have held, consistent \nwith the case law under Rule 4(a)(5), that a district \ncourt\u2019s order reopening the appeal period under Rule \n\n8 \n \n4(a)(6) \u201cvalidates an earlier untimely notice of appeal,\u201d \nid. at 16a, at least as long as the earlier notice continues \nto provide \u201c\u200a\u2018sufficient notice to other parties and the \ncourts\u2019 that the appellant intends to seek appellate re-\nview,\u201d id. at 17a (quoting Smith v. Barry, 502 U.S. 244, \n248 (1992)).  And he would have found that standard sat-\nisfied here, observing that there was no dispute in this \ncase that petitioner\u2019s \u201cJuly 2020 notice of appeal contin-\nued to convey his intent to seek appellate review in Jan-\nuary 2021.\u201d  Id. at 22a. \nPetitioner\u2019s appointed counsel then moved to with-\ndraw, explaining that petitioner wished to seek rehear-\ning en banc but that counsel would not file such a peti-\ntion \u201cin light of the relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to and the \nstringency of Rule 35\u2019s direct conflict or exceptional im-\nportance requirements.\u201d  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2 (Aug. 28, \n2023).  The court of appeals granted that motion, and \npetitioner filed a pro se petition for rehearing en banc.  \nC.A. Doc. 55 (Aug. 31, 2023).  After petitioner obtained \nnew counsel, the court also permitted him to file a sup-\nplemental petition through counsel.  C.A. Doc. 72 (Jan. \n30, 2024).  The government filed responses to both peti-\ntions, arguing in relevant part that the jurisdictional \nquestion was not sufficiently important to warrant en \nbanc review.  See C.A. Doc. 84, at 2 (Feb. 29, 2024); C.A. \nDoc. 61, at 7 (Sept. 14, 2023). \nThe court of appeals denied petitioner\u2019s motion for \nrehearing en banc by a 9-6 vote.  Pet. App. 63a-64a.  \nJudge Niemeyer, who had authored the panel opinion, \nissued a statement in support of denying rehearing en \nbanc in which he reiterated his view that Section 2107(c) \nand Rule 4(a)(6) did not authorize \u201cresurrection of [pe-\ntitioner\u2019s] earlier notice of appeal.\u201d  Id. at 66a.  Chief \n\n9 \n \nJudge Gregory, who had authored the panel dissent, \nalso issued a dissent from the denial of rehearing en \nbanc, which Judges Thacker and Berner joined.  Id. at \n67a-69a.  Those dissenting judges took the view that, \nalthough the jurisdictional question would \u201cimpact only \na few individuals,\u201d it was nonetheless significant enough \nto warrant en banc review.  Id. at 69a.  They also stated \nthat Section 2107(c) and Rule 4(a)(6) do not expressly \naddress \u201cwhether an untimely notice of appeal may be \nvalidated by a district court\u2019s subsequent grant of a \nRule 4(a)(6) motion,\u201d and that \u201cguidance from the Advi-\nsory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Pro-\ncedure may be necessary.\u201d  Id. at 67a-68a. \nARGUMENT \nPetitioner renews (Pet. 28-34) his contention that his \nJuly 2020 notice of appeal was sufficient to bring this \ncase within the jurisdiction of the court of appeals, in \nlight of the district court\u2019s later order reopening the ap-\npeal period for 14 days under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6)\u2014notwithstanding petitioner\u2019s failure to file any \nfurther notice of appeal during the 14-day period.  Alt-\nhough the government continues to adhere to the view \nthat the court of appeals had appellate jurisdiction un-\nder the circumstances of this case, petitioner fails to \nshow that the jurisdictional question warrants further \nreview by this Court.  The issue can arise only after an \napparently rare combination of circumstances.  Moreo-\nver, petitioner fails to show that, as long as the jurisdic-\ntional rule is clear ex ante, the choice of one rule or an-\nother will have any significant practical importance \neven in the rare cases in which it arises.  Review is also \nunwarranted at this time because the Advisory Commit-\ntee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has \nformed a subcommittee to study the issue, and the \n\n10 \n \nrulemaking process could resolve the question pre-\nsented without this Court\u2019s intervention.  The petition \nfor a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n1. The court of appeals erred in concluding that it \nlacked appellate jurisdiction.  To be sure, petitioner \ncould have forestalled any jurisdictional issue by filing \na notice of appeal after the district court reopened the \nperiod for appeal under Section 2107(c) and Rule \n4(a)(6).  But petitioner\u2019s failure to do so did not deprive \nthe court of appeals of jurisdiction under the circum-\nstances of this case. \nThe second sentence of Section 2107(c) provides \nthat, when the district court finds that a party who was \nentitled to notice of a judgment or order in a civil case \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of entry, and \nno other party would be prejudiced, the court \u201cmay  \n* * *  reopen the time for appeal for a period of 14 days \nfrom the date of entry of the order reopening the time \nfor appeal.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 2107(c).  The court may exercise \nthat authority only if the party seeking relief files a mo-\ntion during the 180-day period after entry of the judg-\nment or order at issue, or within 14 days of when the \nparty received the notice that it previously failed to  \nreceive\u2014whichever occurs earlier.  Ibid.; see Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(6)(B). \nThe court of appeals emphasized that those provi-\nsions give the district court limited authority to \u201creopen \nthe time for appeal,\u201d as distinct from the court\u2019s sepa-\nrate authority to \u201cextend the time for appeal\u201d under the \nfirst sentence of Section 2107(c).  28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (em-\nphases added).  In the court of appeals\u2019 view, Congress \nused the term \u201creopen\u201d in deliberate contrast to \u201cex-\ntend[],\u201d so as to signal that the reopening provision ap-\nplies when the appeal period has already closed and a \n\n11 \n \nnew period is being opened.  Pet. App. 10a.  And there \nis no dispute that if petitioner had filed a notice of ap-\npeal during the new 14-day period authorized by the \ndistrict court, the court of appeals would have then had \njurisdiction over his appeal.  Petitioner has never iden-\ntified any practical impediment that would have pre-\nvented him from filing such a notice.  Cf. Pet. 13. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals\u2019 textual distinction \nbetween reopening and extending the time for appeal \ndoes not resolve the question presented here.  Both the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure and this Court\u2019s \nprecedent recognize that a prematurely filed notice of \nappeal can become effective at a later date.  See Fed. R. \nApp. P. 4(a)(2) (\u201cA notice of appeal filed after the court \nannounces a decision or order\u2014but before the entry of \nthe judgment or order\u2014is treated as filed on the date \nof and after the entry.\u201d); FirsTier Mortg. Co. v. Inves-\ntors Mortg. Ins. Co., 498 U.S. 269, 272-277 (1991) (ap-\nplying Rule 4(a)(2) to sustain appellate jurisdiction and \nexplaining that the provision \u201ccodif\u200a[ied] a general prac-\ntice in the courts of appeals of deeming certain prema-\nture notices of appeal effective\u201d). \nAlthough the specific provision in Rule 4(a)(2) re-\ngarding premature notices of appeals does not apply to \nthe circumstances here, the court of appeals did not \nidentify any compelling reason to adopt a different ap-\nproach under Rule 4(a)(6).  By the time the district \ncourt reopened the appeal period here, petitioner had \nalready filed a notice of appeal from the same underly-\ning judgment, and the court had found that no party \nwould be prejudiced by allowing petitioner to \u201crefile his \nappeal.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a.  Under those circumstances, pe-\ntitioner\u2019s July 2020 notice of appeal is best viewed as \n\u201cpremature\u201d to the reopened period, and \u201cthe technical \n\n12 \n \ndefect of prematurity  * * *  should not be allowed to \nextinguish an otherwise proper appeal.\u201d  FirsTier \nMortg., 498 U.S. at 273; cf. Pet. App. 16a-18a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting) (drawing additional support from cir-\ncuit precedent giving effect to untimely notices of ap-\npeal filed before the time for appeal is extended under \nRule 4(a)(5)). \n2. Although the decision below is incorrect, peti-\ntioner fails to identify any compelling basis for further \nreview, particularly while the Advisory Committee is \nstudying the issue and has the authority to amend the \nrules in a manner that could obviate any need for addi-\ntional guidance from this Court.  See pp. 16-17, infra. \nPetitioner principally contends (Pet. 15-22) that the \ndecision below implicates a division of authority within \nthe courts of appeals, but petitioner overstates the de-\ngree of any such conflict.  District courts have had the \nauthority to reopen the time for appeal under Section \n2107(c) since 1991.  See Pub. L. No. 102-198, \u00a7 12, 105 \nStat. 1627; see also Fed. R. App. 4 advisory committee\u2019s \nnote (1991 Amendment).  But petitioner identifies (Pet. \n17-18) only one other published decision in which a court \nof appeals squarely addressed the jurisdictional ques-\ntion that petitioner seeks to present here.  See Winters \nv. Taskila, 88 F.4th 665, 671 (6th Cir. 2023) (Sutton, \nC.J.) (concluding that a litigant who filed an untimely \nnotice of appeal and then successfully moved for reo-\npening of the appeal period \u201cdid not need to file a new \nnotice of appeal after the district court granted [his] \nmotion to reopen,\u201d under the principle that \u201c[a] notice \nof appeal filed too early, generally speaking, ripens \nwhen the window to appeal begins\u201d) (citing, inter alia, \nFirsTier Mortg., 498 U.S. at 273). \n\n13 \n \nPetitioner also relies (Pet. 18) on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ndecision in United States v. Withers, 638 F.3d 1055 \n(2011), but that case did not expressly resolve the same \njurisdictional issue.  The Ninth Circuit instead per-\nceived the key jurisdictional issue to be whether a pro \nse litigant\u2019s untimely notice of appeal should have been \n\u201cconstrued  * * *  as a motion to reopen\u201d the appeal pe-\nriod.  Id. at 1061.  After concluding that the district \ncourt should have construed the untimely notice as a \nmotion to reopen and should have granted the motion, \nthe court of appeals did not then proceed to address \nwhether the pro se litigant needed to file any further \nnotice of appeal during the reopened period.  Id. at \n1061-1062.  The Ninth Circuit instead appears to have \nassumed that its jurisdiction was proper under those \ncircumstances.  See id. at 1062.  While that result is in-\nconsistent with the result reached by the Fourth Circuit \nhere, the precedential force of Withers remains unclear.  \nThis Court does not afford precedential effect to analo-\ngous \u201cdrive-by jurisdictional rulings.\u201d  Steel Co. v. Citi-\nzens for a Better Env\u2019t, 523 U.S. 83, 91 (1998).   \nAs petitioner acknowledges (Pet. 19-21), the other \ncircuits to have addressed the same jurisdictional ques-\ntion have done so only in unpublished decisions.  See \nHammer v. Bortz, No. 23-1842, 2024 WL 2559204, at *3 \n(7th Cir. May 24, 2024); Holden v. Attorney General of \nN.J., No. 21-1862, 2023 WL 8798084, at *1 n.4 (3d Cir. \nDec. 20, 2023); Farrow v. Tulupia, No. 21-1027, 2022 \nWL 274489, at *1 n.1. (10th Cir. Jan. 31, 2022), cert.  \ndenied, 143 S. Ct. 454 (2022); Norwood v. East Allen \nCmty. Schs., 825 Fed. Appx. 383, 386-387 (7th Cir. \n2020); United States v. Marshall, 166 F.3d 349, 1998 \nWL 864012, at *2 (10th Cir. Dec. 14, 1998) (Tbl.), cert. \n\n14 \n \ndenied, 528 U.S. 861 (1999).2  Those nonprecedential  \ndecisions would not preclude a future panel from reach-\ning a different conclusion and thus do not necessarily \nshow that the outcome of this case would have been dif-\nferent had it arisen in one of those circuits.  And even \ncounting generously, petitioner has identified fewer \nthan ten opinions on point since reopening motions be-\ncame available in 1991.  The paucity of such decisions \nunderscores that the jurisdictional question does not \narise frequently\u2014and when it does, the courts of ap-\npeals have rarely considered it sufficiently important to \nwarrant a published opinion. \n3. In addition to the absence of any substantial con-\nflict, further review is unwarranted because the ques-\ntion presented lacks practical significance.  The ques-\ntion can arise only through an unlikely combination of \nprocedural missteps.  The district court may reopen the \ntime for appeal only if it first finds that a party entitled \nto receive notice of the entry of a judgment or order \nfailed to receive such notice within 21 days of the entry \nof the judgment or order.  28 U.S.C 2107(c)(1).  But in \nthe era of electronic filing, most litigants now receive \nimmediate notice of orders and judgments.  Petitioner \nemphasizes (Pet. 23) the possibility that pro se litigants \nmay need to rely on notice via the mail, but \u201c[m]any \ncourts now allow electronic filing by pro se litigants with \nthe court\u2019s permission,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 5 advisory com-\nmittee\u2019s note (2018 Amendment). \n \n2 Petitioner\u2019s reliance (Pet. 21) on Farrow is misplaced for the ad-\nditional reason that the litigant in that case simultaneously filed \nboth a motion to reopen the appeal period and a notice of appeal, \nwhile asking the district court to defer entering the notice until after \ngranting reopening.  See 2022 WL 274489, at *1 n.1. \n\n15 \n \nMoreover, even with respect to the presumably small \nnumber of litigants who fail to receive the requisite no-\ntice, the question presented only arises if one of those \nlitigants wishes to appeal, the litigant cannot rely on the \ndistrict court\u2019s separate authority to extend the time for \nappeal, and the litigant makes a timely request that the \nappeal period be reopened\u2014but files a notice of appeal \nonly before the reopening, not after.  Notably, Section \n2107(c) imposes an outer limit of 180 days to request re-\nopening.  See 28 U.S.C. 2107(c) (court may act upon a \nmotion filed by the \u201cearlier\u201d of the expiration of 180 \ndays from the entry of the judgment or order at issue \nor 14 days after the moving party receives notice).  If \nthat 180-day period expires before the litigant requests \nreopening, the question presented makes no difference \nbecause the district court lacks authority to reopen the \nappeal period in any event.  And even for a timely re-\nquest, the district court cannot reopen the appeal period \nunless it first finds that \u201cno party would be prejudiced.\u201d  \n28 U.S.C. 2107(c)(2).  Petitioner does not demonstrate \nthat such a combination of circumstances is likely to oc-\ncur frequently, and the limited number of appellate deci-\nsions addressing the question presented suggests it does \nnot.  Indeed, petitioner\u2019s own prior court-appointed \ncounsel cited the \u201cthe relatively confined universe of ap-\npellants [the panel] ruling is likely to apply to\u201d as one \nreason for declining to file a petition for rehearing en \nbanc on petitioner\u2019s behalf.  C.A. Doc. 54, at 2. \nPetitioner also overstates (Pet. 22) the practical sig-\nnificance of the decision below within the Fourth Circuit \nitself.  Although the decision below is incorrect, it estab-\nlishes a clear and easily applied jurisdictional rule going \nforward.  District courts in the Fourth Circuit may now \nadvise pro se litigants of the need to file a new notice of \n\n16 \n \nappeal in cases in which a motion to reopen the appeal \nperiod is granted.  And although petitioner derides the \nfiling of a second notice of appeal during the reopened \nperiod of appeal as a \u201chollow ritual,\u201d Pet. 30 (citation \nomitted), he does not show that filing a second notice \nwill be particularly difficult for most or indeed any liti-\ngants affected by the Fourth Circuit\u2019s approach. \n4. This Court\u2019s review is also unwarranted at the \npresent time because the Advisory Committee has al-\nready taken steps to study whether changes to Rule 4(a) \nmay be warranted.  In Winters, the Sixth Circuit ob-\nserved that the Advisory Committee is \u201ccharge[d]  * * *  \nto review issues of precisely this sort\u201d and has the au-\nthority to \u201cimprov[e] the rules where needed.\u201d  88 F.4th \nat 672.  The Sixth Circuit further observed that the Ad-\nvisory Committee \u201cmay be a profitable next stage for \nthis debate,\u201d ibid.\u2014a sentiment endorsed by the dis-\nsenting judges in this case, see Pet. App. 68a (Gregory, \nC.J., dissenting from the denial of rehearing en banc). \nOn October 9, 2024, after the filing of the petition for \na writ of certiorari in this case, the Advisory Committee \nvoted to form a subcommittee to address the issues \nraised by the Sixth Circuit in Winters and the Fourth \nCircuit in the decision below.  See Memorandum from \nEdward Hartnett to the Advisory Committee on the \nFederal Rules of Appellate Procedure, New Suggestion \nfrom Judge Sutton 1-3 (Sept. 5, 2024), reprinted in Ad-\nvisory Committee on Appellate Rules, Tab 7A, at 292-\n295 (Oct. 9, 2024) (reporter\u2019s memorandum describing \nWinters and this case and proposing a subcommittee); \nsee also Jacqueline Thomsen, Administrative Stays \nChanges Weighed After Justices\u2019 Criticism, Bloomberg \nLaw News (Oct. 10, 2024) (noting that the Advisory \nCommittee agreed to \u201clook into the rule on reopening \n\n17 \n \nthe time to file an appeal\u201d in light of Chief Judge Sut-\nton\u2019s suggestion). \nBecause the relevant provisions in Rule 4(a)(6) may \nwell change as a result of the rulemaking process, the \nquestion whether the current language of the rule sup-\nports petitioner may be of limited prospective im-\nportance.  And the Advisory Committee is fully capable \nof addressing the policy concerns that petitioner raises \nhere.  See Pet. 22-27. \nCONCLUSION \nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \nELIZABETH PRELOGAR \nSolicitor General \nBRIAN M.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of *Parrish v. United States* is now more structured, moving from initial fact-gathering to identifying the most critical remaining uncertainty. My prior knowledge, derived from the Petition for Certiorari, remains stable:\n\n*   **Core Legal Question:** The central issue is whether a notice of appeal filed prematurely (after the initial appeal deadline but before a court grants a motion to reopen that deadline) can become effective upon the granting of that motion, or if a second notice must be filed.\n*   **Deep Circuit Split:** The Fourth Circuit is an outlier, standing alone in requiring a second notice of appeal. Five other circuits (Third, Sixth, Seventh, Ninth, Tenth) have adopted the more lenient \"ripening\" approach, where the initial notice becomes effective. This 5-1 split remains the strongest signal favoring a reversal.\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Parrish):** The core arguments remain the same: the \"ripening\" principle from *FirsTier*, the pragmatic desire to avoid \"empty paper shuffling,\" and the significant access-to-justice concern that the Fourth Circuit's rule is a \"trap for the unwary,\" especially for pro se and incarcerated litigants.\n*   **Respondent's Likely Arguments (United States):** These are still inferred from the Fourth Circuit's majority opinion and center on a strict textualist reading of the word \"reopen\" in Rule 4(a)(6) and the jurisdictional nature of appeal deadlines established in *Bowles v. Russell*.\n\nThe new observation, my own internal reasoning, has not added new external facts but has critically refined my model of the case by identifying the most significant source of uncertainty. My prediction of a reversal is strong, but its confidence is now explicitly conditional on the position of the Solicitor General, representing the United States. There are two primary possibilities:\n1.  **Defense of the Judgment:** The government could defend the Fourth Circuit's strict textualist position. This would lead to a standard adversarial proceeding, though the government would still face the lopsided circuit split and strong policy arguments against its position.\n2.  **Confession of Error:** The Solicitor General might agree with the petitioner that the Fourth Circuit's rule is incorrect and should be reversed. A \"confession of error\" by the United States is a very powerful signal to the Court and would make a reversal virtually certain.\n\nTherefore, my task-specific knowledge has evolved to understand that the single most informative piece of evidence yet to be obtained is the official brief filed by the United States in response to the petition.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of how to effectively predict Supreme Court outcomes has become more sophisticated. This observation has moved my strategy from simple information collection to a more targeted, value-of-information-driven approach.\n\n*   **Source Prioritization (Refined):** The Petition for a Writ of Certiorari is confirmed as the best starting point. However, I now recognize a clear sequence of importance. The **Respondent's Brief in Opposition to Certiorari** (or equivalent filing) is the next most critical document. It is not just \"more information\"; it is the document that resolves the key uncertainty about the respondent's official stance.\n*   **Key Heuristics for Prediction (Expanded):** My list of effective heuristics has grown:\n    1.  **\"Find the Circuit Split\":** Remains the primary heuristic. A deep, lopsided split is a powerful predictor.\n    2.  **\"Identify the Interpretive Conflict\":** Still crucial for framing the legal battle (e.g., textualism vs. purposivism).\n    3.  **\"Assess the Policy Stakes\":** The \"trap for the unwary\" argument highlights the importance of understanding the real-world impact of a ruling, especially on vulnerable groups.\n    4.  **\"Look for a Confession of Error\" (New Heuristic):** I have now learned to explicitly watch for this specific procedural action. When the U.S. government is the respondent in a civil or criminal case, the Solicitor General's decision to \"confess error\" is a game-changing event that dramatically increases the probability of reversal. This is a highly specific and potent predictive signal.\n*   **Refined Research Strategy (Now Strategic):** My methodology has evolved from a checklist to a strategic process of uncertainty reduction.\n    1.  Begin with the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari to establish the baseline facts, arguments, and circuit split.\n    2.  **Immediately seek out the Respondent's response.** This is the pivotal next step. The goal is to determine if the respondent will defend the lower court's decision or confess error. This action is designed to resolve the largest remaining uncertainty.\n    3.  Analyze the lower court opinion and any dissents, using them to understand the intellectual foundations of both sides' arguments.\n    4.  Use the petition's Table of Authorities to build a list of key precedents for deeper analysis.\n    5.  **New Step:** After initial briefing, actively monitor the docket for amicus curiae (\"friend of the court\") briefs, as they can signal the importance of the case to outside groups and provide novel arguments."

Both parties now agree that a second notice of appeal should not be required. While the government opposes certiorari on prudential grounds (arguing the rulemaking process is a better solution), this does not change the answer to the underlying legal question. If the Supreme Court were to grant review, it would undoubtedly rule that a second notice is not required. Therefore, the answer to the legal question is 'No'.

          "task_beliefs": "My model of this case has been substantially refined by the critical new evidence from the United States' brief. The foundational elements of the case remain, but the strategic landscape and the likely outcome have been clarified in a surprising way.\n\n*   **Core Legal Question:** The issue remains whether a premature notice of appeal (filed after the original deadline but before a Rule 4(a)(6) reopening) can be validated by the subsequent reopening order, or if a second notice is required.\n\n*   **Deep Circuit Split (Now Unanimous in Principle):** The 5-1 circuit split was previously the strongest signal favoring reversal. The new observation reveals that the United States, as the respondent, *agrees with the petitioner* that the Fourth Circuit erred and that the court of appeals did, in fact, have jurisdiction. The government's brief explicitly states, \"The court of appeals erred in concluding that it lacked appellate jurisdiction.\" This means that, in terms of legal interpretation, all six circuits that have considered the issue, plus the Department of Justice, believe the \"ripening\" or \"validation\" approach is correct. The Fourth Circuit's judgment stands entirely alone.\n\n*   **Petitioner's Arguments (Parrish):** These arguments (ripening from *FirsTier*, avoiding \"empty paper shuffling,\" access to justice) are now explicitly endorsed by the United States.\n\n*   **Respondent's Arguments (United States):** My previous uncertainty about the government's position has been resolved, but not in the binary way I expected. The Solicitor General has executed a nuanced strategy:\n    1.  **Concession of Error on the Merits:** The government does *not* defend the Fourth Circuit's judgment. It agrees that under the correct interpretation of the rules, Parrish's appeal should have been heard. This is a substantive confession of error.\n    2.  **Opposition to Certiorari:** Despite conceding the merits, the government filed a \"Brief for the Respondent in Opposition,\" urging the Court to *deny* the petition for a writ of certiorari.\n    3.  **Justification for Opposition:** The opposition is based on two key prudential arguments:\n        *   The issue is rare and does not have significant practical importance.\n        *   **Crucially, the Advisory Committee on the Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure has formed a subcommittee to study this exact issue.** The government argues that the rulemaking process is the more appropriate venue to resolve this procedural question, which gives the Supreme Court a strong reason to decline to hear the case.\n\n*   **Updated Prediction:** My prediction is now bifurcated. The central uncertainty has shifted from the merits of the case to the procedural question of whether the Court will grant certiorari.\n    *   **If Certiorari is Granted:** Reversal is virtually guaranteed. The government has already conceded the point, and the circuit split is lopsided. The Court would likely issue a summary reversal or a GVR (Grant, Vacate, and Remand).\n    *   **Likelihood of Certiorari:** This is now lower than I might have previously thought. The government's opposition, combined with the compelling \"off-ramp\" of a pending Rules Committee review, gives the Justices a powerful prudential reason to deny the petition and let the expert committee fix the rule for everyone, rather than issuing a one-off judgment. The case now hinges on whether the Court feels the need to correct this specific error for this specific petitioner, despite the alternative solution.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has been exceptionally valuable, validating some existing strategies while revealing the need for more sophisticated heuristics and a broader understanding of the institutional actors involved in federal law.\n\n*   **Source Prioritization (Confirmed and Refined):** The strategy of identifying the Petition for Certiorari as the starting point and the **Respondent's Brief in Opposition** as the single most critical follow-up document is now strongly confirmed. This sequence successfully resolved the largest source of uncertainty in my model.\n\n*   **Key Heuristics for Prediction (Expanded and Sophisticated):**\n    1.  **\"Find the Circuit Split\":** Remains a primary heuristic.\n    2.  **\"Identify the Interpretive Conflict\":** Still crucial.\n    3.  **\"Assess the Policy Stakes\":** Still important, especially the \"trap for the unwary\" argument.\n    4.  **\"Look for a Confession of Error\" (Refined):** This heuristic was too simplistic. I have learned that the Solicitor General has more than two options. I must now model a third, more nuanced strategy: **\"Concede the Merits, Oppose Certiorari.\"** This is a distinct tactic used to correct the government's view of the law while attempting to manage the Supreme Court's docket.\n    5.  **\"Check for Rulemaking Activity\" (New Heuristic):** This is a major addition to my methodology. For cases involving the interpretation of Federal Rules of Procedure (Appellate, Civil, etc.), I have learned that the activity of the Judicial Conference's Advisory Committees is a critical, potentially dispositive, factor. The existence of a subcommittee or a pending rule amendment to address the issue in a case is a very strong prudential reason for the Court to deny certiorari.\n\n*   **Refined Research Strategy (Now More Comprehensive):** My process for analyzing a case has become more robust.\n    1.  Begin with the Petition for a Writ of Certiorari.\n    2.  Immediately seek out the Respondent's response to determine their strategic posture (defend, confess, or concede-and-oppose).\n    3.  **New Step:** If the case involves a Federal Rule, I must now search the `uscourts.gov` website for the agenda books and minutes of the relevant Advisory Committee (e.g., on Appellate Rules) to determine if the issue is already under review. This provides crucial information for predicting the likelihood of certiorari.\n    4.  Analyze lower court opinions and dissents for legal context.\n    5.  Use the Table of Authorities to map key precedents.\n    6.  Monitor the docket for amicus curiae briefs to gauge external interest."

The core facts and procedural history remain unchanged, but my synthesis of the evidence has clarified the distinction between the likely ruling on the merits and the procedural outcome of the case.\n\n*   **Core Legal Question:** The question is whether a party must file a second notice of appeal after a court reopens the time to appeal under Rule 4(a)(6), if their first notice was filed prematurely (after the original deadline but before the reopening).\n\n*   **Unanimous Consensus on the Merits:** The most powerful signal in this case is the complete agreement on the legal question among all interested parties. My initial observation of a 5-1 circuit split has been superseded. The United States, in its Brief in Opposition, has explicitly *conceded that the Fourth Circuit erred* and that its judgment was incorrect. This means that the petitioner (Parrish), the respondent (United States), and the five other circuit courts that have addressed this issue all agree that the premature notice of appeal should be considered valid and that a second notice is not required. The Fourth Circuit's legal conclusion is an isolated outlier.\n\n*   **Party Arguments (Unified):**\n    *   **Petitioner (Parrish):** Arguments for applying the \"ripening\" principle from *FirsTier*, avoiding pointless procedural traps, and ensuring access to justice for litigants are now fully endorsed by the government.\n    *   **Respondent (United States):** The government's strategy is not to defend the lower court's ruling but to argue against Supreme Court intervention. It has confessed error on the merits but opposes certiorari on the prudential grounds that the issue is rare and, more importantly, is already being studied by the Advisory Committee on Appellate Rules.\n\n*   **Final Prediction Model (Bifurcated):** My prediction remains split into two distinct parts, but my internal reasoning has confirmed that I can confidently answer the core legal question regardless of the procedural outcome.\n    *   **Answer to the Legal Question:** Based on the unanimous agreement between the parties and across nearly all circuits, the Supreme Court, *if it were to rule on the merits*, would undoubtedly hold that a second notice of appeal is **not** required. The answer to the question presented is \"No.\"\n    *   **Likelihood of Supreme Court Intervention:** This remains the primary uncertainty. The government's opposition, coupled with the \"off-ramp\" provided by the pending Rules Committee review, creates a strong possibility that the Court will deny certiorari, letting the rulemaking process provide a global fix rather than issuing a judgment for a single case. A Grant, Vacate, and Remand (GVR) or a summary reversal is also possible if the Court wishes to correct this specific error, but a denial of the petition is a very plausible outcome.",
          "design_beliefs": "My meta-level understanding of legal strategy and analysis has been significantly refined. This last observation, an act of internal synthesis, highlights the importance of defining the precise goal and recognizing when sufficient evidence has been gathered to meet it.\n\n*   **Source Prioritization (Confirmed):** The sequence of analyzing the Petition for Certiorari followed by the Respondent's Brief in Opposition remains the most effective strategy for quickly resolving the core legal and strategic conflicts in a Supreme Court case.\n\n*   **Key Heuristics for Prediction (Expanded and Refined):**\n    1.  **\"Find the Circuit Split\":** A foundational heuristic.\n    2.  **\"Identify the Interpretive Conflict\":** Essential for understanding the legal substance.\n    3.  **\"Assess the Policy Stakes\":** Important for gauging the case's significance.\n    4.  **\"Look for a Confession of Error\" (Refined):** This has been upgraded. I now model three distinct respondent strategies: (1) Defend the judgment, (2) Confess error and acquiesce to reversal, and (3) **Concede the Merits, Oppose Certiorari**, a nuanced tactic to correct the law while managing the Court's docket.\n    5.  **\"Check for Rulemaking Activity\":** A critical new heuristic. For cases involving Federal Rules, the activity of the relevant Advisory Committee is a potentially dispositive factor in the Court's decision to grant or deny certiorari.\n    6.  **\"Distinguish the Legal Question from the Case Outcome\" (New Heuristic):** This is a crucial meta-cognitive insight. My task is to predict the Court's ruling on the *legal question*. If the evidence (especially a consensus between the parties) provides a clear answer to that question, I can make a confident prediction on that basis, even if the ultimate procedural fate of the case (e.g., cert denial) remains uncertain. This prevents conflating two separate predictive tasks.\n\n*   **Refined Research Strategy (Now Goal-Oriented):** My process is now more efficient and targeted.\n    1.  Start with the Petition for Certiorari.\n    2.  Prioritize the Respondent's Brief to identify their strategic posture (defend, confess, or concede-and-oppose). This is the highest-value next step.\n    3.  If the case involves a Federal Rule, search `uscourts.gov` for Advisory Committee minutes and agendas to check for pending amendments.\n    4.  **New Step: Synthesize and Evaluate Sufficiency.** After analyzing the core briefs, pause to determine if the evidence is sufficient to answer the specific legal question posed. If the parties are in agreement on the merits, the answer to the legal question is likely settled, and further information gathering (e.g., on amicus briefs) may have low marginal utility for *that specific question*, though it may still inform the cert-grant prediction.\n    5.  Continue with analysis of lower court opinions, precedents, and amicus briefs as needed to resolve remaining uncertainty."
