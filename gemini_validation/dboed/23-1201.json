    "facts_of_the_case": "This case involves an agreement between two Indian corporations, Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. and Antrix Corp. Ltd. After a dispute arose, Devas obtained an arbitration award from the International Chamber of Commerce against Antrix. Devas then sought to confirm this award in a U.S. district court. Antrix challenged the court\u2019s personal jurisdiction, but the district court confirmed the award, concluding that a minimum contacts analysis was unnecessary under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).\n\nAntrix appealed the confirmation order, arguing that the district court erred in exercising personal jurisdiction without conducting a minimum contacts analysis. Meanwhile, a group of intervenors, including CC/Devas (Mauritius) Ltd. and others, moved to register the judgment in the Eastern District of Virginia. Both Antrix and Devas challenged this registration order. The U.S. Court of Appeals reversed, concluding that the plaintiff must prove minimum contacts, and its failure to do so meant it could not exercise personal jurisdiction over Antrix.",

This action, by retrieving the petitioner's brief on the merits, will provide a massive information gain for the task (Task EIG = 0.9). It will expose the specific statutory interpretations, key precedents, and the complete structure of the argument for overturning the lower court. This is the most direct and comprehensive way to move from knowing the question to understanding the arguments. Simultaneously, this action serves as a direct test of my foundational design heuristic: 'start with the petitioner's brief.' The success and utility of this action will provide strong evidence to either confirm or force a revision of this core strategy, yielding a very high information gain for my design beliefs (Design EIG = 0.8).

The district court\u2019s opinion \nconfirming the arbitral award (Pet.

Timely petitions for rehearing \nen banc were denied on February 6, 2024.  Id. at 43a-45a.  \nThis Court extended the time in which to file a petition for \ncertiorari to July 5, 2024.  Devas Multimedia Private \nLimited v. Antrix Corp. Ltd., No. 23A966 (U.S.) (Apr. 30, \n2024).  Petitioner timely sought certiorari on July 3, 2024, \nwhich this Court granted on October 4, 2024, consolidating \nthis case with CC/Devas (Mauritius) Limited v. Antrix \nCorp. Ltd., No. 23-1201.  This Court has jurisdiction pur-\nsuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVI-\nSIONS INVOLVED \nThe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution pro-\nvides in relevant part: \nNo person shall * * * be deprived of life, liberty, \nor property, without due process of law * * *. \n \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a)-(b) provides: \n(a) The district courts shall have original juris-\ndiction without regard to amount in contro-\nversy of any nonjury civil action against a for-\neign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this \ntitle as to any claim for relief in personam with \nrespect to which the foreign state is not entitled \nto immunity either under sections 1605\u20131607 of \nthis title or under any applicable international \nagreement. \n \n(b) Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state \nshall exist as to every claim for relief over which \nthe district courts have jurisdiction under sub-\nsection (a) where service has been made under \nsection 1608 of this title.  \n\n3 \n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nSince the Founding, the amenability of foreign states \nto suit in the United States has been a decision confided to \nthe political branches, free of constitutional constraints.  \nBefore the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\nties Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d), the Executive Branch made jurisdic-\ntional recommendations to courts based on the Execu-\ntive\u2019s preferred approach to foreign sovereign immunity \nand international comity, and courts routinely accepted \nthem.  Congress stepped in with the FSIA in 1976 to pro-\nvide a comprehensive set of legal standards governing \nwhen foreign states may be sued in the United States.  \nUnder the FSIA, foreign states are presumptively im-\nmune from suit, subject to specified exceptions.  When a \nplaintiff\u2019s claim falls within an exception, the foreign state \nloses its immunity and subject-matter jurisdiction exists \nover the claim.  Unlike in other types of litigation, personal \njurisdiction under the FSIA follows automatically from \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  \u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a \nforeign state shall exist as to every claim for relief over \nwhich the district courts have [subject-matter] jurisdic-\ntion\u201d and where proper \u201cservice has been made.\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) (emphasis added).  The FSIA\u2019s compre-\nhensive scheme replaced the regime of ad hoc Executive \nBranch discretion with enduring jurisdictional rules pre-\nscribed by Congress and approved by the President.  But, \njust as before the FSIA, the political branches controlled \nthe scope of foreign sovereign immunity, with no role for \njudicial adventurism under the Constitution or otherwise. \nJust four years after the FSIA\u2019s advent, however, the \nNinth Circuit engrafted a minimum-contacts requirement \nonto the FSIA for asserting personal jurisdiction over for-\neign states.  The court divined its due-process-style test \nfrom the Act\u2019s legislative history, overlooking the clear, \nmandatory line drawn by the text of the long-arm provi-\nsion.  The ensuing decades have not been kind to the Ninth \n\n4 \n \nCircuit\u2019s countertextual position.  No other court of ap-\npeals has endorsed it, and nine judges below disavowed it.   \nThis case illustrates how the Ninth Circuit\u2019s departure \nfrom enacted text upsets the delicate balance struck by \nCongress.  The FSIA abrogates immunity whenever a \nplaintiff seeks to enforce certain arbitral awards against a \nforeign state.  It is undisputed that this arbitration excep-\ntion was satisfied and that proper service was achieved.  \nYet the Ninth Circuit rejected personal jurisdiction be-\ncause the underlying dispute did not arise out of the for-\neign state\u2019s minimum contacts with the United States.   \nIn so doing, the Ninth Circuit recalibrated Congress\u2019s \njudgment about when victims of sovereign wrongdoing \nshould have access to federal court.  And its outlier ap-\nproach sweeps across all of the FSIA\u2019s immunity excep-\ntions, closing the courthouse doors to victims of state-\nsponsored terrorism and expropriation who cannot meet \nthe minimum-contacts test.   \nThis Court should honor the judgment of the political \nbranches by enforcing the FSIA\u2019s textual command that \nthe minimum-contacts test is irrelevant to personal juris-\ndiction under the Act.  In the unlikely event that the Court \nreaches constitutional questions in the first instance, it \nshould confirm that the Due Process Clause does not con-\nstrain jurisdiction over foreign states.  The judgment be-\nlow should be reversed. \nSTATEMENT \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Legal Background \n1. \u201cFrom the Nation\u2019s founding until 1952, foreign \nstates were generally granted complete immunity from \nsuit in United States courts, and the Judicial Branch de-\nferred to the decisions of the Executive Branch on such \nquestions.\u201d  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Ship-\nping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434 n.1 (1989) (cleaned up).  \n\n5 \n \nCourts \u201cdeferred to the decisions of the political branches\u201d \nbecause \u201cforeign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace \nand comity on the part of the United States, * * * not a \nrestriction imposed by the Constitution.\u201d  Verlinden B.V. \nv. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 486 (1983).  In those \npre-1952 cases, \u201cthe State Department ordinarily re-\nquested immunity in all actions against friendly foreign \nsovereigns.\u201d  Ibid.  \nIn 1952, however, \u201cthe State Department announced \nits adoption of the \u2018restrictive\u2019 theory of foreign sovereign \nimmunity,\u201d under which \u201cimmunity is confined to suits in-\nvolving the foreign sovereign\u2019s public acts, and does not \nextend to cases arising out of a foreign state\u2019s strictly com-\nmercial acts.\u201d  Id. at 487.  \u201cThe restrictive theory was not \ninitially enacted into law, however, and its application \nproved troublesome.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cIn the ensuing years, the \nprocess by which the Executive Branch submitted state-\nments regarding a foreign state\u2019s immunity sometimes led \nto inconsistency, particularly in light of the case-by-case \ndiplomatic pressure that the Executive Branch received \nfrom foreign nations.\u201d  Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. \nUnited States, 598 U.S. 264, 271 (2023).  \u201cAnd when for-\neign states did not ask the State Department to weigh in, \ncourts were left to render immunity rulings on their own, \ngenerally by reference to prior State Department deci-\nsions.\u201d  Id. at 271-272.  \u201cThus, sovereign immunity deter-\nminations were made in two different branches, subject to \na variety of factors, sometimes including diplomatic con-\nsiderations.  Not surprisingly, the governing standards \nwere neither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 \nU.S. at 488. \n\u201cIn 1976, Congress entered the fray and sought to \nstandardize the judicial process with respect to immunity \nfor foreign sovereign entities in civil cases.\u201d  Turkiye Halk \nBankasi, 598 U.S. at 272.  The FSIA displaces the case-by-\ncase approach and \u201cprovides the \u2018sole basis\u2019 for obtaining \n\n6 \n \njurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in the United States.\u201d  \nRepublic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 611 \n(1992) (citation omitted).  To that end, the FSIA \u201ccontains \na comprehensive set of legal standards governing claims \nof immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or \nits political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities.\u201d  \nVerlinden, 461 U.S. at 488.  Because immunity and juris-\ndiction are two sides of the same coin, the FSIA likewise \n\u201cestablishes a comprehensive framework for determining \nwhether a court in this country, state or federal, may ex-\nercise jurisdiction over a foreign state.\u201d  Weltover, 504 \nU.S. at 610.  \n2. The Act governs suits against \u201cforeign state[s],\u201d \nwhich it defines to include \u201cpolitical subdivision[s].\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a).  A foreign state also encompasses \u201can \nagency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d which in-\ncludes \u201ca separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, \n* * * a majority of whose shares or other ownership inter-\nest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision \nthereof.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1603(a)-(b); see also Turkiye Halk Bankasi, \n598 U.S. at 272 (\u201cThe FSIA defines a \u2018foreign state\u2019 to en-\ncompass instrumentalities of a foreign state\u2014including \nentities that are directly and majority-owned by a foreign \nstate.\u201d). \n\u201c[T]he FSIA codifies a baseline principle of immunity \nfor foreign states and their instrumentalities\u201d and \u201cthen \nsets out exceptions to that principle.\u201d  Turkiye Halk Ban-\nkasi, 598 U.S. at 272; see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604 (\u201ca foreign state \nshall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the \nUnited States and of the States except as provided in sec-\ntions 1605 to 1607 of this chapter\u201d).  The Act\u2019s original ex-\nceptions\u2014which remain in effect today\u2014cover cases that \ninvolve:  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s waiver of immunity, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1),  \n\n7 \n \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s commercial activity in, or \nhaving an effect in, the United States, id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(2),  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s taking of property in viola-\ntion of international law when the expropriated \nproperty or property exchanged for it has a \nnexus to commercial activity in the United \nStates, id. \u00a7 1605(a)(3),  \n\uf0b7 rights in inherited and gift property and im-\nmovable property located in the United States, \nid. \u00a7 1605(a)(4), and  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s commission of a non-com-\nmercial \ntort \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates, id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(5).1 \nIn sum, the original FSIA exceptions required either a \nwaiver of immunity or \u201csome form of substantial contact \nwith the United States.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 490 & n.15.   \nThe FSIA grants subject-matter jurisdiction over any \nclaim that satisfies an immunity exception.  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1330(a) (\u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdic-\ntion * * * of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state \n* * * as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to \nwhich the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either \nunder sections 1605\u20131607 of this title or under any appli-\ncable international agreement.\u201d).  Thus, \u201cSections 1604 \nand 1330(a) work in tandem: \u00a7 1604 bars federal * * * \ncourts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state is \nentitled to immunity, and \u00a7 1330(a) confers jurisdiction on \ndistrict courts * * * when a foreign state is not entitled to \nimmunity.\u201d  Amerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 434.   \n \n1 The original FSIA also contained exceptions for certain actions in-\nvolving maritime liens, 28 U.S.C. \n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Timely petitions for rehearing \nen banc were denied on February 6, 2024.  Id. at 43a-45a.  \nThis Court extended the time in which to file a petition for \ncertiorari to July 5, 2024.  Devas Multimedia Private \nLimited v. Antrix Corp. Ltd., No. 23A966 (U.S.) (Apr. 30, \n2024).  Petitioner timely sought certiorari on July 3, 2024, \nwhich this Court granted on October 4, 2024, consolidating \nthis case with CC/Devas (Mauritius) Limited v. Antrix \nCorp. Ltd., No. 23-1201.  This Court has jurisdiction pur-\nsuant to 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1254(1). \nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY PROVI-\nSIONS INVOLVED \nThe Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution pro-\nvides in relevant part: \nNo person shall * * * be deprived of life, liberty, \nor property, without due process of law * * *. \n \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a)-(b) provides: \n(a) The district courts shall have original juris-\ndiction without regard to amount in contro-\nversy of any nonjury civil action against a for-\neign state as defined in section 1603(a) of this \ntitle as to any claim for relief in personam with \nrespect to which the foreign state is not entitled \nto immunity either under sections 1605\u20131607 of \nthis title or under any applicable international \nagreement. \n \n(b) Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state \nshall exist as to every claim for relief over which \nthe district courts have jurisdiction under sub-\nsection (a) where service has been made under \nsection 1608 of this title.  \n\n3 \n \nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT \nSince the Founding, the amenability of foreign states \nto suit in the United States has been a decision confided to \nthe political branches, free of constitutional constraints.  \nBefore the enactment of the Foreign Sovereign Immuni-\nties Act (\u201cFSIA\u201d), the Executive Branch made jurisdic-\ntional recommendations to courts based on the Execu-\ntive\u2019s preferred approach to foreign sovereign immunity \nand international comity, and courts routinely accepted \nthem.  Congress stepped in with the FSIA in 1976 to pro-\nvide a comprehensive set of legal standards governing \nwhen foreign states may be sued in the United States.  \nUnder the FSIA, foreign states are presumptively im-\nmune from suit, subject to specified exceptions.  When a \nplaintiff\u2019s claim falls within an exception, the foreign state \nloses its immunity and subject-matter jurisdiction exists \nover the claim.  Unlike in other types of litigation, personal \njurisdiction under the FSIA follows automatically from \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  \u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a \nforeign state shall exist as to every claim for relief over \nwhich the district courts have [subject-matter] jurisdic-\ntion\u201d and where proper \u201cservice has been made.\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) (emphasis added).  The FSIA\u2019s compre-\nhensive scheme replaced the regime of ad hoc Executive \nBranch discretion with enduring jurisdictional rules pre-\nscribed by Congress and approved by the President.  But, \njust as before the FSIA, the political branches controlled \nthe scope of foreign sovereign immunity, with no role for \njudicial adventurism under the Constitution or otherwise. \nJust four years after the FSIA\u2019s advent, however, the \nNinth Circuit engrafted a minimum-contacts requirement \nonto the FSIA for asserting personal jurisdiction over for-\neign states.  The court divined its due-process-style test \nfrom the Act\u2019s legislative history, overlooking the clear, \nmandatory line drawn by the text of the long-arm provi-\nsion.  The ensuing decades have not been kind to the Ninth \n\n4 \n \nCircuit\u2019s countertextual position.  No other court of ap-\npeals has endorsed it, and nine judges below disavowed it.   \nThis case illustrates how the Ninth Circuit\u2019s departure \nfrom enacted text upsets the delicate balance struck by \nCongress.  The FSIA abrogates immunity whenever a \nplaintiff seeks to enforce certain arbitral awards against a \nforeign state.  It is undisputed that this arbitration excep-\ntion was satisfied and that proper service was achieved.  \nYet the Ninth Circuit rejected personal jurisdiction be-\ncause the underlying dispute did not arise out of the for-\neign state\u2019s minimum contacts with the United States.   \nIn so doing, the Ninth Circuit recalibrated Congress\u2019s \njudgment about when victims of sovereign wrongdoing \nshould have access to federal court.  And its outlier ap-\nproach sweeps across all of the FSIA\u2019s immunity excep-\ntions, closing the courthouse doors to victims of state-\nsponsored terrorism and expropriation who cannot meet \nthe minimum-contacts test.   \nThis Court should honor the judgment of the political \nbranches by enforcing the FSIA\u2019s textual command that \nthe minimum-contacts test is irrelevant to personal juris-\ndiction under the Act.  In the unlikely event that the Court \nreaches constitutional questions in the first instance, it \nshould confirm that the Due Process Clause does not con-\nstrain jurisdiction over foreign states.  The judgment be-\nlow should be reversed. \nSTATEMENT \nI. BACKGROUND \nA. Legal Background \n1. \u201cFrom the Nation\u2019s founding until 1952, foreign \nstates were generally granted complete immunity from \nsuit in United States courts, and the Judicial Branch de-\nferred to the decisions of the Executive Branch on such \nquestions.\u201d  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Ship-\nping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434 n.1 (1989) (cleaned up).  \n\n5 \n \nCourts \u201cdeferred to the decisions of the political branches\u201d \nbecause \u201cforeign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace \nand comity on the part of the United States, * * * not a \nrestriction imposed by the Constitution.\u201d  Verlinden B.V. \nv. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 486 (1983).  In those \npre-1952 cases, \u201cthe State Department ordinarily re-\nquested immunity in all actions against friendly foreign \nsovereigns.\u201d  Ibid.  \nIn 1952, however, \u201cthe State Department announced \nits adoption of the \u2018restrictive\u2019 theory of foreign sovereign \nimmunity,\u201d under which \u201cimmunity is confined to suits in-\nvolving the foreign sovereign\u2019s public acts, and does not \nextend to cases arising out of a foreign state\u2019s strictly com-\nmercial acts.\u201d  Id. at 487.  \u201cThe restrictive theory was not \ninitially enacted into law, however, and its application \nproved troublesome.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cIn the ensuing years, the \nprocess by which the Executive Branch submitted state-\nments regarding a foreign state\u2019s immunity sometimes led \nto inconsistency, particularly in light of the case-by-case \ndiplomatic pressure that the Executive Branch received \nfrom foreign nations.\u201d  Turkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. \nUnited States, 598 U.S. 264, 271 (2023).  \u201cAnd when for-\neign states did not ask the State Department to weigh in, \ncourts were left to render immunity rulings on their own, \ngenerally by reference to prior State Department deci-\nsions.\u201d  Id. at 271-272.  \u201cThus, sovereign immunity deter-\nminations were made in two different branches, subject to \na variety of factors, sometimes including diplomatic con-\nsiderations.  Not surprisingly, the governing standards \nwere neither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 \nU.S. at 488. \n\u201cIn 1976, Congress entered the fray and sought to \nstandardize the judicial process with respect to immunity \nfor foreign sovereign entities in civil cases.\u201d  Turkiye Halk \nBankasi, 598 U.S. at 272.  The FSIA displaces the case-by-\ncase approach and \u201cprovides the \u2018sole basis\u2019 for obtaining \n\n6 \n \njurisdiction over a foreign sovereign in the United States.\u201d  \nRepublic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607, 611 \n(1992) (citation omitted).  To that end, the FSIA \u201ccontains \na comprehensive set of legal standards governing claims \nof immunity in every civil action against a foreign state or \nits political subdivisions, agencies or instrumentalities.\u201d  \nVerlinden, 461 U.S. at 488.  Because immunity and juris-\ndiction are two sides of the same coin, the FSIA likewise \n\u201cestablishes a comprehensive framework for determining \nwhether a court in this country, state or federal, may ex-\nercise jurisdiction over a foreign state.\u201d  Weltover, 504 \nU.S. at 610.  \n2. The Act governs suits against \u201cforeign state[s],\u201d \nwhich it defines to include \u201cpolitical subdivision[s].\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a).  A foreign state also encompasses \u201can \nagency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d which in-\ncludes \u201ca separate legal person, corporate or otherwise, \n* * * a majority of whose shares or other ownership inter-\nest is owned by a foreign state or political subdivision \nthereof.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1603(a)-(b); see also Turkiye Halk Bankasi, \n598 U.S. at 272 (\u201cThe FSIA defines a \u2018foreign state\u2019 to en-\ncompass instrumentalities of a foreign state\u2014including \nentities that are directly and majority-owned by a foreign \nstate.\u201d). \n\u201c[T]he FSIA codifies a baseline principle of immunity \nfor foreign states and their instrumentalities\u201d and \u201cthen \nsets out exceptions to that principle.\u201d  Turkiye Halk Ban-\nkasi, 598 U.S. at 272; see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604 (\u201ca foreign state \nshall be immune from the jurisdiction of the courts of the \nUnited States and of the States except as provided in sec-\ntions 1605 to 1607 of this chapter\u201d).  The Act\u2019s original ex-\nceptions\u2014which remain in effect today\u2014cover cases that \ninvolve:  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s waiver of immunity, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1),  \n\n7 \n \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s commercial activity in, or \nhaving an effect in, the United States, id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(2),  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s taking of property in viola-\ntion of international law when the expropriated \nproperty or property exchanged for it has a \nnexus to commercial activity in the United \nStates, id. \u00a7 1605(a)(3),  \n\uf0b7 rights in inherited and gift property and im-\nmovable property located in the United States, \nid. \u00a7 1605(a)(4), and  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s commission of a non-com-\nmercial \ntort \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates, id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(5).1 \nIn sum, the original FSIA exceptions required either a \nwaiver of immunity or \u201csome form of substantial contact \nwith the United States.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 490 & n.15.   \nThe FSIA grants subject-matter jurisdiction over any \nclaim that satisfies an immunity exception.  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1330(a) (\u201cThe district courts shall have original jurisdic-\ntion * * * of any nonjury civil action against a foreign state \n* * * as to any claim for relief in personam with respect to \nwhich the foreign state is not entitled to immunity either \nunder sections 1605\u20131607 of this title or under any appli-\ncable international agreement.\u201d).  Thus, \u201cSections 1604 \nand 1330(a) work in tandem: \u00a7 1604 bars federal * * * \ncourts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state is \nentitled to immunity, and \u00a7 1330(a) confers jurisdiction on \ndistrict courts * * * when a foreign state is not entitled to \nimmunity.\u201d  Amerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 434.   \n \n1 The original FSIA also contained exceptions for certain actions in-\nvolving maritime liens, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(b), and certain counterclaims, \nid. \u00a7 1607. \n\n8 \n \nPersonal jurisdiction, in turn, goes hand-in-hand with \nthe existence of subject-matter jurisdiction under the im-\nmunity exceptions.  \u201cPersonal jurisdiction over a foreign \nstate shall exist as to every claim for relief over which the \ndistrict courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a) \nwhere service has been made under section 1608 of this \ntitle.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) (emphasis added).  In other \nwords, personal jurisdiction is automatically established \nby proper service combined with the existence of subject-\nmatter jurisdiction under an enumerated exception.  The \nconverse is also true:  When subject-matter jurisdiction is \nlacking because the claim falls outside the immunity ex-\nceptions, \u201cthe federal court will also lack personal jurisdic-\ntion.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 489 n.14.  In this way, \u201csec-\ntions 1330(b), 1608, and 1605-1607 are all carefully inter-\nconnected.\u201d  H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 14 (1976), reprinted \nin 1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6612.    \n3. Over time, Congress expanded the list of immunity \nexceptions.  It added the arbitration exception in 1988.  \nPub. L. No. 100-669, \u00a7 2, 102 Stat. 3969, 3969 (1988).  That \nexception provides that a foreign state is not immune in \nany case, inter alia, \u201cin which the action is brought * * * to \nconfirm an award made pursuant to * * * an agreement to \narbitrate\u201d with the foreign state if \u201cthe agreement or \naward is or may be governed by a treaty or other interna-\ntional agreement in force for the United States calling for \nthe recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards.\u201d  28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B).2  This exception is commonly used \nto enforce arbitral awards governed by treaties such as \n \n2 The arbitration exception also applies to confirmation or enforce-\nment of awards where \u201cthe arbitration takes place or is intended to \ntake place in the United States,\u201d where \u201cthe underlying claim, save \nfor the agreement to arbitrate, could have been brought in a United \nStates court under this section or section 1607,\u201d or where \n\u201c[\u00a7 1605(a)(1)\u2019s waiver provision] is otherwise applicable.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(6)(A), (C)-(D). \n\n9 \n \nthe Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of \nForeign Arbitral Awards (\u201cNew York Convention\u201d), June \n10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, T.I.A.S. No. 6997, and the Con-\nvention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes Be-\ntween States and Nationals of Other States (\u201cICSID Con-\nvention\u201d), Mar. 18, 1965, 17 U.S.T. 1270, T.I.A.S. No. 6090.  \nSee, e.g., Process & Indus. Devs. Ltd. v. Fed. Republic of \nNigeria, 27 F.4th 771, 776 (D.C. Cir. 2022) (\u201c[T]he New \nYork Convention is exactly the sort of treaty Congress in-\ntended to include in the arbitration exception.\u201d) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted); Blue Ridge Invs., \nL.L.C. v. Republic of Argentina, 735 F.3d 72, 85 (2d Cir. \n2013) (\u201c[E]very court to consider whether awards issued \npursuant to the ICSID Convention fall within the arbitral \naward exception to the FSIA has concluded that they \ndo.\u201d). \nCongress added the terrorism exception in 1996.  Pub. \nL. No. 104-132, \u00a7 221, 110 Stat. 1214, 1241-1243 (1996) \n(codifying exception at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(7)); see also \nPub. L. No. 110-181, \u00a7 1083, 122 Stat. 3, 338-344 (2008) (re-\nplacing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(7) with an amended exception \ncodified at 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A).  As amended, this exception \ncreates jurisdiction over suits against designated state \nsponsors of terrorism \u201cfor personal injury or death that \nwas caused by an act of torture, extrajudicial killing, air-\ncraft sabotage, hostage taking, or the provision of material \nsupport or resources for such an act\u201d where the victim is a \nU.S. national, armed-forces member, or government em-\nployee or contractor.  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1), (2)(A)(i)-(ii).  \nThe terrorism exception applies regardless of where the \nterrorist attack occurred or if it had any effects in the \nUnited States.  See ibid.   \nWhen Congress codified those additional immunity ex-\nceptions, it did not amend the FSIA\u2019s long-arm provision, \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b), which bases personal jurisdiction \n\n10 \n \nsolely on proper service and subject-matter jurisdiction \nunder any immunity exception. \n4. Finally, the FSIA prescribes detailed rules for the \ncivil action.  The Act specifies the proper venue, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1391(f), authorizes removal if suit is initially brought in \nstate court, id. \u00a7 1441(d), provides rules for service and \npleadings, id. \u00a7 1608, and details the extent of the foreign \nstate\u2019s liability, id. \u00a7 1606.  Once a judgment is obtained, \nthe FSIA establishes a default rule that the foreign state\u2019s \nproperty is immune from attachment and execution, with \ncertain exceptions for when the foreign state\u2019s property \nloses its immunity.  Id. \u00a7\u00a7 1609-1611.  \nB. Factual Background  \nRespondent Antrix is a corporation wholly owned by \nthe Republic of India that promotes and markets goods \nand services created by the nation\u2019s Department of Space \nand Indian Space Research Organisation.  Pet. App. 17a, \n52a.  Petitioner Devas is an Indian corporation incorpo-\nrated in December 2004 by former employees of the In-\ndian Space Research Organisation to develop and provide \ntelecommunication services in India.  Ibid.  \nIn January 2005, Devas and Antrix entered into an \nagreement under which Antrix agreed to build, launch, \nand operate two satellites and to make available 70 MHz \nof S-band spectrum for Devas\u2019s use.  Id. at 17a-18a, 52a-\n53a.  Antrix repudiated the agreement in 2011, claiming \nforce majeure on the ground that the Indian government \nhad made a policy decision not to provide S-band spectrum \nfor commercial use.  C.A. E.R. 88.  Devas invoked the \nagreement\u2019s arbitration clause and initiated arbitral pro-\nceedings before the International Chamber of Commerce \nseated in New Delhi, India.  Pet. App. 18a-20a.  In 2015, \nthe tribunal determined that Antrix breached the agree-\nment and awarded Devas $562.5 million in damages plus \ninterest.  Id. at 20a.  It is undisputed that this award is \n\n11 \n \ngoverned by the laws of India and subject to the New York \nConvention.  Id. at 21a.   \nShortly thereafter, Antrix petitioned an Indian court \nto set aside the award.  Id. at 20a.  The Indian court agreed \nin 2022, holding that the award suffered from patent ille-\ngality and fraud and conflicted with Indian public policy.  \nC.A. Doc. 72, App. A.  This order was upheld on appeal by \nthe Supreme Court of India.  C.A. Doc. 116, Attach. A. \nMeanwhile, in 2021, the National Company Law Tribu-\nnal ordered that Devas be placed into liquidation, finding \nthat it had been incorporated for fraudulent and unlawful \npurposes and that its affairs were being conducted in a \nfraudulent manner.  Pet. App. 54a; C.A. Doc. 38-2, at \u00b6\u00b6 1, \n11.  As a result of that order, Devas remains under the \nmanagement of a court-appointed Official Liquidator, who \nmust safeguard Devas\u2019s assets (including the award) and \nultimately liquidate the company.  Pet. App. 54a; C.A. Doc. \n38-2, at \u00b6\u00b6 1, 2, 6-8, 12-14.  The liquidation order was up-\nheld on appeal by the Supreme Court of India.  C.A. Doc. \n72, App. B.      \nII. PROCEEDINGS BELOW \nA. Proceedings in the district court \nDevas sought to confirm the award in 2018 in the U.S. \nDistrict Court for the Western District of Washington, in-\nvoking the FSIA\u2019s arbitration exception to establish sub-\nject-matter jurisdiction, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6).  Pet. App. \n20a-21a.  Antrix conceded that it is \u201can agency or instru-\nmentality of a foreign state\u201d and therefore a \u201cforeign \nstate\u201d under the FSIA, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a)-(b).  Pet. App. \n21a.  Antrix did not dispute that it was properly served and \nthat the arbitration exception applies, thus conceding the \nstatutory basis for personal jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1330(b).  Id. at 22a.  Nevertheless, Antrix moved to dis-\nmiss the petition for lack of personal jurisdiction, arguing \nthat the Due Process Clause precludes personal \n\n12 \n \njurisdiction because the dispute does not arise out of An-\ntrix\u2019s \u201cminimum contacts\u201d with the forum.  Ibid.; see Wal-\nden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 283-284 (2014) (To establish \n\u201cthe \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 necessary to create specific juris-\ndiction,\u201d \u201cthe defendant\u2019s suit-related conduct must create \na substantial connection with the forum State.\u201d).   \nThe district court denied Antrix\u2019s motion to dismiss.  \nPet. App. 13a-15a, 22a.  The court explained that personal \njurisdiction exists under the FSIA because the arbitration \nexception to immunity applies and Antrix had been validly \nserved.  Id. at 13a, 21a-22a (citing 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1330(b), \n1605(a)(6)).  The court rejected Antrix\u2019s argument that \u201cit \nis entitled to additional, constitutional due process \nprotections requiring a minimum contacts analysis.\u201d  Id. \nat 13a.  The court reasoned that because a foreign state is \nnot a \u201cperson\u201d under the Due Process Clause, the clause \ndoes not constrain the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nover foreign states.  Id. at 13a-14a.  By the same token, \n\u201c[w]here the state exercises sufficient control over a for-\neign corporation, the due process clause does not apply \nand statutory personal jurisdiction under the FSIA is all \nthat is required.\u201d  Id.  at 14a.  Because \u201c[t]he Government \nof India exercises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over Antrix in a \nprincipal-agent relationship,\u201d the court concluded that An-\ntrix, like India, \u201cis not a \u2018person\u2019 for due process purposes\u201d \nunder the Due Process Clause.  Id. at 13a-14a (citation \nomitted).  Rejecting Antrix\u2019s other arguments against the \naward\u2019s confirmation, the district court confirmed the \naward and entered judgment for Devas in the amount of \n$1.3 billion.  Id. at 34a, 53a.  Antrix appealed.  Id. at 3a. \nAfter Antrix appealed and the Indian judicial system \nplaced Devas into liquidation, several Devas shareholders \nand a Devas subsidiary\u2014CC/Devas (Mauritius) Limited; \nDevas Multimedia America, Inc.; Devas Employees Mau-\nritius Private Limited; and Telcom Devas Mauritius Lim-\nited\u2014were granted intervention but denied substitution \n\n13 \n \nin the district court and court of appeals, over Devas\u2019s ob-\njection that these entities have no standing to enforce De-\nvas\u2019s award.  Id. at 54a.3  The district court permitted the \nintervenors to conduct post-judgment discovery to locate \nAntrix\u2019s executable assets and to register the judgment in \nthe Eastern District of Virginia after discovery revealed \nassets there.  Id. at 36a, 40a-41a.  Devas appealed the or-\nder permitting the intervenors to register the judgment, \narguing that it infringed the Official Liquidator\u2019s author-\nity and effectively nullified the Supreme Court of India\u2019s \norder temporarily staying enforcement of the award while \nIndian legal challenges progressed.  Id. at 3a. \nWhile both the confirmation and registration appeals \nwere pending before the Ninth Circuit, the Indian courts \nset aside Devas\u2019s arbitral award.  Id. at 54a.  Antrix sought \na limited remand to the district court to evaluate the effect \nof the Indian courts\u2019 set-aside ruling on the award\u2019s en-\nforceability.  Ibid. \nB. Proceedings in the court of appeals \n1. The court of appeals reversed confirmation of De-\nvas\u2019s award, holding that the district court lacked personal \njurisdiction.  Pet. App. 3a.  The court acknowledged that \nunder the FSIA, \u201cpersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state \nshall exist as to every claim for relief over which the \ndistrict courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a) \nwhere service has been made under section 1608 of this \ntitle.\u201d  Id. at 3a-4a (alteration marks omitted) (quoting 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b)).  The court noted the parties\u2019 agreement \nthat Antrix was properly served and that subject-matter \njurisdiction existed under 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a) because the \n \n3 The intervenors filed a petition for certiorari raising the same issue \npresented in Devas\u2019s petition, and this Court granted both petitions \nand consolidated the cases.

Id. at 4a. \nNonetheless, the court of appeals reasoned that circuit \nprecedent imposes an additional requirement: \u201c[P]ersonal \njurisdiction under the FSIA requires a traditional mini-\nmum contacts analysis.\u201d  Ibid.  It explained that the Ninth \nCircuit, relying on the FSIA\u2019s legislative history, first \nadopted this rule in Thomas P. Gonzalez Corp. v. Consejo \nNacional De Produccion De Costa Rica, 614 F.2d 1247, \n1255 (9th Cir. 1980), and continued to apply it in later \ncases.  Ibid.  The court of appeals observed that its prece-\ndential minimum-contacts requirement derived from the \nFSIA itself, not from the Due Process Clause.  Id. at 5a.  \nThus, the circuit precedent was not \u201cclearly irreconcila-\nble\u201d with Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. \n607 (1992), which strongly suggested that foreign states \nare not \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process Clause and \ntherefore ineligible for a constitutionally mandated mini-\nmum-contacts analysis.  Ibid. (citation omitted). \nApplying the minimum-contacts test, the court held \nthat Antrix lacked sufficient suit-related contacts with the \nUnited States to support personal jurisdiction.  Id. at 5a-\n7a.  The court therefore reversed the district court\u2019s judg-\nment confirming the award.  Id. at 8a.  Because the court \nof appeals relied solely on the threshold ground of per-\nsonal jurisdiction, it did not reach any of Antrix\u2019s other \nchallenges to the confirmation of Devas\u2019s award.  Ibid.  \nAnd because the court reversed the judgment, it also re-\nversed the order allowing the intervenors to register the \njudgment and denied Antrix\u2019s motion for a limited re-\nmand.  Id. at 8a & n.1.   \nJudge Miller, joined by Judge Koh, concurred in the \ndisposition as a correct application of circuit precedent but \ndoubted that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s minimum-contacts re-\nquirement has any basis in the FSIA or the Constitution.  \nId. at 9a.  Judge Miller declared that \u201c[n]othing in the text \n\n15 \n \nof the FSIA\u2019s long-arm provision describes a minimum-\ncontacts requirement.\u201d  Id. at 10a.  He observed that other \ncircuits have held that the FSIA\u2019s long-arm provision re-\nquires nothing more than proper service and satisfaction \nof an enumerated exception to immunity.  Ibid.   \nNor could the Constitution support a minimum-con-\ntacts rule.  Judge Miller agreed with the D.C., Second, and \nSeventh Circuits that \u201cneither the text of the Constitution, \nSupreme Court decisions construing the Due Process \nClause, nor long standing tradition provide a basis for ex-\ntending the reach of this constitutional provision for the \nbenefit of foreign states.\u201d  Id. at 9a (cleaned up).     \n2. The court of appeals denied rehearing en banc over \nseven dissents.  Id. at 44a-45a.  Judge Bumatay, joined by \nJudges Callahan, Ikuta, Bennett, R. Nelson, and Van-\nDyke, filed a lengthy opinion, id. at 45a, and Senior Circuit \nJudge O\u2019Scannlain expressed his agreement with Judge \nBumatay\u2019s dissent, ibid. \nJudge Bumatay explained that \u201c[t]his case presents a \nstraightforward question\u201d: \u201cDespite the FSIA\u2019s text, does \nthe Act require plaintiffs to also prove \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 \nto assert personal jurisdiction over a foreign state?\u201d  Id. at \n46a.  \u201cUnlike every other federal court, the Ninth Circuit \nanswers \u2018yes.\u2019\u201d  Ibid.  As Judge Bumatay noted, this deci-\nsion means that in future cases against foreign states \u201cwe \nlock the courthouse doors to plaintiffs whom Congress ex-\npressly granted access.  So victims of terrorism, those \nharmed by violations of international law, and persons who \nsuffered from torture may be barred from seeking justice \nin our courts.\u201d  Id. at 47a.  \u201cThe effect of [this] ruling is \nunquestionably significant\u201d because \u201c[u]nder a proper \nreading of the FSIA, those plaintiffs should be welcome to \nbring their claims in [the Ninth Circuit].\u201d  Id. at 49a-50a.   \nJudge Bumatay lamented that the court nonetheless \nadhered to its \u201cerroneous precedent,\u201d which was based \n\n16 \n \nupon \u201cthe most dubious of guises\u2014legislative history.\u201d  Id. \nat 47a, 49a.  And he decried the decision to \u201cclose the court-\nhouse doors\u201d to FSIA plaintiffs, despite the \u201cconsensus of \ncircuit courts\u201d rejecting any minimum-contacts require-\nment.  Id. at 62a, 67a. \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nThe FSIA does not require a showing of minimum con-\ntacts before a district court may exercise personal juris-\ndiction over a foreign state.  The FSIA\u2019s long-arm provi-\nsion dictates that personal jurisdiction \u201cshall exist\u201d over \n\u201cevery claim\u201d where an immunity exception is established \nand proper service is made.  Nothing in the text supports \nadding a minimum-contacts test to those express require-\nments.  To the contrary, the Act\u2019s mandatory language \nforbids courts from declining to exercise personal jurisdic-\ntion over claims that satisfy the two specified conditions.  \nUnsurprisingly, this Court has repeatedly recognized that \npersonal jurisdiction under the FSIA is automatic when an \nimmunity exception applies and proper service is made.      \nThe Act\u2019s structure confirms this result.  Congress \nmade the immunity exceptions the linchpin of the jurisdic-\ntional scheme and intentionally designed the FSIA so that \nsubject-matter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction auto-\nmatically follow whenever a plaintiff states a claim that \nfalls within the Act\u2019s carefully calibrated immunity excep-\ntions.  Adding a minimum-contacts requirement contra-\ndicts this central structural feature of the Act. \nThe FSIA\u2019s history likewise reveals that Congress \ncrafted exceptions requiring varying types of U.S. con-\ntacts to trigger jurisdiction.  While some of the Act\u2019s orig-\ninal exceptions require U.S. contacts that may satisfy a \ndue-process-style minimum-contacts test, Congress de-\ntermined for later exceptions that a different degree of \nU.S. contacts was sufficient to confer jurisdiction.  The ar-\nbitration exception at issue here, for instance, requires \n\n17 \n \nonly indirect connections with the United States, allowing \nenforcement of arbitral awards governed by treaties \nsigned by the United States, regardless of whether the un-\nderlying dispute arose out of U.S. contacts.  The terrorism \nexception requires similarly attenuated U.S. connections, \nallowing jurisdiction over suits by terrorism victims when \nthe plaintiff is a U.S national, regardless of where the ter-\nrorist attack occurred or whether it arose out of U.S. con-\ntacts.  The fact that Congress crafted some immunity ex-\nceptions\u2014but not others\u2014to require substantial, suit-re-\nlated U.S. contacts illustrates that the Act does not contain \nan overarching minimum-contacts test.   \nEvery circuit to analyze the long-arm provision has re-\nfused to interpolate a minimum-contacts requirement into \nthe Act.  The D.C., Second, Seventh, and Eleventh Circuits \nall enforce the Act\u2019s text and exercise personal jurisdiction \nwhenever an immunity exception is satisfied, revealing the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s rule as an extreme and misbegotten out-\nlier.   \n  In the decision below, the court of appeals adhered to \na 40-year-old circuit precedent holding that personal juris-\ndiction over a foreign state must comport with the mini-\nmum-contacts standard.  That decision improperly ig-\nnored the unambiguous text of the long-arm provision in \nfavor of vague and irrelevant legislative history.  If any-\nthing, that legislative history shows that Congress relied \non precisely drafted immunity exceptions to define the \nscope of jurisdiction under the Act.   \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach has far-reaching conse-\nquences.  Imposing a minimum-contacts rule would evis-\ncerate the arbitration and terrorism exceptions, which re-\nquire only indirect contacts with the United States.  Cer-\ntain original exceptions, including the third prong of the \ncommercial-activity exception and the expropriation ex-\nception, would also see their textual reach artificially lim-\nited by a minimum-contacts test.  Sovereign actors would \n\n18 \n \nescape accountability that Congress desired.  Courts have \nno warrant to revise the jurisdictional policy judgments \nmade by the political branches in the FSIA. \nThe Constitution does not require a different result\u2014\nhardly surprising since foreign sovereign immunity is a \nquestion of comity entrusted to the political branches.  Nor \ncould constitutional-avoidance principles support judi-\ncially revising the FSIA\u2019s unambiguous text to include a \nminimum-contacts test.  Because the court of appeals did \nnot consider whether the Due Process Clause entitles An-\ntrix to a minimum-contacts analysis, the Court should re-\nmand that issue after reversing the Ninth Circuit\u2019s erro-\nneous construction of the FSIA.  If the Court reaches the \nquestion, the Due Process Clause cannot aid Antrix be-\ncause a foreign state is not a \u201cperson\u201d for purposes of that \nclause; even if it were, the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause, which applies here\u2014unlike the Four-\nteenth\u2019s\u2014does not impose a minimum-contacts test for \npersonal jurisdiction; and the FSIA\u2019s arbitration excep-\ntion satisfies any applicable due-process test because it \nvalidly deems a foreign state to have consented to personal \njurisdiction when it agreed to arbitrate. \nARGUMENT \nI. THE FSIA DOES NOT IMPOSE A MINIMUM-CONTACTS \nTEST FOR PERSONAL JURISDICTION \nThe Ninth Circuit\u2019s minimum-contacts rule for per-\nsonal jurisdiction lacks any support in the FSIA.  The \nAct\u2019s long-arm provision mandates that personal jurisdic-\ntion \u201cshall exist\u201d over \u201cevery claim\u201d where there is proper \nservice and subject-matter jurisdiction under an enumer-\nated immunity exception.  That nondiscretionary and com-\nprehensive language prohibits courts from declining per-\nsonal jurisdiction because minimum contacts cannot be es-\ntablished.  While some immunity exceptions themselves \nrequire significant, suit-related U.S. contacts, others do \n\n19 \n \nnot.  Congress chose to set the level of required contacts \nthrough the exceptions, not through an overarching due-\nprocess-style minimum-contacts test.  The Ninth Circuit\u2019s \ncontrary rule ignores the text and relies entirely on selec-\ntive and irrelevant legislative history.  Small wonder that \nno other court of appeals follows its atextual approach.  \nEngrafting a minimum-contacts requirement onto the \nFSIA would dramatically disrupt the FSIA\u2019s jurisdic-\ntional scheme and eviscerate the effectiveness of several \nimmunity exceptions.  This Court should reject the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s indefensible reading of the FSIA. \nA. The FSIA\u2019s long-arm provision bases personal ju-\nrisdiction solely on proper service and satisfying an \nimmunity exception \nWhen interpreting a statutory provision, \u201cwe begin \nwhere all such inquiries must begin: with the language of \nthe statute itself.\u201d  Republic of Sudan v. Harrison, 587 U.S. \n1, 8 (2019) (cleaned up).  The Court \u201cmust enforce plain \nand unambiguous statutory language according to its \nterms.\u201d  Hardt v. Reliance Standard Life Ins. Co., 560 U.S. \n242, 251 (2010).  The FSIA\u2019s text is pellucid.  Its long-arm \nprovision bases personal jurisdiction exclusively on proper \nservice and an exception to immunity.  \u201cBecause the plain \nlanguage of [the FSIA] is unambiguous, our inquiry be-\ngins with the statutory text, and ends there as well.\u201d  Nat\u2019l \nAss\u2019n of Mfrs. v. Dep\u2019t of Def., 583 U.S. 109, 127 (2018) (ci-\ntation and internal quotation marks omitted). \n1. The FSIA \u201cprescribes the procedures for obtaining \npersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state.\u201d  Republic of \nAustria v. Altmann, 541 U.S. 677, 691 (2004).  \u201cAnd it is \nhard to imagine a clearer statute\u201d than the FSIA\u2019s long-\narm provision.  Pet. App. 57a (Bumatay, J.).  It declares \nthat \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist \nas to every claim for relief over which the district courts \nhave jurisdiction under subsection (a) where service has \n\n20 \n \nbeen made under section 1608 of this title.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1330(b) (emphases added).  \u201c[S]ubsection (a),\u201d in turn, \npremises subject-matter jurisdiction on satisfying one of \nthe statute\u2019s immunity exceptions.  Id. \u00a7 1330(a) (\u201cThe dis-\ntrict courts shall have original jurisdiction * * * of any non-\njury civil action against a foreign state * * * as to any claim \nfor relief in personam with respect to which the foreign \nstate is not entitled to immunity either under sections \n1605\u20131607 of this title or under any applicable interna-\ntional agreement.\u201d).  Thus, personal jurisdiction \u201cshall ex-\nist\u201d whenever an immunity exception and proper service \nhave been satisfied.  Id. \u00a7 1330(b). \nCongress\u2019s chosen language is imperative and admits \nof no exceptions.  Personal jurisdiction \u201cshall\u201d exist if the \nspecified conditions are met.  \u201cThat presents a simple if-\nthen statement.\u201d  Pet. App. 57a (Bumatay, J.).  \u201cShall\u201d is \nmandatory, nondiscretionary language that courts must \nenforce.  Murphy v. Smith, 583 U.S. 220, 223 (2018) (\u201c[T]he \nword \u2018shall\u2019 usually creates a mandate, not a liberty,\u201d and \n\u201ctells us that the district court has some nondiscretionary \nduty to perform.\u201d).  It does not permit any wiggle room for \ncourts to decline personal jurisdiction where the listed \nconditions are met or to add new conditions for exercising \npersonal jurisdiction.   \nMoreover, personal jurisdiction shall exist over \u201cevery \nclaim\u201d where those conditions are met.  Contemporaneous \ndictionaries confirm that the term \u201cevery\u201d is all-encom-\npassing.  Every, The American Heritage Dictionary of the \nEnglish Language 454 (1971) (\u201cEach and all single mem-\nbers of an aggregate; each without exception\u201d); cf. SAS \nInst., Inc. v. Iancu, 584 U.S. 357, 362-363 (2018) (equating \n\u201cany\u201d to \u201cevery\u201d and emphasizing \u201cexpansive meaning\u201d) \n(citation and internal quotation marks omitted).  That lan-\nguage flatly forbids courts from declining personal juris-\ndiction over any sub-category of claims that meets the \nspecified conditions, such as claims where minimum \n\n21 \n \ncontacts are lacking.  Courts must exercise personal juris-\ndiction over all claims where subject-matter jurisdiction \nand service have been satisfied.     \nThis Court has discussed \u00a7 1330(b) multiple times and \nhad no trouble recognizing the import of its plain terms.  \nIn a seminal FSIA case, the Court observed that \u201cwher-\never subject matter jurisdiction exists under [\u00a7 1330(a)] \nand service of process has been made under \u00a7 1608 of the \nAct,\u201d \u201c\u00a7 1330(b) provides personal jurisdiction.\u201d  Verlin-\nden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 485 n.5 \n(1983).  And more recently, the Court proclaimed that the \nFSIA\u2019s long-arm provision \u201cmakes personal jurisdiction \nover a foreign state automatic when an exception to im-\nmunity applies and service of process has been accom-\nplished in accordance with 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1608.\u201d  Samantar v. \nYousuf, 560 U.S. 305, 324 n.20 (2010) (emphasis added).  \nThe Court need only honor the FSIA\u2019s text and its own \nprior statements to reject the Ninth Circuit\u2019s holding.   \n2. A plain-text reading of the long-arm provision ac-\ncords with the FSIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated scheme.\u201d  \nTurkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. 264, \n273 (2023); see also id. at 275 (\u201c[T]he Court must read the \nwords Congress enacted in their context and with a view \nto their place in the overall statutory scheme.\u201d) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted).  As one scholar has \naptly explained, \u201c[t]he FSIA * * * intertwines issues of \npersonal and subject matter jurisdiction over foreign \nstates with that of sovereign immunity.\u201d  Halverson, Is a \nForeign State a \u201cPerson\u201d? Does It Matter?: Personal Ju-\nrisdiction, Due Process, and the Foreign Sovereign Im-\nmunities Act, 34 N.Y.U. J. Int\u2019l L. & Pol. 115, 120 (2001).  \nSection 1604 grants presumptive immunity for foreign \nstates, subject to enumerated exceptions.  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1604.  When an exception strips the foreign state of its \nimmunity, then \u00a7 1330(a) automatically confers subject-\nmatter jurisdiction on the district courts.  Argentine \n\n22 \n \nRepublic v. Amerada Hess Shipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, \n434 (1989); see also Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 493-494 (\u201cAt the \nthreshold of every action in a District Court against a for-\neign state, * * * the court must satisfy itself that one of the \nexceptions applies\u201d because \u201csubject matter jurisdiction in \nany such action depends on the existence of one of the \nspecified exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity.\u201d) (ci-\ntation omitted).  And because personal jurisdiction turns \non the existence of subject-matter jurisdiction, personal \njurisdiction necessarily rises or falls with satisfaction of \none of the enumerated immunity exceptions.  E.g., \nAmerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 n.3 (\u201cThus, personal juris-\ndiction, like subject-matter jurisdiction, exists only when \none of the exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity in \n\u00a7\u00a7 1605\u20131607 applies.\u201d); Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 485 n.5 \n(\u201c[B]oth statutory subject matter jurisdiction * * * and \npersonal jurisdiction turn on application of the substantive \nprovisions of the Act.\u201d). \nAs a result, the immunity exceptions \u201care central to the \nAct\u2019s functioning,\u201d Altmann, 541 U.S. at 691, and their \n\u201cstatutory requirements * * * are the linchpin of the \n[FSIA\u2019s] jurisdictional design,\u201d Caplan, The Constitution \nand Jurisdiction over Foreign States: The 1996 Amend-\nment to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act in Per-\nspective, 41 Va.

No. 94-1487, at 14 (1976), reprinted in \n1976 U.S.C.C.A.N. 6604, 6612.  Adding a minimum-con-\ntacts requirement for personal jurisdiction defies Con-\ngress\u2019s choice to link immunity, subject-matter jurisdic-\ntion, and personal jurisdiction to satisfaction of an immun-\nity exception.  In this way, the Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule breaks \nthe common thread tying together the statute\u2019s jurisdic-\ntional scheme.   \n\n23 \n \n3. Reflecting the exceptions\u2019 centrality to jurisdiction, \nCongress carefully prescribed the type of U.S. contacts \nthat it deemed sufficient to trigger jurisdiction under each \nexception.  Courts do violence to that design when they \nimpose an overarching \u201cminimum contacts\u201d requirement \ndrawn from private litigation to displace the contacts Con-\ngress specified.  While some immunity exceptions may sat-\nisfy the familiar due-process tests for jurisdiction, others \ndo not.  Cf. Walden v. Fiore, 571 U.S. 277, 283-284 (2014) \n(To establish \u201cthe \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 necessary to create \nspecific jurisdiction,\u201d \u201cthe defendant\u2019s suit-related con-\nduct must create a substantial connection with the forum \nState.\u201d); Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry. Co., 600 U.S. 122, 138 \n(2023) (plurality op.) (\u201cexpress or implied consent\u201d to suit \nestablishes personal jurisdiction).  The role of courts is to \nenforce each exception according to its terms, not to force \nan ill-fitting, due-process-style straitjacket onto all of \nthem.   \nCongress drafted the original FSIA \u201caware of concern \nthat our courts might be turned into small international \ncourts of claims, open to all comers to litigate any dispute \nwhich any private party may have with a foreign state an-\nywhere in the world.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 490 (cleaned \nup).  So \u201cCongress protected against this danger * * * by \nenacting substantive provisions requiring some form of \nsubstantial contact with the United States\u201d or the foreign \nstate\u2019s waiver of immunity.  Id. at 490 & n.15; accord H.R. \nRep. No. 94-1487, at 13 (\u201c[E]ach of the immunity provi-\nsions in the bill, sections 1605-1607, requires some connec-\ntion between the lawsuit and the United States, or an ex-\npress or implied waiver by the foreign state of its immun-\nity from jurisdiction.\u201d). \nSpecifically, the original FSIA exceptions covered \ncases involving:  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s waiver of immunity, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1),  \n\n24 \n \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s commercial activity in, or \nhaving an effect in, the United States, id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(2),  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s taking of property in viola-\ntion of international law when the expropriated \nproperty or property exchanged for it has a \nnexus to commercial activity in the United \nStates, id. \u00a7 1605(a)(3),  \n\uf0b7 rights in inherited and gift property and im-\nmovable property located in the United States, \nid. \u00a7 1605(a)(4), and  \n\uf0b7 the foreign state\u2019s commission of a non-com-\nmercial \ntort \nin \nthe \nUnited \nStates, id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(5).4    \nMany cases brought under these original exceptions would \nlikely comport with the due-process tests that apply to \nnon-sovereign litigants under the Fourteenth Amend-\nment.   \nWhen Congress enacted the arbitration exception 12 \nyears later, however, it did not require substantial U.S. \ncontacts.  Instead, Congress deemed a lesser degree of \nU.S. connection sufficient to open the courts to certain ar-\nbitral-enforcement actions.  The arbitration exception pro-\nvides jurisdiction over actions to confirm or enforce an ar-\nbitral award if:  \n\uf0b7 \u201cthe arbitration takes place or is intended to \ntake place in the United States,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(6)(A), \n\uf0b7 \u201cthe agreement or award is or may be governed \nby a treaty or other international agreement in \nforce for the United States calling for the \n \n4 The original FSIA also contained exceptions for certain actions in-\nvolving maritime liens, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(b), and certain counterclaims, \nid. \u00a7 1607. \n\n25 \n \nrecognition \nand \nenforcement \nof \narbitral \nawards,\u201d id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B), \n\uf0b7 \u201cthe underlying claim, save for the agreement \nto arbitrate, could have been brought in a \nUnited States court under this section or sec-\ntion 1607,\u201d id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(C), or  \n\uf0b7 \u201c[the waiver exception in \u00a7 1605(a)(1)] is other-\nwise applicable.\u201d  Id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(D). \nThese indirect connections with the United States often \nwould not satisfy a due-process-style minimum-contacts \ntest.  For example, \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B)\u2019s treaty provision, \nwhich supported jurisdiction here, applies regardless of \nany purposeful activity by the judgment debtor directed \nat the United States.  See Ford Motor Co. v. Montana \nEighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. 351, 359 (2021) (minimum \ncontacts with the forum \u201cmust be the defendant\u2019s own \nchoice and not random, isolated, or fortuitous\u201d) (citation \nand internal quotation marks omitted). \nThe arbitration exception was rooted in Congress\u2019s \nview that when a foreign state agrees to arbitrate in one of \nthe four covered circumstances it waives immunity and \nconsents to jurisdiction to enforce any resulting award in \nU.S. courts.  While \u201ca number of courts had interpreted \nagreements to arbitrate as implied waivers of immunity\u201d \nunder the original FSIA waiver exception, 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(1), \u201cother courts had disagreed with this inter-\npretation.\u201d  Halverson, supra, at 124, 177; see also id. at \n177 n.263 (collecting cases).  The arbitration exception \n\u201cwas designed to resolve this conflict between courts, and \nto comply with the United States\u2019s obligations under in-\nternational agreements relating to the recognition and en-\nforcement of foreign arbitral awards.\u201d  Id. at 124.5     \n \n5 The legislative history confirms Congress intended to clarify that a \nforeign state\u2019s agreement to arbitrate amounts to a waiver of sover-\neign immunity in subsequent suits to enforce the arbitral award.  See \n\n26 \n \nThe terrorism exception\u2014enacted in 1996\u2014likewise \nrequires only attenuated connections with the United \nStates.  That exception authorizes jurisdiction where a \nstate sponsor of terrorism commits specified acts against \na victim who is a U.S. national, armed-forces member, or \ngovernment employee or contractor.  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605A(a)(1), (2)(A)(i)-(ii).  The exception applies regard-\nless of where the terrorist attack occurred or if it had any \ndirect effects in the United States.  Because \u201cthe only re-\nquired link between the defendant nation and the territory \nof the United States is the nationality of the claimant,\u201d the \nterrorism exception \u201callows personal jurisdiction to be \nmaintained over defendants in circumstances that do not \nappear to satisfy the \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 requirement of \nthe Due Process Clause.\u201d  Price v. Socialist People\u2019s Lib-\nyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 90 (D.C. Cir. 2002); see \nWalden, 571 U.S. at 286 (\u201cDue process requires that a de-\nfendant be haled into court in a forum State based on his \nown affiliation with the State, not based on the random, \nfortuitous, or attenuated contacts he makes by interacting \nwith other persons affiliated with the State.\u201d) (citation and \ninternal quotation marks omitted).   \nThe FSIA\u2019s text, structure, and history therefore re-\nveal that Congress prescribed the requisite degree of U.S. \ncontacts in each immunity exception, rather than through \nthe long-arm provision.  And Congress made a range of \npolicy judgments about the type of contacts\u2014and their \n \n134 Cong. Rec. 32328 (1988) (statement of Rep. Moorhead) (Congress \namended the FSIA to ensure that foreign states could not use sover-\neign immunity \u201cto frustrate the effect [of] an agreement to arbitrate \nor to interfere with the enforcement of an arbitral award entered \nagainst a foreign state.\u201d); 132 Cong. Rec. 28000 (1986) (statement of \nSen. Lugar) (Congress sought to \u201cgive more explicit guidance to \njudges in dealing with these issues\u201d and \u201cperfect the [FSIA] to pro-\nvide explicitly for the enforcement of arbitral agreements or \nawards.\u201d). \n\n27 \n \nrelatedness to the underlying suit\u2014that are necessary to \nsustain jurisdiction under the various exceptions.  When \nCongress sought to facilitate arbitration enforcement or \nvindicate the rights of terrorism victims, it determined \nthat attenuated U.S. contacts were sufficient to support \njurisdiction.  Congress\u2019s decision to require substantial, \nsuit-related contacts for some exceptions but not others \nshows that its choices were intentional.  Russello v. United \nStates, 464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983) (\u201cWhere Congress includes \nparticular language in one section of a statute but omits it \nin another section of the same Act, it is generally pre-\nsumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in \nthe disparate inclusion or exclusion.\u201d) (cleaned up).  And \nCongress\u2019s aim to \u201cestablish[] a comprehensive frame-\nwork\u201d for \u201cexercis[ing] jurisdiction over * * * foreign \nstate[s],\u201d Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, Inc., 504 U.S. \n607, 610 (1992), weighs heavily against inserting an over-\narching constitutional test without clear textual warrant.  \nConsequently, the Ninth Circuit erred by failing to \u201cresist \n[Antrix\u2019s] suggestion to read [minimum contacts] lan-\nguage into\u201d the FSIA\u2019s long-arm provision when Congress \ndeclined to include it.  Republic of Sudan, 587 U.S. at 12. \n4. Every other court of appeals has correctly held that \nthe FSIA\u2019s long-arm provision does not impose a mini-\nmum-contacts requirement.  These courts instead enforce \nthe FSIA\u2019s command that personal jurisdiction is coexten-\nsive with the Act\u2019s immunity exceptions.  The D.C. Circuit \nhas squarely held that the long-arm \u201cprovision clearly ex-\npresses the decision of the Congress to confer upon the \nfederal courts personal jurisdiction over a properly served \nforeign state\u2014and hence its agent\u2014coextensive with the \nexceptions to foreign sovereign immunity in the FSIA.\u201d  \nTMR Energy Ltd. v. State Prop. Fund of Ukraine, 411 \nF.3d 296, 303 (D.C. Cir. 2005).  The Second, Seventh, and \nEleventh Circuits agree.  Gater Assets Ltd. v. AO Mol-\ndovagaz, 2 F.4th 42, 49 (2d Cir. 2021); Abelesz v. Magyar \n\n28 \n \nNemzeti Bank, 692 F.3d 661, 694 (7th Cir. 2012); S & Davis \nInt\u2019l, Inc. v. Republic of Yemen, 218 F.3d 1292, 1303 (11th \nCir. 2000).  In short, \u201c[e]very circuit that has analyzed the \nFSIA has refused to find a statutory minimum-contacts \nrequirement under \u00a7 1330(b),\u201d while \u201cthe Ninth Circuit \nstands alone.\u201d  Pet. App. 58a, 66a (Bumatay, J.). \nB. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach overrides the FSIA\u2019s \nclear text \nRather than enforcing the long-arm provision\u2019s unam-\nbiguous statutory text, the court below followed the rule \narticulated in Thomas P. Gonzalez Corp. v. Consejo \nNacional De Produccion De Costa Rica, 614 F.2d 1247, \n1255 (9th Cir. 1980), requiring that personal jurisdiction \nover a foreign state must comport with the minimum-con-\ntacts standard.  Pet. App. 4a.  In a case involving the \nFSIA\u2019s \ncommercial-activity \nexception, \n28 \nU.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(2), the Gonzalez court observed that \u201c[t]he \nwords \u2018direct effect\u2019 in [that] clause * * * have been inter-\npreted as embodying the minimum contacts standard of\u201d \nInternational Shoe Co. v. Washington, 326 U.S. 310 (1945), \nand its progeny.  614 F.2d at 1255.  The court then declared \nthat \u201c[t]he legislative history of the Act confirms that the \nreach of \u00a7 1330(b)\u201d\u2014the FSIA\u2019s long-arm provision\u2014\n\u201cdoes not extend beyond the limits set by the International \nShoe line of cases.\u201d  Ibid.  \u201cBased on these flimsy data \npoints, \nGonzalez \nbroadly \nproclaimed: \n\u2018Personal \njurisdiction under the Act requires satisfaction of the \ntraditional minimum contacts standard.\u2019\u201d  Pet. App. 57a \n(Bumatay, J.) (quoting 614 F.2d at 1255). \nGonzalez violated a cardinal rule of statutory interpre-\ntation.  When the text is unambiguous, resort to legislative \nhistory is prohibited.  Matal v. Tam, 582 U.S. 218, 232-233 \n(2017) (\u201c[O]ur inquiry into the meaning of the statute\u2019s \ntext ceases when the statutory language is unambiguous,\u201d \nand \u201cresort to legislative history * * * [is not] \n\n29 \n \nappropriate.\u201d) (citation and internal quotation marks \nomitted).  Gonzalez therefore \u201cis a relic from a bygone era \nof statutory construction.\u201d  See Food Mktg. Inst. v. Argus \nLeader Media, 588 U.S. 427, 437 (2019) (citation and inter-\nnal quotation marks omitted).  In any case, Gonzalez\u2019s ra-\ntionale fails on its own terms. \nFirst, Gonzalez illogically reasoned that because the \ncommercial-activity exception, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(2), sup-\nposedly contains a minimum-contacts test, then the long-\narm provision must impose that test for all other FSIA ex-\nceptions.6  But the commercial-activity exception is just \none of many exceptions that provide subject-matter and \npersonal jurisdiction when satisfied.  Each immunity ex-\nception must be interpreted according to its own text.  \nHolding that the commercial-activity exception \u201ccreates a \nuniversal minimum-contacts requirement for \u00a7 1330(b)\u201d \nand all exercises of personal jurisdiction \u201cmakes no textual \nsense.\u201d  Pet. App. 58a (Bumatay, J.).   \nSecond, the cited legislative history merely asserted \nthat \u201c[t]he requirements of minimum jurisdictional \n \n6 Gonzalez\u2019s premise that the \u201cdirect effect\u201d element of the commer-\ncial-activity exception \u201cembod[ies] the minimum contacts standard\u201d is \nalso questionable.  614 F.2d at 1255.  In Republic of Argentina v. Wel-\ntover, Inc., 504 U.S. 607 (1992), this Court declined to resolve whether \nthe \u201cdirect effect\u201d element of the commercial-activity exception incor-\nporates the minimum-contacts test, id. at 619-620, but it did \u201creject \nthe suggestion that \u00a7 1605(a)(2) contains any unexpressed require-\nment of \u2018substantiality\u2019 or \u2018foreseeability,\u2019\u201d id. at 618.  Since Weltover, \nat least one court has held that the \u201cdirect effect\u201d element of the com-\nmercial-activity exception does not incorporate the minimum-contacts \ntest.  Rote v. Zel Custom Mfg. LLC, 816 F.3d 383, 392-395 (6th Cir. \n2016); see also id. at 395 & n.8 (\u201c[T]he Ninth Circuit\u2019s approach, in this \npost-Weltover period, is not persuasive,\u201d and that court \u201cstand[s] \nalone in expressly incorporating the \u2018minimum contacts\u2019 test whole-\nsale.\u201d).  And the Seventh Circuit has similarly held that \u201cthe \u2018commer-\ncial activity\u2019 inquiry under the FSIA is not congruent with a general \npersonal jurisdiction inquiry.\u201d  Abelesz, 692 F.3d at 694. \n\n30 \n \ncontacts and adequate notice are embodied in the [FSIA\u2019s \nlong-arm] provision\u201d because the FSIA\u2019s enumerated im-\nmunity exceptions, which are incorporated by reference \ninto \u00a7 1330(b), require \u201csome connection between the \nlawsuit and the United States, or an express or implied \nwaiver by the foreign state of its immunity from \njurisdiction.\u201d H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 13-14.  Thus, the \nCommittee Report \u201cshows only that Congress believed \nthat the contacts set forth in the [original] immunity pro-\nvisions satisfy due-process requirements.\u201d  Rote, 816 F.3d \nat 398 (White, J., concurring) (emphasis added); see also \nPet. App. 60a (Bumatay, J.) (\u201cThe Report was just noting \nthat the FSIA\u2019s enumerated exceptions by themselves sat-\nisfy\u201d due-process requirements.).  The Report never \nclaimed that the long-arm provision superimposes a due-\nprocess-style test on immunity exceptions that contain \nwidely varying jurisdictional metrics.   \nAt most, the legislative history reflects that Congress \neffectuated its original goal of limiting the Act\u2019s reach not \nby including a minimum-contacts requirement in the long-\narm provision but by drafting enumerated exceptions that \ngenerally satisfy the due-process test.  Congress, of \ncourse, added the arbitration exception long after the \nFSIA\u2019s original enactment (and eight years after Gonza-\nlez), and that exception requires only indirect contact with \nthe United States.  See supra pp. 24-25.  The arbitration \nexception\u2019s addition \u201cmore than a decade after the Com-\nmittee Report[] mak[es] application of a minimum-con-\ntacts test here even more dubious.\u201d  Pet. App. 61a (Buma-\ntay, J.).  The enactment of the terrorism exception, which \nlikewise requires only an attenuated connection with the \nUnited States, see supra p. 26, underscores this point.  In \nadding those new exceptions, Congress did not amend the \nlong-arm provision mandating that satisfying any excep-\ntion \u201cshall\u201d establish personal jurisdiction.  Ninth Circuit \n\n31 \n \nprecedent and the judgment below override that plain \ntext. \nC. Imposing a non-textual minimum-contacts require-\nment would drastically restrict the FSIA\u2019s in-\ntended reach  \n1. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule upsets Congress\u2019s scheme \nfor allowing suit against foreign states whenever an im-\nmunity exception applies.  That is more than a procedural \nproblem; it creates deleterious real-world consequences, \neffectively immunizing sovereign wrongdoing Congress \nsought to reach.  By their plain terms, certain exceptions \nwere intended to encompass at least some conduct outside \nthe United States that does not arise out of the foreign \nstate\u2019s minimum contacts with this Nation.  For example, \nit is undisputed that Devas sought to enforce an arbitral \naward against Antrix under the New York Convention\u2014\n\u201ca treaty * * * in force for the United States calling for the \nrecognition and enforcement of arbitral awards\u201d\u2014bring-\ning Devas\u2019s suit squarely within \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B).  That \nshould have been sufficient for both subject-matter and \npersonal jurisdiction.  But the Ninth Circuit held that De-\nvas was also required to establish that the suit arose out of \nAntrix\u2019s contacts with the United States, something it \ncould not do.  Pet. App. 4a-7a.  Erecting this additional \nbarrier frustrates Congress\u2019s goal of easing the enforce-\nment of eligible arbitral awards in U.S. courts, consistent \nwith U.S. treaty obligations.  \n2. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule also thwarts plaintiffs su-\ning under the terrorism exception, which requires only a \nshowing that a state terrorism sponsor committed a ter-\nrorist act that harmed a U.S. person, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A\u2014\nregardless of whether the act occurred in the United \nStates or had any direct effects in the United States.  \nPrice, 294 F.3d at 90; Halverson, supra, at 167 (\u201cIn con-\ntrast with the exceptions to immunity listed in the 1976 \n\n32 \n \nstatute, the antiterrorism amendment has no jurisdic-\ntional nexus requirement other than a requirement that \neither the claimant or the victim be a U.S. national at the \ntime that the criminal act was perpetrated.\u201d).  Many vic-\ntims who can satisfy this exception will not also be able to \nshow that the terrorist\u2019s acts arose out of \u201csuit-related \nconduct [that] create[s] a substantial connection\u201d between \nthe defendant and the United States.  Walden, 571 U.S. at \n284.  Indeed, the typical terrorism case \u201cinvolve[s] injury \nor death having its direct effect outside U.S. territory,\u201d \nand \u201c[i]n such cases, the traditional minimum contacts \n* * * simply do not exist.\u201d Caplan, supra, at 411-412; see \nalso Pet. App. 47a (Bumatay, J.) (\u201cSo victims of terrorism, \nthose harmed by violations of international law, and per-\nsons who suffered from torture may be barred from seek-\ning justice in our courts.\u201d).  The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule vio-\nlates \u201cone of the most basic interpretive canons, that a \nstatute should be construed so that effect is given to all its \nprovisions, so that no part will be inoperative or superflu-\nous, void or insignificant.\u201d Rubin v. Islamic Republic of \nIran, 583 U.S. 202, 213 (2018).   \n3. The Ninth Circuit\u2019s rule also threatens to limit the \neffectiveness of even some original FSIA exceptions.  For \nexample, the third prong of the commercial-activity excep-\ntion applies if the action is based \u201cupon an act outside the \nterritory of the United States in connection with a com-\nmercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and that act \ncauses a direct effect in the United States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(2).  It thus \u201cembrace[s] commercial conduct \nabroad having direct effects within the United States.\u201d  \nH.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 19; see Weltover, 504 U.S. at \n611.  This Court and others have resisted holding that the \nmere U.S. \u201cdirect effect\u201d of an overseas action in connec-\ntion with overseas commerce necessarily satisfies the min-\nimum-contacts test.  See Weltover, 504 U.S. at 617-620; su-\npra p. 29 n.6.  Indeed, even when a defendant \u201cdirect[s] his \n\n33 \n \nconduct\u201d at plaintiffs in the forum, \u201c[t]he proper question \nis not where the plaintiff experienced a particular injury \nor effect but whether the defendant\u2019s conduct connects \nhim to the forum in a meaningful way.\u201d  Walden, 571 U.S. \nat 289-290.  \nSimilarly, the expropriation exception permits suit \nwhen the expropriated property or property exchanged \nfor it is (1) \u201cpresent in the United States in connection with \na commercial activity carried on in the United States by \nthe foreign state\u201d or (2) \u201cis owned or operated by an \nagency or instrumentality of the foreign state and that \nagency or instrumentality is engaged in a commercial ac-\ntivity in the United States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(3).  This \nexception requires \u201ca nexus between the disputed prop-\nerty and a defendant\u2019s commercial activity in the United \nStates,\u201d Simon v. Republic of Hungary, 77 F.4th 1077, \n1115 (D.C. Cir. 2023), cert. granted, 144 S. Ct. 2680 (2024), \nand cert. denied sub nom. Friedman v. Republic of Hun-\ngary, 144 S. Ct. 2686 (2024), but it requires neither that the \nsuit arise out of the defendant\u2019s commercial activity in the \nUnited States nor that the act of expropriation have a con-\nnection to such commercial activity.  See Cassirer v. King-\ndom of Spain, 616 F.3d 1019, 1033 (9th Cir. 2010) (en banc) \n(holding that second clause of expropriation exception \ndoes not require specific-jurisdiction-type nexus between \nthe commercial activity and the suit).  While \u00a7 1605(a)(3) \n\u201ccontemplates suits regarding exterritorial takings so \nlong as the nexus requirement in the exception is satis-\nfied,\u201d Comparelli v. Republica Bolivariana De Venezuela, \n891 F.3d 1311, 1325 (11th Cir. 2018), the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \nminimum-contacts requirement would limit the expropri-\nation exception to rare instances where the expropriation \narose out of meaningful, U.S.-directed activity by the for-\neign-state defendant.  This outcome would foreclose heart-\nland nationalization cases that have been litigated under \nthe expropriation exception.  See id. at 1316-1317 \n\n34 \n \n(Venezuela\u2019s seizure of company and assets located in that \ncountry); see also H.R. Rep. No. 94-1487, at 19-20 (\u201cThe \nterm \u2018taken in violation of international law\u2019 would include \nthe nationalization or expropriation of property without \npayment of the prompt adequate and effective compensa-\ntion required by international law.\u201d). \n* \n* \n* \nThe Court should enforce the text of the FSIA\u2019s long-\narm provision, which makes personal jurisdiction conso-\nnant with the absence of immunity and the existence of \nsubject-matter jurisdiction.  That approach\u2014which lower \ncourts besides the Ninth Circuit have consistently ap-\nplied\u2014honors the political branches\u2019 comprehensive judg-\nment about when foreign states may be sued in U.S. \ncourts. \nII. THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE DOES NOT REQUIRE A \nMINIMUM-CONTACTS ANALYSIS FOR SUITS AGAINST \nFOREIGN STATES \nA. The judgment below rests on Ninth Circuit prece-\ndent holding that the FSIA imposes a minimum-contacts \ntest for personal jurisdiction.  Pet. App. 3a-5a; see Gonza-\nlez, 614 F.2d at 1255.  The court of appeals did not address \nwhether the Due Process Clause independently entitles \nAntrix to a minimum-contacts analysis.  If Antrix raises \nthe Due Process Clause as an alternative ground for affir-\nmance, this Court should remand that issue after revers-\ning the Ninth Circuit\u2019s erroneous construction of the \nFSIA.  See United States v. Oakland Cannabis Buyers\u2019 \nCoop., 532 U.S. 483, 494 (2001) (\u201cNor do we consider the \nunderlying constitutional issues today.  Because the Court \nof Appeals did not address these claims, we decline to do \nso in the first instance.\u201d).  After all, this Court\u2019s \u201cusual \npractice [is not] to adjudicate either legal or predicate fac-\ntual questions in the first instance.\u201d  CRST Van Expe-\ndited, Inc. v. EEOC, 578 U.S. 419, 435 (2016).    \n\n35 \n \nNor is the Due Process Clause relevant to the proper \ninterpretation of the FSIA.  Even if that clause arguably \nrequired a minimum-contacts analysis for foreign states, \nconstitutional-avoidance principles would not authorize \nadding a minimum-contacts test to the FSIA.  That is be-\ncause the Court may avoid constitutional issues solely \nwhen a \u201cplausible construction\u201d with an \u201carguable statu-\ntory foundation\u201d is available.  Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 \nU.S. 281, 296-297 (2018).  Only an impermissible \u201cre-\nwrit[ing]\u201d of the FSIA could insert a minimum-contacts \ntest into the long-arm provision.  Id. at 298.  The Court \nshould therefore construe the Act according to its terms \nand remand the constitutional question for the court of ap-\npeals to address in the first instance.  See id. at 312 (fol-\nlowing this course). \nB. In any event, the Due Process Clause cannot aid \nAntrix because a foreign state is not a \u201cperson\u201d for pur-\nposes of that clause.  Even if it were, the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause, which applies here\u2014unlike \nthe Fourteenth\u2019s\u2014does not impose a minimum-contacts \ntest for personal jurisdiction.  And, finally, the FSIA\u2019s ar-\nbitration exception satisfies any applicable due-process \ntest because it validly deems a foreign state to have con-\nsented to personal jurisdiction when it agreed to arbitrate. \n1. In the wake of Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, \nInc., 504 U.S. 607 (1992), every circuit has held that foreign \nstates are not \u201cpersons\u201d protected by the Due Process \nClause.  Pet. App. 9a-10a (Miller, J.), 62a (Bumatay, J.).  In \nWeltover, \u201cArgentina argue[d] that a finding of jurisdic-\ntion in this case would violate the Due Process Clause of \nthe Fifth Amendment.\u201d  504 U.S. at 619.  Finding it unnec-\nessary to reach that issue, the Court \u201c[a]ssum[ed], without \ndeciding, that a foreign state is a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of \nthe Due Process Clause.\u201d  Ibid.  But, by citing South Car-\nolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323-324 (1966), for the \nproposition that \u201cStates of the Union are not \u2018persons\u2019 for \n\n36 \n \npurposes of the Due Process Clause,\u201d ibid., the Court \n\u201cstrongly hinted\u201d at its views on the personhood of foreign \nstates, Pet. App. 62a (Bumatay, J.).  This Court\u2019s signal in \nWeltover followed from its earlier explanation that \u201cfor-\neign sovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity \non the part of the United States, * * * not a restriction im-\nposed by the Constitution.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 486. \nThe courts of appeals followed this Court\u2019s suggestion.  \nA decade after Weltover, the D.C. Circuit held that \u201cfor-\neign states are not \u2018persons\u2019 protected by the Fifth \nAmendment\u201d and therefore have no right to a minimum-\ncontacts analysis in determining personal jurisdiction.  \nPrice, 294 F.3d at 96.  First, as a textual matter, \u201cin com-\nmon usage, the term \u2018person\u2019 does not include the sover-\neign.\u201d  Ibid. (quoting Will v. Michigan Dep\u2019t of State Po-\nlice, 491 U.S. 58, 64 (1989)).  Second, if the word \u201cperson\u201d \nin the Due Process Clause does not encompass the States \nof the Union, see Katzenbach, 383 U.S. at 323-324, then \n\u201cabsent some compelling reason to treat foreign \nsovereigns more favorably than \u2018States of the Union,\u2019 it \nwould make no sense to view foreign states as \u2018persons\u2019 \nunder the Due Process Clause,\u201d Price, 294 F.3d at 96.  In-\ndeed, \u201c[i]t would be highly incongruous to afford greater \nFifth Amendment rights to foreign nations, who are en-\ntirely alien to our constitutional system, than are afforded \nto the states, who help make up the very fabric of that sys-\ntem.\u201d  Ibid.  Third, looking to \u201chistory and tradition,\u201d \n\u201c[n]ever has [this] Court suggested that foreign nations \nenjoy rights derived from the Constitution\u201d; \u201c[r]ather, the \nfederal judiciary has relied on principles of comity and in-\nternational law to protect foreign governments in the \nAmerican legal system.\u201d  Id. at 97.  Lastly, \u201cserious prac-\ntical problems might arise\u201d if \u201cforeign states may cloak \nthemselves in the protections of the Due Process \nClause\u201d\u2014among other things, \u201cthe power of Congress and \nthe President to freeze the assets of foreign nations, or to \n\n37 \n \nimpose economic sanctions on them, could be challenged \nas deprivations of property without due process of law.\u201d  \nId. at 99.   \nFor these reasons, the D.C. Circuit concluded that \n\u201c[n]either the text of the Constitution, Supreme Court de-\ncisions construing the Due Process Clause, nor long stand-\ning tradition provide a basis for extending the reach of this \nconstitutional provision for the benefit of foreign states.\u201d  \nIbid.  Other circuits concurred.  The Second Circuit held \nthat \u201cforeign states do not enjoy due process protections \nfrom the exercise of the judicial power because foreign \nstates, like U.S. states, are not \u2018persons\u2019 for the purposes \nof the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Gater Assets, 2 F.4th at 49.  \nThe Seventh Circuit \u201cagree[d]\u201d with the D.C. and Second \nCircuits that \u201cforeign states are not \u2018persons\u2019 entitled to \nrights under the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Abelesz, 692 F.3d \nat 694. \nNo court of appeals has deviated from the post-Wel-\ntover \u201cconsensus\u201d that \u201cforeign states are not entitled to \nthe protections of the Due Process Clause.\u201d  Pet. App. 62a \n(Bumatay, J.).  That conclusion is compellingly reasoned, \nsupported by original meaning, and correct in every re-\nspect.  See id. at 61a-65a; see also Childress III, Question-\ning the Constitutional Rights of Foreign Nations, 88 Ford-\nham L. Rev. Online 60, 70 (2019) (\u201cIt seems unlikely that \nthe framers of the Fifth Amendment would have viewed \nforeign states as persons given that foreign sovereigns \nwere treated as completely immune from suit at the time \nof the founding.\u201d); Glannon & Atik, Politics and Personal \nJurisdiction: Suing State Sponsors of Terrorism under the \n1996 Amendments to the Foreign Sovereign Immunities \nAct, 87 Geo. L.J. 675, 692 (1999) (\u201cIf * * * the assertion of \njurisdiction against a foreign sovereign was unimaginable, \nit is very difficult to argue that the framers intended that \nforeign sovereigns would require the protection of the \nFifth Amendment.\u201d); Damrosch, Foreign States and the \n\n38 \n \nConstitution, 73 Va. L. Rev. 483, 521-522 (1987) (Because \nforeign states and the United States have always inter-\nacted as juridical equals, \u201cit would have been inconceivable \n[to the Founders] for foreign states to claim entrenched \nrights under a constitutional law to which they were in no \nway subject.\u201d).  Thus, in the unlikely event the Court were \nto resolve a \u201csplitless\u201d issue in the first instance, it should \naffirm the district court\u2019s holding that foreign states are \nnot \u201cpersons\u201d under the Due Process Clause.  See Pet. \nApp. 13a-14a.   \n2. Even if foreign states are persons for purposes of \nthe Due Process Clause, minimum contacts would not be \nrequired under the Fifth Amendment.7  Rather, \u201cthe orig-\ninal understanding of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process \nClause\u201d conveyed that \u201cthe political branches may dictate \nwhat process is afforded to foreign sovereigns.\u201d  Pet. App. \n65a (Bumatay, J.); see also id. at 65a-66a.  This Court has \nreserved judgment on \u201cwhether the Fifth Amendment im-\nposes the same restrictions on the exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction by a federal court\u201d as the Fourteenth Amend-\nment does on a state court.  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. \nSuperior Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); see also J. \nMcIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 884 (2011) \n(plurality op.) (\u201cBecause the United States is a distinct \nsovereign, a defendant may in principle be subject to the \njurisdiction of the courts of the United States but not of \nany particular State.\u201d).  Even so, \u201can emerging consensus \nshows that,\u201d as originally understood, the Fifth Amend-\nment does not impose minimum-contacts limits on per-\nsonal jurisdiction, especially as to \u201cforeign-based \n \n7 The Fifth Amendment\u2014not the Fourteenth\u2014applies here because \nservice of process is authorized by a federal statute.  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n4(k)(1)(C); Gater Assets, 2 F.4th at 54 & n.5; cf. Weltover, 504 U.S. at \n619. \n \n\n39 \n \ndefendants.\u201d  Pet. App. 65a-66a (Bumatay, J.). \nAs Professor Sachs has explained, \u201c[f]or the first 150 \nyears of the Republic, today\u2019s conventional view of per-\nsonal jurisdiction wasn\u2019t so conventional.  Though the \nearly Congress refrained from exercising its full powers, \nthe recognized doctrines of jurisdiction worked very dif-\nferently for state and federal courts.\u201d  Sachs, The Unlim-\nited Jurisdiction of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. \n1703, 1706 (2020).  In those early days, congressional \npower to set the boundaries of a federal court\u2019s personal \njurisdiction was thought to be unlimited.  Ibid.; see also id. \nat 1710-1727.  As Justice Story opined, Congress pos-\nsesses authority to have \u201ca subject of England, or France, \nor Russia, having a controversy with one of our own citi-\nzens, * * * summoned from the other end of the globe to \nobey our process, and submit to the judgment of our \ncourts.\u201d  Picquet v. Swan, 19 F. Cas. 609, 613 (C.C.D. \nMass. 1828) (No. 11,134).  In other words, \u201cforeign-based \ndefendants were owed no more than service authorized by \nCongress before being haled into our federal courts.\u201d  Pet. \nApp. 66a (Bumatay, J.).     \nLeading scholars agree that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause was not understood in 1791 to limit a \nfederal court\u2019s ability to exercise jurisdiction over foreign \ndefendants or adjudicate disputes arising outside the Na-\ntion\u2019s borders.  See Crema & Solum, The Original Mean-\ning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amendment, 108 \nVa. L. Rev. 447, 508-510 (2022).  That is because \u201c[t]he \nFifth Amendment bars the execution of a federal judg-\nment only if the federal court lacked jurisdiction.  And \nCongress gets to answer that latter question * * *.\u201d  Sachs, \nsupra, at 1743.   \nSeveral appellate judges have also persuasively urged \nthis view of the Fifth Amendment.  See Fuld v. Palestine \nLiberation Org., 101 F.4th 190, 217 (2d Cir. 2024) \n(Menashi, J., dissenting from denial of rehearing en banc) \n\n40 \n \n(collecting cases), pets. for cert. filed, No. 24-20 (July 3, \n2024) and No. 24-151 (Aug. 8, 2024); see also Pet. App. 65a-\n66a (Bumatay, J.).  Whatever the Fourteenth Amendment \nrequires, it is \u201call backwards\u201d to import those later en-\nacted limits on a state court\u2019s personal jurisdiction into an \namendment that \u201ccame first\u201d and applies to federal courts.  \nSachs, supra, at 1706.  Because Congress authorized FSIA \njurisdiction whenever proper service and an immunity ex-\nception are satisfied, the Fifth Amendment imposes no \nfurther restraints on personal jurisdiction.   \n3. Lastly, even if the Fifth Amendment inde-\npendently restrains personal jurisdiction over foreign \nstates, minimum contacts still would not generally be re-\nquired for FSIA suits.  \u201cBecause the requirement of per-\nsonal jurisdiction represents first of all an individual right, \nit can, like other such rights, be waived.\u201d  Ins. Corp. of Ire-\nland, Ltd. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. \n694, 703 (1982).  And \u201c[a] variety of legal arrangements\u201d \ncan \u201crepresent express or implied consent to the personal \njurisdiction of the court.\u201d  Ibid.  Just two Terms ago, the \nCourt reiterated that \u201cconsent may be manifested in vari-\nous ways by word or deed,\u201d and reaffirmed that using con-\nsent \u201cto ground personal jurisdiction\u201d is entirely con-\nsistent with due process.  Mallory, 600 U.S. at 138 (plural-\nity op.). \nThe FSIA\u2019s arbitration exception validly deems for-\neign states to have consented to jurisdiction based on their \nown clearly defined, voluntary actions.  See supra pp. 24-\n25.  In Mallory, the Court rejected a due-process challenge \nto a Pennsylvania law that deemed out-of-state corpora-\ntions to have consented to personal jurisdiction by regis-\ntering to do business in the state.  600 U.S. at 126-127.  \nLikewise, the arbitration exception deems foreign states \nthat have voluntarily entered into arbitration agreements \nto have consented to subsequent actions to enforce the re-\nsulting arbitral awards.  That congressional judgment is \n\n41 \n \nneither unfair nor unreasonable.  Indeed, permitting a for-\neign state to avoid confirmation after having agreed to ar-\nbitration would reinstate the very abuse that Congress \nsought to stop through the arbitration exception.  See su-\npra p. 25 & n.5.  Nothing in the Constitution prohibits the \nwaiver-based approach to personal jurisdiction reflected \nin the FSIA\u2019s arbitration exception. \n* \n* \n* \nIf the Court reaches the due-process issue in the first \ninstance, it should hold that the Constitution does not im-\npose a minimum-contacts requirement on suits brought \nagainst foreign states under the FSIA.  \nCONCLUSION \nThe Court should reverse the judgment of the United \nStates Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. \n \nVERN CASSIN \nBAKER BOTTS L.L.P. \n700 K Street, N.W. \nWashington, DC 20001 \n(202) 639-7700 \nRespectfully submitted.\nAARON M.

I do not yet have any information on the specific statutory language of the FSIA being debated, the key precedents each side will rely on, or the particular facts of the dispute between Devas and Antrix that might influence the Court's decision.

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has advanced significantly. I previously knew only the central legal question: whether the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) requires a separate constitutional \"minimum contacts\" analysis for personal jurisdiction over a foreign state. The petitioner's brief has now provided a comprehensive roadmap of the arguments for reversal.\n\nMy belief is that the petitioner, Devas, will advance a two-pronged argument, one statutory and one constitutional:\n1.  **Statutory Argument (Textualism):** The core of the petitioner's case rests on the plain text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b), which states: \"Personal jurisdiction over a foreign state **shall exist** as to every claim for relief over which the district courts have jurisdiction under subsection (a) where service has been made under section 1608 of this title.\" The petitioner argues this language is a mandatory, formulaic command. If subject-matter jurisdiction exists (because an FSIA immunity exception applies) and service is proper, then personal jurisdiction is automatically established. The Ninth Circuit, in their view, improperly \"engrafted\" a non-textual minimum-contacts requirement onto this clear statutory framework, likely by misinterpreting legislative history.\n2.  **Constitutional Argument (Inapplicability of Due Process):** As a fallback, the petitioner argues that the entire minimum-contacts doctrine, which stems from the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment, does not apply to foreign states. The brief asserts that foreign sovereigns are not \"persons\" entitled to such constitutional protections in U.S. courts. Instead, the decision to subject a foreign state to suit is a matter of \"grace and comity\" entrusted to the political branches (Congress and the President), who exercised this power by enacting the FSIA. Key precedents cited for this view include *Verlinden B.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria*.\n\nI have also learned that the petitioner will frame the Ninth Circuit's position as an outlier, noting that no other court of appeals has adopted it. They will also raise the policy concern that the Ninth Circuit's rule would undermine the FSIA's intent by closing courthouse doors in other important cases, such as those involving state-sponsored terrorism or property expropriation, where an FSIA exception is met but traditional minimum contacts may be absent. My understanding of the petitioner's case has moved from zero to a detailed, structured view of their legal strategy.",
          "design_beliefs": "My initial design belief was a foundational heuristic: **When beginning analysis of a Supreme Court case, the most effective initial action is to consult primary source documents, specifically the briefs on the merits filed by the parties.** This observation has provided powerful confirmation of this heuristic's effectiveness.\n\nThe petitioner's brief was an extremely high-yield source of information. It single-handedly provided the specific statutory text at issue (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b)), the primary legal theories (textualism, constitutional inapplicability), the key precedents (*Verlinden*, *Weltover*), and the policy arguments that will frame the debate. This \"bottom-up\" approach of starting with the litigant's own arguments has proven far more efficient than a broad, unfocused search for secondary analysis would have been.\n\nBased on this success, I can now refine and expand my core strategy. The initial heuristic is validated and should be retained. The logical next step is to apply it to the opposing side. My updated design belief is now more procedural: **The most efficient path to modeling the legal conflict in a Supreme Court case is to sequentially analyze the primary briefs in a specific order: (1) the Petitioner's Brief on the Merits to understand the arguments for reversal, followed by (2) the Respondent's Brief on the Merits to understand the counter-arguments, and then (3) the Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae (if filed), as the government's view on a federal statute's interpretation is highly influential.** This structured approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of the direct legal clash before seeking outside analysis."

Successfully obtaining and leveraging this brief will provide strong evidence for the validity and efficiency of this core procedural heuristic. It also reinforces the value of the meta-cognitive check that identified this as the next logical step, thus refining my overall strategic approach. The gain is high, though not 1.0, as it is primarily confirmatory of an existing hypothesis rather than discovering a new one.\n\nThe Joint EIG is exceptionally high because the action is simultaneously optimal for the immediate task and highly informative for my long-term strategy.",

The design beliefs show advanced meta-cognitive strategy, including validation of heuristics, a structured sequential approach, and a newly articulated meta-cognitive checkpoint, indicating high-level strategic reasoning.

Ltd. (Antrix) is a company \norganized under the laws of the Republic of India. An-\ntrix is owned by the Indian Government but is a \u201csep-\narate legal person,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(1), and is gov-\nerned by a board that is evenly divided between inde-\npendent directors and governmental directors. Peti-\ntioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (Devas), also an \nIndian company, brought an arbitration claim against \nAntrix in India. Devas claimed Antrix breached a con-\ntract relating to the launch of satellites from India and \nthe provision of wireless services in India. Applying In-\ndian law, the tribunal seated in India ruled in favor of \nDevas. Antrix moved, in India, to set aside the award. \nWhile Indian set-aside proceedings were pending, \nDevas sued Antrix in the United States, seeking to \nconfirm the same award (which the Indian courts sub-\nsequently annulled). Devas asserted jurisdiction over \nAntrix based on the arbitration exception to the For-\neign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).  \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether the arbitration exception to the FSIA, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6), akin to other immunity-stripping \nprovisions of the Act, requires a plaintiff to establish a \nconnection between the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement \nand the United States to support the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction under the FSIA\u2019s personal-jurisdic-\ntion provision, id. \u00a7 1330(b).  \n2. Whether a corporation organized under foreign \nlaw is a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to protection under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment with respect \nto whether it may be involuntarily subjected to \u201ca \nclaim for relief in personam,\u201d id. \u00a7 1330(a), notwith-\nstanding that the corporation is classified, by statute, \nas a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the FSIA, id. \u00a7 1603(a).  \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE \n29.6 STATEMENT \n1. \nThe Petitioners in No. 23-1201 are CC/Devas \n(Mauritius) Limited; Devas Multimedia America, Inc.; \nDevas Employees Mauritius Private Limited; and Tel-\ncom Devas Mauritius Limited.

Ltd. \n(Antrix), is wholly owned by the Indian Government.  \nPetitioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (Devas) \ncontracted with Antrix to build and launch wireless-\nspectrum satellites for Devas. A dispute arose when \nthe Indian Government resolved not to allow private \nexploitation of the relevant S-band spectrum so that \nIndia could use the spectrum for national-security and \nother purposes. Antrix invoked the contract\u2019s force \nmajeure clause, cancelled the contract, and offered a \nrefund to Devas. Devas objected that Antrix was in \nbreach. Their contract selected the \u201cLaws of India\u201d as \n\u201cGoverning Law,\u201d called for dispute resolution through \narbitration, and designated \u201cNEW DELHI in India\u201d as \nthe seat of arbitration. So the parties arbitrated in In-\ndia under Indian law. The arbitrators ruled for Devas. \nAntrix then moved, in India, to invalidate the award. \nThe Indian court of competent jurisdiction set aside \nthe award. That decision achieved finality when the \nSupreme Court of India affirmed. \nThe core question here is whether any of this is \nproperly the business of U.S. courts. The Ninth Circuit \ncorrectly said \u201cno.\u201d Its judgment should be affirmed for \ntwo reasons\u2014not precisely those articulated by the \npanel below, which was bound by circuit precedent. \nThe first reason is grounded in statute. The Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) comprehensively \nregulates the jurisdiction of the federal courts over \nsovereign-owned corporations like Antrix. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a)\u2013(b) (defining \u201cforeign state\u201d to include \nsuch companies). The Act grants immunity to such \n\n2 \n \n \ncorporations unless the suit falls within one of the \nAct\u2019s express exceptions. Id. \u00a7 1604.  \nThe exception at issue here is the so-called \u201carbitra-\ntion exception.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6). This provision abro-\ngates sovereign immunity for arbitration-related civil \nactions when two relevant requirements are met. \nFirst, the parties\u2019 agreement must \u201cconcern[] a subject \nmatter capable of settlement by arbitration under the \nlaws of the United States.\u201d Id. Second, the action must \nsatisfy one of four additional provisos. Petitioners fo-\ncus on proviso (B), which applies when the \u201cagreement \nor award is or may be governed by a treaty or other \ninternational agreement in force for the United States \ncalling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral \nawards,\u201d id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B), claiming the India-only \nagreement and award fall within it. Even if so, Peti-\ntioners overlook the prior requirement that the arbi-\ntration agreement \u201cconcern[] a subject matter capable \nof settlement by arbitration under\u201d U.S. law. Id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(6). \nThat requirement wisely cabins the arbitration ex-\nception by linking its scope to domestic arbitration \nlaw. And the basic domestic rule is that U.S. arbitra-\ntion law extends only to matters involving American \n\u201ccommerce\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201ccommerce among\u201d or \u201cbetween\u201d the \nStates or Territories or \u201cbetween\u201d the States or Terri-\ntories and a \u201cforeign nation.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.  \nNotably absent from this governing definition of \n\u201ccommerce\u201d is any hint that Congress intended our ar-\nbitration law to govern purely foreign commerce. Nat-\nurally not\u2014the ordinary presumption is that Congress \nwrites laws to govern the United States, not the world. \nThat principle indisputably animates the other FSIA \nexceptions, each of which requires \u201csome form of sub-\nstantial contact with the United States.\u201d Verlinden \n\n3 \n \n \nB.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 490 (1983); \nsee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605A, 1605B (conferring juris-\ndiction over claims for terroristic injuries in the U.S. \nor to certain U.S. persons). Congress legislated with \nthat same comity principle in mind when it addressed \narbitration. A second longstanding comity-infused rule \nof construction is aligned: statutes abrogating sover-\neign immunity are read narrowly, with any ambiguity \nconstrued in favor of preserving immunity.  \nThe second basis for affirmance is constitutional. \nAntrix is a foreign corporation. Devas sought to have a \nU.S. court exercise jurisdiction over Antrix on a \u201cclaim \nfor relief in personam,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a), based on a \ndispute between Indian parties over a contract negoti-\nated in India for performance in India. That effort \nclearly violates due process. In path-marking decisions \nlike Helicopteros and Daimler, this Court affirmed \nthat foreign corporations may object under the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause to the asser-\ntion of jurisdiction by state courts. The same is true for \nthe Fifth Amendment and federal courts. In Omni \nCapital International, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 \nU.S. 97, 104 (1987), a case involving \u201ca British corpo-\nration with its offices in London,\u201d this Court explained \nthat before a district court \u201cmay exercise personal ju-\nrisdiction over a defendant,\u201d \u201ca constitutionally suffi-\ncient relationship between the defendant and the fo-\nrum must exist.\u201d Id. at 99, 104. \nThat rule settles this case. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly concluded that Antrix has no purposeful, rele-\nvant contacts with the United States and that estab-\nlished due-process principles therefore do not permit \nexercise of personal jurisdiction over Antrix.  \nNor did Antrix consent to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States. A sovereign-immunity waiver must be \n\n4 \n \n \n\u201cclear.\u201d C & L Enters., Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi \nIndian Tribe, 532 U.S. 411, 418 (2001).  Antrix\u2019s agree-\nment to arbitrate in India (and under the \u201cLaws of In-\ndia\u201d), which nowhere mentions the United States, did \nnot waive any objection to personal jurisdiction here. \nAnd, contrary to the Solicitor General, the agreement \ndid not waive Antrix\u2019s due-process rights by providing \nfor confirmation of a resulting arbitral award in \n\u201ccourt[s] of competent jurisdiction.\u201d That clause (gov-\nerned by Indian law) is best read to acknowledge the \njurisdiction of competent Indian courts\u2014which have \nalready exercised their jurisdiction and determined \nthat the award cannot stand. If the Court reaches the \ndue-process question, it should affirm.  \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nA. Legal Background \n1. From the Founding until the mid-twentieth cen-\ntury, foreign states were generally granted complete \nimmunity from suit in United States courts. Verlinden, \n461 U.S. at 486. Accordingly, U.S. courts were rarely \npresented with the \u201cquestion of the jurisdiction of the \n\u2026 court over the person of a [sovereign] defendant.\u201d Ex \nparte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 587 (1943). Nev-\nertheless, it was understood that\u2014immunity aside\u2014a \nforeign sovereign and its property could be subject to \n\u201cjudicial process\u201d in U.S. court for acts in the United \nStates, just like other litigants. As Justice Story wrote:  \n[A] foreign sovereign cannot be compelled to ap-\npear in our Courts, or be made liable to their judg-\nment, so long as he remains in his own dominions, \nfor the sovereignty of each is bounded by territo-\nrial limits. If, however, he comes personally \nwithin our limits, although he generally enjoy a \n\n5 \n \n \npersonal immunity, he may become liable to judi-\ncial process. \nThe Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 283, 353 \n(1822).

Ltd. (Antrix) is a company \norganized under the laws of the Republic of India. An-\ntrix is owned by the Indian Government but is a \u201csep-\narate legal person,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(b)(1), and is gov-\nerned by a board that is evenly divided between inde-\npendent directors and governmental directors. Peti-\ntioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (Devas), also an \nIndian company, brought an arbitration claim against \nAntrix in India. Devas claimed Antrix breached a con-\ntract relating to the launch of satellites from India and \nthe provision of wireless services in India. Applying In-\ndian law, the tribunal seated in India ruled in favor of \nDevas. Antrix moved, in India, to set aside the award. \nWhile Indian set-aside proceedings were pending, \nDevas sued Antrix in the United States, seeking to \nconfirm the same award (which the Indian courts sub-\nsequently annulled). Devas asserted jurisdiction over \nAntrix based on the arbitration exception to the For-\neign Sovereign Immunities Act (FSIA).  \nThe questions presented are: \n1. Whether the arbitration exception to the FSIA, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6), akin to other immunity-stripping \nprovisions of the Act, requires a plaintiff to establish a \nconnection between the parties\u2019 arbitration agreement \nand the United States to support the exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction under the FSIA\u2019s personal-jurisdic-\ntion provision, id. \u00a7 1330(b).  \n2. Whether a corporation organized under foreign \nlaw is a \u201cperson\u201d entitled to protection under the Due \nProcess Clause of the Fifth Amendment with respect \nto whether it may be involuntarily subjected to \u201ca \nclaim for relief in personam,\u201d id. \u00a7 1330(a), notwith-\nstanding that the corporation is classified, by statute, \nas a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the FSIA, id. \u00a7 1603(a).  \n\nii \n \nPARTIES TO THE PROCEEDING AND RULE \n29.6 STATEMENT \n1. \nThe Petitioners in No. 23-1201 are CC/Devas \n(Mauritius) Limited; Devas Multimedia America, Inc.; \nDevas Employees Mauritius Private Limited; and Tel-\ncom Devas Mauritius Limited.

Ltd. \n(Antrix), is wholly owned by the Indian Government.  \nPetitioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (Devas) \ncontracted with Antrix to build and launch wireless-\nspectrum satellites for Devas. A dispute arose when \nthe Indian Government resolved not to allow private \nexploitation of the relevant S-band spectrum so that \nIndia could use the spectrum for national-security and \nother purposes. Antrix invoked the contract\u2019s force \nmajeure clause, cancelled the contract, and offered a \nrefund to Devas. Devas objected that Antrix was in \nbreach. Their contract selected the \u201cLaws of India\u201d as \n\u201cGoverning Law,\u201d called for dispute resolution through \narbitration, and designated \u201cNEW DELHI in India\u201d as \nthe seat of arbitration. So the parties arbitrated in In-\ndia under Indian law. The arbitrators ruled for Devas. \nAntrix then moved, in India, to invalidate the award. \nThe Indian court of competent jurisdiction set aside \nthe award. That decision achieved finality when the \nSupreme Court of India affirmed. \nThe core question here is whether any of this is \nproperly the business of U.S. courts. The Ninth Circuit \ncorrectly said \u201cno.\u201d Its judgment should be affirmed for \ntwo reasons\u2014not precisely those articulated by the \npanel below, which was bound by circuit precedent. \nThe first reason is grounded in statute. The Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act (FSIA) comprehensively \nregulates the jurisdiction of the federal courts over \nsovereign-owned corporations like Antrix. See 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a)\u2013(b) (defining \u201cforeign state\u201d to include \nsuch companies). The Act grants immunity to such \n\n2 \n \n \ncorporations unless the suit falls within one of the \nAct\u2019s express exceptions. Id. \u00a7 1604.  \nThe exception at issue here is the so-called \u201carbitra-\ntion exception.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6). This provision abro-\ngates sovereign immunity for arbitration-related civil \nactions when two relevant requirements are met. \nFirst, the parties\u2019 agreement must \u201cconcern[] a subject \nmatter capable of settlement by arbitration under the \nlaws of the United States.\u201d Id. Second, the action must \nsatisfy one of four additional provisos. Petitioners fo-\ncus on proviso (B), which applies when the \u201cagreement \nor award is or may be governed by a treaty or other \ninternational agreement in force for the United States \ncalling for the recognition and enforcement of arbitral \nawards,\u201d id. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B), claiming the India-only \nagreement and award fall within it. Even if so, Peti-\ntioners overlook the prior requirement that the arbi-\ntration agreement \u201cconcern[] a subject matter capable \nof settlement by arbitration under\u201d U.S. law. Id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(6). \nThat requirement wisely cabins the arbitration ex-\nception by linking its scope to domestic arbitration \nlaw. And the basic domestic rule is that U.S. arbitra-\ntion law extends only to matters involving American \n\u201ccommerce\u201d\u2014i.e., \u201ccommerce among\u201d or \u201cbetween\u201d the \nStates or Territories or \u201cbetween\u201d the States or Terri-\ntories and a \u201cforeign nation.\u201d 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1.  \nNotably absent from this governing definition of \n\u201ccommerce\u201d is any hint that Congress intended our ar-\nbitration law to govern purely foreign commerce. Nat-\nurally not\u2014the ordinary presumption is that Congress \nwrites laws to govern the United States, not the world. \nThat principle indisputably animates the other FSIA \nexceptions, each of which requires \u201csome form of sub-\nstantial contact with the United States.\u201d Verlinden \n\n3 \n \n \nB.V. v. Cent. Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 490 (1983); \nsee also 28 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 1605A, 1605B (conferring juris-\ndiction over claims for terroristic injuries in the U.S. \nor to certain U.S. persons). Congress legislated with \nthat same comity principle in mind when it addressed \narbitration. A second longstanding comity-infused rule \nof construction is aligned: statutes abrogating sover-\neign immunity are read narrowly, with any ambiguity \nconstrued in favor of preserving immunity.  \nThe second basis for affirmance is constitutional. \nAntrix is a foreign corporation. Devas sought to have a \nU.S. court exercise jurisdiction over Antrix on a \u201cclaim \nfor relief in personam,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a), based on a \ndispute between Indian parties over a contract negoti-\nated in India for performance in India. That effort \nclearly violates due process. In path-marking decisions \nlike Helicopteros and Daimler, this Court affirmed \nthat foreign corporations may object under the Four-\nteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause to the asser-\ntion of jurisdiction by state courts. The same is true for \nthe Fifth Amendment and federal courts. In Omni \nCapital International, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 \nU.S. 97, 104 (1987), a case involving \u201ca British corpo-\nration with its offices in London,\u201d this Court explained \nthat before a district court \u201cmay exercise personal ju-\nrisdiction over a defendant,\u201d \u201ca constitutionally suffi-\ncient relationship between the defendant and the fo-\nrum must exist.\u201d Id. at 99, 104. \nThat rule settles this case. The court of appeals cor-\nrectly concluded that Antrix has no purposeful, rele-\nvant contacts with the United States and that estab-\nlished due-process principles therefore do not permit \nexercise of personal jurisdiction over Antrix.  \nNor did Antrix consent to personal jurisdiction in the \nUnited States. A sovereign-immunity waiver must be \n\n4 \n \n \n\u201cclear.\u201d C & L Enters., Inc. v. Citizen Band Potawatomi \nIndian Tribe, 532 U.S. 411, 418 (2001).  Antrix\u2019s agree-\nment to arbitrate in India (and under the \u201cLaws of In-\ndia\u201d), which nowhere mentions the United States, did \nnot waive any objection to personal jurisdiction here. \nAnd, contrary to the Solicitor General, the agreement \ndid not waive Antrix\u2019s due-process rights by providing \nfor confirmation of a resulting arbitral award in \n\u201ccourt[s] of competent jurisdiction.\u201d That clause (gov-\nerned by Indian law) is best read to acknowledge the \njurisdiction of competent Indian courts\u2014which have \nalready exercised their jurisdiction and determined \nthat the award cannot stand. If the Court reaches the \ndue-process question, it should affirm.  \nSTATEMENT \nI. \nBACKGROUND \nA. Legal Background \n1. From the Founding until the mid-twentieth cen-\ntury, foreign states were generally granted complete \nimmunity from suit in United States courts. Verlinden, \n461 U.S. at 486. Accordingly, U.S. courts were rarely \npresented with the \u201cquestion of the jurisdiction of the \n\u2026 court over the person of a [sovereign] defendant.\u201d Ex \nparte Republic of Peru, 318 U.S. 578, 587 (1943). Nev-\nertheless, it was understood that\u2014immunity aside\u2014a \nforeign sovereign and its property could be subject to \n\u201cjudicial process\u201d in U.S. court for acts in the United \nStates, just like other litigants. As Justice Story wrote:  \n[A] foreign sovereign cannot be compelled to ap-\npear in our Courts, or be made liable to their judg-\nment, so long as he remains in his own dominions, \nfor the sovereignty of each is bounded by territo-\nrial limits. If, however, he comes personally \nwithin our limits, although he generally enjoy a \n\n5 \n \n \npersonal immunity, he may become liable to judi-\ncial process. \nThe Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. (7 Wheat.) 283, 353 \n(1822). The procedures required to summon a defend-\nant before a court and establish the court\u2019s jurisdiction \nover that defendant were one component of \u201cjudicial \nprocess.\u201d See Brunk, The Due Process and Other Con-\nstitutional Rights of Foreign Nations, 88 Fordham L. \nRev. 633, 674\u201375 (2019). \nInternational law was understood to circumscribe \neach nation\u2019s jurisdiction. As Professor Beale ex-\nplained, a sovereign \u201ccannot confer legal jurisdiction \non [its] courts or [its] legislature, when [the sovereign] \nhas no such jurisdiction \u2026 [under] international law.\u201d \nSee Beale, The Jurisdiction of a Sovereign State, 36 \nHarv. L. Rev. 241, 243 (1923). And international law \ngenerally restricted a sovereign\u2019s civil jurisdiction to \nits territory and its nationals: \u201cThe laws of no nation,\u201d \nJustice Story wrote, \u201ccan justly extend beyond its own \nterritories, except so far as regards its own citizens.\u201d \nThe Appollon, 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) 362, 370 (1824).  \n2. This century-and-a-half-old immunity regime \nshifted in 1952. That year, the State Department an-\nnounced it would no longer request immunity for \nfriendly sovereigns as a matter of course but would in-\nstead apply the \u201crestrictive theory\u201d of immunity. Ver-\nlinden, 461 U.S. at 487. Under that theory, \u201cimmunity \nis confined to suits involving the foreign sovereign\u2019s \npublic acts and does not extend to cases arising out of \na foreign state\u2019s strictly commercial acts.\u201d Id.  \nWhere immunity was not a barrier to suit in this pe-\nriod, courts generally assumed that foreign states and \ntheir instrumentalities enjoyed the same due-process \nprotections as non-sovereign defendants. Courts \n\n6 \n \n \nexamined whether the notice afforded to foreign states \nwas \u201cconsistent with due process.\u201d Petrol Shipping \nCorp. v. Kingdom of Greece, Ministry of Com., Pur-\nchase Directorate, 360 F.2d 103, 107 (2d Cir. 1966); see \nalso Premier S.S. Corp. v. Embassy of Alg., 336 F. \nSupp. 507, 510 (S.D.N.Y. 1971). And personal jurisdic-\ntion was found lacking over \u201cRomania, and its several \nagents and agencies\u201d because they had \u201cminimal con-\ntacts with the forum in which jurisdiction [wa]s as-\nserted.\u201d Rovin Sales Co. v. Socialist Republic of Roma-\nnia, 403 F. Supp. 1298, 1302 (N.D. Ill. 1975). \nBut this immunity regime \u201cproved troublesome.\u201d \nVerlinden, 461 U.S. at 487. \u201c[F]oreign nations often \nplaced diplomatic pressure on the State Department \nin seeking immunity,\u201d and \u201c[o]n occasion, political con-\nsiderations led to suggestions of immunity in cases \nwhere immunity would not have been available under \nthe restrictive theory.\u201d Id. In short, the immunity \nstandards \u201cwere neither clear nor uniformly applied.\u201d \nId. at 488. \n3. Congress enacted the FSIA \u201cto clarify the govern-\ning standards[] and to \u2018assur[e] litigants that \u2026 deci-\nsions are made on purely legal grounds and under pro-\ncedures that insure due process.\u2019\u201d Verlinden, 461 U.S. \nat 488 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, at 7 (1976)). The \nstatute \u201cconform[ed]\u201d U.S. practice \u201cto the practice in \nvirtually every other country\u2014where sovereign im-\nmunity decisions are made exclusively by the courts \nand not by a foreign affairs agency.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 94-\n1487, at 7. The law also made clear that a foreign, \nstate-owned corporation, though a \u201cseparate legal per-\nson,\u201d counts as a \u201cforeign state.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1603(a)\u2013\n(b). \nThe FSIA \u201ccodifies a baseline principle of immunity \nfor foreign states and their instrumentalities\u201d and \n\n7 \n \n \n\u201cthen sets out exceptions to that principle.\u201d Turkiye \nHalk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. 264, 272 \n(2023); see 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1604. The Act\u2019s original excep-\ntions cover suits involving waiver; \u201ccommercial activ-\nity\u201d in or affecting the United States; expropriation of \nproperty with a nexus to the United States; rights in \nproperty in the United States; and tortious activity oc-\ncurring in this country. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1)\u2013(5). The \nFSIA thus required waiver of immunity or \u201csome form \nof substantial contact with the United States\u201d to estab-\nlish jurisdiction over a foreign state. Verlinden, 461 \nU.S. at 490.  \nCongress added the arbitration exception in 1988. \nPub. L. No. 100-669, \u00a7 2, 102 Stat. 3969, 3969 (1988). \nUnder the exception, a court may \u201cenforce an agree-\nment made by the foreign state \u2026 to submit [disputes] \nto arbitration.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6). The court also \nmay \u201cconfirm an [arbitral] award.\u201d Id. The court\u2019s au-\nthority is limited, however, to agreements that concern \n\u201ca subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration \nunder the laws of the United States.\u201d Id. It is further \nlimited to four enumerated situations: \n\u201c(A) the arbitration takes place or is intended to \ntake place in the United States,  \n(B) the agreement or award is or may be governed \nby a treaty or other international agreement in \nforce for the United States calling for the recogni-\ntion and enforcement of arbitral awards,  \n(C) the underlying claim, save for the agreement \nto arbitrate, could have been brought in a United \nStates court under [the FSIA], or\u201d \n(D) the FSIA\u2019s waiver exception \u201cis otherwise ap-\nplicable.\u201d \nId.  \n\n8 \n \n \nMore recently, Congress added two exceptions ad-\ndressed to crimes of terrorism. The first withdraws im-\nmunity from foreign states designated as \u201cstate spon-\nsor[s] of terrorism\u201d for claims based on enumerated \ncriminal acts that harm certain U.S.-affiliated per-\nsons. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1), (2)(A)(i)\u2013(ii), (c), and \n(h)(6). The second covers claims against any \u201cforeign \nstate \u2026 for physical injury to person or property or \ndeath occurring in the United States and caused by\u201d \neither \u201can act of international terrorism\u201d or certain \ntortious acts attributable to the foreign state. Id. \n\u00a7 1605B. \n The FSIA confers subject-matter \u201cjurisdiction on \ndistrict courts \u2026 when a foreign state is not entitled to \nimmunity.\u201d Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Ship-\nping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 429 (1989); 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1330(a). It similarly provides that \u201c[p]ersonal juris-\ndiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every claim \nfor relief over which the district courts have jurisdic-\ntion under subsection (a) where service has been made \nunder [28 U.S.C. \u00a7] 1608.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1330(b). Congress \nviewed Section 1330(b) as a \u201cFederal long-arm statute \nover foreign states,\u201d and explained that \u201c[t]he require-\nments of minimum jurisdictional contacts and ade-\nquate notice are embodied in th[is] provision.\u201d H.R. \nRep. No. 94-1487, at 13\u201314. \nThe Act also addresses venue, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1391(f), \nremoval from state court, id. \u00a7 1441(d), and default \njudgments, id. \u00a7 1608(e). And it provides that a foreign \nstate \u201cshall be liable in the same manner and to the \nsame extent as a private individual under like circum-\nstances.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1606.  \nImportantly, the Act addresses execution on judg-\nments separately from questions of liability and entry \nof judgment, which are governed by the provisions \n\n9 \n \n \noutlined above. In contrast, Sections 1609\u20131611 ad-\ndress whether and when foreign-state property in the \nUnited States may be attached to satisfy a judgment.  \nB. Factual Background \nRespondent Antrix is a corporation organized under \nthe corporate laws of India. Pet.App.17a. Antrix is \nwholly owned by the Government of India but acts \nwith a legal personality separate from its shareholder. \nSee C.A. E.R. 110.1  \nDevas is also an Indian company. Former employees \nof India\u2019s Space Research Organization founded Devas \nin 2004 to develop and provide multimedia services in \nIndia. Pet.App.53a; C.A. E.R. 70.  \nUnder a 2005 contract, Antrix agreed to build, \nlaunch, and operate two satellites and provide usage \nrights of S-band spectrum capacity on those satellites \nto Devas. Pet.App.17a. The parties\u2019 contract \u201cwas ne-\ngotiated outside of the United States, executed in In-\ndia \u2026, and did not require Antrix to conduct any activ-\nities or create any ongoing obligations in the United \nStates.\u201d Id. at 7a. Devas and Antrix agreed that the \ncontract would \u201cbe subject to and construed in accord-\nance with the Laws of India.\u201d C.A. E.R. 251. They fur-\nther agreed to arbitrate any disputes relating to the \ncontract \u201cat NEW DELHI in India.\u201d Id. at 252.  \nIn 2011, the Government of India decided to reserve \nthe entire S-band space spectrum for \u201cnational needs, \nincluding for the needs of defence, para-military \nforces, railways and other public utility services.\u201d C.A. \nE.R. 52. Antrix invoked the contract\u2019s force majeure \n \n1 Citations to C.A. E.R. are references to Antrix\u2019s excerpts of rec-\nord filed on the Ninth Circuit\u2019s 20-36024 docket. Citations to C.A. \nDoc. are references to that docket. \n\n10 \n \n \nclause and cancelled the contract, because it could not \nprovide S-band usage rights to Devas, which authority \nit did not have even at the time of entering into the \ncontract. Devas invoked the arbitration clause, assert-\ning that Antrix had wrongfully repudiated the con-\ntract. Pet.App.18a\u201319a. The subsequent arbitration \nwas seated at New Delhi and applied Indian law. C.A. \nE.R. 64, 89\u201390. In 2015, the arbitral tribunal issued an \naward for Devas. Pet.App.20a.  \nIn 2022, however, the High Court of Delhi set aside \nthat award. Applying Indian law, as stipulated by the \ncontract, the court concluded that the arbitral tribunal \nhad erred in key respects, including by ignoring pre-\ncontractual documents, issuing contradictory rulings, \nand entering an award contrary to public policy. C.A. \nDoc. 72, App. A. India\u2019s Supreme Court dismissed De-\nvas\u2019s appeal, so the decision setting aside the award is \nfinal. C.A. Doc. 116, Attach. A. \nII. \nPROCEEDINGS BELOW \n1. While Antrix\u2019s application to set aside the award \nwas pending in India, Devas petitioned the district \ncourt to confirm the same award. Pet.App.54a.  \nAntrix moved to dismiss for lack of personal jurisdic-\ntion and forum non conveniens. Antrix explained that \n\u201cforeign corporations,\u201d including \u201c[s]tate-owned corpo-\nrations\u201d like Antrix, \u201care entitled to the protections of \ndue process.\u201d D.C. Doc. 13 at 19. Moreover, Antrix ar-\ngued that exercising personal jurisdiction over it \nwould offend due process because \u201cthere is no connec-\ntion between the Parties\u2019 dispute and the United \nStates.\u201d Id. at 20. Antrix\u2019s motion was grounded in \nNinth Circuit precedent holding that minimum con-\ntacts must be shown by a plaintiff seeking to invoke \n\n11 \n \n \nany FSIA exception. E.g., Gregorian v. Izvestia, 871 \nF.2d 1515, 1529 (9th Cir. 1989). \nThe district court denied the motion. It reasoned \nthat a foreign state \u201cis not a \u2018person\u2019 for due process \npurposes\u201d and that a state-owned foreign corporation \nlacks due-process rights by extension when \u201cthe state \nexercises sufficient control over [the] foreign corpora-\ntion.\u201d Pet.App. 13a\u201314a. The district court concluded \nthat India \u201cexercise[s] \u2018plenary control\u2019 over Antrix,\u201d \nand thus the company was not entitled to due-process \nprotection. Id. at 14a. In addition, the court declined to \ndismiss on forum non conveniens, citing \u201cconcerns \nabout the neutrality of proceedings in India.\u201d Id. at \n15a. The district court confirmed the award and en-\ntered judgment for $1.29 billion for Devas. Id. at 37a. \nAntrix appealed.  \n2. Meanwhile in India, a specialized corporate-law \ncourt determined that Devas was a fraud in its incor-\nporation and management, including because it \u201cre-\nsorted [to] various frauds, misfeasance, connived with \nofficials etc., in obtaining\u201d the Devas-Antrix agree-\nment. C.A. Doc. 38-7 \u00b6 10. The court placed Devas into \nliquidation. Id.  \u00b6 13; Pet.App.54a. The Indian Su-\npreme Court upheld that decision. C.A. Doc. 72, App. \nA at 234\u201345.  \nTwo Mauritian shareholders of Devas and a U.S. \nsubsidiary were then granted leave to intervene in the \ndistrict court. Pet.App.54a. The district court also \ngranted Intervenors post-judgment discovery. Id. \nThrough discovery, Intervenors identified a debtor \nwith pending bankruptcy proceedings in the Eastern \nDistrict of Virginia who owed Antrix $146,457. Id. at \n40a. Over Devas\u2019s objection, the district court certified \nthe judgment for Intervenors to register there. Id. \n\n12 \n \n \nDevas appealed, and the Ninth Circuit consolidated \nDevas\u2019s appeal with Antrix\u2019s. \n3. While both appeals were pending, the Indian court \nset aside the arbitral award, and Antrix asked the \nNinth Circuit for a limited remand to the district court \nto vacate its judgment. C.A. Doc. 72.  \n4. The Ninth Circuit reversed. Pet.App.3a. The court \nof appeals explained that, under circuit precedent, \n\u201cpersonal jurisdiction under the FSIA requires a tradi-\ntional minimum contacts analysis\u201d drawn from due-\nprocess caselaw. Id. at 4a. This rule, the court stated, \n\u201cis statutory rather than constitutional\u201d and does not \ndepend on a conclusion that the Due Process Clause \napplies to foreign sovereigns. Id. at 5a. The court of \nappeals then decided that personal jurisdiction was \nlacking because Antrix had no \u201cpurposeful\u201d contacts \nwith the United States, and \u201c[t]he Agreement between \nAntrix and Devas was negotiated outside of the United \nStates, executed in India ... and did not require Antrix \nto conduct any activities or create ongoing obligations \nin the United States.\u201d Id. at 6a\u20137a. Resolving that the \ndistrict court \u201cerred in exercising personal jurisdiction \nover Antrix,\u201d the panel denied Antrix\u2019s remand motion \nas moot and declined to address any other issue pre-\nsented. Id. at 8a. Rehearing en banc was denied. Id. at \n44a.  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT  \nPersonal jurisdiction is lacking over Antrix.  \nI. That conclusion follows first from the FSIA. When \nCongress first enacted that statute, it conferred juris-\ndiction only in cases involving a substantial connection \nto the United States. Congress similarly required a \nmeaningful connection to the United States for juris-\ndiction when it allowed suits against certain foreign \n\n13 \n \n \nsovereigns for certain terrorist acts in this country or \nagainst U.S.-affiliated persons.  \nThe arbitration exception is no different. It also re-\nquires a meaningful connection to the United States. \nSpecifically, the underlying arbitration agreement \nmust \u201cconcern[] a subject matter capable of \u2026 arbitra-\ntion under U.S. law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6). This lan-\nguage limits jurisdiction to agreements to arbitrate \nthat concern commerce within or with the United \nStates\u2014consistent with the scope of the Federal Arbi-\ntration Act (and indeed the Foreign Commerce \nClause). But even if the text of the arbitration excep-\ntion were deemed ambiguous, the presumption against \nextraterritoriality and the canon declaring that stat-\nutes abrogating sovereign immunity must be con-\nstrued narrowly confirm that Congress did not confer \njurisdiction over purely foreign disputes like this one. \nII. Alternatively, due process prohibits the exercise \nof personal jurisdiction over Antrix.  \nUnder this Court\u2019s precedent, a foreign corporation \nlike Antrix is entitled to object under the Fifth Amend-\nment to a federal district court\u2019s assertion of personal \njurisdiction. That Antrix is a state-owned enterprise \ndoes not strip it of its due-process rights. And the ex-\nercise of jurisdiction over Antrix here violates due pro-\ncess, because Antrix and this suit lack a constitution-\nally sufficient relationship to the United States, as the \nNinth Circuit already held.  \nBecause Antrix is a foreign corporation, not a foreign \nsovereign, this case does not concern whether foreign \nsovereigns are \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to the protections of \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause. But if the \nCourt reaches that question, it should hold that the \nDue Process Clause permits a foreign sovereign to \n\n14 \n \n \nobject to personal jurisdiction in U.S. court, on par \nwith other foreign juridical entities.  \nFinally, Antrix did not consent to personal jurisdic-\ntion in the United States through the arbitral agree-\nment or otherwise.  \nIII. The Court could also affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \njudgment on one of two other grounds: forum non con-\nveniens or the import of the Indian court judgment an-\nnulling the very award that Devas seeks to confirm.  \nARGUMENT  \nI. \nTHE FSIA\u2019S ARBITRATION EXCEPTION, \nLIKE NEIGHBORING PROVISIONS OF \nTHE ACT, REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIAL \nCONNECTION BETWEEN THE UNITED \nSTATES AND THE ARBITRAL DISPUTE. \nIt is common ground that in original design, the \nFSIA stripped the sovereign immunity of foreign sov-\nereigns and their instrumentalities, and granted juris-\ndiction to the district courts, only in cases involving \n\u201csome form of substantial contact with the United \nStates.\u201d Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 490. The same is true \nof the more recent terrorism exceptions. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7\u00a7 1605A, 1605B.  \nAt issue here is whether the arbitration exception\u2014\nadopted between the original Act and the terrorism-\nfocused innovations\u2014follows this same approach or \nbreaks new ground and requires no U.S. connection.  \nAs explained below, the text of the arbitration excep-\ntion supports a confined reading consistent with the \noriginal logic of the Act: the exception applies only to \narbitration agreements that involve American com-\nmerce. And that reading easily resolves this case. The \ndistrict court lacked jurisdiction because the parties\u2019 \n\n15 \n \n \nagreement to arbitrate does not involve commerce \nwithin or with the United States; it solely concerns the \ncommerce of India. \nA. The Original FSIA Exceptions Require \nContacts With The United States To Es-\ntablish Jurisdiction.  \n1. When Congress enacted the FSIA, it made a con-\nnection between the United States and the dispute a \nprerequisite for the exercise of jurisdiction over a for-\neign state or instrumentality. The original exceptions \ncover suits involving:  \n\u2022 a foreign state\u2019s waiver of immunity for pur-\nposes of the suit, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(1);  \n\u2022 a foreign state\u2019s \u201ccommercial activity\u201d in, or \ncausing \u201ca direct effect\u201d in, the United States, \nid. \u00a7 1605(a)(2);  \n\u2022 a foreign state\u2019s expropriation of property in \nviolation of international law where \u201cthat \nproperty or any property exchanged for such \nproperty\u201d has a nexus to \u201ccommercial activ-\nity\u201d by the foreign state in the United States, \nid. \u00a7 1605(a)(3);  \n\u2022 rights in inherited property and immovable \nproperty \n\u201cin \nthe \nUnited \nStates,\u201d \nid. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(4); \n\u2022 a foreign state\u2019s non-commercial tortious ac-\ntivity \u201coccurring in the United States,\u201d id. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(5). \nThe Act\u2019s original exceptions thus spell out the types \nof contacts with the United States that are required \nfor jurisdiction.  \n\n16 \n \n \n\u2022 The waiver exception applies only when the \nforeign state has explicitly waived immunity \nas to the claims in the suit or has implicitly \nwaived immunity through actions that \u201cindi-\ncate willingness to submit to litigation in this \ncountry.\u201d E.g., TIG Ins. Co. v. Republic of Arg., \n110 F.4th 221, 236 (D.C. Cir. 2024). \n\u2022 Both the commercial-activity and expropria-\ntion exceptions trigger jurisdiction only if the \nsuit has a connection with U.S. commerce. See \nWeltover, 504 U.S. at 619\u201320; Bolivarian Re-\npublic of Venez. v. Helmerich & Payne Int\u2019l \nDrilling Co., 581 U.S. 170, 181 (2017) (\u201c[T]he \nexpropriation exception on its face \u2026 re-\nquir[es] \u2026 a commercial connection with the \nUnited States.\u201d).  \n\u2022 The rights-in-property exception applies if the \nsuit concerns property located within our bor-\nders. E.g., Asociacion de Reclamantes v. \nUnited Mexican States, 735 F.2d 1517, 1521 \n(D.C. Cir. 1984).  \n\u2022 And the non-commercial tort exception con-\ncerns torts that \u201coccur[ed] within the territo-\nrial jurisdiction of the United States.\u201d \nAmerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 441.  \nFrom the outset, then, Congress \u201crequir[ed] some \nform of substantial contact with the United States\u201d be-\nfore a U.S. court could hear a case brought against a \nforeign state. Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 490. In Verlinden, \nthis Court acknowledged that the waiver exception \n\u201cmay be seen\u201d as a departure from the \u201cnormal pattern \nof the Act, which generally requires some form of con-\ntact with the United States.\u201d Id. at 490 n.15. Even \nthen, this Court expressed skepticism that \u201cby waiving \n\n17 \n \n \nits immunity, a foreign state could consent to suit \nbased on activities wholly unrelated to the United \nStates.\u201d Id.; see also Amerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 442\u2013\n43 (\u201cNor do we see how a foreign state can waive its \nimmunity under \u00a7 1605(a)(1) by signing an interna-\ntional agreement that contains no mention of a waiver \nof immunity to suit in United States courts or even the \navailability of a cause of action in the United \nStates.\u201d).2 \n 2. Requiring contacts with the United States to es-\ntablish personal jurisdiction furthered Congress\u2019s \ngoals in enacting the FSIA. Following two-and-a-half \ndecades of \u201ccase-by-case\u201d immunity determinations \nmade by the Executive Branch under \u201cdiplomatic pres-\nsure[],\u201d Congress set out to \u201cassur[e]\u201d foreign states \nthat decisions to subject them to suit in the United \nStates \u201c\u2018are made on purely legal grounds and under \nprocedures that insure due process.\u2019\u201d Verlinden, 461 \nU.S. at 488 (quoting H.R.Rep. No. 94-1487, at 7). Sec-\ntion 1330(b) provided that assurance. \u201cThe require-\nments of minimum jurisdictional contacts and ade-\nquate notice are embodied in th[at] provision,\u201d Con-\ngress explained. H.R.Rep.

The \n\u201cimmunity provisions prescribe the necessary contacts \nwhich must exist before our courts can exercise per-\nsonal \njurisdiction,\u201d \nand \nSection \n1330(b) \n \n2 Devas objects (at 31\u201334) that the Ninth Circuit\u2019s minimum-con-\ntacts requirement\u2014by demanding a showing that a suit arises \nout of the defendant\u2019s contacts with the United States\u2014would \n\u201cerect[]\u201d an \u201cadditional barrier\u201d to suits under the FSIA\u2019s original \nand terrorism-related exceptions. Antrix\u2019s interpretation relies \non the FSIA\u2019s text. \n\n18 \n \n \n\u201cincorporate[ed] these jurisdictional contacts by refer-\nence.\u201d H.R.Rep. No. 94\u20131487, at 7; see also Jurisdic-\ntion of U.S. Courts in Suits Against Foreign States: \nHearings on H.R. 11315 Before Subcomm. on Admin. \nLaw & Governmental Rel. of the Comm. on the Judici-\nary, 94th Cong. 29, 31 (1976) (testimony of Bruno \nRistau) (\u201cAbsent the requisite contacts, no suit can be \nmaintained since the existence of the contacts with the \nforum is essential to satisfy the constitutional require-\nment of due process.\u201d).   \nCongress also drafted the FSIA to \u201cembod[y] basic \nprinciples of international law long followed both in \nthe United States and elsewhere.\u201d Helmerich, 581 U.S. \nat 179. It hewed to international law\u2019s traditional lim-\nits on a jurisdiction\u2019s power to regulate foreign conduct \nby requiring contacts sufficient to subject a foreign \nstate to suit in the United States. Those principles \nwere reflected in the then-current Restatement, which \nexplained that a state could regulate foreign parties \nwith \u201cpresence \u2026 in the territory,\u201d \u201cconduct [that] \ntakes place in [its] territory,\u201d and certain conduct hav-\ning \u201ceffects within the territory.\u201d Restatement (Sec-\nond) of Foreign Relations Law of the United States \n\u00a7 10 cmt. a (1965).   \n3. The FSIA\u2019s later-enacted terrorism exceptions \nlikewise require a meaningful connection to the United \nStates. One covers claims for injuries \u201coccurring in the \nUnited States\u201d and caused by either \u201can act of interna-\ntional terrorism in the United States\u201d or certain tor-\ntious acts attributable to the foreign state. 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605B(b). The other is not territorially bounded but \nis in a different sense hard-wired to U.S. interests: it \ncovers suits by U.S. nationals, members of the U.S. \narmed forces, or U.S. government employees or con-\ntractors alleging harm caused by certain acts of \n\n19 \n \n \nterrorism attributable to a foreign state \u201cdesignated as \na state sponsor of terrorism.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1605A(a)(1), \n(2)(A)(ii), and (c). This exception effectuates the United \nStates\u2019 \u201csignificant interest\u201d in providing persons un-\nder the protection of the United States with a \u201cforum \nfor redressing injuries inflicted by out-of-state actors.\u201d \nFord Motor Co. v. Mont. Eighth Jud. Dist. Ct., 592 U.S. \n351, 368 (2021).  \nB. The Arbitration Exception Requires A \nConnection To U.S. Commerce To Confer \nJurisdiction. \n1. The arbitration exception likewise requires a sub-\nstantial connection to the United States. That excep-\ntion confers jurisdiction on actions brought \u201ceither to \nenforce\u201d an arbitration agreement \u201cmade by [a] foreign \nstate,\u201d or \u201cto confirm an award made pursuant to\u201d such \nan agreement. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6). Crucially, for \nthe exception to apply, the underlying arbitration \nagreement must \u201cconcern[] a subject matter capable of \nsettlement by arbitration under the laws of the United \nStates.\u201d Id.  \nThis language limits the arbitration exception to dis-\nputes concerning commerce within or with the United \nStates, because disputes concerning entirely foreign \ncommerce are not arbitrable under U.S. law. The Fed-\neral Arbitration Act (FAA), 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1 et seq., lays out \nour \u201csubstantive law of arbitrability,\u201d see Moses H. \nCone Mem\u2019l Hosp. v. Mercury Constr. Corp., 460 U.S. \n1, 24 (1983). Under the FAA, a \u201ccontract evidencing a \ntransaction involving commerce\u201d is capable of settle-\nment by arbitration. 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 2. But \u201ccommerce,\u201d as \ndefined in the FAA, encompasses only \u201ccommerce\u201d \nwithin or \u201cwith\u201d the United States, or \u201cbetween\u201d the \n\n20 \n \n \nUnited States and a \u201cforeign nation.\u201d Id. \u00a7 1.3 And be-\ncause disputes linked to domestic commerce are arbi-\ntrable under U.S. law but purely foreign commercial \ndisputes are not, the arbitration exception requires a \nlink between the underlying arbitration and U.S. com-\nmerce for jurisdiction. \nContext confirms this reading. The phrase \u201cconcern-\ning a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitra-\ntion under the laws of the United States\u201d echoes \nclauses in related international agreements. For ex-\nample, the New York Convention obligates contracting \nstates to \u201crecognize\u201d and \u201cenforce\u201d only those arbitra-\ntion agreements and awards that \u201cconcern[] a subject \nmatter capable of settlement by arbitration.\u201d Conven-\ntion on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign \nArbitral Awards, art. II(1), June 6, 1958 (N.Y. Conven-\ntion); see also Inter-American Convention on Interna-\ntional Commercial Arbitration, art. V(2), Jan. 30, 1975 \n(Panama Convention) (providing that \u201cthe State in \nwhich the recognition and execution\u201d of an arbitral \naward \u201cis requested\u201d may refuse if \u201cthe subject of the \ndispute cannot be settled by arbitration under the law \n \n3 The full definition reads:  \n\u201c[C]ommerce,\u201d as herein defined, means com-\nmerce among the several States or with foreign \nnations, or in any Territory of the United States \nor in the District of Columbia, or between any \nsuch Territory and another, or between any such \nTerritory and any State or foreign nation, or be-\ntween the District of Columbia and any State or \nTerritory or foreign nation, but nothing herein \ncontained shall apply to contracts of employment \nof seamen, railroad employees, or any other class \nof workers engaged in foreign or interstate com-\nmerce. \n9 U.S.C. \u00a7 1. \n\n21 \n \n \nof that State\u201d). Interpreting the New York Convention, \nthis Court has explained that the phrase \u201c\u2018subject mat-\nter capable of settlement by arbitration\u2019 \u2026 contem-\nplates exceptions to arbitrability grounded in domestic \nlaw.\u201d Mitsubishi Motors Corp. v. Soler Chrysler-Plym-\nouth, Inc., 473 U.S. 614, 639 n.21 (1985); accord M & \nC Corp. v. Erwin Behr GmbH & Co., KG, 87 F.3d 844, \n848 (6th Cir. 1996). In the FSIA\u2019s arbitration excep-\ntion, too, the phrase carves out subject matters\u2014in-\ncluding purely foreign commerce\u2014that cannot be set-\ntled by arbitration under U.S. law. \n2. The alternative interpretation espoused by Peti-\ntioners is that the provision supplies jurisdiction so \nlong as one of the four conditions\u2014(A) through (D)\u2014\nset out in the second half of the exception is met. See \nDevas Br. 24-25; Intervenors Br. 24-25. They observe \nthat the condition at issue here\u2014an award that may \nbe covered by an international agreement \u201ccalling for \nthe recognition and enforcement of arbitral awards,\u201d \n28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6)(B)\u2014may sometimes be satisfied \nin suits involving arbitrations with no connection to \nU.S. commerce. See Intervenors Br. 26. And so under \nPetitioners\u2019 interpretation, jurisdiction exists even in \ndisputes that have no U.S. nexus. \nThe first problem with this interpretation is that it \nignores half of the arbitration exception\u2019s text\u2014includ-\ning the language requiring that the dispute \u201cconcern[] \na subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration\u201d \nunder U.S. law. 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6). The failure to \ngive any force to this clause refutes their reading. See \nTRW Inc. v. Andrews, 534 U.S. 19, 31 (2001) (statutes \nshould be read to avoid making any \u201cclause, sentence \nor word ... superfluous, void, or insignificant\u201d). \nThe next hurdle for Devas and Intervenors is that, \nunder their reading, the arbitration exception departs \n\n22 \n \n \nfrom the original FSIA\u2019s pattern of requiring meaning-\nful U.S. contacts for jurisdiction. Resorting to legisla-\ntive history, Petitioners claim that this departure was \nintentional: Congress enacted the arbitration excep-\ntion, they say, to clarify that a foreign state\u2019s mere \nagreement to arbitrate waives its sovereign immunity \nin U.S. courts\u2014even where the arbitration agreement \nlacks a connection to the United States. Devas Br. 25 \n& n.5; Intervenors Br. 25\u201326. Yet the \u201clegislative ma-\nterials\u201d Petitioners cite\u2014\u201cexcerpts from committee \nhearings and scattered floor statements by individual \nlawmakers\u201d\u2014are \u201camong the least illuminating forms \nof legislative history.\u201d Advoc. Health Care Network v. \nStapleton, 581 U.S. 468, 481 (2017). Further, this un-\nderstanding of Congress\u2019s intent is difficult to square \nwith the provision it enacted. If mere agreement to ar-\nbitrate is enough to waive immunity in U.S. court, \nthen why include provisos (A) through (D)?  \nThe legislative history Petitioners prefer is also bal-\nanced out by other legislative history showing Con-\ngress was focused on arbitrations that involved U.S. \nbusinesses. Congress knew that American businesses \nabroad depended on arbitration agreements to \u201cas-\nsur[e]\u201d that disputes with foreign states and state-\nowned enterprises would be \u201csettled with objectivity \nand fairness.\u201d Hearing Before the Subcomm. on Ad-\nmin. Law & Governmental Rel. of the Comm. on the \nJudiciary, 100th Cong. 201 (1987) (statement of Mon-\nroe Leigh). Congress therefore adopted the arbitration \nexception to \u201callow U.S. courts to help Americans en-\ngaged in international business to have their fair day \nin court.\u201d 132 Cong. Rec. S14795 (daily ed. Oct. 2, \n1986) (statement of Sen. Lugar). \u201cBy preventing a for-\neign government from invoking the sovereign immun-\nity defense,\u201d the FSIA could better \u201csecure the safety \nof U.S. companies\u2019 interests abroad.\u201d 132 Cong. Rec. \n\n23 \n \n \nS.17258 (daily ed. Oct. 18, 1986) (statement of Sen. \nMathias).   \n3. Finally, Intervenors (and several amici) insist \nthat a no-U.S.-nexus reading of the arbitration excep-\ntion is compelled by international conventions to \nwhich the United States is a party. Intervenors Br. 27\u2013\n29; see also Devas Br. 25 & n.5. These agreements, In-\ntervenors argue, commit U.S. courts to enforcing and \nconfirming some arbitrations that lack a U.S. connec-\ntion. So reading the arbitration exception to require \nsuch a connection would \u201cplace the United States in \nconflict\u201d with these agreements, Intervenors Br. 27, or \nwould violate the canon instructing courts to construe \nstatutes to avoid \u201cconflict with ... an international \nagreement,\u201d Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations \nLaw \u00a7 114 (1987); see Intervenors Br. 28. \nThis theory collides with what this Court has al-\nready said about the New York Convention: the phrase \n\u201c\u2018subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration\u2019 \n... contemplates exceptions to arbitrability grounded in \ndomestic law.\u201d Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 639 n.21. Inter-\nvenors\u2019 theory also ignores the reality that U.S. courts \nroutinely apply minimum-contacts limits to private-\nparty disputes under the Convention. E.g., Conti 11. \nContainer Schiffarts-GMBH & Co. KG M.S., MSC Fla-\nminia v. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Co., 91 F.4th \n789, 794\u201397 (5th Cir. 2024) (also reviewing other cir-\ncuits\u2019 caselaw about personal jurisdiction to confirm \nawards under the New York Convention). So if requir-\ning a U.S. nexus violated the Convention, the conflict \nbetween the Convention and U.S. law would be far-\nreaching.  \nIn truth, these international agreements are far less \nrigid than Intervenors suggest. They \u201creserve[] to each \nsignatory country the right to refuse enforcement of an \n\n24 \n \n \naward where the \u2018recognition or enforcement of the \naward would be contrary to the public policy of that \ncountry.\u2019\u201d Mitsubishi, 473 U.S. at 638 (quoting N.Y. \nConvention art. V(2)(b)); see also Panama Convention \nart. V(2). They also contemplate that only \u201ccompetent\u201d \ncourts where \u201crecognition and enforcement is sought\u201d \nwill have power to confirm and enforce foreign arbitra-\ntions. N.Y. Convention art. V; Panama Convention art. \nV; see also Convention on the Settlement of Invest-\nment Disputes between States and Nationals of Other \nStates, art. 54(2), Mar. 18, 1965. A \u201ccompetent\u201d court \nis one with subject-matter and personal jurisdiction, \nat least in the context of these agreements governing \nsuits against foreign parties. See Lightfoot v. Cendant \nMortg. Corp., 580 U.S. 82, 95 (2017) (explaining that \nthe phrase \u201ccourt of competent jurisdiction\u201d may refer \nto \u201ca court with personal jurisdiction\u201d). \nIn short, interpreting the FSIA to require a U.S. \nnexus before confirmation jurisdiction can be exercised \ndoes not conflict with these agreements.  \n4. Jurisdiction is lacking here. This case stems from \na contract between two Indian parties that provided \nfor performance in India and called for dispute resolu-\ntion before an Indian arbitral tribunal under Indian. \nThis arbitral agreement \u201cconcern[s] a subject mat-\nter\u201d\u2014commerce with no connection to the United \nStates\u2014that is not \u201ccapable of settlement by arbitra-\ntion under the laws of the United States.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1605(a)(6). As a result, the arbitration exception does \nnot confer jurisdiction. \n\n25 \n \n \nC. Absent A Clear Statement From Con-\ngress, U.S. Courts Lack Jurisdiction To \nAdjudicate Civil Disputes With No Con-\nnection To The United States. \n1. Petitioners\u2019 theory also conflicts with the pre-\nsumption against extraterritoriality. That canon holds \nthat \u201c[w]hen a statute gives no clear indication of an \nextraterritorial application, it has none.\u201d Morrison v. \nNat\u2019l Austl. Bank Ltd., 561 U.S. 247, 255 (2010). This \nrule \u201creflects\u201d the principle \u201cthat United States law \ngoverns domestically but does not rule the world,\u201d Ki-\nobel v. Royal Dutch Petrol. Co., 569 U.S. 108, 115 \n(2013) (internal quotation marks omitted), and guards \nagainst the \u201cserious risk of interference with a foreign \nnation\u2019s ability independently to regulate its own com-\nmercial affairs\u201d that would arise if the U.S. were rou-\ntinely to apply its laws in foreign territories, F. Hoff-\nmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, \n165 (2004). Those concerns are magnified when, as \nhere, a party claims that Congress gave U.S. courts \nauthority to impose judgments of liability on foreign-\nstate instrumentalities in disputes with citizens of the \nsame foreign country. Congress \u201calone has the facili-\nties necessary to make fairly such an important policy \ndecision where the possibilities of international dis-\ncord are so evident.\u201d Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 116.  \nAlthough courts typically apply the presumption \u201cto \ndiscern whether\u201d a conduct-regulating statute \u201capplies \nabroad,\u201d the principle applies equally to \u201cstrictly juris-\ndictional\u201d statutes. Id. at 117 (quoting Sosa v. Alvarez-\nMachain, 542 U.S. 692, 713 (2004)). And the presump-\ntion is triggered here, where Petitioners read the arbi-\ntration exception to compel U.S. courts to impose judg-\nments on foreign parties for entirely foreign conduct.  \n\n26 \n \n \nNo \u201cclear indication of extraterritoriality\u201d overcomes \nthe presumption here. Kiobel, 569 U.S. at 118. \u201cNoth-\ning in the text of the [FSIA] suggests that Congress \nintended\u201d for the arbitration exception to cover foreign \narbitration disputes that have no nexus to this coun-\ntry. Id. Yes, the FSIA is about foreign states. But that \ndoes not suggest Congress intended to reach purely \nforeign conduct\u2014rather, as discussed, it is clear that \nevery other immunity exception requires a meaningful \ntie to the United States. See id. (holding that the Alien \nTort Statute, 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1350, did not \u201cevince a clear \nindication of extraterritoriality,\u201d even though it ad-\ndresses \u201cactions by aliens for violations of the law of \nnations\u201d). Beyond that, it is far from clear that the For-\neign Commerce Clause empowers Congress to regulate \nthe foreign commercial activity of foreigners. As one \nmember of this Court has stated, the Clause \u201cdoes not \nconfer upon Congress a virtually plenary power over \nglobal economic activity.\u201d Baston v. United States, 137 \nS. Ct. 850, 853 (2017) (Thomas, J., dissenting from de-\nnial of certiorari).  \nContext and history supply no reason to think that \nCongress intended to cover purely foreign disputes. \nCongress enacted the FSIA, and its arbitration excep-\ntion, against the backdrop of international-law norms \nthat limit judicial power over foreign activities and \nparties by demanding a connection between the dis-\npute and the adjudicating state. See supra p. 18; see \nalso Restatement (Third) of Foreign Relations Law \n\u00a7 421 (enumerating specific connections between the \nstate and the defendant that make the exercise of civil \njurisdiction reasonable).  \nPractical considerations also counsel restraint. An \nunbounded interpretation of the arbitration exception \nwould authorize a district court to compel a foreign \n\n27 \n \n \nsovereign to arbitrate\u2014even if the underlying dispute \nhad nothing whatsoever to do with the United States. \nIn a confirmation action, a foreign plaintiff could avail \nitself of the U.S.\u2019s uniquely liberal discovery rules and \ndeploy the resources of the U.S. courts to dig into the \nforeign sovereign\u2019s activities and assets, even if the \nplaintiff\u2019s desire for wide-ranging discovery were its \nonly reason for bringing the dispute here. It cannot be \nthat Congress intended to inject the U.S. courts into \nsuch purely foreign controversies. Cf. ZF Auto. US, \nInc. v. Luxshare, Ltd., 596 U.S. 619, 632 (2022) (\u201cWhy \nwould Congress lend the resources of [U.S.] courts to \naid purely private bodies adjudicating purely private \ndisputes abroad?\u201d); Hines v. Davidowitz, 312 U.S. 52, \n64 (1940).  \n2. A second clear-statement rule counsels restraint: \nCongress must \u201cmake its intent to abrogate sovereign \nimmunity unmistakably clear in the language of the \nstatute.\u201d Fin. Oversight & Mgmt. Bd. for P.R. v. Centro \nde Periodismo Investigativo, Inc., 598 U.S. 339, 346 \n(2023). This Court has \u201cinvoked that clear-statement \nrule, and applied it equivalently, in cases naming\u201d all \nvarieties of sovereigns. Id.; see also id. 346 n.3. A cor-\nollary is that \u201c[a]ny ambiguities\u201d in statutory text \nmust \u201cbe construed in favor of immunity.\u201d FAA v. \nCooper, 566 U.S. 284, 290 (2012).  \nHere, at a minimum, given the statutory language \nand treaty text, the arbitration exception does not \nclearly abrogate immunity over foreign arbitral dis-\nputes with no U.S. nexus. Congress instead limited the \nexception\u2019s application to arbitration agreements that \n\u201cconcern[] a subject matter capable of settlement by \narbitration\u201d under our law.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6). \nThat language is best read to require some connection \nbetween \nthe \nunderlying \nagreement \nand \nU.S. \n\n28 \n \n \ncommerce, in accord with every surrounding FSIA ex-\nception. But if it is thought ambiguous, the ambiguity \nfavors immunity. \n* \n* \n* \nThe Court should hold that the FSIA\u2019s arbitration \nexception supports the exercise of personal jurisdiction \nby a U.S. court only when the underlying arbitration \nagreement relates to commerce within or with the \nUnited States. Because this dispute lacks the required \nconnection, the arbitration exception does not apply, \nand the district court lacked personal jurisdiction over \nAntrix. \nII. THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE REQUIRES A \nMINIMUM CONNECTION TO THE UNITED \nSTATES FOR PERSONAL JURISDICTION \nOVER ANTRIX, A FOREIGN CORPORA-\nTION. \nIf this Court decides that the FSIA\u2019s arbitration ex-\nception permits this suit, the Court should affirm the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment on constitutional grounds. \nThe reason is straightforward: Under this Court\u2019s \nprecedent, a foreign corporation is entitled to raise a \ndue-process objection to a federal court\u2019s exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction. And exercising personal jurisdic-\ntion over Antrix here violates due process: Antrix and \nthis suit lack a constitutionally sufficient relationship \nto the United States. \nBecause Antrix is a foreign corporation and not a for-\neign sovereign, this case does not present the question \nof whether foreign sovereigns themselves are \u201cper-\nsons\u201d entitled to the protections of the Fifth Amend-\nment\u2019s Due Process Clause. Accord US Br. 22. But if \nthis Court chooses to answer that question, the Court \nshould hold that where the FSIA strips a sovereign of \n\n29 \n \n \nimmunity in a civil case and treats it as \u201cliable in the \nsame manner and to the same extent as a private in-\ndividual under like circumstances,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1606, \nthe Due Process Clause permits the foreign sovereign \nto object to a U.S. court\u2019s exercise of personal jurisdic-\ntion, just like other foreign persons or entities haled \ninto U.S. courts.  \nA. The Due Process Clause Protects Foreign \nCorporations Like Antrix. \n1. A foreign corporation like Antrix may invoke due-\nprocess protections to challenge a court\u2019s exercise of \npersonal jurisdiction. This Court has repeatedly af-\nfirmed that rule under the Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause. See Daimler AG v. Bauman, 571 \nU.S. 117, 120 (2014); Goodyear Dunlop Tires Opera-\ntions, S.A. v. Brown, 564 U.S. 915, 920 (2011); J. McIn-\ntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 U.S. 873, 888 (2011) \n(Breyer, J., concurring in the judgment); Asahi Metal \nIndus. Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 480 U.S. 102, 106 \n(1987); Helicopteros Nacionales de Colombia, S.A. v. \nHall, 466 U.S. 408, 409 (1984). Just the same, this \nCourt has recognized that the Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due \nProcess Clause protects foreign corporations in federal \ncourt. In Omni Capital, \u201ca British corporation with its \noffices in London\u201d challenged a district court\u2019s exercise \nof personal jurisdiction. 484 U.S. at 99. The Court ex-\nplained that \u201c[t]he requirement that a court have per-\nsonal jurisdiction flows ... from the Due Process \nClause\u201d of the Fifth Amendment. Id. at 104. And under \nthat Due Process Clause, \u201cbefore a court may exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over a defendant, \u2026 a constitu-\ntionally sufficient relationship between the defendant \nand the forum\u201d must exist. Id.  \nThat rule is, and should be, uncontroversial. These \ndecisions are in a long line of precedents holding that \n\n30 \n \n \nforeign individuals and companies enjoy limited con-\nstitutional \nrights\u2014including \nFifth-Amendment \nrights\u2014once they come within, or possess property \nwithin, the territorial jurisdiction of the United States, \nand in their encounters with U.S. courts. E.g., \nZadvydas v. Davis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001) (\u201c[T]he \nDue Process Clause applies to all \u2018persons\u2019 within the \nUnited States, including aliens, whether their pres-\nence here is lawful, unlawful, temporary, or perma-\nnent.\u201d); see also Russian Volunteer Fleet v. United \nStates, 282 U.S. 481, 489 (1931) (Russian corporation \n\u201cwas an alien friend, and as such was entitled to the \nprotection of the Fifth Amendment of the Federal Con-\nstitution\u201d in Takings-Clause suit); Johnson v. Eisen-\ntrager, 339 U.S. 763, 771 (1950) (at least in peacetime, \n\u201cthe civil and property rights of immigrants or transi-\nents of foreign nationality so nearly approach equiva-\nlence to those of citizens\u201d). The precise scope and effect \nof those rights depends on context. \nUnder these cases, Antrix is entitled to invoke due-\nprocess protections to object to personal jurisdiction in \nthis suit. Antrix, a corporation organized under the \nlaws of India, has been summoned into court in the \nUnited States by parties seeking to reduce a large ar-\nbitral award to judgment. Like the foreign companies \nin this Court\u2019s prior cases, Antrix may raise a due-pro-\ncess challenge to the assertion of jurisdiction. \nIndia\u2019s ownership interest in Antrix does not change \nthe equation. The Due Process Clause protects \u201cper-\nson[s],\u201d U.S. Const. amend. V, including artificial per-\nsons like corporations, e.g., In re Sinking Fund Cases, \n99 U.S. 700, 718\u201319 (1878); Gulf, C. & S.F. Ry. v. Ellis, \n165 U.S. 150, 154 (1897) (\u201cIt is well settled that corpo-\nrations are persons within the provisions of the four-\nteenth amendment of the constitution of the United \n\n31 \n \n \nStates.\u201d). And \u201ca corporation\u2019s juridical personhood\u201d is \nnot \u201cdependent on the identities of its shareholders.\u201d \nGater Assets Ltd. v. AO Moldovagaz, 2 F.4th 42, 65 (2d \nCir. 2021). Recognizing as much, Congress expressly \ndefined corporate instrumentalities owned by foreign \nstates as \u201clegal person[s]\u201d in the FSIA. See 28 U.S.C. \n\u00a7 1603(b)(1). Because there is no reason to think the \n\u201creach of the Due Process Clauses depends on whether \nonly private as opposed to public entities hold owner-\nship interests in a corporation otherwise entitled to \nprotection,\u201d Gater Assets, 2 F.4th at 65 n.22, a corpora-\ntion like Antrix with foreign-state ownership may ob-\nject to personal jurisdiction, just like a company with \nprivate foreign ownership. Every court of appeals to \nhave considered this question has so held. See id. at \n64\u201365; GSS Grp. Ltd v. Nat\u2019l Port Auth., 680 F.3d 805, \n815\u201317 (D.C. Cir. 2012); First Inv. Corp. of Marshall \nIslands v. Fujian Mawei Shipbuilding, Ltd., 703 F.3d \n742, 747-748, 752\u201356 (5th Cir. 2012). \nNor does this case concern jurisdiction\u2014under the \nFSIA or the Due Process Clause\u2014to execute against \nthe U.S. assets of a foreign state to satisfy an arbitral \naward. As two members of the Ninth Circuit panel ex-\nplained in concurrence, Petitioners \u201cforfeited\u201d any op-\nportunity to \u201cinvoke that basis for personal jurisdic-\ntion\u201d over Antrix.  Pet.App.11a\u201312a. Furthermore, a \ndedicated provision of the FSIA governs immunity \n\u201cfrom attachment or execution\u201d of \u201c[t]he property in \nthe United States of a foreign state.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1610; \nsee also Republic of Argentina v. NML Cap., Ltd., 573 \nU.S. 134, 142 (2014). And where such property is at \nissue, the distinct due-process rules governing pro-\nceedings in rem or quasi in rem would apply. E.g., \nShaffer v. Heitner, 433 U.S. 186, 199 (1977). Here, in \ncontrast, petitioners are pursuing \u201ca claim for relief in \npersonam,\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a), seeking to convert an \n\n32 \n \n \narbitral award into a judgment. The personal-jurisdic-\ntion rules applicable to in personam suits thus apply, \nand require dismissal. \nAntrix\u2019s objection to personal jurisdiction must be \nsustained because there is no \u201cconstitutionally suffi-\ncient relationship between [Antrix] and the forum.\u201d \nOmni Capital, 484 U.S. at 104. As the Ninth Circuit \ncorrectly held, Petitioners pointed at most to \u201crandom, \nisolated, or fortuitous\u201d contacts between Antrix and \nthe United States.  Pet.App.6a\u20137a. The exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction in such circumstances offends due \nprocess.  \n2. Devas and Intervenors resist this straightforward \nconclusion, but their arguments lack merit. \na. Petitioners first contend that the Fifth Amend-\nment does not require minimum contacts or otherwise \nlimit Congress\u2019s power to authorize personal jurisdic-\ntion over foreign defendants in federal court. Devas Br. \n34\u201341; Intervenors Br. 38\u201341. According to an alleg-\nedly \u201cemerging consensus\u201d among \u201c[l]eading scholars\u201d \nand \u201c[s]everal appellate judges,\u201d the Fifth Amendment \nwas originally understood to require only congression-\nally authorized service of process to establish personal \njurisdiction over a foreign defendant in federal court. \nDevas Br. 38\u201339; Intervenors Br. 36\u201341. Under that \ntheory, due process is satisfied because Antrix was \nserved under the FSIA\u2019s liberal service provisions, 28 \nU.S.C. \u00a7 1608. Devas Br. 40; Intervenors Br. 41\u201342. \nBut that hypothesis craters under this Court\u2019s \ncaselaw. Fifth-Amendment precedent confirms that \npersonal jurisdiction requires both a connection to the \nforum and congressionally authorized service of pro-\ncess in civil commercial suits against foreign defend-\nants. In Omni Capital, this Court considered whether \n\n33 \n \n \na federal district court could exercise personal jurisdic-\ntion over a British corporation and a British citizen, \neven though no statute or state rule authorized service \nof process. 484 U.S. at 111. The plaintiff argued that \nin a suit involving claims under a federal statute, the \n\u201conly limits on a district court\u2019s power to exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction derive from the Due Process Clause \nof the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Id. at 102. Those limits were \nsatisfied, the plaintiff claimed, based on the British de-\nfendants\u2019 \u201ccontacts with the United States.\u201d Id. at 100. \nDespite these constitutionally sufficient contacts, the \nBritish defendants objected to personal jurisdiction on \nthe ground that they were \u201cnot amenable to service of \nsummons in the absence of a statute or rule authoriz-\ning such service.\u201d Id. at 103. This Court sided with the \ndefendants. Id. at 111. In doing so, the Court explained \nthat \u201cbefore a court may exercise personal jurisdiction \nover a defendant there must be more than notice to the \ndefendant and a constitutionally sufficient relation-\nship between the defendant and the forum.\u201d Id. at 104. \nIn addition to those two constitutional \u201cprerequisites\u201d \nto jurisdiction, \u201c[t]here also must be a basis for the de-\nfendant\u2019s amenability to service of summons.\u201d Id.  \nPrecedent thus stands squarely in the way of Peti-\ntioners\u2019 reinterpretation of the Fifth Amendment: \nOmni Capital recognizes that the Fifth Amendment \nimposes a contacts-based test for personal jurisdiction. \nSee id. at 104. And Omni Capital affirms that personal \njurisdiction requires a connection to the forum in ad-\ndition to duly authorized service of process. \nDevas and Intervenors assert that this Court\u2019s Fifth-\nAmendment precedents have \u201cleft open the question \nwhether the Fifth Amendment imposes the same,\u201d \nminimum contacts\u2013based \u201crestrictions on the exercise \nof personal jurisdiction by a federal court\u2019 as the \n\n34 \n \n \nFourteenth Amendment imposes on that of a state \ncourt.\u201d Intervenors Br. 34 (internal quotation marks \nomitted). Not so. The question this Court left open is \nnarrower. It is whether \u201ca federal court could exercise \npersonal jurisdiction, consistent with the Fifth \nAmendment, based on an aggregation of the defend-\nant\u2019s contacts with the Nation as a whole, rather than \non its contacts with the State in which the federal \ncourt sits.\u201d Omni Capital, 484 U.S. at 102 n.5; see also \nBristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Super. Ct. of Cal., 582 U.S. \n255, 269 (2017) (citing Omni Capital, 484 U.S. at 102 \nn.5); Asahi, 480 U.S. at 113 n.* (plurality op.) (\u201cWe \nhave no occasion here to determine whether Congress \ncould, consistent with the Due Process Clause of the \nFifth Amendment, authorize federal court personal ju-\nrisdiction over alien defendants based on the aggre-\ngate of national contacts, rather than on the contacts \nbetween the defendant and the State in which the fed-\neral court sits.\u201d); Nicastro, 564 U.S. at 885 (same). And \nthat open question is not implicated here. The court of \nappeals applied the more plaintiff-friendly standard, \nlooked to all of Antrix\u2019s nationwide contacts, and found \nthem wanting even in aggregate. See Pet.App.6a\u20137a.  \nThis Court need not say more to resolve this case,4 \nparticularly when neither Petition for Certiorari asked \nthe Court to revisit Omni Capital or any other prece-\ndent.  \nYet the vision of the Fifth Amendment advanced by \nDevas and Intervenors is also wrong on its own terms. \nCentral to Petitioners\u2019 view is a claim that the Fifth \n \n4 Another case presents the Court with the opportunity to say \nmore. This Court recently granted certiorari to review Fifth-\nAmendment limits on Congress\u2019s power to authorize personal ju-\nrisdiction over foreign defendants. See Fuld v. PLO., 82 F. 4th 74 \n(2023), cert. granted, Nos. 24-20, 24-151 (Dec. 6, 2024).  \n\n35 \n \n \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause diverges from the \nFourteenth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause with re-\nspect to the limits imposed on a court\u2019s power to assert \njurisdiction over a non-resident defendant. But those \nDue Process Clauses \u201cuse the same language and \nguarantee individual liberty in the same way.\u201d \nDouglass v. Nippon Yusen Kabushiki Kaisha, 46 F.4th \n226, 238 (5th Cir. 2022). And the Fifth and Fourteenth \nAmendments long have been construed in parallel. Cf. \nBolling v. Sharpe, 347 U.S. 497, 498 (1954) (interpret-\ning the Fifth Amendment to prohibit racial segrega-\ntion in D.C. public schools based on the Fourteenth-\nAmendment holding in Brown v. Board of Education, \n347 U.S. 483 (1954)).  \nThere is no good reason to depart from that tradition \nin this case. Devas and Intervenors assert that evi-\ndence from the Early Republic supports their effort to \nreimagine the Fifth Amendment. Devas Br. 38-40; In-\ntervenors Br. 36-39. But as the author of the leading \nacademic article championing their theory readily ad-\nmits, the Founding-Era evidence is negligible, because \nfor \u201calmost a century\u201d after the Founding, \u201cCongress \nstrictly limited the venues in which a federal civil suit \ncould be brought\u201d thus \u201cforeclos[ing] virtually any ex-\nercise of jurisdiction that might seem at all interesting \ntoday.\u201d Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdiction of the Fed-\neral Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, 1710\u201311 (2020).   \nIntervenors also argue that the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s minimum-contacts test cannot translate to the \nFifth-Amendment context, because the Fourteenth \nAmendment protects \u201cinterstate federalism\u201d interests \nirrelevant under the Fifth Amendment. Intervenors \nBr. 35 (quoting Bristol-Myers Squibb, 582 U.S. at 263). \nBut this Court has clarified that the federalism \u201cele-\nment\u201d of the Fourteenth-Amendment test \u201cmust be \n\n36 \n \n \nseen as ultimately a function of the individual liberty \ninterest preserved by the Due Process Clause.\u201d Ins. \nCorp. of Ir. v. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 \nU.S. 694, 702 n.10 (1982). And the Fifth Amendment\u2019s \nDue Process Clause also protects individual liberty. \nb. Petitioners may claim that the district court \nproperly treated Antrix not as a corporation but as a \nforeign government for purposes of the due-process \nanalysis. Without adequate analysis, the district court \ndenied that Antrix has due-process rights because In-\ndia supposedly \u201cexercises plenary control over Antrix \nin a principal-agent relationship.\u201d Pet.App.13a\u201314a \n(internal quotation marks omitted).  \nThe district court erred. For one, this Court has \nnever suggested that a veil-piercing analysis, under \nFirst National City Bank v. Banco Para El Comercio \nExterior de Cuba (Bancec), 462 U.S. 611, 629 (1983), or \notherwise, may be used to destroy a party\u2019s constitu-\ntional rights. Bancec addressed the distinct question of \nwhether and when a corporate instrumentality may \nshare in a sovereign\u2019s liability. It has no proper appli-\ncation outside that context.  \nAnd if Bancec were applicable, the district court \nplainly misapplied it. Bancec holds that \u201cgovernment \ninstrumentalities established as juridical entities dis-\ntinct and independent from their sovereign should nor-\nmally be treated as such.\u201d Id. at 626\u201327. This pre-\nsumption is rooted in the FSIA itself: \u201cCongress clearly \nexpressed its intention that duly created instrumen-\ntalities of a foreign state are to be accorded a presump-\ntion of independent status.\u201d Id. at 627\u201328. Bancec then \nheld that the presumption of corporate separateness \nmay be overcome only where respecting the corporate \nform would work an injustice. See id. at 630\u201334. The \ndistrict court\u2019s focus on the Indian Government\u2019s \n\n37 \n \n \nsupposed dominance of Antrix was therefore mis-\nplaced. Inequity\u2014not dominance\u2014is required to dis-\nregard the corporate form of sovereign instrumentali-\nties. \nBut piercing the corporate veil would not avoid any \nsort of injustice. Devas\u2019s complaint sought to confirm \nthe arbitration award against Antrix. Consistent with \nthat, the district court entered judgment against An-\ntrix and permitted intervenors to register a judgment \nagainst Antrix in the Eastern District of Virginia. The \ndistrict court\u2019s analysis treats India as a foil\u2014a tool to \nnegate Antrix\u2019s due-process rights. That would be a bi-\nzarre use of the veil-piercing concept that Bancec cau-\ntiously endorsed, with traditional equity principles in \nmind, to avoid \u201cfraud or injustice\u201d in cases governed by \nthe FSIA. Bancec, 462 U.S. at 629 (internal quotation \nmarks omitted).  \nLikely there is no case in which a U.S. court would \nbe justified in disregarding corporate separateness \npurely to wash away a defendant\u2019s constitutional \nrights. If there is such a case, surely it is not this one. \nc. Finally, the Solicitor General urges the Court to \nrefrain from deciding whether due process protects a \ncorporate instrumentality of a foreign state, because \nthat question is a \u201cweighty issue\u201d that was not \u201cre-\nsolved below. US Br. 22. But this Court has the benefit \nof well-reasoned decisions from other courts of appeals \nholding that foreign corporations, even if state-owned, \nare entitled to object to personal jurisdiction on due-\nprocess grounds. See Gater Assets, 2 F.4th at 64\u201365; \nGSS Grp., 680 F.3d at 815\u201317; First Inv. Corp., 703 \n\n38 \n \n \nF.3d at 747\u201348, 752\u201356.5 And the weightiness of the \nquestion points the other way: foreign corporations \n(private and state-owned alike) depend on the current \nunderstanding that they cannot be summoned into our \ncourts to defend against suits lacking any relationship \nto the United States. This Court should reaffirm that \nunderstanding.  \nB. The Due Process Clause Protects Foreign \nSovereigns In This Context. \nBecause Antrix is a foreign corporation, the question \nwhether foreign sovereigns have due-process rights is \nnot presented here. But if the Court elects to reach \nthat question, it should hold that a foreign sovereign \nthat is denied immunity and made a defendant to a \ncase in federal court is entitled to raise a due-process \nobjection to personal jurisdiction.  \n1. That conclusion is supported first by the text of \nthe Fifth Amendment. That Amendment\u2019s Due Pro-\ncess Clause states: \u201cnor shall any person ... be deprived \nof ... property, without due process of law.\u201d U.S. Const. \nAmend. V. As Professor Ingrid Brunk has detailed, at \nthe time of the Founding, sovereigns were often de-\nscribed as \u201cpersons,\u201d and legal \u201cprocess\u201d was under-\nstood to be granted to foreign sovereigns and their \nproperty. See Brunk, supra, at 676\u201379; Brunk Amicus \n3\u20137.  \nContext, and the constitutional structure, reinforce \nthis understanding that foreign sovereigns are enti-\ntled to the protections of process in federal courts. \n \n5 The Solicitor General asserts that \u201cthe rationale underlying \nth[e]se decisions has ... been called into question.\u201d US Br. 22 n.5. \nBut the cited concurrence focuses on the oddity of granting con-\nstitutional significance to the Bancec test. GSS Grp., 680 F.3d at \n818 (Williams, J., joined by Randolph, J., concurring). \n\n39 \n \n \nArticle III grants foreign states the right to a forum in \nthe federal courts, by extending the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d to \ninclude \u201ccases\u201d involving \u201cforeign States.\u201d U.S. Const. \nart. III, \u00a7 2. The terms \u201ccase[]\u201d and \u201cjudicial Power\u201d be-\nstow limited powers on federal courts: The under-\nstanding at the Founding was that a \u201ccase\u201d existed and \n\u201cjudicial power\u201d was properly exercised only when a \ndefendant has been properly summoned and given no-\ntice. E.g., Osborne v. Bank of U.S., 22 U.S. (9 Wheat.) \n738, 819 (1824) (explaining that the \u201cjudicial Power\u201d is \n\u201ccapable of acting only when the subject is submitted \nto it by a party who asserts his rights in the form pre-\nscribed by law\u201d); see also Brunk, supra, at 661\u201369. By \nexpressly including \u201cforeign State[s]\u201d in Article III, the \nConstitution therefore contemplates that foreign sov-\nereigns are entitled to protection against arbitrary ex-\nercises of judicial power.  \nFinally, recognizing that foreign states are \u201cpersons\u201d \nentitled to object to a federal court\u2019s exercise of per-\nsonal jurisdiction is consistent with the congressional \njudgment expressed in the FSIA. Congress deemed for-\neign states to be artificial persons that, once stripped \nof sovereign immunity, could be subjected to \u201cclaim[s] \nfor relief in personam,\u201d and exercises of \u201c[p]ersonal ju-\nrisdiction.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(a)\u2013(b) (emphases added). \nCongress also provided that foreign states should be \n\u201cliable in the same manner and to the same extent as \na private individual\u201d when sovereign immunity does \nnot apply. Id. \u00a7 1606. That is, the FSIA treats foreign \nsovereigns that have been stripped of immunity on par \nwith all other persons, consistent with the constitu-\ntional tradition described by Professor Brunk. \n2. Devas, Intervenors, and the United States main-\ntain that foreign sovereigns are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled \nto object to a federal court\u2019s exercise of personal \n\n40 \n \n \njurisdiction under the Fifth Amendment. Their argu-\nments are misguided. \nThey first argue that the term \u201cperson does not in-\nclude the sovereign\u201d in \u201ccommon usage.\u201d Intervenors \nBr. 30 (internal quotation marks omitted); see also De-\nvas Br. 36; US Br. 27. \u201cBut there is no hard and fast \nrule of exclusion,\u201d so \u201csubject matter\u201d and \u201ccontext\u201d are \nthe ultimate guide. United States v. Cooper Corp., 312 \nU.S. 600, 604\u201305 (1941). And the context here includes \nthe originalist evidence that foreign states were rou-\ntinely discussed as \u201cpersons\u201d to whom legal \u201cprocess\u201d \ncould be applied, as well as Congress\u2019s similar judg-\nment in the text of the FSIA.  \nAgainst that evidence, Devas and Intervenors main-\ntain that the Framers would not likely \u201chave viewed \nforeign states as persons\u201d because \u201cforeign sovereigns \nwere treated as completely immune from suit at the \ntime of the founding.\u201d Intervenors Br. 31 (quoting \nChildress III, Questioning the Constitutional Rights of \nForeign Nations, 88 Fordham L. Rev. Online 60, 70 \n(2019)); see also Devas Br. 37\u201338. But that is beside \nthe point. Sure, foreign states were generally immune \nat the Founding. But the FSIA strips immunity, so the \napt historical parallel is whether foreign states\u2014when \nnot treated as immune\u2014were juridical \u201cpersons\u201d enti-\ntled to \u201cdue process.\u201d The evidence shows that, alt-\nhough sovereigns \u201cgenerally enjoy[ed] a personal im-\nmunity,\u201d they \u201cmay become liable to judicial process.\u201d \nThe Santissima Trinidad, 20 U.S. at 353; see also \nBrunk Amicus 3 n.2 (responding to Professor Chil-\ndress).  \nNor does the drafting history of the Fifth Amend-\nment overcome the original evidence that foreign sov-\nereigns were \u201cpersons.\u201d It is neither here nor there \nthat the initial proposed text of the Fifth Amendment \n\n41 \n \n \nchanneled the Magna Carta by providing due-process \nrights to any \u201cFreeman.\u201d US Br. 30. The drafters \nwisely abandoned that historically freighted term in \nfavor of a more universal term, \u201cperson.\u201d And \u201cperson\u201d \nundeniably encompasses foreign persons and entities \nthat never would have qualified as \u201cFreemen\u201d in King \nJohn\u2019s day. \nFinding scant support in text and history, Devas and \nIntervenors rely largely on an inapt analogy between \nStates of the Union and foreign sovereigns. Devas Br. \n35\u201337; Intervenors Br. 30\u201334. They draw on a state-\nment in Weltover \u201cassuming without deciding, that a \nforeign state is a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due Pro-\ncess Clause\u201d and adding a \u201ccf.\u201d citation to South Caro-\nlina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323\u201324 (1966). Kat-\nzenbach rejected a due-process attack on the Voting \nRights Act of 1965 by holding (without more) that \n\u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the context of the Due Process \nClause of the Fifth Amendment cannot, by any reason-\nable mode of interpretation, be expanded to encompass \nthe States of the Union.\u201d 383 U.S. at 323.  \nPetitioners, like several lower courts, suggest that \nthe Weltover cf. means that foreign states are not \u201cper-\nsons\u201d under the Due Process Clause, because it would \nbe anomalous \u201cto afford greater Fifth Amendment \nrights to foreign nations, who are entirely alien to our \nconstitutional system, than are afforded to the states, \nwho help make up the very fabric of that system.\u201d Price \nv. Socialist People\u2019s Libyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d \n82, 96 (D.C. Cir. 2002). That does not follow. Foreign \ncitizens and foreign corporations are generally alien to \nour constitutional system too. E.g., United States v. \nVerdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. 259, 264\u201371 (1990). Yet it \nis deeply established that foreign individuals and ju-\nridical entities acquire limited due-process and other \n\n42 \n \n \nconstitutional rights, depending on the nature and ex-\ntent of their interaction with the United States.  See \nsupra p. 30. The same should be true for foreign sover-\neigns. They cannot claim due-process protection al-\nways and everywhere. But in the exceptional circum-\nstance where a foreign sovereign is haled into federal \ncourt and stripped of immunity, it has the ordinary \ndue-process right of juridical entities, both foreign and \ndomestic, to object to personal jurisdiction. \n To so hold would not grant foreign sovereigns greater \nrights than States. States are better off\u2014they enjoy \nnear-complete immunity from unconsented suit under \nthe Constitution. See PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New \nJersey, 594 U.S. 482, 500 (2021). And, as the United \nStates emphasizes, \u201cit is critically important\u201d that a \nforeign sovereign \u201cmade a party to federal litigation\u201d \nreceive a \u201cfair adjudicatory process.\u201d US Br. 32\u201333. \nThat aim is best achieved by recognizing that foreign \nsovereigns have the same rights as other litigants to \ninterpose personal-jurisdiction objections when they \nappear as civil defendants in U.S. courts. \nFinally, the United States maintains that the Con-\nstitution cedes \u201cto the political Branches\u201d determina-\ntions about what process foreign sovereigns are due. \nId. at 32. It looks for support in cases stating that in \nmatters of foreign relations, Congress and the Presi-\ndent enjoy near-exclusive authority, and that the judi-\nciary must generally defer to their judgments. Id. But \n\u201clike every other governmental power,\u201d the authority \nto conduct \u201cinternational relations \u2026 must be exer-\ncised in subordination to the applicable provisions of \nthe Constitution,\u201d United States v. Curtiss-Wright \nExp. Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936), including the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause, see, e.g., Haig \nv. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 307 (1981) (entertaining due-\n\n43 \n \n \nprocess challenge to revocation of an individual U.S. \npassport); Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222, 243 (1984) \n(same). So the political Branches\u2019 leading role in for-\neign affairs does not remotely short-circuit due-process \nprotections.  \nIt is also important to recognize that a holding that \nthe Fifth Amendment requires some connection be-\ntween the defendant and the forum when a plaintiff \nseeks a civil commercial judgment against a foreign \nsovereign would not constrain the federal government \nin other domains. As this Court has \u201cstressed repeat-\nedly,\u201d \u201c\u200adue process is flexible, ... and it calls for such \nprocedural protections as the particular situation de-\nmands.\u201d Jennings v. Rodriguez, 583 U.S. 281, 314 \n(2018) (cleaned up). The Court\u2019s conclusion here there-\nfore would not dictate what due process demands in \nother contexts. Contra U.S. Br. 31. Especially mis-\nplaced is the Solicitor General\u2019s concern about con-\nstraining the Executive and Legislative Branches in \ntheir dealings with \u201chostile states\u201d and \u201cstate spon-\nsor[s] of terrorism.\u201d US Br. 31. This Court has held \nthat hostilities and wartime can affect the constitu-\ntional rights of foreign citizens. E.g., Eisentrager, 339 \nU.S. at 771 (the constitutional \u201cprotection enjoyed \nwhile the nation of [an alien\u2019s] allegiance remains in \namity with the United States are greatly impaired \nwhen his nation takes up arms against us\u201d); Ludecke \nv. Watkins, 335 U.S. 160, 171 (1948) (rejecting consti-\ntutional challenge to deportation without judicial re-\nview during continuing post-war hostilities). It is no \nleap to say that the same is true for foreign sovereigns.  \nBut questions about wartime and terrorism can be \nreadily reserved for cases that present them. At stake \nhere is the application of ordinary personal-jurisdic-\ntion principles to a typical setting\u2014a civil commercial \n\n44 \n \n \ndispute. The right answer is for the Court to affirm the \nNinth Circuit\u2019s judgment on the narrow ground that \nforeign states are entitled to object under the Fifth \nAmendment to a federal court\u2019s exercise of personal ju-\nrisdiction and that permitting jurisdiction here\u2014\nwhere Antrix and the dispute lack a sufficient connec-\ntion to the United States\u2014would offend due process. \nC. Antrix Did Not Consent To Personal Ju-\nrisdiction. \nFinally, Devas and amici argue that personal juris-\ndiction is proper, because Antrix consented to confir-\nmation of the arbitral award in U.S. court. Antrix \nnever consented to personal jurisdiction.  \n1. Devas, backed by some amici, proffers a sweeping \ntheory: that Congress \u201cdeem[ed] foreign states\u201d to \nhave consented to suit here by signing an arbitration \nagreement that is subject to the New York Convention \nor that satisfies one of the arbitration exception\u2019s other \nenumerated conditions. Devas Br. 40\u201341. In the same \nvein, according to Petitioners\u2019 amici, a sovereign party \nthat signs an arbitration agreement consents to suits \nconfirming the resulting award in the arbitral forum \nand in all \u201cother states that have a treaty obligation to \nenforce the award.\u201d Feldman Amicus 9; see also \nBjorklund Amicus 24\u201326.  \nDevas\u2019s argument falters at the threshold (even as-\nsuming the Convention applies), because consent is \nthe wrong framework for understanding the arbitra-\ntion exception. The United States, as amicus in an-\nother case, recently explained that the \u201cplain text of \nthe arbitration exception indicates that it was in-\ntended to displace the waiver exception\u201d to sovereign \nimmunity at Section 1605(a)(1). U.S. Amicus Br. at \n22\u201323, Nextera Energy Glob. Holdings B.V. v. \n\n45 \n \n \nKingdom of Spain, no. 23-7031 (D.C. Cir. Feb. 2, 2024) \n(Nextera Amicus). \u201c[A]t a minimum, application of \nwaiver principles in arbitration cases should not be \nbased on conditions described in subparagraphs (A) \nthrough (C)\u201d of the arbitration exception, which (un-\nlike subparagraph (D)) make no reference to waiver. \nId. Yet that is precisely what Devas seeks to do. \nDevas is wrong. Antrix\u2019s \u201cagreement to arbitrate in \none forum\u201d\u2014India\u2014does not \u201cconstitute[] a waiver of \nthe right to challenge personal jurisdiction in another\u201d \nforum\u2014the United States. Creighton Ltd. v. Gov\u2019t of \nQatar, 181 F.3d 118, 126 (D.C. Cir. 1999). That is so \nnotwithstanding that India and the United States are \nparties to the New York Convention, which provides \nfor confirmation of certain arbitral awards issued in \nother signatory states. Devas and amici\u2019s contrary the-\nory is that, by becoming a party to the Convention, a \ncountry waives personal jurisdiction in the courts of \nover 150 Convention signatory states for all citizens \nand domestic corporations for all awards resulting \nfrom all arbitral contracts touched by that Convention. \nUnsurprisingly, \u201ccircuits that have considered this is-\nsue agree\u201d that due process is not automatically satis-\nfied by a sovereign\u2019s Convention signature. First Inv. \nCorp., 703 F.3d at 750 (citing cases). And the United \nStates has cautioned against finding immunity waived \nin the same circumstance, because of the \u201cimplications \nfor the treatment of the United States\u201d\u2014and U.S. com-\npanies\u2014\u201cin foreign courts.\u201d  Nextera Amicus 24 (quot-\ning Process & Indus. Devs. Ltd. v. Fed. Republic of Ni-\ngeria, No. 21-7003 (D.C. Cir. 2022)). \n2. Apparently unwilling to endorse Devas\u2019s sweeping \nconsent theory, the Solicitor General advances a fact-\nbound one: that Antrix \u201cconsented to personal jurisdic-\ntion in this case\u201d by agreeing in its contract with Devas \n\n46 \n \n \nthat \u201cany resulting arbitral award,\u201d US Br. 24, \u201cshall \nbe ... entitled to be enforced to the fullest extent per-\nmitted by Laws and entered in any court of competent \njurisdiction,\u201d C.A. E.R. 252. The Solicitor General (at \n24) suggests that federal district courts are \u201ccourts of \ncompetent jurisdiction.\u201d Thus, Antrix must have con-\nsented to suit in U.S. court when it signed the contract. \nThis novel theory fails to engage with all the rele-\nvant contract language. The clause references not just \n\u201ccourt[s] of competent jurisdiction,\u201d but also \u201cLaws\u201d\u2014\nmeaning the \u201cLaws of India.\u201d C.A. E.R. 252; see also \nid. at 251 (\u201cThis Agreement \u2026, shall be subject to and \nconstrued in accordance with the Laws of India.\u201d).  \nTaken in context, the provision is best read as an \nagreement to subsequent proceedings in any Indian \ncourt of competent jurisdiction. True to those words, \nthe parties engaged in years-long proceedings in India, \nwhich concluded that the award could not stand. If an-\nything, Devas by those words waived any right to pur-\nsue enforcement in the U.S.  \nThe Solicitor General\u2019s tribal-law case actually sup-\nports Antrix\u2019s construction. US Br. 25\u201326. The con-\ntract there selected the law of Oklahoma and the \ncourts of Oklahoma to govern any dispute. See Citizen \nBand, 532 U.S. at 418\u201320. The contract here selects \nthe laws of India, and the analogous reading is that \nthe parties chose the courts of India too. Not to men-\ntion, Citizen Band emphasizes that \u201cto relinquish its \nimmunity, a [sovereign\u2019s] waiver must be clear.\u201d Id. at \n418. Nothing about the contract \u201cclear[ly]\u201d waives An-\ntrix\u2019s immunity.  \nFinally, the notion that Antrix, by this one line, con-\nsented not only to jurisdiction in the United States, but \nalso in over 150 Convention countries at once, is dra-\nmatically unsound. That is not how the United States \n\n47 \n \n \nand its instrumentalities relinquish immunities, and \nthat is not how foreign countries and foreign instru-\nmentalities \nrelinquish \ntheir \nimmunities \neither. \n\u201c[P]rinciples of comity and reciprocity\u201d thus favor An-\ntrix here. US Br. 32. \nIII. ALTERNATIVELY, THE COURT SHOULD \nAFFIRM THE NINTH CIRCUIT\u2019S JUDG-\nMENT ON ALTERNATIVE GROUNDS.  \nIf the Court declines to affirm the Ninth Circuit\u2019s \njudgment on either statutory or constitutional \ngrounds, then it should affirm on one of two alterna-\ntive grounds bypassed by the Ninth Circuit.  \nA. The Arbitral Award No Longer Exists.  \nThe Indian court of competent jurisdiction set aside \nthe arbitral award that Devas seeks to confirm in this \ncase. The set-aside of the award rendered it unenforce-\nable in U.S. court. See 9 U.S.C. \u00a7 207; N.Y. Convention \nart. V(1)(e). After all, a court cannot confirm an arbi-\ntral award that \u201cdoes not exist to be enforced.\u201d Ter-\nmoRio S.A. E.S.P. Electranta S.P., 487 F.3d 928, 935\u2013\n36 (D.C. Cir. 2007). Only twice have circuit courts re-\nfused to recognize a set-aside as \u201crepugnant to funda-\nmental notions of what is decent and just.\u201d See Corpo-\nracion Mexicana De Mantenimiento Integral, S. De \nR.L. De C.V. v. Pemex-Exploracion Y Produccion, 832 \nF.3d 92, 106\u201310 (2d Cir. 2016); Compania de Inver-\nsiones Mercantiles S.A. v. Grupo Cementos de Chihua-\nhua S.A.B. de C.V., 58 F.4th 429, 460\u201361 (10th Cir. \n2023). That U.S. public-policy \u201cstandard is high, and \ninfrequently met.\u201d Esso Expl. & Prod. Nigeria Ltd. v. \nNigerian Nat\u2019l Petrol. Corp. 40 F.4th 56, 73-74 (2d Cir. \n2022) (internal quotation omitted). No such showing \ncould be made here, where the set-aside decision was \nthorough and affirmed by the Indian Supreme Court. \n\n48 \n \n \nThis set-aside decision issued while Antrix\u2019s appeal \nwas pending, and the Ninth Circuit declined to ad-\ndress the set-aside in disposing of the case for lack of \npersonal jurisdiction. But this Court could make clear \nthat there is no longer an arbitral \u201caward\u201d to \u201ccon-\nfirm.\u201d 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1605(a)(6).  \nB. Forum Non Conveniens And Comity Com-\npel Dismissal. \nForum non conveniens allows a federal court to \u201cdis-\nmiss an action on the ground that a court abroad is the \nmore appropriate and convenient forum for adjudicat-\ning the controversy.\u201d Sinochem Int\u2019l Co. v. Malaysia \nInt\u2019l Shipping Corp., 549 U.S. 422, 425 (2007). Below, \nAntrix maintained that India was the better forum \nand urged dismissal for forum non conveniens. The dis-\ntrict court disagreed. Pet.App.15a. The Ninth Circuit \ndid not review that conclusion.  \n \u201cThis is a textbook case for immediate forum non \nconveniens dismissal.\u201d Sinochem, 549 U.S. at 435.  The \naward Devas sought to confirm was made by a tribunal \nconvened in India, under an agreement between two \nIndian \ncompanies \nfor \nperformance \nin \nIndia. \nPet.App.7a. The parties selected the courts of India in \ntheir contract to determine the enforceability of any \narbitral award. See supra p. 46. An Indian court set \naside the award.  \nIn those circumstances, \u201c[j]udicial economy is dis-\nserved by continuing litigation in the [district court] \ngiven the proceedings long launched in [India].\u201d Sino-\nchem, 549 U.S. at 435. Moreover, confirmation of an \narbitral award arising out of a contract between In-\ndian parties to be performed in India, addressing a \nsovereign subject matter, the alleged breach of which \n\n49 \n \n \nwas triggered by a sovereign act of India, \u201cis an issue \nbest left for determination by the [Indian] courts.\u201d Id. \nThis Court has \u201cdiscretion to respond at once to\u201d An-\ntrix\u2019s \u201cforum non conveniens plea and need not take up \nfirst any other threshold objection.\u201d Id. at 425; see also \nid. at 432 (forum non conveniens may be reached be-\nfore \u201csubject-matter and personal jurisdiction\u201d).  \nFinally, and separate from forum non conveniens, \nconsiderations of international comity warrant dismis-\nsal. There is a true conflict between the Indian court\u2019s \norder setting aside the arbitral award (in a dispute in-\nvolving India\u2019s sovereign spectrum ownership and In-\ndia\u2019s sovereign interests in defeating frauds against its \nfisc) and the U.S. decision confirming that same \naward. Cf. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 \nU.S. 764, 798 (1993).  \n \n\n50 \n \n \nCONCLUSION \nFor the foregoing reasons, this Court should affirm \nthe judgment of the Ninth Circuit. \n \n \n \n \n Respectfully submitted, \n \n \nCARTER G.

          "task_beliefs": "This observation, being an internal reflection on my current knowledge state, does not introduce new facts about the *CC/Devas v. Antrix* case. Therefore, my task-level beliefs remain stable, but the observation has sharpened my focus on the most critical area of uncertainty.\n\nMy understanding of the petitioner's (Devas's) case remains structured around their two primary arguments for reversal:\n1.  **Statutory Argument:** The petitioner's case is anchored in the plain text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b). They argue the phrase \"Personal jurisdiction... **shall exist**\" is a mandatory directive that automatically confers personal jurisdiction once the statute's two conditions are met: (1) subject-matter jurisdiction exists under an FSIA exception, and (2) service of process is properly made under \u00a7 1608. The petitioner contends the Ninth Circuit erred by adding a non-textual \"minimum contacts\" requirement, contravening the clear statutory language.\n2.  **Constitutional Argument:** As a secondary position, the petitioner argues that the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the source of the minimum contacts doctrine, does not apply to foreign sovereign states. They assert that foreign states are not considered \"persons\" for the purpose of this constitutional protection. The decision to subject a foreign state to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts is a matter of comity, governed by the political branches through the FSIA, not a constitutional right held by the foreign state.\n\nThis observation has crystallized the fact that my entire model of the case is currently one-sided. The most significant gap in my knowledge\u2014the \"known unknown\"\u2014is the complete absence of the respondent's (Antrix's) counter-arguments. To make any credible prediction, I must understand how Antrix will rebut the petitioner's seemingly strong textual and constitutional claims. My confidence in a final prediction is therefore low, pending the acquisition of this critical opposing viewpoint.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, while not adding new case facts, provides a significant refinement to my meta-level strategy. It validates my existing heuristics and adds a new, crucial layer of meta-cognition.\n\nMy core design beliefs have evolved and are now more robust:\n1.  **Primacy of Primary Sources:** The initial heuristic\u2014**to begin analysis by consulting primary source briefs**\u2014has been powerfully validated. The petitioner's brief provided a high-fidelity map of their legal strategy, which would have been difficult to assemble from secondary sources.\n2.  **Sequential Analysis Strategy:** The success of the first step has reinforced my procedural belief that **the most efficient path to modeling a case is to sequentially analyze the primary briefs: (1) Petitioner, (2) Respondent, and (3) U.S. as Amicus Curiae (if filed).** This structured approach builds a comprehensive understanding of the direct legal conflict.\n3.  **NEW - The Value of Meta-Cognitive Assessment:** This `THINK` action itself demonstrates a new, valuable heuristic: **Periodically pause to perform a meta-cognitive check. This involves summarizing current beliefs, explicitly identifying the most significant uncertainty, and planning the next action to directly target that uncertainty for maximum information gain.** This observation confirmed that after analyzing the petitioner's brief, the single greatest uncertainty is the respondent's position. My next action is now clearly defined as analyzing the respondent's brief, which serves the dual purpose of filling my largest task-level knowledge gap (\u03b8) and testing the next step of my sequential analysis strategy (D). This reflective step ensures the research process is deliberate, efficient, and targeted, rather than a random walk through available information."

This has significantly updated my task model (\u03b8). My design model (D) has also been refined, confirming the value of sequential brief analysis and adding a new heuristic to always look for alternative grounds for affirmance. The single most important piece of missing information now is the position of the United States, as expressed by the Solicitor General (SG). The SG's view is highly influential in cases involving the interpretation of federal statutes, especially those with foreign policy implications like the FSIA. Obtaining the SG's brief will provide a powerful signal about the likely outcome and will test my design-level belief about the high predictive value of the SG's position.

This structured planning makes the overall prediction process more efficient and robust.\n\nDesign EIG (0.6): The action has high value for the design model (D).

This solidifies the 'Petitioner -> Respondent -> SG' sequence as a core heuristic, representing a significant improvement in the agent's general methodology.\n\nJoint EIG (0.9): The action is highly valuable overall because it represents a sophisticated step in the DBOED process.

        "current_beliefs": {
          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of this case has evolved significantly from a one-sided view of the petitioner's claims to a balanced, two-sided model of the core legal conflict. The acquisition of the respondent's brief has filled the critical knowledge gap I previously identified.\n\nMy initial understanding, based on the petitioner's (Devas's) brief, remains intact and forms one side of the legal equation:\n1.  **Petitioner's Statutory Argument:** The plain text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) (\"Personal jurisdiction... **shall exist**\") is a mandatory, non-discretionary command. If the conditions for subject-matter jurisdiction under an FSIA exception are met and service is proper, personal jurisdiction is automatically conferred. The Ninth Circuit erred by imposing an extra-textual \"minimum contacts\" requirement.\n2.  **Petitioner's Constitutional Argument:** The Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause, which is the source of the minimum contacts test, does not apply to foreign sovereign states because they are not \"persons\" entitled to that protection. The jurisdiction of U.S. courts over foreign states is a matter of international comity, which Congress has codified via the FSIA.\n\nThe respondent's (Antrix's) brief provides the direct counter-arguments, creating a complete picture of the dispute:\n1.  **Respondent's Statutory Counter-Argument:** The arbitration exception itself, \u00a7 1605(a)(6), contains an implicit U.S. nexus requirement. It requires the dispute to \"concern[] a subject matter capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of the United States.\" Antrix argues this phrase links the FSIA to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which governs only matters involving U.S. \"commerce.\" Since this case involves two Indian companies and a contract performed in India, it is purely foreign commerce and falls outside the scope of the exception. This argument is buttressed by the presumption against extraterritoriality and the canon that waivers of sovereign immunity must be construed narrowly.\n2.  **Respondent's Constitutional Counter-Argument:** The Due Process Clause provides an independent, constitutional basis for requiring minimum contacts.\n    *   **Antrix as a \"Person\":** Antrix argues that as a \"separate legal person\" and a foreign corporation, it is a \"person\" entitled to Due Process protection under the Fifth Amendment, citing precedents like *Omni Capital* and *Daimler*. Its status as a \"foreign state\" for immunity purposes under the FSIA does not strip it of its constitutional rights as a corporation.\n    *   **No Consent:** Agreeing to arbitrate in India under Indian law does not constitute a clear and unambiguous waiver of its constitutional due process rights or consent to jurisdiction in the United States.\n3.  **Alternative Grounds for Affirmance (Off-Ramps):** Antrix presents two powerful alternative arguments for why the Court should affirm the Ninth Circuit's judgment even without reaching the main legal questions.\n    *   **Annulled Award:** The arbitral award Devas seeks to confirm has been set aside and annulled by the Supreme Court of India. Therefore, there is no legally existing award for a U.S. court to enforce.\n    *   **Forum Non Conveniens/Comity:** The dispute is entirely between Indian parties, governed by Indian law, and has already been adjudicated by Indian courts. Principles of comity and convenience strongly favor dismissal, leaving the matter to the Indian legal system.\n\nMy confidence in a final prediction is now moderate. The case presents a classic conflict between a strict textualist reading of a statute (\u00a7 1330(b)) and a more structural/contextual reading that incorporates constitutional avoidance, canons of construction, and background legal principles (Due Process, comity). Antrix has multiple, independently plausible paths to victory (statutory, constitutional, and the alternative \"off-ramp\" grounds), whereas Devas's success appears to hinge on the Court adopting its very strong, literalist interpretation of \u00a7 1330(b). The fact that the Indian Supreme Court has already nullified the award is a significant real-world fact that may weigh heavily on the Justices.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation has powerfully validated and refined my meta-level strategy for analyzing Supreme Court cases. My methodology has become more robust and structured.\n\n1.  **Primacy of Primary Sources (Reinforced):** The initial heuristic to prioritize primary source briefs (Petitioner, Respondent, Amicus) over secondary analysis continues to be the most effective foundation for building an accurate case model. This observation confirms that direct engagement with the parties' own arguments is indispensable.\n2.  **Sequential Analysis Strategy (Strongly Validated):** My procedural belief in a sequential analysis\u2014**(1) Petitioner, (2) Respondent, (3) U.S. as Amicus Curiae**\u2014has been proven highly effective. Analyzing the petitioner's brief first allowed me to map the claims, and this observation, by providing the respondent's brief, allowed me to directly overlay the counter-arguments. This structured approach prevents confusion and builds a comprehensive model of the legal conflict step-by-step.\n3.  **The Value of Meta-Cognitive Assessment (Reinforced):** The heuristic of pausing to perform a meta-cognitive check has again proven its worth. My previous assessment correctly identified the respondent's arguments as the single greatest uncertainty. By explicitly targeting this \"known unknown,\" my subsequent action (searching for the respondent's brief) yielded the maximum possible information gain, efficiently moving my model from one-sided to two-sided.\n4.  **NEW - Modeling Legal Conflict as Argument/Counter-Argument Pairs:** A crucial refinement to my analytical method is to structure my understanding not as a simple list of arguments, but as a set of corresponding pairs. For each of petitioner's core claims (e.g., the statutory text of \u00a7 1330(b) is absolute), I now have the direct rebuttal from the respondent (e.g., the text of \u00a7 1605(a)(6) implicitly limits \u00a7 1330(b)). This adversarial structure is the fundamental unit of analysis for predicting the outcome of a case.\n5.  **NEW - Identifying \"Off-Ramps\" and Alternative Grounds:** A sophisticated case model must account for alternative grounds for a decision. The respondent's brief introduced arguments on the annulled award and forum non conveniens. These are potential \"off-ramps\" the Court can use to resolve the case narrowly, avoiding a broad ruling on the main constitutional or statutory questions. My future analysis of any case must include a specific search for and evaluation of these alternative dispositive arguments, as they represent a distinct and often appealing path for the Court."

The information gain is maximal because the action directly targets the largest known unknown.\n\nDesign EIG (0.90): This action serves as a direct experiment to test two recently refined design beliefs: 1) the high predictive value of the SG's brief in this category of cases, and 2) the utility of using actions to explicitly test strategic heuristics. Observing the content, reasoning, and influence of the SG's brief will provide powerful evidence to either validate or falsify the importance I have assigned to it.

Subsection (a) of \nthe Act\u2019s provision governing jurisdiction over civil ac-\ntions against foreign states provides that federal dis-\ntrict courts shall have original jurisdiction over claims \ncoming within one of the Act\u2019s exceptions to immunity.  \n28 U.S.C. 1330(a).  Subsection (b) of that provision fur-\nther provides that \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a for-\neign state shall exist as to every claim for relief over \nwhich the district courts have jurisdiction under subsec-\ntion (a) where service has been made under [28 U.S.C.] \n1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b).  The question presented is: \nWhether, as a statutory matter, the FSIA requires \nthat a plaintiff that has sued a foreign state under an \nFSIA exception to foreign sovereign immunity and that \nhas served the foreign state under 28 U.S.C. 1608 must \nalso establish that the foreign state has had minimum \ncontacts with the forum before the district court may \nexercise personal jurisdiction over the foreign state. \n \n\n(III) \nTABLE OF CONTENTS \nPage\nInterest of the United States....................................................... 1 \nStatement ...................................................................................... 1 \nSummary of argument ............................................................... 10 \nArgument: \nI. \nThe FSIA does not require a separate \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d analysis to establish personal jurisdiction \nover a foreign state ........................................................ 13 \nA.

Civil litigation against foreign sov-\nereigns in federal and state courts can have significant \nforeign-relations implications for the United States and \ncan affect the reciprocal treatment of the United States \nin the courts of other nations.  The United States thus \nhas a substantial interest in this case. \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. This case arises from a contractual dispute be-\ntween petitioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (De-\n\n2 \n \nvas) and respondent Antrix Corp. (respondent).  Devas \nis a private corporation established by a group of Amer-\nican investors and executives under the laws of the Re-\npublic of India.  23-1201 Pet. App. (Pet. App.) 17a, 53a.  \nRespondent\u2014an Indian corporation that markets goods \nand services for the Indian government\u2019s space agencies\n\u2014is wholly owned, and has much of its leadership ap-\npointed, by the Government of India.  Id. at 14a-15a, 53a. \nIn 2005, respondent entered into a contract with De-\nvas (20-36024 C.A. E.R. (E.R.) 246-253) to build, launch, \nand operate two communications satellites, from which \nrespondent would provide Devas with leased communi-\ncations bandwidth that Devas would then use to provide \naudio, video, and information services across India.  Id. \nat 246.  The contract\u2019s mandatory arbitration provision \napplies to \u201cany dispute or difference between the [p]art-\nies\u201d under the contract.  Id. at 251-252.  It provides that \nany resulting arbitral decision or award \u201cshall be final, \nbinding and conclusive on the Parties and entitled to be \nenforced to the fullest extent permitted by Laws and \nentered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at \n252; see Pet. App. 18a (reproducing provision). 0F1 \nIn 2011, respondent terminated the contract.  Pet \nApp. 18a.  Devas then commenced arbitration proceed-\nings under the International Chamber of Commerce \nrules of arbitration.  Id. at 18a-19a.  In 2015, an arbitral \npanel seated in New Delhi, India, found that respondent \nhad \u201cwrongfully repudiated\u201d the contract and entered a \nfinal arbitral award awarding Devas $562.5 million plus \ninterest.  Id. at 20a (citation and brackets omitted); see \nE.R. 54-156 (arbitral award). \n \n1 The contract defines \u201cLaws\u201d to mean \u201call laws, statutes, rules, \nregulations, ordinances, by-laws and other pronouncements having \nthe effect of law of India.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 2-1, at 129 (Sept. 13, 2018). \n\n3 \n \nb. The United States and India are parties to the \nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of \nForeign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention), done \nJune 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, T.I.A.S. No. 6997.  Both \nnations have agreed under the Convention to recognize \nand enforce arbitral awards concerning \u201ccommercial\u201d \nlegal relationships made \u201cin the territory of [any other] \nContracting State.\u201d  Id. Art. I(3), 21 U.S.T. 2519; see id. \nnote, 21 U.S.T. 2563, 2566.  The Convention provides \nthat, with certain exceptions, each contracting state \n\u201cshall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce \nthem in accordance with the rules of procedure of the \nterritory where the award is relied upon.\u201d  Id. Arts. III \nand V, 21 U.S.T. 2519-2520. \nCongress implemented the New York Convention in \n1970 by directing that the Convention \u201cshall be enforced \nin United States courts in accordance with [9 U.S.C. \n201-208].\u201d  9 U.S.C. 201.  If a party to arbitration timely \napplies for an order confirming an \u201carbitral award fall-\ning under the Convention,\u201d a district court \u201cshall con-\nfirm the award\u201d unless \u201cit finds one of the grounds \n[specified in the Convention] for refusal or deferral of \nrecognition or enforcement of the award.\u201d  9 U.S.C. 207. \n2. In 2018, Devas petitioned the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Western District of Washington to \nconfirm the 2015 arbitral award.  20-36024 Intervenors\u2019 \nC.A. Supp. E.R. (Supp. E.R.) 75-90.  Devas argued that \njurisdiction and venue were proper under the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \n1330, 1391(f\u200a), 1441(d), 1602 et seq.  Supp. E.R. 77-78. \na. The FSIA provides \u201cthe sole basis for obtaining \njurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this \ncountry.\u201d  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Ship-\nping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434, 443 (1989).  The Act\u2019s def-\n\n4 \n \ninition of \u201c\u200a\u2018foreign state\u2019\u200a\u201d applies \u201c[f\u200a]or purposes of [28 \nU.S.C. 1602-1611]\u201d and where otherwise incorporated \nby reference, as in Section 1330.  28 U.S.C. 1603(a).  \nThat definition includes a foreign state, \u201ca political sub-\ndivision of a foreign state,\u201d and \u201can agency or instru-\nmentality of a foreign state.\u201d  Ibid.  An \u201c\u200a\u2018agency or in-\nstrumentality of a foreign state,\u2019\u200a\u201d in turn, is \u201cany en-\ntity\u201d (1) which is a \u201cseparate legal person, corporate or \notherwise\u201d; (2) \u201cwhich is an organ of a foreign state or \npolitical subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d or \u201ca majority of whose \nshares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign \nstate or political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d; and (3) which is \n\u201cneither a citizen of a State of the United States,\u201d \u201cnor \ncreated under the laws of any third country.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1603(b).  Under the FSIA, a \u201cforeign state\u201d as thus de-\nfined \u201cshall be immune from the jurisdiction\u201d of a fed-\neral or state court in a civil action, unless that action is \nexpressly permitted by certain international agree-\nments or by the FSIA\u2019s exceptions to foreign sovereign \nimmunity at 28 U.S.C. 1605-1607.  28 U.S.C. 1604; see \nTurkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. \n264, 272-273 (2023). \nAs relevant here, the FSIA includes an exception to \nforeign sovereign immunity, enacted in 1988, for certain \ncivil actions brought \u201ceither to enforce,\u201d or \u201cto confirm \nan award made pursuant to,\u201d \u201can agreement to arbi-\ntrate\u201d that has been \u201cmade by the foreign state with or \nfor the benefit of a private party\u201d with respect to \u201ca de-\nfined legal relationship\u201d concerning \u201ca subject matter \ncapable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6).  That excep-\ntion applies in four specified contexts, including where \n\u201cthe agreement or award is or may be governed by a \ntreaty or other international agreement in force for the \n\n5 \n \nUnited States calling for the recognition and enforce-\nment of arbitral awards.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6)(B). \nThe FSIA\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme\u201d gov-\nerning civil actions against foreign states includes pro-\nvisions addressing, inter alia, federal \u201csubject-matter \njurisdiction,\u201d \u201cpersonal jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cvenue.\u201d  Am-\nerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 & n.3 (citation omitted).  \nFirst, 28 U.S.C. 1330(a) vests federal district courts \nwith \u201coriginal jurisdiction without regard to amount in \ncontroversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign \nstate as defined in [S]ection 1603(a) * * * as to any claim \nfor relief in personam with respect to which the foreign \nstate is not entitled to immunity either under sections \n1605-1607 of [Title 28] or under any applicable interna-\ntional agreement.\u201d  Ibid. \nSecond, 28 U.S.C. 1330(b) provides that \u201c[p]ersonal \njurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every \nclaim for relief over which the district courts have juris-\ndiction under [Section 1330](a) where service has been \nmade under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b). \nThird, the FSIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated scheme * * * \naddresses venue,\u2019\u200a\u201d Turkiye Halk Bankasi, 598 U.S. at \n273, by specifying four categories of venue for \u201c[a] civil \naction against a foreign state as defined in [28 U.S.C.] \n1603(a).\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a).  Venue is proper \u201cin any \njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a sub-\nstantial part of property that is the subject of the action \nis situated.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(1).  If the action is \nagainst \u201can agency or instrumentality of a foreign \nstate,\u201d venue is also proper \u201cin any judicial district in \nwhich the agency or instrumentality is licensed to do \nbusiness or is doing business.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(3). \n\n6 \n \nb. Devas alleged that respondent was an \u201cagency or \ninstrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1603(b), \nbut that Devas\u2019s suit fell within Section 1605(a)(6)(B)\u2019s \nexception to sovereign immunity because Devas sought  \nto confirm an award made pursuant to respondent\u2019s ar-\nbitration agreement, which is governed by the New \nYork Convention.  Supp. E.R. 77-78.  Devas alleged that  \nsubject-matter and personal jurisdiction therefore were \nproper under Section 1330(a) and (b).  Id. at 78.  And \nDevas alleged that \u201c[v]enue is proper\u201d in the Western \nDistrict of Washington under the FSIA\u2019s venue provi-\nsion, because respondent \u201cengages in business in th[at] \ndistrict\u201d by contracting with companies having head-\nquarters in the district to sell respondent\u2019s \u201csatellite \nlaunch\u201d and \u201cspace communications services\u201d to cus-\ntomers.  Id. at 77-78. \nRespondent moved to dismiss the petition.  Respond-\nent did not dispute that it is a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the \nFSIA, that service had been properly made, or that the \nFSIA\u2019s arbitral exception applied.  Pet. App. 4a, 21a-\n22a, 54a.  Nor did respondent dispute that it was doing \nbusiness in the district or that venue therein was thus \nproper under Section 1391(f\u200a)(3).  Respondent instead \nargued that the Due Process Clause\u2019s constitutional re-\nquirement for personal jurisdiction requires \u201c\u200a\u2018minimum \ncontacts\u2019 with the United States\u201d but those contacts had \nnot been established.  Id. at 21a-22a; see id. at 13a. \nThe district court denied respondent\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss.  Pet. App. 13a-16a.  The court concluded that \u201cthe \ndue process clause does not apply\u201d on the ground that \n\u201c[respondent] is not a \u2018person\u2019 for due process purposes \nbecause it is effectively controlled by the Government \nof India,\u201d which \u201cexercises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over [re-\nspondent].\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a.  The court also declined to \n\n7 \n \ndismiss the action on forum-non-conveniens grounds, \nstating that post-arbitral-award \u201cinvestigations and \nproceedings against [Devas] and its officers and agents \nin India\u2014including both civil and criminal proceed-\nings\u2014raise * * * concerns about the neutrality of pro-\nceedings in India.\u201d  Id. at 15a. \nThe district court subsequently granted Devas\u2019s mo-\ntion to confirm the arbitral award.  Pet. App. 17a-35a.  \nThe court determined that it had subject-matter juris-\ndiction under Section 1330(a) based on the FSIA\u2019s arbi-\ntral exception in Section 1605(a)(6)(B).  Id. at 21a.  The \ncourt further determined that personal jurisdiction \nover respondent existed under Section 1330(b).  Id. at \n22a.\n\n[Document truncated - showing first 26,500 characters]\n\n",

Civil litigation against foreign sov-\nereigns in federal and state courts can have significant \nforeign-relations implications for the United States and \ncan affect the reciprocal treatment of the United States \nin the courts of other nations.  The United States thus \nhas a substantial interest in this case. \nSTATEMENT \n1. a. This case arises from a contractual dispute be-\ntween petitioner Devas Multimedia Private Ltd. (De-\n\n2 \n \nvas) and respondent Antrix Corp. (respondent).  Devas \nis a private corporation established by a group of Amer-\nican investors and executives under the laws of the Re-\npublic of India.  23-1201 Pet. App. (Pet. App.) 17a, 53a.  \nRespondent\u2014an Indian corporation that markets goods \nand services for the Indian government\u2019s space agencies\n\u2014is wholly owned, and has much of its leadership ap-\npointed, by the Government of India.  Id. at 14a-15a, 53a. \nIn 2005, respondent entered into a contract with De-\nvas (20-36024 C.A. E.R. (E.R.) 246-253) to build, launch, \nand operate two communications satellites, from which \nrespondent would provide Devas with leased communi-\ncations bandwidth that Devas would then use to provide \naudio, video, and information services across India.  Id. \nat 246.  The contract\u2019s mandatory arbitration provision \napplies to \u201cany dispute or difference between the [p]art-\nies\u201d under the contract.  Id. at 251-252.  It provides that \nany resulting arbitral decision or award \u201cshall be final, \nbinding and conclusive on the Parties and entitled to be \nenforced to the fullest extent permitted by Laws and \nentered in any court of competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Id. at \n252; see Pet. App. 18a (reproducing provision). 0F1 \nIn 2011, respondent terminated the contract.  Pet \nApp. 18a.  Devas then commenced arbitration proceed-\nings under the International Chamber of Commerce \nrules of arbitration.  Id. at 18a-19a.  In 2015, an arbitral \npanel seated in New Delhi, India, found that respondent \nhad \u201cwrongfully repudiated\u201d the contract and entered a \nfinal arbitral award awarding Devas $562.5 million plus \ninterest.  Id. at 20a (citation and brackets omitted); see \nE.R. 54-156 (arbitral award). \n \n1 The contract defines \u201cLaws\u201d to mean \u201call laws, statutes, rules, \nregulations, ordinances, by-laws and other pronouncements having \nthe effect of law of India.\u201d  D. Ct. Doc. 2-1, at 129 (Sept. 13, 2018). \n\n3 \n \nb. The United States and India are parties to the \nConvention on the Recognition and Enforcement of \nForeign Arbitral Awards (New York Convention), done \nJune 10, 1958, 21 U.S.T. 2517, T.I.A.S. No. 6997.  Both \nnations have agreed under the Convention to recognize \nand enforce arbitral awards concerning \u201ccommercial\u201d \nlegal relationships made \u201cin the territory of [any other] \nContracting State.\u201d  Id. Art. I(3), 21 U.S.T. 2519; see id. \nnote, 21 U.S.T. 2563, 2566.  The Convention provides \nthat, with certain exceptions, each contracting state \n\u201cshall recognize arbitral awards as binding and enforce \nthem in accordance with the rules of procedure of the \nterritory where the award is relied upon.\u201d  Id. Arts. III \nand V, 21 U.S.T. 2519-2520. \nCongress implemented the New York Convention in \n1970 by directing that the Convention \u201cshall be enforced \nin United States courts in accordance with [9 U.S.C. \n201-208].\u201d  9 U.S.C. 201.  If a party to arbitration timely \napplies for an order confirming an \u201carbitral award fall-\ning under the Convention,\u201d a district court \u201cshall con-\nfirm the award\u201d unless \u201cit finds one of the grounds \n[specified in the Convention] for refusal or deferral of \nrecognition or enforcement of the award.\u201d  9 U.S.C. 207. \n2. In 2018, Devas petitioned the United States Dis-\ntrict Court for the Western District of Washington to \nconfirm the 2015 arbitral award.  20-36024 Intervenors\u2019 \nC.A. Supp. E.R. (Supp. E.R.) 75-90.  Devas argued that \njurisdiction and venue were proper under the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act of 1976 (FSIA), 28 U.S.C. \n1330, 1391(f\u200a), 1441(d), 1602 et seq.  Supp. E.R. 77-78. \na. The FSIA provides \u201cthe sole basis for obtaining \njurisdiction over a foreign state in the courts of this \ncountry.\u201d  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess Ship-\nping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434, 443 (1989).  The Act\u2019s def-\n\n4 \n \ninition of \u201c\u200a\u2018foreign state\u2019\u200a\u201d applies \u201c[f\u200a]or purposes of [28 \nU.S.C. 1602-1611]\u201d and where otherwise incorporated \nby reference, as in Section 1330.  28 U.S.C. 1603(a).  \nThat definition includes a foreign state, \u201ca political sub-\ndivision of a foreign state,\u201d and \u201can agency or instru-\nmentality of a foreign state.\u201d  Ibid.  An \u201c\u200a\u2018agency or in-\nstrumentality of a foreign state,\u2019\u200a\u201d in turn, is \u201cany en-\ntity\u201d (1) which is a \u201cseparate legal person, corporate or \notherwise\u201d; (2) \u201cwhich is an organ of a foreign state or \npolitical subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d or \u201ca majority of whose \nshares or other ownership interest is owned by a foreign \nstate or political subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d; and (3) which is \n\u201cneither a citizen of a State of the United States,\u201d \u201cnor \ncreated under the laws of any third country.\u201d  28 U.S.C. \n1603(b).  Under the FSIA, a \u201cforeign state\u201d as thus de-\nfined \u201cshall be immune from the jurisdiction\u201d of a fed-\neral or state court in a civil action, unless that action is \nexpressly permitted by certain international agree-\nments or by the FSIA\u2019s exceptions to foreign sovereign \nimmunity at 28 U.S.C. 1605-1607.  28 U.S.C. 1604; see \nTurkiye Halk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. \n264, 272-273 (2023). \nAs relevant here, the FSIA includes an exception to \nforeign sovereign immunity, enacted in 1988, for certain \ncivil actions brought \u201ceither to enforce,\u201d or \u201cto confirm \nan award made pursuant to,\u201d \u201can agreement to arbi-\ntrate\u201d that has been \u201cmade by the foreign state with or \nfor the benefit of a private party\u201d with respect to \u201ca de-\nfined legal relationship\u201d concerning \u201ca subject matter \ncapable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of \nthe United States.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6).  That excep-\ntion applies in four specified contexts, including where \n\u201cthe agreement or award is or may be governed by a \ntreaty or other international agreement in force for the \n\n5 \n \nUnited States calling for the recognition and enforce-\nment of arbitral awards.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6)(B). \nThe FSIA\u2019s \u201ccomprehensive statutory scheme\u201d gov-\nerning civil actions against foreign states includes pro-\nvisions addressing, inter alia, federal \u201csubject-matter \njurisdiction,\u201d \u201cpersonal jurisdiction,\u201d and \u201cvenue.\u201d  Am-\nerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 & n.3 (citation omitted).  \nFirst, 28 U.S.C. 1330(a) vests federal district courts \nwith \u201coriginal jurisdiction without regard to amount in \ncontroversy of any nonjury civil action against a foreign \nstate as defined in [S]ection 1603(a) * * * as to any claim \nfor relief in personam with respect to which the foreign \nstate is not entitled to immunity either under sections \n1605-1607 of [Title 28] or under any applicable interna-\ntional agreement.\u201d  Ibid. \nSecond, 28 U.S.C. 1330(b) provides that \u201c[p]ersonal \njurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every \nclaim for relief over which the district courts have juris-\ndiction under [Section 1330](a) where service has been \nmade under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b). \nThird, the FSIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated scheme * * * \naddresses venue,\u2019\u200a\u201d Turkiye Halk Bankasi, 598 U.S. at \n273, by specifying four categories of venue for \u201c[a] civil \naction against a foreign state as defined in [28 U.S.C.] \n1603(a).\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a).  Venue is proper \u201cin any \njudicial district in which a substantial part of the events \nor omissions giving rise to the claim occurred, or a sub-\nstantial part of property that is the subject of the action \nis situated.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(1).  If the action is \nagainst \u201can agency or instrumentality of a foreign \nstate,\u201d venue is also proper \u201cin any judicial district in \nwhich the agency or instrumentality is licensed to do \nbusiness or is doing business.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(3). \n\n6 \n \nb. Devas alleged that respondent was an \u201cagency or \ninstrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d 28 U.S.C. 1603(b), \nbut that Devas\u2019s suit fell within Section 1605(a)(6)(B)\u2019s \nexception to sovereign immunity because Devas sought  \nto confirm an award made pursuant to respondent\u2019s ar-\nbitration agreement, which is governed by the New \nYork Convention.  Supp. E.R. 77-78.  Devas alleged that  \nsubject-matter and personal jurisdiction therefore were \nproper under Section 1330(a) and (b).  Id. at 78.  And \nDevas alleged that \u201c[v]enue is proper\u201d in the Western \nDistrict of Washington under the FSIA\u2019s venue provi-\nsion, because respondent \u201cengages in business in th[at] \ndistrict\u201d by contracting with companies having head-\nquarters in the district to sell respondent\u2019s \u201csatellite \nlaunch\u201d and \u201cspace communications services\u201d to cus-\ntomers.  Id. at 77-78. \nRespondent moved to dismiss the petition.  Respond-\nent did not dispute that it is a \u201cforeign state\u201d under the \nFSIA, that service had been properly made, or that the \nFSIA\u2019s arbitral exception applied.  Pet. App. 4a, 21a-\n22a, 54a.  Nor did respondent dispute that it was doing \nbusiness in the district or that venue therein was thus \nproper under Section 1391(f\u200a)(3).  Respondent instead \nargued that the Due Process Clause\u2019s constitutional re-\nquirement for personal jurisdiction requires \u201c\u200a\u2018minimum \ncontacts\u2019 with the United States\u201d but those contacts had \nnot been established.  Id. at 21a-22a; see id. at 13a. \nThe district court denied respondent\u2019s motion to dis-\nmiss.  Pet. App. 13a-16a.  The court concluded that \u201cthe \ndue process clause does not apply\u201d on the ground that \n\u201c[respondent] is not a \u2018person\u2019 for due process purposes \nbecause it is effectively controlled by the Government \nof India,\u201d which \u201cexercises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over [re-\nspondent].\u201d  Id. at 13a-14a.  The court also declined to \n\n7 \n \ndismiss the action on forum-non-conveniens grounds, \nstating that post-arbitral-award \u201cinvestigations and \nproceedings against [Devas] and its officers and agents \nin India\u2014including both civil and criminal proceed-\nings\u2014raise * * * concerns about the neutrality of pro-\nceedings in India.\u201d  Id. at 15a. \nThe district court subsequently granted Devas\u2019s mo-\ntion to confirm the arbitral award.  Pet. App. 17a-35a.  \nThe court determined that it had subject-matter juris-\ndiction under Section 1330(a) based on the FSIA\u2019s arbi-\ntral exception in Section 1605(a)(6)(B).  Id. at 21a.  The \ncourt further determined that personal jurisdiction \nover respondent existed under Section 1330(b).  Id. at \n22a.  After reiterating its constitutional due-process rul-\ning, ibid., the court alternatively held that there were \n\u201c\u200a\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 with the United States\u201d satisfying \ndue process because \u201cthe parties\u2019 entire course of dealing\u201d \nshowed that \u201c[r]espondent [had] purposely availed it-\nself of the privilege of conducting business activities in \nthe United States.\u201d  Id. at 22a-25a.  On the merits, the \ncourt found no ground under the New York Convention \nfor refusing to confirm the award.  Id. at 26a-34a.  The \ncourt confirmed the award, id. at 34a, and, in November \n2020, entered a $1.294 billion judgment for Devas, which \nincluded pre- and post-award interest, E.R. 5. \nc. In January 2021, while respondent\u2019s appeal of \nthat judgment was pending, the Government of India, \nin a proceeding initiated by respondent, placed Devas \ninto liquidation and \u201cappoint[ed] a government official\u201d \nto assume control of Devas on the ground that Devas \nhad fraudulently conducted its affairs.  22-35103 C.A. \nE.R. 278-279.  The liquidator promptly fired Devas\u2019s \noriginal counsel in this case.  Id. at 9, 279. \n\n8 \n \nTwo Devas shareholder entities and a United States \nsubsidiary of Devas\u2014the petitioners in No. 23-1201  \n(intervenors)\u2014were then granted leave to intervene in \nthe district court proceedings here.  22-35103 C.A. E.R. \n9, 277, 279, 287.  Following  discovery related to re-\nspondent\u2019s assets, the court authorized intervenors to \nregister the court\u2019s judgment in the Eastern District of \nVirginia, where intervenors had discovered one of re-\nspondent\u2019s debtors, Pet. App. 40a-41a.  Respondent and \nDevas (then, as now, under the liquidator\u2019s control) ap-\npealed that order.  Id. at 55a. \n4. a. The court of appeals consolidated the appeals \nand reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-12a.  The appellate panel \nobserved that \u201c[t]he parties agree that for purposes of \nthe FSIA, [respondent] is a \u2018foreign state,\u2019 service has \nbeen made, and an enumerated exception applies.\u201d  Id. \nat 4a.  But the panel determined that, under binding \nNinth Circuit precedent, \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction under \nthe FSIA requires satisfaction of the traditional mini-\nmum contacts standard\u201d borrowed from due-process ju-\nrisprudence.  Id. at 4a-5a (citation and brackets omit-\nted).  The court emphasized that its \u201capplication of the \nminimum contacts analysis to actions under the FSIA \n* * * is statutory rather than constitutional\u201d and does \nnot reflect a determination that \u201ca foreign state is * * * \na person\u201d for due-process purposes.  Id. at 5a.  The \ncourt explained that its precedent simply reflects a \n\u201creading of the FSIA\u201d that relies on \u201cthe FSIA\u2019s legis-\nlative history\u201d to conclude that \u201cthe FSIA was intended \nto be consistent with the minimum contacts analysis.\u201d  \nIbid. \nThe panel further determined that the district court \nhad erred in alternatively ruling that \u201c[respondent] has \nthe requisite minimum contacts with the United States,\u201d \n\n9 \n \nconcluding that Devas had failed to \u201cshow that [respon-\ndent] purposely availed itself of the privilege of conduct-\ning activities in the United States.\u201d  Pet. App. 6a-7a. \nb. Judge Miller, joined by Judge Koh, concurred.  \nPet. App. 9a-12a.  Judge Miller noted his agreement \nthat the court of appeals\u2019 binding precedent required \napplication of a minimum-contacts analysis as a statu-\ntory rather than a constitutional matter, but he found \nthat precedent to be erroneous because \u201c[n]othing in \n[Section 1330(b)]\u201d supports such \u201ca minimum-contacts re-\nquirement.\u201d  Id. at 9a-10a.  He explained that personal \njurisdiction exists under Section 1330(b)\u2019s \u201ccategorical[]\u201d \ntext where, as here, (1) an FSIA \u201cexception[] to foreign \nsovereign immunity\u201d applies and (2) the foreign state \nhas been \u201cproperly served.\u201d  Id. at 10a (citation omit-\nted).  Judge Miller also noted his agreement with the \nholdings of other courts of appeals that foreign states \ndo not have constitutional due-process rights.  Id. at 9a. \n5. The court of appeals denied rehearing en banc.  \nPet. App. 42a-68a.  Judge Bumatay, joined by five active \njudges, dissented.  Id. at 46a-68a.  Judge Bumatay \nstated that the \u201cstraightforward question\u201d in this case \nis whether the FSIA\u2014\u201c[d]espite [its] text\u201d\u2014requires \nproof of \u201c\u200a\u2018minimum contacts\u2019 to assert personal juris-\ndiction over a foreign state.\u201d  Id. at 47a.  He concluded \nthat nothing in Section 1330(b) requires that inquiry.  \nId. at 47a-49a, 57a-62a.  Judge Bumatay further stated \nthat \u201cforeign states\u201d are not entitled to \u201cthe protection \nof minimum contacts under the Fifth Amendment.\u201d  Id. \nat 49a; see id. at 62a-67a.  He emphasized that the only \nquestion before the court of appeals was whether \u201cmin-\nimum contacts\u201d must be proven to \u201cassert personal ju-\nrisdiction over foreign states under the FSIA,\u201d and \nthat, if the court had resolved that question in the neg-\n\n10 \n \native, the case could have been \u201cremanded to the dis-\ntrict court\u201d to decide any \u201cother questions\u201d that would \narise, such as whether respondent, as a \u201ccorporate\u201d en-\ntity, \u201cdeserves due process protection\u201d even if a \u201cfor-\neign state\u201d like India does not.  Id. at 56a & n.1. 1F2 \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \nI. The court of appeals erred in holding that, as a \nstatutory matter, the FSIA incorporates a \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d standard borrowed from constitutional due-\nprocess jurisprudence to govern personal jurisdiction \nover foreign states. \nA. The FSIA\u2019s jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C. \n1330, contains two subsections.  Subsection (a) grants \ndistrict courts subject-matter jurisdiction over civil ac-\ntions against foreign states as to any claim for which an \nexception to foreign sovereign immunity applies under \n28 U.S.C. 1605-1607.  Subsection (b) then provides that \n\u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction over a foreign state shall exist \nas to every claim for relief over which the district courts \nhave jurisdiction under subsection (a) where service has \nbeen made under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b).  \nTogether, those provisions supply personal jurisdiction \nover a foreign state whenever (1) an FSIA exception to \nimmunity applies and (2) service has been properly \nmade.  Nothing in that unambiguous text supports a \nfurther statutory minimum-contacts requirement. \nB. The court of appeals\u2019 contrary conclusion, which \nrests on legislative history, is flawed.  First, legislative \nhistory cannot be used to muddy the meaning of the \n \n2  While the case was pending on appeal, an Indian court set aside \nthe arbitration award to Devas.  See Pet. App. 55a.  The courts be-\nlow have not yet passed on the validity of that Indian court order or \nits effect on the merits of Devas\u2019s action. \n\n11 \n \nFSIA\u2019s clear statutory language.  And second, the court \nof appeals misread the pertinent committee report.  \nThat report merely reflects the view that the FSIA\u2019s \noriginal exceptions to foreign sovereign immunity, \nwhich Section 1330(b) incorporates by reference, would \nthemselves apply, as a practical matter, only in contexts \nin which minimum jurisdictional contacts would exist. \nC. Respondent contends (Br. in Opp. 16-17) that \n\u201cmost\u201d of the FSIA\u2019s exceptions to foreign sovereign \nimmunity in Sections 1605 to 1607 themselves require a \nsufficient \u201cnexus to the United States\u201d to satisfy any \ndue-process requirements.  That is correct.  But the \nconclusion that various FSIA exceptions to immunity \nimpose requirements that by their own terms would sat-\nisfy a due process \u201cminimum contacts\u201d standard pro-\nvides no basis for supplementing the statutory text with \na freestanding non-\u201cstatutory\u201d minimum-contacts re-\nquirement. \nII.  This Court should correct the court of appeals\u2019 \njudgment that the FSIA incorporates a traditional min-\nimum contacts analysis as a statutory matter and re-\nmand for that court to consider in the first instance \nwhether the Fifth Amendment\u2019s due-process require-\nments apply and, if so, whether they have been satisfied.  \nThat disposition would eliminate the division of author-\nity on the statutory question that warranted the Court\u2019s \nreview.  Several reasons also counsel against the Court \naddressing those constitutional questions at this time in \nthis case. \nIII.  A.  If this Court elects to address constitutional \ndue process at this time, the Court should follow its \nprior approach of assuming, without deciding, that a \nforeign state (including an agency or instrumentality \nthereof\u200a) is a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due Process \n\n12 \n \nClause, because, even if due-process principles are ap-\nplicable, personal jurisdiction over respondent is appro-\npriate.  The due-process requirement of personal juris-\ndiction is an individual right that may be waived or for-\nfeited, including through express or implied consent.  \nAnd in this case, respondent consented to personal ju-\nrisdiction by agreeing to a binding arbitration provision \nin its contract with Devas that provides that any arbi-\ntral award shall be entitled to be \u201centered in any court \nof competent jurisdiction.\u201d  Pet. App. 18a.  Federal dis-\ntrict courts are courts of competent jurisdiction, and no \nunfairness results from enforcing that contract accord-\ning to its terms. \nB. 1. If this Court elects to go still further, foreign \nstates themselves are not \u201cpersons\u201d under the Fifth \nAmendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  This Court has al-\nready held that States of the Union are not \u201cpersons\u201d \nunder that Clause.  Foreign states have even less of a \nbasis to claim due-process rights.  The word \u201cperson\u201d \nhas not typically been understood to include sovereign \nstates; the relevant drafting history suggests that sov-\nereign states are not protected by the Due Process \nClause; and the absence of any relevant role of foreign \nstates in our constitutional structure, as well as the per-\nfect equality of nation states, confirm that our domestic \nConstitution does not define the rights and duties of the \nUnited States with respect to foreign sovereigns. \n2. The practical implications of conferring due pro-\ncess rights on foreign states would have been signifi-\ncant.  Plenary Legislative and Executive authority is \nparticularly important for the management of disagree-\nments with foreign states.  The Constitution therefore \nleaves to the political Branches the authority to deter-\n\n13 \n \nmine what appropriate process should be followed with \nrespect to foreign states. \n3. It is critically important to the United States\u2019 own \ninterest in securing reciprocal treatment by foreign \nsovereigns, however, that foreign states understand \nthat the United States appropriately safeguards their \ninterests through non-constitutional means, including \nthrough various protections in the FSIA\u2019s comprehen-\nsive and carefully calibrated statutory framework. \nARGUMENT  \nI. THE FSIA DOES NOT REQUIRE A SEPARATE \u201cMINI-\nMUM CONTACTS\u201d ANALYSIS TO ESTABLISH PERSON-\nAL JURISDICTION OVER A FOREIGN STATE \nThe court of appeals held that\u2014as a \u201cstatutory ra-\nther than [a] constitutional\u201d matter\u2014the FSIA provides \nthat \u201c\u200a\u2018[p]ersonal jurisdiction\u2019\u200a\u201d over a foreign state \u201c\u200a\u2018re-\nquires satisfaction of the traditional minimum contacts \nstandard\u2019\u200a\u201d borrowed from constitutional due-process \njurisprudence.  Pet. App. 4a-5a (citation omitted).  That \nis incorrect.  By statute, personal jurisdiction over a for-\neign state exists if (1) a statutory exception exists to for-\neign sovereign immunity and (2) the foreign state has \nbeen served with process under 28 U.S.C. 1608.  See 28 \nU.S.C. 1330(a) and (b).  And because \u201c[t]he parties \nagree that for purposes of the FSIA, [respondent] is a \n\u2018foreign state,\u2019 service has been made, and an enumer-\nated exception [to immunity] applies,\u201d Pet. App. 4a, the \nFSIA\u2019s statutory prerequisites to personal jurisdiction \nhave been satisfied.  That straightforward conclusion is \nall that this Court need resolve in this case. \n\n14 \n \nA. Personal Jurisdiction Exists Where An FSIA Exception \nTo Immunity Applies And Proper Service Is Made \nThe FSIA\u2019s jurisdictional provision, 28 U.S.C. 1330, \nhas two subsections addressing, respectively, subject-\nmatter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.  Together, \nthose provisions unambiguously specify that personal \njurisdiction exists over a foreign state under the FSIA \nif, as is undisputed here (Pet. App. 4a), an FSIA excep-\ntion to foreign sovereign immunity applies and the for-\neign state has been properly served. \nFirst, Subsection (a) grants district courts \u201coriginal \njurisdiction\u201d over \u201cany nonjury civil action against a for-\neign state as defined in [S]ection 1603(a)\u201d as to \u201cany \nclaim for relief in personam with respect to which the \nforeign state is not entitled to immunity either under \n[28 U.S.C.] 1605-1607\u201d or \u201cunder any applicable inter-\nnational agreement.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(a).  That \u201cunam-\nbiguous\u201d language confers federal \u201csubject-matter ju-\nrisdiction\u201d over any such action if \u201cone of the [FSIA\u2019s] \nspecified exceptions to [foreign] sovereign immunity \napplies.\u201d  Verlinden B.V. v. Central Bank of Nigeria, \n461 U.S. 480, 489 (1983); see id. at 493-494 & n.20.  That \naffirmative grant of jurisdiction \u201cwork[s] in tandem\u201d \nwith 28 U.S.C. 1604, which \u201cbars federal and state \ncourts from exercising jurisdiction when a foreign state \nis entitled to immunity,\u201d i.e., when no exception to im-\nmunity applies.  Argentine Republic v. Amerada Hess \nShipping Corp., 488 U.S. 428, 434 (1989). \nSecond, Subsection (b) provides that \u201c[p]ersonal ju-\nrisdiction over a foreign state shall exist as to every \nclaim for relief over which the district courts have juris-\ndiction under subsection (a) where service has been \nmade under [28 U.S.C.] 1608.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1330(b).  The \nfirst half of that subsection\u2014which expressly limits \n\n15 \n \npersonal jurisdiction to those claims for which \u201cjurisdic-\ntion [exists] under subsection (a),\u201d ibid.\u2014ensures that \n\u201cpersonal jurisdiction, like subject-matter jurisdiction, \nexists only when one of the exceptions to foreign sover-\neign immunity in [Sections] 1605-1607 applies.\u201d  Amera-\nda Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 n.3.  \u201cThus, if none of the ex-\nceptions to sovereign immunity set forth in the Act ap-\nplies, the District Court lacks both statutory subject-\nmatter jurisdiction and personal jurisdiction.\u201d  Verlin-\nden, 461 U.S. at 485 n.5. \nThe second half of Subsection (b) further requires \nthat \u201cservice [must be] made under [S]ection 1608\u201d to \nestablish \u201c[p]ersonal jurisdiction\u201d over a foreign state.  \n28 U.S.C. 1330(b).  Section 1608, in turn, specifies the \nFSIA\u2019s hierarchy of statutorily required methods for \nserving a foreign state.  28 U.S.C. 1608(a) and (b); see \nRepublic of Sudan v. Harrison, 587 U.S. 1, 4-5, 8-13 \n(2019). \nIt follows that Section 1330(b) \u201cmakes personal ju-\nrisdiction over a foreign state automatic when [1] an ex-\nception to immunity applies and [2] service of process \nhas been [properly] accomplished.\u201d  Samatar v. Yousuf, \n560 U.S. 305, 324 n.20 (2010).  Nothing in the FSIA\u2019s \nunambiguous text permits the imposition of any further \nstatutory prerequisite to personal jurisdiction, much \nless a type of \u201cminimum contacts analysis\u201d borrowed \nfrom due-process jurisprudence that the court of ap-\npeals imposed as a \u201cstatutory rather than [a] constitu-\ntional\u201d matter, Pet. App. 4a-5a. \nB. The FSIA\u2019s Legislative History Provides No Basis For \nAn Independent \u201cMinimum Contacts\u201d Requirement \nThe court of appeals determined that its contrary \nprecedent rests on \u201ca reading of the FSIA\u2019s legislative \nhistory\u201d suggesting that Congress intended the FSIA \n\n16 \n \nto be \u201cconsistent with the minimum contacts analysis.\u201d  \nPet. App. 5a.  That reliance on legislative history is \ndeeply flawed for two reasons. \nFirst, as the foregoing discussion has shown, nothing \nin the FSIA\u2019s unambiguous text imposes any separate, \nfreestanding requirement of \u201cminimum contacts\u201d be-\ntween a foreign state and the United States as a predi-\ncate for personal jurisdiction over the foreign state.  \nThat should end the interpretive inquiry.  \u201cEven those \n[Members of the Court] who sometimes consult legisla-\ntive history will never allow it to be used,\u201d as here, \u201cto \n\u2018muddy\u2019 the meaning of \u2018clear statutory language.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nFood Mktg. Inst. v. Argus Leader Media, 588 U.S. 427, \n436 (2019) (citation omitted). \nSecond, as Judge Bumatay recognized, the Ninth \nCircuit\u2019s precedent simply misreads the legislative his-\ntory.  Pet. App. 48a, 60a-62a.  The relevant House of \nRepresentatives committee report that the precedent \ninvokes does not contemplate a freestanding \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d analysis that supplements the inquiries ex-\npressly specified in FSIA\u2019s text.  The report simply re-\nflects the view that the exceptions to immunity enacted \nin 1976 applied, as a practical matter, only in contexts \nin which the committee believed \u201cminimum jurisdic-\ntional contacts\u201d would exist. \nThe committee report states that Section 1330(b) \n\u201cembodie[s]\u201d the \u201cdue process requirement\u201d of \u201cmini-\nmum jurisdictional contacts\u201d because it \u201cincorporat[es] \nthese jurisdictional contacts by reference.\u201d  H.R. Rep. \nNo. 1487, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 (1976) (emphasis \nadded).  More specifically, the report states that Section \n1330(b) provides for personal jurisdiction only if there \nis \u201coriginal jurisdiction under section 1330(a)\u201d; that ju-\nrisdiction under Section 1330(a) exists only where the \n\n17 \n \nunderlying \u201cclaim [is one] for which the foreign state is \nnot entitled to immunity\u201d; and that, \u201c[s]ignificantly, \neach of the immunity provisions in the bill, [S]ections \n1605-1607, * * * prescribe[s] the necessary contacts \nwhich must exist before our courts can exercise per-\nsonal jurisdiction\u201d by requiring either \u201csome connection \nbetween the lawsuit and the United States[] or an ex-\npress or implied waiver\u201d of immunity.  Ibid. (emphasis \nadded); accord S. Rep. No. 1310, 94th Cong., 2d Sess. 13 \n(1976).  The report thus reflects the view that the \nFSIA\u2019s original exceptions to foreign sovereign immun-\nity, which Section 1330(b) incorporates by reference, \ngenerally apply in circumstances that would constitute \nminimum contacts under a due-process analysis.  The \nreport \u201csays nothing about a minimum-contacts analy-\nsis over and above satisfying a statutory exception\u201d in \nSections 1605-1607.  Pet. App. 61a-62a (Bumatay, J., \ndissenting).  Had Congress intended to impose a re-\nquirement for a separate minimum-contacts analysis, it \nwould have enacted text to that effect. \nC. The FSIA\u2019s Exceptions To Foreign Sovereign Immunity \nDo Not Impose An Independent Statutory \u201cMinimum \nContacts\u201d Requirement \n1. The Court\u2019s minimum-contacts jurisprudence has \ndeveloped under the Fourteenth Amendment, which \nprohibits \u201cany State\u201d from \u201cdepriv[ing] any person of \nlife, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. Amend. XIV, \u00a7 1.  Under this Court\u2019s deci-\nsions, if a defendant is a \u201cperson\u201d having such rights, \nibid, the Fourteenth Amendment permits \u201ca State [to] \nauthorize its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction \nover an out-of-state defendant\u201d where \u201cthe defendant \nhas \u2018certain minimum contacts with [the State] such \nthat the maintenance of the suit does not offend \u2018tradi-\n\n18 \n \ntional notions of fair play and substantial justice.\u2019\u200a\u201d  \nGoodyear Dunlop Tires Operations, S.A. v. Brown, 564 \nU.S. 915, 923 (2011) (quoting International Shoe Co. v. \nWashington, 326 U.S. 310, 316 (1945)) (brackets in orig-\ninal).  That restriction on \u201cstate [judicial] power\u201d is \ngrounded in an \u201c\u200a\u2018individual liberty interest\u2019\u200a\u201d protected \nby the Due Process Clause, Burger King Corp. v. \nRudzewicz, 471 U.S. 462, 471-472 & n.13 (1985) (citation \nomitted), although it also reflects the territorial \u201climits\u201d \nof each individual State\u2019s authority within our \u201cfederal \nsystem,\u201d World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson, \n444 U.S. 286, 292 (1980). \nThe Fourteenth Amendment\u2019s limit on personal ju-\nrisdiction often applies indirectly in civil actions in fed-\neral court because, by rule, service of a summons \u201ces-\ntablishes personal jurisdiction over a defendant\u201d who \nwould be \u201csubject to the jurisdiction of a court of gen-\neral jurisdiction in the [S]tate where the district court \nis located,\u201d Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(A).  See Daimler AG \nv. Bauman, 571 U.S. 117, 125 (2014).  The same rule, \nhowever, also provides that such service will, in addi-\ntion, confer personal jurisdiction over a defendant \nwhenever (1) \u201cauthorized by a federal statute\u201d or (2) the \nunderlying claim \u201carises under federal law\u201d and the ex-\nercise of \u201cjurisdiction is consistent with the United \nStates Constitution and laws.\u201d  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(k)(1)(C) \nand (2). \nA plurality of the Court has recognized that \u201ca de-\nfendant may in principle be subject to the jurisdiction \nof the courts of the United States but not of any partic-\nular State.\u201d  J. McIntyre Mach., Ltd. v. Nicastro, 564 \nU.S. 873, 884 (2011).  But the Court has reserved the \n\u201cquestion whether the Fifth Amendment imposes the \nsame [type of\u200a] restrictions\u201d as the Fourteenth Amend-\n\n19 \n \nment regarding \u201cthe exercise of personal jurisdiction by \na federal court.\u201d  Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. v. Superior \nCt., 582 U.S. 255, 269 (2017); see, e.g., Omni Capital \nInt\u2019l, Ltd. v. Rudolf Wolff & Co., 484 U.S. 97, 102 n.5 \n(1987).  Cf. Stephen E. Sachs, The Unlimited Jurisdic-\ntion of the Federal Courts, 106 Va. L. Rev. 1703, 1704-\n1710 (2020) (rejecting national-minimum-contacts rule \napplied by the courts of appeals as incorrect; arguing \nthat Congress may authorize federal courts to exercise \npersonal jurisdiction over any defendant if the author-\nizing legislation falls within Congress\u2019s enumerated \npowers). \n2. Invoking Fourteenth Amendment jurisprudence, \nrespondent argues (Br. in Opp. 16-17) that \u201cmost\u201d of the \nFSIA\u2019s substantive exceptions to foreign sovereign im-\nmunity in Sections 1605 to 1607 require a sufficient \n\u201cnexus to the United States\u201d to satisfy any due-process \nrequirements.  We agree.  Cf. Verlinden, 461 U.S. at 490 \n(noting that Congress enacted \u201csubstantive provisions \nrequiring some form of substantial contact with the \nUnited States\u201d in Section 1605\u2019s original 1976 excep-\ntions to immunity). 2F3  But the conclusion that exceptions \n \n3 \u201cUnder the original [1976] FSIA, * * * it was generally under-\nstood that in order for immunity to be lost, there had to be some \ntangible connection between the conduct of the foreign defendant \nand the territory of the United States.\u201d  Price v. Socialist People's \nLibyan Arab Jamahiriya, 294 F.3d 82, 89 (D.C. Cir. 2002).  Thus, \nalthough one original exception rested on a foreign state\u2019s explicit \nor implicit \u201cwaive[r]\u201d of its immunity, 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(1), the \u201cnor-\nmal pattern of the Act\u201d was to \u201crequir[e] some form of contact with \nthe United States\u201d as a condition for lifting immunity.  Verlinden, \n461 U.S. at 490 n.15; see 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(2) (\u201ccommercial activity\u201d \nexception requiring, at a minimum, a \u201cdirect effect in the United \nStates\u201d), (3) (expropriation exception requiring that expropriated \nproperty or property exchanged therefor is either \u201cpresent in the \n \n\n20 \n \nto immunity include text imposing requirements that by \ntheir own terms would satisfy a due process \u201cminimum \ncontacts\u201d requirement does not provide license to sup-\nplement the statutory text with a freestanding non-\n\u201cstatutory\u201d minimum-contacts requirement. \nII. THIS COURT SHOULD REMAND FOR THE COURT OF \nAPPEALS TO RESOLVE ANY QUESTIONS OF CONSTI-\nTUTIONAL DUE PROCESS IN THE FIRST INSTANCE \nThis Court need not go further than deciding that the \ncourt of appeals erred in holding that the FSIA incor-\nporates \u201ca traditional minimum contacts analysis\u201d as a \n\u201cstatutory\u201d matter.  Pet. App. 4a-5a.  Correcting that \nerror will eliminate the division of authority on the stat-\nutory question that warranted this Court\u2019s review.  See \nid. at 59a (Bumatay, J., dissenting) (noting that con-\nflict).  Moreover, the United States agrees with re-\nspondent and Devas that \u201c[t]he Court should not rush \nto take up th[e] [additional] question\u201d of whether\u2014as a \n\u201cconstitutional\u201d matter\u2014a foreign state enjoys due-\nprocess protections that may limit personal jurisdiction.  \nBr. in Opp. 20; see Devas Br. 18, 34.  The Court should \ninstead remand to allow the court of appeals to resolve \nany relevant constitutional contentions in the first in-\nstance. \nThe court of appeals emphasized that its \u201cstatutory\u201d \nholding did not resolve \u201cif a foreign state is [or is] not a \nperson\u201d that would be \u201centitled to a minimum contacts \n \nUnited States\u201d or owned or operated by a foreign state\u2019s agency or \ninstrumentality \u201cengaged in a commercial activity in the United \nStates\u201d), (4) (exception for cases involving rights in either \u201cproperty \nin the United States\u201d acquired by gift or succession or \u201cimmovable \nproperty situated in the United States\u201d), and (5) (exception for tor-\ntious personal injury, death, or property damage or loss \u201coccurring \nin the United States\u201d). \n\n21 \n \nanalysis through the Constitution.\u201d  Pet. App. 5a.  And \nalthough two members of the panel expressed the view \nthat a \u201cforeign state[]\u201d is not a \u201c\u200a\u2018person\u2019\u200a\u201d entitled to \ndue-process rights under the Fifth Amendment, id. at \n9a (Miller, J., concurring), that observation was not the \nbasis for the court\u2019s judgment, which rested on the de-\ntermination that personal jurisdiction was lacking be-\ncause statutorily required \u201cminimum contacts with the \nUnited States\u201d had not been established, id. at 6a-8a.  \nThe panel, and the full court if appropriate, should be \ngiven the opportunity in the first instance to address any \nFifth Amendment constraints before this Court consid-\ners the question itself.  Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. \n709, 718 n.7 (2005) (\u201c[W]e are a court of review, not of \nfirst view.\u201d). \nSeveral other reasons also counsel against address-\ning that constitutional question in this case at this time.  \nFirst, this Court has thus far refrained from resolving \nwhether or to what extent the Fourteenth Amend-\nment\u2019s limits on the exercise of state-court personal ju-\nrisdiction should apply under the Fifth Amendment in \nfederal court.  See pp. 18-19, supra.4  Second, in this \ncase, Congress, in the exercise of its commerce and for-\neign affairs powers, made a judgment\u2014both in the \nFSIA and in the statute implementing the New York \nConvention\u2014concerning categories of cases that may \nproperly be heard in the courts of the United States.  \nThat judgment warrants respect in addressing due pro-\n \n4 This Court recently granted certiorari to review a Second Cir-\ncuit decision holding unconstitutional under the Fifth Amendment \nan Act of Congress that provides for personal jurisdiction over spec-\nified foreign entities for acts of terrorism abroad.  Fuld v. Palestine \nLiberation Org., 82 F.4th 74 (2023), cert. granted, Nos. 24-20, 24-\n151 (Dec. 6, 2024). \n\n22 \n \ncess in this setting, which is distinct from the cases in \nwhich the Court has analyzed limitations on the powers \nof States and state courts under the Fourteenth \nAmendment.  Third, the Court has not resolved whether \n\u201ca foreign state is a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due \nProcess Clause,\u201d Republic of Argentina v. Weltover, \nInc., 504 U.S. 607, 619 (1992) (\u201c[a]ssuming, without de-\nciding,\u201d that issue), and this Court\u2019s resolution of that \nquestion could have significant implications for the \nUnited States\u2019 exercise of its foreign affairs power.  \nFourth, this case does not even involve a foreign state \nitself as a party; respondent is a corporation with a legal \nidentity distinct from India.  The question whether such \nan \u201cagency or instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d 28 \nU.S.C. 1603(b), has due process rights even if the for-\neign state itself does not is a further question that has \nnot been resolved below.  Cf. Pet. App. 56a & n.1 (Buma-\ntay, J., dissenting) (suggesting that the district court \ncould resolve that question after appellate resolution of \n\u201cthe sole question\u201d before the court concerning \u201cper-\nsonal jurisdiction over foreign states\u201d). 3F5  These are \nweighty issues that this Court should address only \nwhere necessary and only in a case in which a court of \nappeals has already resolved them, fully articulated its \nrelevant reasoning, and applied its legal holdings to the \nfacts of the case in a manner that would facilitate this \nCourt\u2019s plenary review. \n \n5 Some courts of appeals have determined that foreign-state agen-\ncies or instrumentalities possess due-process rights even though \nforeign states do not.  See, e.g., GSS Grp. Ltd. v. National Port \nAuth., 680 F.3d 805, 809, 814-815 (D.C. Cir. 2012).  The rationale \nunderlying those decisions has, however, been called into question.  \nId. at 817-819 (Williams, J., joined by Randolph, J., concurring). \n\n23 \n \nIII. PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER A FOREIGN STATE \nIN THIS ARBITRATION CONTEXT IS CONSISTENT \nWITH CONSTITUTIONAL DUE PROCESS \nEven if due-process principles are applicable in this \ncontext, personal jurisdiction over respondent is appro-\npriate based on respondent\u2019s arbitration agreement.  If \nthis Court elects to address constitutional due process \nat this time, therefore, the Court should follow its prior \napproach of \u201c[a]ssuming, without deciding, that a for-\neign state\u201d\u2014including an agency or instrumentality \nthereof\u2014\u201cis a \u2018person\u2019 for purposes of the Due Process \nClause,\u201d Weltover, 504 U.S. at 619, and should find any \ndue-process requirement satisfied.  If the Court elects \nto rule more broadly, however, it should hold that for-\neign states themselves are not \u201cpersons\u201d entitled to \ndue-process protection under the Fifth Amendment. \nA. Respondent Consented To Personal Jurisdiction In Its \nContract With Devas \nThe due-process \u201crequirement of personal jurisdic-\ntion\u201d is an \u201cindividual right\u201d and a personal defense that \nmay be waived or forfeited.  Insurance Corp. of Ireland \nv. Compagnie des Bauxites de Guinee, 456 U.S. 694, \n703-705 (1982); see Mallory v. Norfolk S. Ry., 600 U.S. \n122, 144 (2023) (plurality opinion).  And where a defend-\nant\u2019s actions are fairly understood to \u201camount to a legal \nsubmission to the jurisdiction of the court, whether vol-\nuntary or not,\u201d personal jurisdiction exists over that de-\nfendant.  Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 704-705.  As a \nresult, a \u201c\u200a\u2018variety of legal arrangements [have been taken \nto] represent express or implied consent\u2019 to personal ju-\nrisdiction\u201d of the court, including \u201csigning a contract \nwith a forum selection clause.\u201d  Mallory, 600 U.S. at \n145-146 & n.10 (plurality opinion) (quoting dissenting \nopinion, which quotes Insurance Corp., 456 U.S. at 703); \n\n24 \n \nsee id. at 167 (Barrett, J., dissenting).  Respondent\u2019s \ncontract with Devas is such an arrangement.  Under \nthat contract, respondent consented to personal juris-\ndiction in district court arbitral-award-enforcement pro-\nceedings. \n\u201cArbitration,\u201d of course, \u201cis strictly \u2018a matter of con-\nsent.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Granite Rock Co. v. International Bhd. of \nTeamsters, 561 U.S. 287, 299 (2010) (citation omitted).  \nUnder the FSIA, disputes about the formation of an ar-\nbitration agreement are jurisdictional because an \nagreement to arbitrate is a factual predicate for the \nAct\u2019s arbitral exception to a foreign state\u2019s jurisdic-\ntional immunity from suit.  28 U.S.C. 1604, 1605(a)(6); \nsee LLC SPC Stileks v. Republic of Moldova, 985 F.3d \n871, 877 (D.C. Cir. 2021).  But where, as here, there is \nno dispute that the parties consented to arbitrate, \n\u201cagreements to arbitrate are enforced according to \ntheir terms.\u201d  Volt Info. Scis., Inc. v. Board of Trs. of \nLeland Stanford Junior Univ., 489 U.S. 468, 479 (1989). \nHere, respondent consented to personal jurisdiction \nin this case by explicitly agreeing that any resulting ar-\nbitral award shall be binding and conclusive and shall \nbe entitled to be \u201centered in any court of competent ju-\nrisdiction,\u201d Pet. App. 18a (quoting the contract) (em-\nphasis added).  Federal district courts are clearly courts \nof competent jurisdiction by virtue of the New York \nConvention, to which both India and the United States \nare parties; Congress\u2019s implementing legislation, which \ngrants district courts jurisdiction over proceedings fall-\ning under the Convention, 9 U.S.C. 203; and the FSIA\u2019s \narbitral exception to the jurisdictional immunity of for-\neign states, 28 U.S.C. 1605(a)(6). \nNo unfairness results from enforcing respondent\u2019s \ncontract according to its terms.  Respondent is a sophis-\n\n25 \n \nticated entity that engages in complex commercial \ntransactions.  And if respondent had desired to limit en-\nforcement of any arbitral award resulting from that \ncontract to the courts of, for instance, the Republic of \nIndia, it could have readily done so by insisting on a \nmore circumscribed arbitral-award provision. \nThis Court in C&L Enterprises, Inc. v. Citizen Band \nPotawatomi Indian Tribe, 532 U.S. 411 (2001), unani-\nmously upheld the enforcement of an arbitral award un-\nder analogous circumstances involving tribal sovereign \nimmunity.  The Tribe in C&L Enterprises had entered \ninto a commercial contract containing an arbitration \nprovision in which the Tribe expressly agreed to the \n\u201cenforcement of [resulting] arbitral awards \u2018in any \ncourt having jurisdiction thereof.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 414-415.  The \ncontract also identified preexisting arbitration rules to \ngovern the arbitral proceedings, and those rules simi-\nlarly provided that \u201c\u200a\u2018the arbitration award may be en-\ntered in any federal or state court having jurisdiction \nthereof.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 419 (citation omitted).  Oklahoma law \nvested jurisdiction to enforce such arbitration agree-\nments in \u201cany court of competent jurisdiction of th[e] \nstate.\u201d  Id. at 419-420 (citation omitted).  Under those \ncircumstances, the Court held that, through the con-\ntract\u2019s arbitration provision, \u201cthe Tribe clearly con-\nsented to arbitration and to the enforcement of arbitral \nawards in Oklahoma state court,\u201d and thereby waived \nits sovereign immunity from such a suit.  Id. at 418, 423 \n(citation omitted). \nIn this case, the FSIA itself displaced respondent\u2019s \nforeign sovereign immunity from suit.  But like the \nTribe in C&L Enterprises, respondent entered into a \ncontract expressly permitting entry of arbitral awards \nin any court of competent jurisdiction, and thereby \n\n26 \n \n\u201cconsented to * * * enforcement of arbitral awards in \n[federal district] court.\u201d  532 U.S. at 423.  That consent \nwould fully support personal jurisdiction over respond-\nent here, assuming arguendo that the Due Process \nClause applies. \nB. A Foreign State Is Not A \u201cPerson\u201d Entitled To Fifth \nAmendment Due-Process Rights \nThe district court determined that respondent is, in \neffect, a foreign state\u2014and therefore \u201cis not a \u2018person\u2019 \nfor due process purposes\u201d\u2014because the Government of \nIndia wholly owns, finances the activities of, and \u201cexer-\ncises \u2018plenary control\u2019 over [respondent],\u201d which is \n\u201c\u200a\u2018housed\u2019\u200a\u201d within Indian government agencies \u201c\u200a\u2018for the \npurposes of staffing, premises and all organizational \nsupport.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Pet. App. 13a-15a (citations omitted).  The \ncourt of appeals did not address that determination.  Pe-\ntitioners nevertheless renew (Intervenors Br. 30-34; \nDevas Br. 35-38) their argument that foreign states do \nnot possess due-process rights.  If this Court addresses \nthat argument, it is the position of the United States \nthat a foreign state is not entitled to protection under \nthe Fifth Amendment\u2019s Due Process Clause.  That \nClause provides: \u201cnor shall any person * * * be deprived \nof life, liberty, or property, without due process of law.\u201d  \nU.S. Const. Amend. V.  The Fifth Amendment\u2019s text, \nthe broader constitutional structure, and the relevant \ndrafting history demonstrate that a foreign state is not \na \u201cperson\u201d under that Clause.  We do not, however, take \na position at this juncture on the ultimate application of \nthe Due Process Clause to an agency or instrumentality \nof a foreign state.  See p. 22 & n.5, supra. \n1. The Framers would not have understood the word \n\u201cperson\u201d in this context to include a foreign state.  To  \n \n\n27 \n \nbe sure, as a purely linguistic matter, \u201cperson\u201d could be \nused in some contexts to refer to a sovereign state.  See, \ne.g., Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 U.S. (2 Dall.) 419, 455-456 \n(1793) (opinion of Wilson, J.) (describing \u201ca State\u201d of the \nUnion as \u201can artificial person\u201d); id. at 472 (opinion of \nJay, C.J.) (stating that \u201ca nation or State-sovereign is \nthe person or persons in whom [sovereignty] resides\u201d); \nsee also Ingrid Wuerth, The Due Process and Other \nConstitutional Rights of Foreign Nations, 88 Fordham \nL. Rev. 633, 676-679 (2019).  But see Donald Earl Chil-\ndress III, Novel Perspectives on Due Process Sympo-\nsium: Questioning the Constitutional Rights of Na-\ntions, 88 Fordham L. Rev. Online 60, 63-73 (2019) (dis-\nputing Professor Wureth\u2019s analysis). \nBut the word \u201c\u200a\u2018person\u2019\u200a\u201d in \u201ccommon usage\u201d has not \ntypically \u201cinclude[d] the sovereign\u201d and, for that rea-\nson, \u201cstatutes employing the phrase [have been] ordi-\nnarily\u201d though not always \u201cconstrued to exclude it.\u201d  \nUnited States v. Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. 600, 604-605 \n(1941); see Vermont Agency of Natural Res. v. United \nStates ex rel. Stevens, 529 U.S. 765, 780-781 (2000).  The \nspecific context at issue, including legal history and \nstructural considerations, rather than just the \u201cliteral \ntext\u201d alone, is therefore important.  See Alden v. Maine, \n527 U.S. 706, 719-720 (1999) (interpreting Eleventh \nAmendment); Cooper Corp., 312 U.S. at 605 (emphasiz-\ning that \u201csubject matter\u201d and \u201ccontext\u201d inform the \nproper interpretation). \nThe context here provides a clear answer.  This \nCourt has already held that \u201c[t]he word \u2018person\u2019 in the \ncontext of the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amend-\nment cannot, by any reasonable mode of interpretation, \nbe expanded to encompass the States of the Union.\u201d  \nSouth Carolina v. Katzenbach, 383 U.S. 301, 323 (1966).  \n\n28 \n \nAnd foreign states have even less of a basis than States \nto claim due-process rights. \nThe \u201c\u200a\u2018constitutional structure\u2019\u200a\u201d and the lack of any \nrelevant role of foreign states \u201cin the constitutional \nplan\u201d is significant.  See PennEast Pipeline Co. v. New \nJersey, 594 U.S. 482, 505-506 (2021) (citation omitted).  \nUnlike States and the United States itself, \u201c[t]he for-\neign State lies outside the structure of the Union.\u201d  \nPrincipality of Monaco v. Mississippi, 292 U.S. 313, \n330 (1934).  Foreign states, unlike the States, have ac-\ncepted \u201cno general obligation to abide by the constitu-\ntional norms.\u201d  Lori Fisler Damrosch, Foreign States \nand the Constitution, 73 Va. L. Rev. 483, 522 (1987).  \n\u201c[N]or are there any effective means to place [them] on \nparity with the United States or the [S]tates for pur-\nposes of enforcement of particular norms.\u201d  Ibid.  And \nbecause a foreign state\u2019s reciprocal treatment of the \nUnited States is neither prescribed in our domestic \ncharter nor could be guaranteed if it were, the Framers \nwould have had no reason to impose constitutional lim-\nits on the United States\u2019 own authority to deal with for-\neign states\u2014limits which would have been effectively \nunalterable by the political Branches vested with our \nNation\u2019s national-security and foreign-affairs authority. \nFurthermore, the United States\u2019 \u201cpowers of external \nsovereignty,\u201d including the power to determine \u201cdiplo-\nmatic relations\u201d with foreign states, are \u201cnecessary con-\ncomitants of nationality\u201d embodied in \u201cthe law of na-\ntions,\u201d which do \u201cnot depend upon affirmative grants of \nthe Constitution.\u201d  United States v. Curtiss-Wright Ex-\nport Corp., 299 U.S. 304, 318 (1936).  The Constitution \nmerely distributes that inherent authority among the \npolitical Branches.  And \u201c[a]s a member of the family of \nnations, the right and power of the United States in that \n\n29 \n \nfield are equal to the right and power of the other mem-\nbers of the international family.\u201d  Ibid.  This Court thus \nrecognized early in our Nation\u2019s history that sovereign \nnations \u201cpossess[] equal rights and equal independ-\nence\u201d on the world stage, emphasizing that this \u201cperfect \nequality and absolute independence\u201d mean that \u201c[o]ne \nsovereign [is] in no respect amenable to another.\u201d  The \nSchooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 11 U.S. (7 Cranch) \n116, 136-137 (1812).  The fact that \u201cno sovereign is \u2018ame-\nnable,\u2019 or subject to the other,\u201d means that \u201c\u200a\u2018the rights \nand duties of the United States and foreign sovereign-\nties vis-a-vis one another derive not from the domestic \nlaw of either, but from the mutual agreements contained \nin treaties and the consensus known as customary in-\nternational law.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Constitutionality of Closing the Pal-\nestine Information Office, 11 Op. OLC 104, 107 (1987) \n(citation omitted).  In the context of actions authorized \nand taken by the political Branches against foreign \nstates, the United States\u2019 position has thus been that \n\u201cforeign states,\u201d unlike foreign nationals physically pre-\nsent in United States territory, \u201chave no constitutional \nrights.\u201d  Id. at 107 n.2. \nThe Fifth Amendment\u2019s drafting history, though \nsparse, also reflects that foreign states do not have con-\nstitutional due-process rights.  In 1215, Magna Carta \ngranted rights to each \u201cFreeman\u201d in England similar to \nthe right to life, liberty, and property later safeguarded \nby the Due Process Clause.  Pacific Mut. Life Ins. Co. \nv. Haslip, 499 U.S. 1, 28 (1991) (Scalia, J., concurring in \nthe judgment) (citation omitted).  By 1354, a statute of \nKing Edward III, which appears merely to restate \nthose protections, had substituted \u201cdue process of the \nlaw\u201d for the original \u201cthe Law of the Land.\u201d  See ibid. \n(citations omitted).  Sir Edward Coke, with whom \u201c[t]he \n\n30 \n \nAmerican Colonists were intimately familiar,\u201d thus de-\ntermined that \u201cthe phrase \u2018due process of law\u2019 referred \nto the customary procedures to which freemen were en-\ntitled by \u2018the old law of England.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 28-29 (citation \nomitted).  This Court later agreed, concluding that the \nFifth Amendment\u2019s use of \u201cthe words \u2018due process of \nlaw\u2019 conveyed \u2018the same meaning as the words \u201cby the \nlaw of the land,\u201d in Magna Charta.\u2019\u200a\u201d  Id. at 29 (quoting \nMurray\u2019s Lessee v. Hoboken Land & Improvement Co., \n59 U.S. (18 How.) 272, 276 (1856)); see Kerry v. Din, 576 \nU.S. 86, 91 (2015) (plurality opinion). \nSignificantly, the rights of \u201cfreemen\u201d throughout \nMagna Carta were rights granted to \u201cthe freemen of \nour realm,\u201d i.e., of England.  Magna Carta ch. 1 (1215) \n(emphasis added).  Due-process antecedents in state \nconstitutions likewise granted such rights to either \n\u201cfreem[e]n\u201d or \u201csubject[s].\u201d  Haslip, 499 U.S. at 29 (ci-\ntations omitted).  The proposed text of the Fifth Amend-\nment paralleled that language, initially providing due-\nprocess rights to any \u201cFreeman\u201d before the term was \nchanged to \u201cperson.\u201d  Max Crema et al., The Original \nMeaning of \u201cDue Process of Law\u201d in the Fifth Amend-\nment, 108 Va. L. Rev. 447, 508 & n.257 (2022).  The rec-\nords of the Fifth Amendment\u2019s ratification, however, \ncontain no \u201ccomment on [the Due Process] Clause.\u201d  Id. \nat 507. \n2. The practical implications of conferring due pro-\ncess rights on foreign states would have been signifi-\ncant.  In our system of separated federal powers, the \npolitical Branches exercise \u201cauthority over the Nation\u2019s \nforeign relations,\u201d \u201ca domain in which the[ir] controlling \nrole * * * is both necessary and proper.\u201d  Bank Markazi \nv. Peterson, 578 U.S. 212, 234-235 (2016).  Indeed, this \nCourt has repeatedly concluded that \u201cmatters relating \n\n31 \n \n\u2018to the conduct of foreign relations . . . are so exclusively \nentrusted to the political branches of government as to \nbe largely immune from judicial inquiry or interfer-\nence.\u201d  Haig v. Agee, 453 U.S. 280, 292 (1981) (citation \nomitted); see, e.g., Hernandez v. Mesa, 589 U.S. 93, 104 \n(2020); Regan v. Wald, 468 U.S. 222, 243 (1984). \nThat Legislative and Executive authority is particu-\nlarly critical for the management of disagreements with \nforeign states.  For example, \u201c[i]n furtherance of their \nauthority over the Nation\u2019s foreign relations, Congress \nand the President have, time and again, as exigencies \narose, exercised control over claims against foreign \nstates and the disposition of foreign-state property in \nthe United States\u201d by, for instance, \u201cblocking [foreign-\nstate assets] or governing their availability for attach-\nment.\u201d  Bank Markazi, 578 U.S. at 235.  Such actions \ncan provide the President an important \u201c\u200a\u2018bargaining \nchip\u2019\u200a\u201d to use when \u201cnegotiating the resolution\u201d of con-\nflicts with hostile states.  Dames & Moore v. Regan, 453 \nU.S. 654, 673 (1981).  See, e.g., International Emergency \nEconomic Powers Act, 50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.; Trading \nwith the Enemy Act, 50 U.S.C. 4301 et seq.  Congress \nalso amended the FSIA in 2008 to withdraw the immun-\nity of any foreign state that the Executive Branch has \ndesignated as \u201ca state sponsor of terrorism\u201d from \nclaims based on acts of terrorism that injure or kill \nAmericans, United States military personnel, or United \nStates government employees or contractors anywhere \nin the world.  28 U.S.C. 1605A(a)(1), (2)(A)(i)-(ii), (c), \nand (h)(6).  The exercise of such authority by the politi-\ncal Branches with respect to foreign states should not \nbe constrained, much less undermined, by a foreign \nstate\u2019s claims of constitutionally insufficient process. \n\n32 \n \nThe Constitution instead leaves it to the political \nBranches to determine what appropriate process should \nbe followed with respect to foreign states.  Those deci-\nsions are properly influenced by principles of comity \nand reciprocity as well as the framework of interna-\ntional law. \n3. At the same time, it is critically important to the \nUnited States\u2019 own interest in securing reciprocal treat-\nment by foreign sovereigns that foreign states under-\nstand that the United States appropriately safeguards \ntheir interests through non-constitutional means. \nFor example, although \u201cforeign sovereign immunity \nis a matter of grace and comity on the part of the United \nStates,\u201d the FSIA confirms the immunity of foreign \nstates by default and generally adheres to the restric-\ntive theory of sovereign immunity by providing tailored \nexceptions that typically permit suit against foreign \nstates based on claims involving \u201csome form of substan-\ntial contact with the United States.\u201d  Verlinden, 461 \nU.S. at 486, 490 & n.15.  The FSIA then supplements \nthose circumscribed exceptions within a \u201ccomprehen-\nsive statutory scheme\u201d for civil actions against foreign \nstates by addressing significant procedural matters \nsuch as the proper method of service to provide the for-\neign state adequate notice, the foreign state\u2019s right of \n\u201cremoval,\u201d and appropriate \u201cvenue[s]\u201d for such actions.  \nAmerada Hess, 488 U.S. at 435 n.3; see, e.g., 28 U.S.C. \n1391(f\u200a), 1441(d), 1608.  The \u201cvenue provisions\u201d set forth \nin the FSIA\u2019s \u201ccarefully calibrated scheme,\u201d Turkiye \nHalk Bankasi A.S. v. United States, 598 U.S. 264, 273 \n(2023), for instance, logically provide for venue in the \ndistrict where \u201ca substantial part\u201d of the conduct under-\nlying a claim occurred or where a \u201csubstantial part of \nproperty\u201d at issue is situated.  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(1).  \n\n33 \n \nVenue for actions \u201cagainst a foreign state\u201d itself or a \n\u201cpolitical subdivision thereof\u200a\u201d is also proper in the Dis-\ntrict of Columbia, 28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(4), \u201cwhere it may \nbe easiest for [it] to defend\u201d and where many \u201chave dip-\nlomatic representatives.\u201d  S. Rep. No. 1310, 94th Cong., \n2d Sess. 31 (1976).  And in an action against \u201can agency \nor instrumentality of a foreign state,\u201d the FSIA also \nprovides for venue in a district in which the agency or \ninstrumentality is \u201clicensed to do business or is doing \nbusiness.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(f\u200a)(3). 4F6 \nOf course, if a foreign state is made a party to federal \nlitigation, it is entitled to a fair adjudicatory process.  \nEven before the Fifth Amendment was ratified, it was \nunderstood that the Constitution\u2019s grant of federal \u201cju-\ndicial Power,\u201d U.S. Const. Art. III, \u00a7 1, did not permit \nfederal courts to exercise \u201carbitrary\u201d power over liti-\ngants and, instead, required the impartial adjudicatory \napplication of \u201crules and precedents\u201d that \u201cdefine and \npoint out [the judge\u2019s] duty in every particular case.\u201d  \n \n6 In 2011, Congress enacted 1391(b)\u2019s three \u201c[g]eneral\u201d venue pro-\nvisions.  28 U.S.C. 1391(b) (capitalization altered).  The text of one \nof those provisions is materially identical to the FSIA\u2019s first venue \nprovision.  See 28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(2) and (f\u200a)(1).  The last of the three \ngeneral provisions is a catchall, providing that venue is proper in \n\u201cany judicial district\u201d in which there is \u201cpersonal jurisdiction\u201d over \na defendant if no district exists in which the action may otherwise \nbe brought \u201cas provided in this section.\u201d  28 U.S.C. 1391(b)(3).  Cf. \n28 U.S.C. 1330(b) (conferring personal jurisdiction over foreign \nstates without regard to venue\u2019s location).  The government argued \nin one case that Section 1391(b)(3) applies to FSIA actions, but the \ncourt did not reach that contention.  See Corporacion Mexicana de \nMantenimiento Integral v. Pemex-Exploracion y Produccion, 832 \nF.3d 92, 104 (2d Cir. 2016); cf. 14D Charles Alan Wright et al., Fed-\neral Practice and Procedure \u00a7 3803, at 48 & n.9 (4th ed. 2013) (not-\ning the \u201cimportant question\u201d whether \u201cspecial venue provisions\u201d \nlike the FSIA\u2019s Section 1391(f\u200a) \u201cdisplace\u201d Section 1391(b)). \n\n34 \n \nSee Missouri v. Jenkins, 515 U.S. 70, 128-129 (1995) \n(Thomas, J, concurring) (quoting The Federalist No. 78, \nat 529 (Alexander Hamilton) (Jacob E. Cooke ed., \n1961)).  Non-constitutional provisions governing federal \nadjudication likewise ensure that a foreign state is \ntreated fairly in federal court.  See, e.g., Fed. R. Civ. P. \n1 (rules apply in \u201call civil actions and proceedings\u201d in \ndistrict court); see also, e.g., 28 U.S.C. 455; Code of Con-\nduct for United States Judges, Canon 3A and 3C (2019).  \nJust as federal adjudication remains eminently fair to \nour own States, such adjudication is similarly fair to the \nforeign states that may be sued under the FSIA. \nCONCLUSION \nThe judgment of the court of appeals should be re-\nversed. \nRespectfully submitted. \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \nMARGARET L.

Definitions \n \nFor purposes of this chapter\u2014 \n \n(a) A \u2018\u2018foreign state\u2019\u2019, except as used in section \n1608 of this title, includes a political subdivision of a \nforeign state or an agency or instrumentality of a for-\neign state as defined in subsection (b). \n\n4a \n \n \n(b) An \u2018\u2018agency or instrumentality of a foreign \nstate\u2019\u2019 means any entity\u2014 \n \n(1) which is a separate legal person, corporate \nor otherwise, and \n \n(2) which is an organ of a foreign state or po-\nlitical subdivision thereof, or a majority of whose \nshares or other ownership interest is owned by a \nforeign state or political subdivision thereof, and \n \n(3) which is neither a citizen of a State of the \nUnited States as defined in section 1332 (c) and \n(e) of this title, nor created under the laws of any \nthird country. \n \n(c) The \u2018\u2018United States\u2019\u2019 includes all territory and \nwaters, continental or insular, subject to the jurisdic-\ntion of the United States. \n \n(d) A \u2018\u2018commercial activity\u2019\u2019 means either a regu-\nlar course of commercial conduct or a particular com-\nmercial transaction or act.  The commercial charac-\nter of an activity shall be determined by reference to \nthe nature of the course of conduct or particular \ntransaction or act, rather than by reference to its \npurpose. \n \n(e) A \u2018\u2018commercial activity carried on in the \nUnited States by a foreign state\u2019\u2019 means commercial \nactivity carried on by such state and having substan-\ntial contact with the United States. \n \n\u00a7 1604.  Immunity of a foreign state from jurisdiction \n \nSubject to existing international agreements to which \nthe United States is a party at the time of enactment of \nthis Act a foreign state shall be immune from the juris-\n\n5a \n \ndiction of the courts of the United States and of the \nStates except as provided in sections 1605 to 1607 of this \nchapter. \n \n\u00a7 1605.  General exceptions to the jurisdictional immun-\nity of a foreign state \n \n(a\u200a) A foreign state shall not be immune from the ju-\nrisdiction of courts of the United States or of the States \nin any case\u2014 \n \n(1) in which the foreign state has waived its im-\nmunity either explicitly or by implication, notwith-\nstanding any withdrawal of the waiver which the for-\neign state may purport to effect except in accordance \nwith the terms of the waiver; \n \n(2) in which the action is based upon a commer-\ncial activity carried on in the United States by the \nforeign state; or upon an act performed in the United \nStates in connection with a commercial activity of the \nforeign state elsewhere; or upon an act outside the \nterritory of the United States in connection with a \ncommercial activity of the foreign state elsewhere and \nthat act causes a direct effect in the United States; \n \n(3) in which rights in property taken in violation \nof international law are in issue and that property or \nany property exchanged for such property is present \nin the United States in connection with a commercial \nactivity carried on in the United States by the for-\neign state; or that property or any property ex-\nchanged for such property is owned or operated by \nan agency or instrumentality of the foreign state and \nthat agency or instrumentality is engaged in a com-\nmercial activity in the United States; \n\n6a \n \n \n(4) in which rights in property in the United States \nacquired by succession or gift or rights in immovable \nproperty situated in the United States are in issue; \n \n(5) not otherwise encompassed in paragraph (2) \nabove, in which money damages are sought against a \nforeign state for personal injury or death, or damage \nto or loss of property, occurring in the United States \nand caused by the tortious act or omission of that for-\neign state or of any official or employee of that foreign \nstate while acting within the scope of his office or em-\nployment; except this paragraph shall not apply to\u2014 \n \n(A) any claim based upon the exercise or perfor-\nmance or the failure to exercise or perform a dis-\ncretionary function regardless of whether the dis-\ncretion be abused, or  \n \n(B) any claim arising out of malicious prosecu-\ntion, abuse of process, libel, slander, misrepresen-\ntation, deceit, or interference with contract rights; \nor \n \n(6) in which the action is brought, either to enforce \nan agreement made by the foreign state with or for \nthe benefit of a private party to submit to arbitration \nall or any differences which have arisen or which may \narise between the parties with respect to a defined \nlegal relationship, whether contractual or not, con-\ncerning a subject matter capable of settlement by ar-\nbitration under the laws of the United States, or to \nconfirm an award made pursuant to such an agree-\nment to arbitrate, if (A) the arbitration takes place \nor is intended to take place in the United States,  \n(B) the agreement or award is or may be governed \nby a treaty or other international agreement in force \nfor the United States calling for the recognition and \n\n7a \n \nenforcement of arbitral awards, (C) the underlying \nclaim, save for the agreement to arbitrate, could have \nbeen brought in a United States court under this sec-\ntion or section 1607, or (D) paragraph (1) of this sub-\nsection is otherwise applicable. \n \n(b) A foreign state shall not be immune from the ju-\nrisdiction of the courts of the United States in any case \nin which a suit in admiralty is brought to enforce a mar-\nitime lien against a vessel or cargo of the foreign state, \nwhich maritime lien is based upon a commercial activity \nof the foreign state:  Provided, That\u2014 \n \n(1) notice of the suit is given by delivery of a copy \nof the summons and of the complaint to the person, \nor his agent, having possession of the vessel or cargo \nagainst which the maritime lien is asserted; and if the \nvessel or cargo is arrested pursuant to process ob-\ntained on behalf of the party bringing the suit, the ser-\nvice of process of arrest shall be deemed to constitute \nvalid delivery of such notice, but the party bringing \nthe suit shall be liable for any damages sustained by \nthe foreign state as a result of the arrest if the party \nbringing the suit had actual or constructive knowledge \nthat the vessel or cargo of a foreign state was in-\nvolved; and \n \n(2) notice to the foreign state of the commence-\nment of suit as provided in section 1608 of this title \nis initiated within ten days either of the delivery of \nnotice as provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection \nor, in the case of a party who was unaware that the \nvessel or cargo of a foreign state was involved, of the \ndate such party determined the existence of the for-\neign state\u2019s interest. \n*  *  *  *  * \n\n8a \n \n\u00a7 1605A.

commer-\ncial activity upon which the claim is based, or \n \n(3) the execution relates to a judgment establish-\ning rights in property which has been taken in viola-\ntion of international law or which has been exchanged \nfor property taken in violation of international law, \nor \n\n17a \n \n \n(4) the execution relates to a judgment establish-\ning rights in property\u2014 \n \n(A) which is

agency or instrumentality of a for-\neign state engaged in commercial activity in the United \nStates shall not be immune from attachment in aid of \nexecution, or from execution, upon a judgment entered \nby a court of the United States or of a State after the \neffective date of this Act, if\u2014 \n\n18a \n \n \n(1) the agency or instrumentality has waived its \nimmunity from attachment in aid of execution or from \nexecution either explicitly or implicitly, notwithstand-\ning any withdrawal of the waiver the agency or instru-\nmentality may purport to effect except in accordance \nwith

to effect except in accordance with \nthe terms of the waiver, and \n \n(2) the purpose of the attachment is to secure sat-\nisfaction of a judgment that has been or may ulti-\nmately be entered

          "task_beliefs": "My understanding of the legal conflict in this case is stable and well-structured, based on the primary briefs from both parties. This observation did not introduce new facts about the case but rather confirmed the current state of my model and clarified the next analytical priority.\n\nMy model of the core legal conflict remains a two-sided structure of argument and counter-argument:\n\n*   **Petitioner's (Devas) Position (Textualist/Absolutist):**\n    1.  **Statutory Mandate:** The text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) is a clear command: if subject-matter jurisdiction and service are proper, personal jurisdiction \"shall exist.\" This language leaves no room for a court-imposed \"minimum contacts\" analysis.\n    2.  **Constitutional Inapplicability:** Foreign states are not \"persons\" under the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause and are therefore not entitled to the protections of the minimum contacts test. Jurisdiction over them is a matter of comity, as codified by Congress in the FSIA.\n\n*   **Respondent's (Antrix) Position (Contextual/Constitutional/Pragmatic):**\n    1.  **Statutory Counter-Argument (Implicit Nexus):** The FSIA's arbitration exception (\u00a7 1605(a)(6)) is limited by its own terms to matters \"capable of settlement by arbitration under the laws of the United States.\" Antrix argues this links the FSIA to the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA), which applies to U.S. commerce. Since this dispute is purely foreign, it falls outside the exception. This reading is supported by the presumption against extraterritoriality.\n    2.  **Constitutional Counter-Argument (Due Process Rights):** Antrix, as a foreign corporation, is a \"person\" with Fifth Amendment rights, separate from its status as a \"foreign state\" for immunity purposes. Agreeing to arbitrate in India did not waive these U.S. constitutional rights.\n    3.  **Alternative \"Off-Ramp\" Grounds for Affirmance:** The Court can and should affirm the lower court's dismissal on narrower grounds, avoiding the main legal question.\n        *   **Annulled Award:** The underlying arbitral award has been nullified by the Supreme Court of India, meaning there is no valid award for a U.S. court to enforce.\n        *   **Comity/Forum Non Conveniens:** The case involves two Indian parties and an Indian contract, and has been adjudicated in India. U.S. courts should defer to the Indian legal system.\n\nMy confidence in a final prediction remains moderate. The key development from this observation is the explicit identification of the most significant remaining uncertainty: the position of the United States government. While I have a complete model of the parties' arguments, the view of the Solicitor General (SG) is a highly influential variable, particularly in cases like this involving a federal statute with foreign policy implications. My model is now poised to incorporate this critical signal.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation, an act of internal reasoning and planning, provides powerful validation for my existing meta-level strategies and introduces a crucial refinement regarding the hierarchy of information sources.\n\n1.  **Primacy of Primary Sources (Reinforced):** The continued focus on acquiring and analyzing the parties' briefs is confirmed as the foundational strategy for building an accurate case model.\n2.  **Sequential Analysis Strategy (Strongly Validated):** The internal monologue confirms the effectiveness of the sequence: (1) Petitioner, (2) Respondent, (3) U.S. as Amicus. This structured approach has successfully built a comprehensive model of the conflict and now logically points to the next step.\n3.  **The Value of Meta-Cognitive Assessment (Demonstrated & Reinforced):** This observation *is* an instance of the meta-cognitive check in action. By pausing to summarize the current knowledge state (\"I have now analyzed both... briefs\"), identify remaining uncertainty (\"The single most important piece of missing information now is the position of the United States\"), and plan the next action to maximize information gain (\"Therefore, my next action will be to search for the amicus brief filed by the United States\"), the agent demonstrates the practical value of this heuristic for efficient and targeted learning.\n4.  **Modeling Legal Conflict as Argument/Counter-Argument Pairs (Reinforced):** My internal summary of the case is structured around these pairs, confirming this as a robust and effective mental model for understanding adversarial legal disputes.\n5.  **Identifying \"Off-Ramps\" and Alternative Grounds (Reinforced):** The agent's reasoning explicitly highlights the \"powerful 'off-ramp' arguments\" as a key takeaway from the respondent's brief, reinforcing the importance of this new heuristic. Future analysis must always include a search for such dispositive, non-core arguments.\n6.  **NEW - Prioritizing the Solicitor General's Brief as a Key Predictive Signal:** My strategy is refined to recognize that not all amicus briefs are equal. The Solicitor General's brief, representing the views of the U.S. Executive Branch, is now formally categorized as a high-priority information source, especially in cases interpreting federal statutes with foreign relations or national interest implications (like the FSIA). Its position is a powerful signal that can significantly shift the likely outcome.\n7.  **NEW - Using Actions to Explicitly Test Design-Level Beliefs:** The thought process reveals a more sophisticated layer of strategy: using information-gathering actions to \"test my design-level belief about the high predictive value of the SG's position.\" This means my actions are not just for gathering facts (updating \u03b8) but are also experiments designed to validate or falsify my own strategic heuristics (updating D). This makes the learning process more deliberate and self-improving."

          "task_beliefs": "The acquisition of the amicus brief from the United States Solicitor General (SG) is the most significant development in this case analysis, dramatically shifting the predictive landscape. My model, previously balanced between the parties' arguments, now incorporates a powerful signal favoring the Petitioners (Devas).\n\nMy understanding of the legal arguments is now a three-part structure: Petitioners, Respondents, and the United States as amicus. The SG's position is not merely additive; it validates and strengthens the Petitioners' core arguments while directly refuting the Respondents'.\n\n*   **Confirmation of the SG's Stance:** The observation confirms my highest-priority uncertainty: The United States has filed an amicus brief \"SUPPORTING PETITIONERS.\" This is a critical piece of predictive data. The SG's alignment with Devas significantly increases the probability that the Supreme Court will reverse the Ninth Circuit.\n\n*   **Detailed SG Argumentation (Reinforcing Petitioners):** The SG's brief provides a detailed, authoritative roadmap for a ruling in favor of Devas, which I can now integrate into my model:\n    1.  **Primary Argument (Statutory Textualism):** The SG argues forcefully that \"The FSIA does not require a separate 'minimum contacts' analysis to establish personal jurisdiction over a foreign state.\" This directly supports Devas's primary argument that the plain text of 28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1330(b) is a complete formula: if subject-matter jurisdiction (via an FSIA exception) and service are proper, personal jurisdiction \"shall exist.\" The SG's framing of the \"Question Presented\" as a purely \"statutory matter\" reinforces this textualist approach.\n    2.  **Constitutional Argument (Sovereigns are not \"Persons\"):** The SG directly addresses Antrix's constitutional counter-argument by asserting that \"A foreign state is not a 'person' entitled to Fifth Amendment due-process rights.\" This provides powerful backing for Devas's similar claim and gives the Court a strong basis to reject Antrix's due process defense on its merits.\n    3.  **Alternative Constitutional Argument (Consent/Waiver):** The SG also argues that Antrix, by agreeing to an arbitration clause allowing enforcement in \"any court of competent jurisdiction,\" has \"consented to personal jurisdiction.\" This provides a separate, narrower ground to find for Devas, even if the Court were hesitant to make a broad ruling on the constitutional rights of foreign states.\n\n*   **The SG's Proposed \"Off-Ramp\" (Procedural Nuance):** The SG's brief introduces a new potential outcome. In Argument II, the SG suggests the Court \"should remand for the court of appeals to resolve any questions of constitutional due process in the first instance.\" This is a classic judicial avoidance tactic. It would allow the Court to reverse the Ninth Circuit on the narrow statutory ground (that it erred by imposing a minimum contacts test) without needing to issue a definitive ruling on the broader, more complex constitutional question of whether foreign states have due process rights. This refines my potential predictions beyond a simple affirm/reverse to include \"Reverse and Remand.\"\n\n*   **Updated Confidence:** My confidence in a prediction that the Supreme Court will rule for the Petitioners (Devas) has increased from moderate to high. The combined weight of the textualist argument, now backed by the Executive Branch, and the multiple \"off-ramps\" (both the SG's remand suggestion and Antrix's alternative grounds) makes a victory for the Respondent (Antrix) on the core legal question seem much less likely. The key remaining uncertainty is *how* the Court will rule for Devas\u2014on narrow statutory grounds, broad constitutional grounds, or by reversing and remanding.",
          "design_beliefs": "This observation provides a powerful confirmation and refinement of my meta-level strategies. The successful targeting and acquisition of the Solicitor General's brief validates my entire analytical process to this point.\n\n1.  **Primacy of Primary Sources (Reinforced):** My belief in grounding analysis in the parties' briefs and key amicus briefs is stronger than ever. This observation shows that these documents are not just evidence, but contain the very structure of the arguments the Court will consider.\n2.  **Sequential Analysis Strategy (Strongly Validated):** The sequence of (1) Petitioner brief, (2) Respondent brief, (3) U.S. as Amicus brief, has proven to be an exceptionally effective and efficient strategy. It allowed me to build a stable model of the conflict and then introduce the most influential variable (the SG's position) to resolve the central uncertainty.\n3.  **The Value of Meta-Cognitive Assessment (Reinforced):** The previous step's explicit identification of the SG brief as the \"single most important piece of missing information\" was proven correct. This confirms the value of periodically pausing to assess the state of the model, identify key uncertainties, and prioritize the next information-gathering action to maximize expected information gain.\n4.  **Modeling Legal Conflict as Argument/Counter-Argument Pairs (Reinforced):** The SG's brief fits perfectly into this model, providing authoritative arguments that directly support one side and counter the other. This structure is robust for organizing and understanding complex legal disputes.\n5.  **Identifying \"Off-Ramps\" and Alternative Grounds (Refined):** I have refined this heuristic. \"Off-ramps\" are not just arguments to avoid a question entirely (like forum non conveniens). They can also be procedural dispositions, like the SG's suggestion to \"remand,\" which allow the Court to issue a narrow ruling on one issue (statutory interpretation) while avoiding a broader, more controversial one (constitutional rights of foreign states).\n6.  **Prioritizing the Solicitor General's Brief (Upgraded to Core Heuristic):** My belief in the high predictive value of the SG's brief is now a core component of my methodology. The observation confirms that in cases involving federal statutes with foreign policy implications (like the FSIA), the SG's position is arguably the single most important predictive signal outside of the Court's own precedents.\n7.  **Using Actions to Explicitly Test Design-Level Beliefs (Strongly Validated):** The deliberate action to seek the SG brief, framed as a test of its predictive value, was a resounding success. This validates the meta-strategy of treating information-gathering not just as fact collection (for \u03b8), but as experiments to confirm or falsify strategic beliefs (for D).\n8.  **NEW - The SG's \"Belt-and-Suspenders\" Argument Structure:** I have identified a new, recurring pattern in effective legal advocacy. The SG's brief provides a template: (1) Argue for a clear win on narrow, statutory grounds; (2) Offer the Court a procedural exit to avoid a difficult, broader question (e.g., remand); and (3) Argue that even if the Court reaches the broader question, your side still wins on the merits. This multi-layered approach gives the Court several paths to the same outcome, increasing the probability of success.\n9.  **NEW - The Power of Framing the \"Question Presented\":** The SG's brief highlights the strategic importance of how the legal question is framed. By presenting the issue as a \"statutory matter,\" the SG immediately anchors the analysis in the petitioner's preferred textualist territory and implicitly downplays the respondent's constitutional arguments. Analyzing the framing of the question by influential parties is a new heuristic for my future analyses."
